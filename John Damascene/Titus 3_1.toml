If men honor emperors, who are often corrupt and impious sinners, as well as those appointed by them to rule over provinces, who often are greedy and violent, in obedience to the words of the divine apostle, “Be submissive to rulers and authorities” and “Pay all of them their dues, honor to whom honor is due; respect to whom respect is due” and “Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and to God the things that are God’s”9—if we do all this, how much more ought we to worship the King of kings?
