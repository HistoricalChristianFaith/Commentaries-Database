Some of the things said concerning Christ make known the fact of his origin from the Father as cause.… For from him he derives both his being and all that he has. His being was by generative and not by creative means, as, “I came forth, and I have come,” and “I live because of the Father.” But all that he has is not by free gift or by teaching, but in a causal sense, as “the Son is not able to do anything of himself, unless he sees the Father doing anything.” For if the Father does not exist, neither does the Son. For the Son is of the Father and in the Father and with the Father, and not after the Father. In a similar way also what he does is of him and with him. For there is one and the same—not similar but the same—will and energy and power in the Father, Son and Holy Spirit.
