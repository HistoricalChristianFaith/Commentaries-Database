Now, the fact that Scripture speaks of one gathering does not mean that they were gathered together into one place, for notice that after this it says: “And the gathering together of the waters he called seas.” Actually, the account meant that the waters were segregated by themselves apart from the earth. And so the waters were brought together into their gathering places and the dry land appeared.
