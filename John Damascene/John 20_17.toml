Of those passages which refer to the period after the resurrection, there are several which pertain to his human nature.… Other passages speak of Christ’s dual nature, such as, “I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.” “My God and your God,” is to be understood more in an abstract way, as though he were ranking himself with us. Those passages, in general, that are sublime must be assigned to the divine nature, which is superior to passion and body. And those passages that are humble must be ascribed to the human nature. And those passages that are common must be attributed to the compound being, that is, the one Christ, who is God and man. And it should be understood that both [the human and divine] belong to one and the same Jesus Christ, our Lord. For if we know what is proper to each, and perceive that both are performed by one and the same, we shall have the true faith and shall not go astray.
