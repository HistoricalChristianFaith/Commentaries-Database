No one is entirely without the gifts of God, but one will be inclined to this virtue and another to that. One to more virtue, another to less. One to the more elevated and supereminent virtues, another to those that are humble and modest. God has distributed to each according to the measure of his faith. The powerful will therefore be examined severely, and “of the one to whom much has been entrusted, much will be required.” Of each person will be demanded, in fact, according to the measure in which he has been entrusted by God’s power. And the benefactor knows his recipient: “Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes.”
