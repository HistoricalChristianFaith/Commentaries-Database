When we worship the likeness of the priceless and life-giving cross, we know that it is made out of a tree. We are not honoring the tree as such (God forbid), but the likeness as a symbol of Christ. For he said to his disciples, admonishing them, “Then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in Heaven,” meaning the cross. And so also the angel of the resurrection said to the woman, “You seek Jesus of Nazareth who was crucified.” And the apostle said, “We preach Christ crucified.” For there are many named Jesus and many who may claim to be the Christ, but we worship the one crucified. He does not say pierced but crucified. It behooves us, then, to worship the sign of Christ. For wherever the sign may be, there also will he be. But it does not behoove us to worship the material of which the image of the cross is composed, even though it is gold or precious stones.
