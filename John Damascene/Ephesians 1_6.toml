For as it is above so it is below, says the Scriptures, that we may become obedient unto the Father even unto death, and because, as Christ said, "O God, My God, why have you forsaken Me?" That He did not rescue Him, but truly abandoned Him on the cross; If and in favor of us this was done, then before His face, as such, the voice of God said loudly, This Oneâ€™s grace is everywhere. He who is loved and His beloved is proclaimed by the Holy Scriptures.
