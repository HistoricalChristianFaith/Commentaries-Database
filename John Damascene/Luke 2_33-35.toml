However, this blessed one, who had been found worthy of gifts surpassing nature, did at the time of the passion suffer the pangs which she had escaped at childbirth. When she saw him put to death as a criminal—the man she knew to be God when she gave birth to him—her heart was torn from maternal compassion and she was rent by her thoughts as by a sword. This is the meaning of “and a sword will pierce through your own soul.” But her grief gave way to the joy of the resurrection, the resurrection which proclaimed him to be God who had died in the flesh.
