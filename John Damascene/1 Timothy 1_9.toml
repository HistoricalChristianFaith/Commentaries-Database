From the time when we were born again of water and the Spirit, we have become sons of God and members of his household. For this reason St. Paul calls the faithful “saints.” Therefore we do not grieve but rejoice over the death of the saints. We are not under the law but under grace, having been justified by faith and having seen the one true God. For the law is not laid down for the just, nor do we serve as children, held under the law, but we have reached the estate of mature manhood and are fed on solid food, not on that which leads to idolatry. The law was good, as a lamp shining in a dark place until the day dawns, and the morning star rose in our hearts. The living water of divine knowledge has driven away pagan seas, and now all may know God. The old creation has passed away, and all things are made new.
