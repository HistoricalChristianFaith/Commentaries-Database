For in regards to the works of God, meaning he and his apostolic commission from God, he surely declared, I work only but through Christ, being empowered by God. The introduction of the epistle, is to teach them in regards to the grace of Christ. Now this grace, we received from Him, and our sanctification, inasmuch as we have become partakers of His body, and have taken on His understanding. And the cause of this grace, is the goodness of God, Who is praised forever. Now the path to her (i.e. Grace), is through the blood of Christ that redeems.
