When Noah was ordered to enter the ark and was entrusted with the safeguarding of the seed of the earth, he was given this command, which reads: “Come into the ark, you, your sons, your wife and your sons’ wives.” He separated them from their wives, so that with the help of chastity they might escape the ocean’s depths and that worldwide destruction.
