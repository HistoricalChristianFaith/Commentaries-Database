If the bones of the righteous are impure, how is it that the bones of Jacob and Joseph were carried out of Egypt with every honor? Or how is it that a dead man was raised after coming in contact with the bones of Elisha? If God works miracles through bones, it is clear that he can also do so through images, stones and many other things. This also happened with Elisha, who gave his staff to his servant and ordered him to go and raise the son of the Shunammite woman with it. Moses too, with a staff, not only punished Pharaoh4 but also divided the sea, sweetened waters6 and opened the rock and made water flow out. Solomon says, “Blessed is the wood from which salvation comes.” Elisha made a piece of iron float after throwing a stick in the Jordan, and it is also written that “the tree of life” and “the plant of Sabek” lead to forgiveness. Moses lifted up the serpent on a stick, saving the lives of the people, and confirmed the priesthood in the tent with a blooming branch.
