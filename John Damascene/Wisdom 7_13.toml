Everything that exists must give thanks to God, rendering him perpetual veneration, since all things have being from him and subsist in him. Without stint he gives a share of his gifts to all without being asked, and he wants everyone to be saved and to partake of his goodness. He is patient33 toward us sinners. He makes the sun rise on the righteous and the unrighteous and makes it rain on the bad and the good, also because for our sake the Son of God became like us, making us partakers of his divine nature, since we will be like him, as John the theologian says in the catholic epistle.
