For, although he was impassible, he became subject to the experience of human passions and was made minister of our salvation. Now, they who say that he is a servant divide the one Christ into two, just as Nestorius did. But we say that he is Lord and Master of all creation, the one Christ, the same being at once God and man, and that he knows all things, “for in him are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.”
