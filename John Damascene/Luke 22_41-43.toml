Consequently, while he had naturally the power of willing as God and as man, the human will followed after and was subordinated to his will, not being motivated by its own opinion but wanting what his divine will wanted. With the permission of the divine will, he suffered what was naturally proper to him. When he begged to be spared death, he did so naturally, with his divine will wanting and permitting. He was thus in agony and afraid. Then, when his divine will wanted his human will to choose death, it freely accepted the passion. He did not freely deliver himself over to death as God alone but also as man. By this, he also gave us the grace of courage in the face of death. He says before his saving passion, “Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me.” Clearly as man and not as God, he was to drink from the chalice. Consequently, as man, he wishes the cup to pass, and these words arose from a natural fear. “Not my will, but yours be done.” That is to say, “I am of another substance than yours, but also of your substance which is mine and yours in so far as I am begotten consubstantial with you.” These are words of courage. Since by his good pleasure the Lord truly became man, his soul at first experienced the weakness of nature. Through sense perception, he felt a natural pain at the thought of his soul’s separation from the body. It was then strengthened by the divine will and faced death courageously. He was entirely God with his humanity and entirely man with his divinity. He as man in himself and through himself subjected his humanity to God the Father and became obedient to the Father. He thus set a most noble example and pattern for us.
