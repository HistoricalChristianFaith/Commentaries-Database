Furthermore, let no one maintain that the heavens or the heavenly bodies are animate, for they are inanimate and without feeling. So, even though sacred Scripture says, “Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad,” it is really calling on the angels in heaven and the people on earth to rejoice. Of course, Scripture can personify inanimate things and talk about them as if they were alive, as for example, “The sea saw and fled; Jordan was turned back,” and, “What ailed you, O sea, that you did flee? and you, O Jordan, that you were turned back?” and again, “Mountains and hills are asked the reason for their skipping.” In just the same way it is customary for us to say that “the city was gathered together,” not intending to mean the houses but the occupants of the houses. Still again, “the heavens show forth the glory of God” not by speaking in voice audible to sensible ears but by manifesting to us through their own greatness the power of the Creator, and when we make comments about their beauty, we give glory to their Maker as the best of all artificers.
