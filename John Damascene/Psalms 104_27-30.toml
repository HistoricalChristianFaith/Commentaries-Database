And again to Moses: “I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.” God “is not the God of the dead,” of those who have died and will never be again. Rather, he is the God of the living, whose souls live in his hand and whose bodies will by the resurrection live again. And David, the ancestor of God, says to God, “You shall take away their breath, and they shall fail and shall return to their dust.” See how it is a question of their bodies. Then he adds, “You shall send forth your spirit, and they shall be created; and you shall renew the face of the earth.”
