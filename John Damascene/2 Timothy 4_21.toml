As if to say: Do not grieve which removes oneself from a settled position. The Lord is with you: And he did not say, with you, but, with your spirit, so there's a double of assistance with the grace of the Spirit, also to assist him. It was written to Timothy from Rome. He wrote the letter while he was in prison in Rome, together with the first letter that he wrote to him, and from the feet of perfection. For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come (2 Tim 4:6).
