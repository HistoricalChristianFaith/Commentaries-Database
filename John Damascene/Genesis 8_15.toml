When Noah was ordered to enter the ark and was entrusted with the safeguarding of the seed of the earth, he was given this command, which reads, “Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.” He had separated them from their wives, so that with the help of chastity they might escape the deep and that worldwide destruction. However, after the cessation of the flood, the command was “Go forth from the ark, you and your wife, and your sons and your sons’ wives with you.” Here, see how marriage was again permitted for the sake of increase.
