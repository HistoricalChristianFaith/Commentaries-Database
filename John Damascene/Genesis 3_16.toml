Virginity was practiced in paradise. Indeed, sacred Scripture says that “they were naked, to wit, Adam and Eve, and were not ashamed.” However, once they had fallen, they knew that they were naked, and being ashamed they sewed together aprons for themselves. After the fall, when Adam heard “Dust thou art, and unto dust you shall return,” and death entered into the world through transgression, then Adam knew his wife, who conceived and brought forth. And so to keep the race from dwindling and being destroyed by death, marriage was devised, so that by the begetting of children the race of men might be preserved.
