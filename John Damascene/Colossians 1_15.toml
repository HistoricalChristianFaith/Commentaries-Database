He who has been born first is firstborn, whether he is the only child or has preceded other brothers. So, if the Son of God were called “firstborn” without being called “onlybegotten,” then we should understand him to be firstborn of creatures as being a creature. Since, however, he is called both firstborn and onlybegotten, we must maintain both of these as applying to him. Thus, we say that he is “the firstborn of every creature,” since he is from God, and creation is also from God…. For this very reason, that he shared flesh and blood along with us and then, also, that we were made sons of God through him by being adopted through baptism. He who is by nature Son of God has become firstborn among us who have by adoption and grace become sons of God and are accounted as his brothers.
