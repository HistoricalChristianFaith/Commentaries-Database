Jesus answered, &c. This was in answer to their question, Whom makest thou Thyself? He refers all His glory to His Father from whom He Isaiah , and who is God. What I say of Myself is of no value or weight, and that not only with you, as S. Chrysostom says, but with others. For in every court no one is believed on his own word but on the testimony of others, who witness for him (see chap. v31). Solomon also says, "Let another praise thee, and not thine own lips" ( Proverbs 27:2). The Arians objected that the Father glorifies the Son. He is therefore greater than the Son. S. Augustine replies, "Thou heretic, readest thou not that the Son Himself said that He glorifies His Father? But He also glorifies the Song of Solomon , and the Son glorifies the Father. Put aside thy pernicious teaching, acknowledge their equality, correct thy perversity."
