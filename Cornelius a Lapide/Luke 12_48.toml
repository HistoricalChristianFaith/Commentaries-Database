But he that knew not, and did things worthy of stripes shall be beaten with few stripes. That Isaiah , with fewer than he who knew his lord"s will, according to the measure as well of his ignorance as of his act and fault. There are four degrees of ignorance, the first invincible, which is without blame; the second vincible, but hardly Song of Solomon , which has some fault and is subject to punishment; the third crass, which has more blame; the fourth wilful, which has the most blame and the heaviest punishment. Of this the  Psalm 36:4 speaks, "He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good, he abhorreth not evil." "This Prayer of Manasseh ," says Euthymius, "despised everything; that one was slothful. But contempt is worse than sloth." For the slothful man knew not when he might have known, and, as Titus says, he neglected to learn and despised, and derided contemptuously. Hence it is plain against Jovinian and modern heretics that there are degrees even of mortal sin, and some are worse than others, and will therefore meet with more heavy punishment in hell, but one of a milder the other of a more severe punishment. 
And to whomsoever much is given—a greater knowledge that Isaiah , and recognition of his master"s will—of him shall much be required, by Christ the Judges , and in the particular as well as general judgment. For, as S. Gregory (Hom9) says, "When gifts are increased the responsibility is increased also," and to whom they commit much (that Isaiah , the care and superintendence of souls), of him will they ask the more. "Many things," says Bede, "are entrusted to him, to whom is committed, with his own salvation, the salvation also of the flock of God. From such will Christ, His assessors the Apostles, and the other Judges , require the more, not only their own safety and salvation as far as lies in them, but those also of the faithful committed to them. "In the pastor," says S. Bernard, "is required the care of souls, not the cure (cura requiritur, non curatio). The latter may be impossible from the virulence or pertinacity either of the disease or of the patient." "These things," says Titus "clearly show the judgment of the surgeons and pastors, whilst that of the rest is not less grave and perilous. Let them not therefore show pride because of their degree and office, but discharge their duties and feed their flocks with the greater humility, zeal, and diligence." "Each one, therefore," says S. Gregory, "ought to be the more humble and prompt to serve God, from the office given to him, as he knows himself to be under the greater obligation of giving account." 
Again, S. Bernard (Lib. iv. de Consid.), lays down forcibly, and point by point, to Pope Eugenius III. what, and how much, God requires from Pontiffs, Bishops, and Prelates. "Consider thyself," he says, "as the form of justice, the mirror of holiness—the exemplar of piety—the assertor of the truth, the defender of the faith, the doctor of the Gentiles, the leader of Christians, the friend of the bridegroom, the ordainer of the clergy, the pastor of the people, the governor of the unwise, the refuge of the oppressed, the advocate of the poor, the hope of the wretched, the tutor of the young, the judge of widows, the eyes of the blind, the tongue of the dumb, the staff of the aged, the avenger of crimes, the dread of the wicked, the glory of the good, the rod of the powerful, the hammer of tyrants, the father of kings, the judge of the laws, the dispenser of canonries, the salt of the earth, the light of the world, the priest of the Most High, the Vicar of Christ. Who would not be struck with fear, and tremble, when he heard this, all of which is required of your see?" Thus S. Paul to the Heb. xiii17 , on which, says S. Chrysostom, "I wonder if any guardian of souls can be saved." Cardinal Bellarmine said the same of Pontiffs. Hence wise and holy men have avoided prelacies, and have only accepted them by compulsion. S. Cyprian, in his Epist2 , lib. iv, wrote thus of Cornelius the Pontiff. "He did not demand the popedom for himself, nor seize it by force, as others puffed up by their arrogance and pride have done, but quietly and modestly, and like others who have been divinely called to this office, he endured force lest he should be compelled to accept it." In like manner, as far as they could, SS. Gregory, Chrysostom, Ambrose, Basil, Nazianzen, Nicholas, Athanasius, shunned the office of Bishops; and in our own times Pius V, when chosen Pontiff, turned pale and almost fell into a faint. When asked the reason he frankly answered, "When I was a Religious of the Order of Benedict, I had very good hope of my salvation; when I was afterwards made a Bishop I began to have a dread about it: now that I am chosen Pontiff I almost despair of it, for how am I to give account to God for so many thousands of souls as are in this whole city, when I can scarcely answer for my own soul?" So it is in his life. Finally, the Council of Trent declares the burthen of a Bishop"s office to be one formidable to the shoulders of angels.
