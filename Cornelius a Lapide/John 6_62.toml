Jesus knowing in Himself, Greek, ÎµÌ‰Î½ Î­Î±Ï…Ï„Ï‰Ìƒ, Syriac, in His soul, i.e, through His omniscience, without any one to tell, or reveal it. "For this was a proof of His Divinity, that He revealed secrets," says Chrysostom. That His disciples murmured at this, He saith unto them, Doth this scandalize you? As though he said, "I do so many and wonderful things because I am sent by the Father for this purpose, as I have proved to you by My miracles; ye ought not therefore to be scandalized and offended at My words and deeds, but ye ought rather to ask God who sent Me for light and grace, that ye may be able to receive them."
