Before God I lie not. Vatablus paraphrases this verse: "What I write unto you, behold I write before God—I lie not;" and Theophylact agrees with him. But Ambrose and Augustine think that before God is a formal oath—I call God to witness. The Apostle asserts that he had not seen the other Apostles so strenuously that no one might be able to say that he had visited them in secret, and had not been taught by God (Jerome).
