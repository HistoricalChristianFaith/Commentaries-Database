And the cock crew. Hear S. Chrysostom on S. Matt. xxvi70 , "Mark signifies that neither by the crow of the cock was he led to remember, nor did it keep him from denial." Chrysostom adds, "Mark only has written thus, most accurately detailing the gracious care of the Master for His disciple, and Peter"s weakness. Wherefore we ought especially to admire him, because he not only did not hide his master"s fault, but wrote the account of it in greater detail than the others, for this very reason that he was Peter"s disciple."
