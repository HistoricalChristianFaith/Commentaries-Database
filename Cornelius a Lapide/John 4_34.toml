Jesus saith, &c. Christ here tells the work of preaching, and man"s redemption, His, that Isaiah , His own special and sweetest food, because by it, as by the greatest dainties, He was fed and delighted. So Euthymius says, "The will of the Father, who had sent Him, and His work enjoined upon Christ, is the salvation of men, according to the words, I have finished the work which Thou gavest me to do." 
Tropologically, let Christians, and specially preachers, learn from Christ that their spiritual food ought to be obedience and zeal for souls1. Because both sustain the life of the soul2. Because both, like food, cause the powers of the mind to become strong3. Because as food causes a child to grow up to be a perfect Prayer of Manasseh , so do these two virtues make us to grow to a virile state of spiritual strength.
