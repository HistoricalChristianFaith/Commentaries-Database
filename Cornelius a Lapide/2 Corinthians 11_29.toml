Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is weak, or grieves, or is afflicted, and I am not with him weak, grieved, or afflicted? Who is offended and I am not on fire, both with grief, because the evil that my neighbour suffers when he is scandalised is mine, and with zeal also, to remedy his trouble and remove the cause of offence? 
S. Gregory (Hom12in Ezekiel 4:3), on the words, "Take thou unto thee an iron pan," thinks that by the pan is meant the mind of Ezekiel , who, on seeing the overthrow of Jerusalem, was, as it were, roasted in a pan with compassion. Of this God puts him in mind by ordering him to place a pan between himself and the city. Such, too, was S. Paul when he said: "Who is offended and I burn not?" "Paul had set on fire his heart," says S. Gregory, "with zeal for souls, and so had made it a pan in which, from love of virtue, he flamed against vice."
