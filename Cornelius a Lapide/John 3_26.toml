And they came, &c. Who was with thee beyond Jordan: viz, Jesus, who came to thee to be baptized. He now ungratefully makes Himself equal to thee, and usurps thine office of baptizing. You ought therefore to restrain Him; otherwise all will flock from thee to Him, to thy shame as well as ours. Thus Euthymius, "He exercises thine own office against thee, and seizes on thy renown." Wishing further to exasperate John , they added, All men leave thee, and go to Him.
