Come and see, &c. Saith Cyril, "Giving an account of the miracle, she prepared her hearers to believe:" because although, as S. Chrysostom says, she had not heard the whole history of her life from Christ, from what she did hear she believed (He knew) the rest. 
Is not this the Christ? "She speaks as though hesitating, that they might give their opinion," said Euthymius. For she herself had no doubt, but firmly believed Jesus to be the Messiah. As S. Chrysostom says, "Observe the immense wisdom of this woman: she neither affirms nor denies that He is the Christ. She did not wish that she should be the author of their believing in Him. She wished them to be persuaded by hearing Him for themselves, which persuasion would be far more likely to happen in that way. For without doubt she understood that if they once tasted of that Fountain, they would have the same opinion about it that she had." This Samaritan woman then, by the conversation and grace of Christ, from a sinner became a penitent and a saint, yea a preacher of Christ like Mary Magdalen. 
Her proper name was Photina, who is reckoned among the Saints in the Roman Martyrology on the20th of March, in the words following: "On the same day Saint Photina, the Samaritan woman, her sons, Joseph and Victor: also Sebastian, a general, Anatolius, Photius, &c, brothers, who all confessed Christ and obtained martyrdom." On which Baronius says, "The Greek Menology assigns this day for her commemoration." Her head is religiously preserved at Rome, in the basilica of S. Paul, where I have seen it amongst other relies of the saints.
