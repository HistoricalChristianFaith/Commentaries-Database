And the Apostles said to the Lord, Increase our faith. The Apostles said this, when, from their little faith, they had been unable to cast out the devil from the lunatic. They then asked for greater faith, as appears from the above words compared with those of S.  Matthew 17:19, &c, for Christ made the same reply in each place, "If you had faith as a grain of mustard seed you would move mountains."
