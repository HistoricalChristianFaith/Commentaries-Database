The Pharisee stood and prayed thus within himself. The Jews prayed partly kneeling and partly standing, when their prayer was longer than usual—sacrifice or psalmody. For in the temple there was no place to sit, except for the High Priest and king alone, as I have showed on  Ezekiel 46:2. The word "standing" is added here to show the pride of the Pharisee; he raised his head to heaven as if to dispute with God, or to claim and exact the measure of his merits. "For a humble Prayer of Manasseh ," as Theophylact says, "is humble of aspect, but this Pharisee is seen to be proud both by his habit and bearing." The Arabic reads, "The Pharisee stood praying." The Pharisee, therefore, stood proudly1. As being secure and confident in his own merits, and as calling God to judgment2. He stood first, or among the first, near the altar3. He stood with his neck and face erect and fixed on heaven, as if heaven were his debtor. The publican, however, stood1. Trembling and fearful, confessing his sins2. Afar off, at a distance from the altar, the last, or among the last3.With his face cast down towards the ground, not venturing to look up to heaven, showing his fear and penitence by the place in which he stood and by his appearance. Hence Bede says, allegorically, "The Pharisee is the people of the Jews, exalting their merits by the righteousness of the law. The publican is the Gentile confessing his sin apud se." The apud se of the Pharisee is referred in the Syriac to "standing," standing apud se—relying on himself, trusting to himself, insisting on his own merits and dwelling on them. The Syriac reads, "serveto." Our version more rightly connects the apud se with "orabat." He prayed with himself in his soul and mind, for the pride in his heart so puffed him up, that he would not pray or speak but with himself—he did not deign to do so before others. He prayed like the Pharisees outwardly, in a grave inflated pompous tone. Hence S. Basil on Isaiah ii. says, "He prayed a apud se not apud Deum—for he acted like himself when he fell into the sin of pride." 
He prayed—In his own way, for he did not pray to God, but he praised himself. S. Augustine (serm. xxxvi) on the words of the Lord according to S. Luke: "What did he ask of God? Seek from his own words. We find nothing. He went up to pray; he would not ask of God, but preferred to please himself, and heap insults on the devout publican as well." 
I thank Thee. "He is not blamed," said S. Augustine (serm. xxxvi.), "because he gave thanks, but because he wished for nothing to be given to him. Whoever says "I justify myself," is worse than the Pharisee who proudly called himself righteous, but who also gave thanks to God." 
"He gave God thanks," says S. Bernard (de Grad. Humil.), "not because he was good, but because he was alone: and not so much for the good which he had himself, as for the evil which he saw in others. He had not cast out the beam from his own eye, and he recounts the motes in his brothers" eyes. For he says "unjust"—"extortioners."" 
I am not as other men. He should at least have said "as many others," for what does "other" mean, but all men except himself? "I," he said, "am righteous, the rest are sinners;" that Isaiah , I alone am righteous, all the rest are wicked. The proud Prayer of Manasseh , to exalt himself the more, especially despises and depreciates others. 
S. Gregory (lib. xxiii. Moral. c7) describes four species of pride in this Pharisee. The first Isaiah , when men think that they have good, e.g, virtue a se. The second, when they ascribe this to their own merits. The third, when they think that they have that which they have not. The fourth, when they wish to be singular, and therefore despise and speak evil of others. The three last of these are clearly shown in the proud and false righteousness of this Pharisee. The first appeared in him because he ascribed his righteousness, not to God but to his own works, and said of God, with the Pagan, "Let God give me strength, let Him give me wealth, I will order my mind myself." "If, in fine," says Theophylact, "he had believed that it was the gift of God that he had graces not his own (aliena), he would not have held other men in contempt, remembering, that even he himself was naked as far as regards his own virtue." 
Even as this publican.—"See," says an Interlineator on S. Augustine, "how the vicinity of this publican was the occasion of greater pride to the Pharisee." The Syriac has, "Nor as this publican," supply, "am I a public sinner." Of his pride, he judges rashly and falsely that the publican was wicked, when in truth he was a penitent and justified. The Pharisee sinned therefore, 1. In judging rashly; 2. In despising the publican; 3. In reviling and insulting him, for he casts up to the publican his sins. S. Chrysostom in the Catena: "All human nature did not satisfy his contempt, but he attacked this publican. Whoever reproaches others, commits many offences1. He makes the other worse, for if he is a sinner he who is rebuked rejoices to find a partner in his wickedness; if righteous, he thinks highly of himself2. He harms the Church; for his hearers revile it3. He causes God to be blasphemed4. He makes the other more shameless, and engenders hate towards his rebuker5. He renders himself obnoxious to punishment. 
S. Bernard (de Gradib. Humil.): "The Pharisee, while rejoicing in himself, insults other men beyond measure. David does otherwise. He says, "All men, are liars." He excepted no one, lest he should deceive him; for he knew that all have sinned, and have need of the glory of God. The Pharisee deceived himself alone, when he excepted himself from the common reproach, lest he should be excepted from mercy. The Pharisee makes light of mercy while he dissembles his misery. The Prophet says, as well of himself as of all others, "All men are liars." The Pharisee admits it of all men but himself. "I am not," he said, "as other men."" 
I fast thrice in the week. In Sabbato. This is "by synecdoche, the chief day of the week being put for the whole week, which is called sabbatum. Hence the Arabic, "I fast two days in every week." Theophylact says that "the Pharisees fasted on the second and fifth days;" but he gives no authority for it. 
I give tithes of all that I possess. Not only of the first-fruits which the law compels, but, for my desire for a higher and a willing service, I give tithes of all things whatever, as flesh, eggs, fish, to which I am not bound. This Pharisee had branded other men as if they were adulterers and unjust, while he himself alone was pure and just. He would prove himself pure by his fasts, which are the mother of purity, and to be just by his giving tithes of everything. "As regards impurity," says Theophylact, "he makes boast of his fasting, for from luxury comes wantonness. Against usury and injustice he brings forward his giving tithes of every thing that he possessed. "So far am I," he said, "from usury and unfair dealing, that I put aside what is my own."" So S. Ephrem, in Catena. 
Morally. S. Gregory here observes (Homily vii. on Ezekiel): "The Pharisee, who published his fasts and gave tithes, thanked God, as if his guardianship were on the watch throughout the circuit of his whole city; but because he had not noticed one opening, that of pride in himself, there the enemy took possession of him. While therefore he was silent on what he ought to have declared, he unhappily spoke of that on which he should have held his peace; and through his pride, his merits, if he had any, were diminished, for while he held humility in contempt, he augmented his sins."
