And shall cut him asunder. That Isaiah , shall separate him from Himself, and His household, the Church triumphant; from the society of the Blessed and from the Beatitude promised to the faithful servants. See St. Jerome on Matt. xxiv.: "Shall cut him asunder, that Isaiah , shall separate him from the Communion of Saints." St. Hilary: "Shall separate him from the good promises;" Origen: "Shall cut him off from the gift of the Holy Spirit and from the society and guardianship of the Angels, for Christ will deprive him of all grace, all virtue, all help, and all hope of salvation." 
And appoint his position with the unfaithful. That Isaiah , shall punish him with the other servants who were unfaithful to him, although they pretended to be the contrary. Hence  Matthew 24:51 has "with the hypocrites." These unfaithful are perhaps the unbelievingâ€”they who would not believe in Christ, and of whom it is said, "He that believeth not hath been judged already." S.  John 3:18.
