And the High-Priest arose and said, Answerest Thou nothing to those things which they witness against Thee? He arose, as being indignant that He was silent, and slighted this accusation as futile, and confuted it by His silence. Again, he rose up to show the heinousness and gravity of the crime brought against Christ, as though Christ, in speaking thus, had made light of the magnificence and holiness of the temple. 
But Jesus held His peace1. Because the charge contained nothing worthy of death, and needed not an answer2. Because He knew that anything He might answer would be turned into a charge against Him3. Because He was fully preparing Himself for the death decreed for Him of the Father, and wished not to escape it by self-excuse4. The silence of Christ atoned for Adam"s excuses (Com. on Mark 14apud S. Jer.). Christ was silent, in order by His silence to make satisfaction for Adam"s foolish talking.
