For Herod was afraid of John , knowing him to be a just man and a holy. At first, therefore, it was only Herodias who wished to kill John , as the rebuker of her adultery. Herod did not assent, as Mark here signifies, and Luke ( Luke 9:7-9). But afterwards she persuaded Herod, which she did the more easily, because, as Josephus asserts, he was of a malignant disposition, and prone to cruelty; and he was incensed against John on account of his frequent reproofs. "Herodias was afraid," says Bede, lest Herod should some time or other come to a proper mind under John"s rebuke, and dissolve the marriage, and restore Herodias to his brother Philip."
