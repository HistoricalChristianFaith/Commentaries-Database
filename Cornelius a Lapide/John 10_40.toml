And went away again beyond Jordan, into the place where John at first baptized. In Bethabara, or Bethania, where Christ was baptized by him. He afterwards baptized in Ã†non (see  John 3:23), frequently shifting His abode. He went through other districts of Jordan, He withdrew to Bethabara, that the people who followed Him thither might call to mind the testimony which John had borne to Him on the very spot, and also the testimony of God the Father at His baptism, and might on this account believe in Him. So S. Chrysostom. 
And there abode: till the Passover and his own Passion drew nigh, when He returned to Jerusalem, and raised up Lazarus, which provoked the scribes and rulers against Him.
