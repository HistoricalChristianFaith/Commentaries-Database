I beseech you, brethren, &c. Theophylact arranges this verse and the next in this way: I beseech you, brethren, that ye submit yourselves to Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus, and to every one that works with them and labours; for ye know their house (i.e, houses or families), that they are the firstfruits of Achaia (viz, that they were the first in Achaia to believe on Christ), and that they have devoted themselves and all that they have to the ministering to the saints (i.e, in showing hospitality to needy Christians and to strangers, and especially those who labour in the Gospel). The submission enjoined here would consist in showing honour, and in following their exhortations and good example. The fellow-labourers are those who helped the men mentioned above in their Christian work.
