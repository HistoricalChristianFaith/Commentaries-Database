When the sun had set: Gr. ï¢•×¤×• ï¢‘×”×¥ ï¢• ï¢’×›×™×Ÿ×¢, i.e, when the sun was swallowed up and sunk in the sea. For ×”×¥ï¢•×œ×‘×™ means to be sunk, submerged, and is spoken of islands which are submerged and drowned by the sea. This is a form of speech adopted from the common people, who think that when the sun sets it is subrnerged in the ocean.
