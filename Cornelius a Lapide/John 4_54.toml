This is again, &c. The word again must be joined with when He was come. Meaning, this was the second miracle which Christ wrought in Cana of Galilee, when again—that Isaiah , a second time—He was come thither out of Judea. For the first miracle was the conversion of water into wine, which Christ did, when He came the first time out of Judea into Galilee. He came, therefore, twice out of Judea into Galilee, and illustrated each of His comings by a new miracle. "It is called the second," says Euthymius, not "because after the first He had done no other miracle in the whole of Palestine (for He had already done many in Judea), but because, after the first, this was (only) the second which He had done in Cana." John says this, indicating that an abundance of miracles were performed subsequently by Christ in Galilee, which Matthew relates ( Matthew 4:23, &c.), and which after this are related by S. John.
