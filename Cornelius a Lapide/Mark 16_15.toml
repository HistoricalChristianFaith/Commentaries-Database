And He said unto them, Go ye into the whole world, and preach the Gospel to every creature. He said this not on Easter day, when He appeared to the Eleven as they sat at meat, but afterwards, when He showed Himself to them and others on a mountain of Galilee, as it is in S. Matt. xxviii16 , &c. Or it may be that He committed this chief and peculiar office of preaching the Gospel to the Apostles more than once. 
Go ye into the whole world, that is to say, not into Juda only, as ye have done hitherto, but up and down in all directions throughout the world. For it does not seem probable that a few Apostles should have traversed and converted the whole world, especially because in America, lately discovered, no traces of the faith of Christ have been found. 
Every creature, i.e, to all nations, as it is in  Matthew 28:19.
