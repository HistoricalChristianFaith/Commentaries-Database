Be not thoughtful beforehand what you shall speak. Gr. Ï€Î¶Î¿Î¼ÎµÏÎ¹Î¼Î½Î±ÌƒÏ„Îµ, i.e, do not think anxiously beforehand. The Greek and Syriac add, neither do ye meditate, after what manner or arrangement ye shall speak and answer governors and tyrants. But whatsoever shall be given you (i.e, shall be suggested to you by the Holy Spirit) in that hour, that speak ye. The Arabic has, because ye shall be given in that hour what ye shall speak. (Top)
