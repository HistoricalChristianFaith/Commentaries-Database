But Hebrews , being gone out, began to publish and to blaze abroad the word, i.e, the fact of the miracle of his leprosy having been healed by Christ. For he thought that this was for the glory of God and Christ, although Christ, out of humility and modesty, had enjoined silence; but he himself did not consider this command binding upon him. 
So that he could not openly go into the city, without feeling His modesty hurt by the honour and applause of the people. Or could not may mean would not. For so could is often put for would, as Nazianzen shows by many examples (Orat4 , de Theolog.). 
*It has not been thought necessary to print in full the text of S. Mark. The citation of the few passages commented on is from the Douai Version.
