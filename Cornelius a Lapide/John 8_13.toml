The Pharisees therefore, &c. That Isaiah , is not worthy of credit. For no one is accepted as a witness in his own case, but must produce other witnesses (see above, v31). 
These were not the same Pharisees as those who had accused the adulteress, but others, who wished to avenge the disgrace of their fellows, and in their malevolence against Christ, brought this charge against Him, to put Him to shame. "Being nurtured in ignorance," says S. Cyril, "and not knowing Him to be Emmanuel, they suspected Him of aiming at His own glory, and attack Him, as though one of ourselves."
