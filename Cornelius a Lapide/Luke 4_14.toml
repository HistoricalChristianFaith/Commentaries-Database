And Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit into Galilee. In the Greek ÎµÌ‰Î½ Î´Ï…Î½Î¬Î¼ÎµÎ¹, in the power, strength, or force of the Spirit. Under a strong impulse of the Spirit, Jesus returned to Galilee. For the Holy Ghost was moving Him, and powerfully impelling Him to put forth at this time that spiritual power which He had received from the beginning of His conception, but which He had hitherto shut up and hidden within Himself, and to begin in Galilee with immense ardour and zeal, His ministry of preaching, and, confirm it by His admirable holiness of life and His stupendous miracles. Hence Theophylact renders it ÎµÌ‰Î½Î¸Î¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Ï‰ÌƒÎ½,driven and urged on by the enthusiasm and Divine afflatus of the Holy Ghost.
