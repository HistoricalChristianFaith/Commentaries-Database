And he said unto him, Well. That Isaiah , for one mna thou shalt receive a thousand and a thousand, nay the government of one Province or Decapolis, ten cities or more. That Isaiah , for a little labour and care on earth thou shalt receive great, nay, the very greatest, ineffable rewards in heaven, and shalt especially precede those on whom thou hast expended the gifts of God on earth, and whom thou hast converted to Christ or hast moved to His faith and goodness. S. Ambrose gives the reason: "As the angels are preferred to be first, so are they also who have merited the life of angels." 
And Bede more concisely: "Be it so that thou receivest power over ten cities, that Isaiah , thou shalt have more abundant happiness and honour in the heavens, and shalt be glorified above, for all and by all to whom thou hast been a fellow-worker in their salvation. For even after the judgment there will an order of dignity, and fitting mutual honour among the blessed." Hence the words of the Apostle, 1Thess. ii19.
