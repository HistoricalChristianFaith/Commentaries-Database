Jesus brought bound, and accused before Pilate15 Upon the clamour of the common people, the murderer Barabbas is loosed, and Jesus delivered up to be crucified17 He is crowned with thorns, 19 spit on, and mocked: 21fainteth in bearing his cross: 27 hangeth between two thieves: 29 suffereth the triumphing reproaches of the Jews: 39 but confessed by the centurion to be the Son of God: 43and is honourably buried by Joseph.
