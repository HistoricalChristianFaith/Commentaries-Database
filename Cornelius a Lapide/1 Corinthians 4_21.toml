What will ye? Shall I come unto you with a rod? Such as becomes the father I spoke of in ver15. The rod is a symbol of severity of rebuke and power of punishing. So Chrysostom, Theophylact, Anselm. 
Observe here the power of punishing lodged in the Church and her prelates, and exercised by Paul in the next chapter. Å’cumemius and Cajetan refer these words of the Apostle"s to the next chapter, in which he sternly rebukes the Corinthians for the incest of the fornicator. However, these words can well be joined with the preceding, in which he reproved the Corinthians for their pride.
