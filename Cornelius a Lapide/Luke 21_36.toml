Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand bore the Son of man. The Arabic has, "That you may be strengthened in flight." 
Stand before the Son of Man. So Wisdom of Solomon 5:1 "They shall stand with great constancy." "To those therefore who give themselves up to vigils, prayers, and good works, that day shall not be a snare, but a festival," says Theophylact.
