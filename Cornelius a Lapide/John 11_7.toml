Then after that saith He to His disciples, Let us go into Judea again. By thus forewarning, Christ calms the fears of His timid disciples; for they feared to return with Him into Jud√¶a, because the Jews had a little before sought to stone Him ( John 10:31). So S. Chrysostom: "Never at any other time did the Lord announce to His disciples whither He was about to go; but here they were greatly afraid of being harassed should He set out without warning They feared both for Him and for themselves, for they were not strong in the faith." S. Augustine says: "Christ departed, as a Prayer of Manasseh , from Judea, that He might not be stoned: but in returning, forgetful of His weakness, He showed His power."
