SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. He continues the argument of the preceding chapter that the Jews, like children and slaves, were under the Jewish law as a pdagague, while Christians, as sons of full age, were led, not by the law, but by the Spirit of adoption, whereby they cry, "Abba, Father," and that it Isaiah , therefore, unworthy of them to return to the weak and beggarly elements of the law. 
ii. He Observes (ver13) on the eagerness with which the Galatians had formerly embraced his preaching, that he may shame them for so lightly departing from it. 
iii. He introduces (ver21) a new argument from an allegory drawn from Abraham"s history. His wife Sarah, a "free woman," bore him Isaac as his son and heir, by whom were represented Christians, the free-born sons of God, free from the bondage of the law, and in due time heirs of Abraham"s blessing. His bondwoman Hagar bore him Ishmael, who was cast out, and who represented the Judaisers, to be shut out from the blessing promised by God to Abraham.

Now I say. This is closely connected with vers24,25 of the preceding chapter, where it was said that "the law was our schoolmaster to bring us unto Christ, but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster." He proceeds to prove this at greater length, and begins with the example of a child who is under tutors. 
The heir, as long as he is a child, differeth nothing from a servant. An infant, as the Greek word Isaiah , who has not yet attained to years of discretion, inasmuch as he is under a tutor and a pdagogue, and cannot exercise the right of dominion over his property, is in the position of a slave rather than a lord, nay, he is subject to a slave, viz, his pdagogue, and is under tutors and governors.
