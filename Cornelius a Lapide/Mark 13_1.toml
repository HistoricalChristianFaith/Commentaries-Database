Christ foretelleth the destruction of the temple9 the persecutions for the gospel: 10 that the gospel must be preached to all nations: 14that great calamities shall happen to the Jews: 24and the manner of his coming to judgment: 32the hour whereof being known to none, every man is to watch and pray, that we be not found unprovided, when he cometh to each one, particularly by death.
