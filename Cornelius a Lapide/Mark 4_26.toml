And He said, So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the earth. This is another parable, different from that of the Sower, which precedes it. Both, however, are taken from seed, but differently applied and explained. Moreover, by the seed, as SS. Chrysostom and Bede rightly explain, both here and in S. Matthew 13 , is signified evangelical doctrine. By the field, hearers; by the harvest, the end of the world, or each one"s death, is meant.
