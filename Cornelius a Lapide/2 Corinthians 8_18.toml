And we have sent with him the brother whose praise is in the Gospel. Barnabas, whose praise is in the preaching of the Gospel. He was ordained as S. Paul"s companion ( Acts 13:3) (Theodoret, Chrysostom, Å’cumenius); but since Barnabas and Paul were now separated, and Silas had taken S. Barnabas" place at S. Paul"s side ( Acts 15:40), it is better with Baronius to take the reference as being to Silas, or, with Anselm and Jerome, to Luke. S. Paul calls him brother, not Apostle, and this applies better to S. Luke , who wrote a Gospel, and was the inseparable companion of S. Paul. S. Ignatius, writing to the Ephesians , assigned this eulogy to Luke in the words: "As Luke testifies, whose praise is in the Gospel."
