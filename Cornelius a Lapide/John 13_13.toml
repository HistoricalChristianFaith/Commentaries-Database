Ye call me "Master" and "Lord," and ye speak rightly, for so I am. Christ was Master and Lord of all men and of the whole world, not only as God but as Prayer of Manasseh , and not only taught externally by speaking, as masters commonly do, but illuminated minds interiorly, and impelled the will whithersoever He would. See  Matthew 12:10.
