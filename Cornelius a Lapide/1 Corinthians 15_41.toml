There is one glory of the sun, &c. Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Primasius, Å’cumenius, Bede, Augustine (de Sanct. Virg. c26), Jerome (contra Jovinian. lib. ii.), prove from this that not only is the resurrection of the saints glorious, but that there is also an inequality of rewards in heaven, just as there is an inequality in the seeds of merits sown here.
