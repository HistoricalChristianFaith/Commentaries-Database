But there shall not an hair of your head perish. "Because," says S. Gregory, "what was said about death was hard, comfort is added at once, from the joy of the resurrection, when it is said, "a hair of your head shall not perish." For we know that the flesh when wounded, causes pain, but the hair when cut does not. Our Lord therefore said to His martyrs, "A hair of your head shall not perish."" From these words of Christ, we may conclude that we shall rise again with our actual bodies. S. Augustine (De Civitate, chap19 , 2O.) So S. Bonaventure, S. Thomas, the master of the sentences, Soto, and others. Their proof is from  Matthew 10:30: "The very hairs of your head are all numbered;" and from this of S. Luke , "Not a hair of your head shall perish." "Not in length," says S. Augustine, "but in number." 
2. We may collect this from reason, for our bodies will rise without deformity, with their natural adornments and comeliness; the adornment of the head is the hair, the beard, the nails. If any one has not these he is a deformed.
