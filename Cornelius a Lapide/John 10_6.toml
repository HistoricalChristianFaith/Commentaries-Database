This parable spake Jesus unto them, but they knew not what things they were which he snake unto them. In the Greek Ï€Î±Î¶Î¿Î¹Î¼Î¯Î¿Î½, a similitude, proverb. (See note on  Proverbs 1:5.) The Pharisees and Jews, against whom He launched it (and the apostles also), did not understand it, as being involved and obscure.
