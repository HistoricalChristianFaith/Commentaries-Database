And through a window in a basket was I let down. This escape of S. Paul from Damascus happened in the year39 ( Acts 9:25), when, as Josephus says, Aretas, King of Arabia and of the country near Damascus, waged war against Herod, because Herod had repudiated his wife, the daughter of Aretas, for the purpose of marrying Herodias. In this war Herod was worsted, and slain by Aretas. This brought on Aretas the vengeance of Tiberius CÃ¦sar, who sent Vitellius, governor of Syria, to take or slay Aretas (Josephus, Ant. lib. x. c7). Using the opportunity, the Jews, enraged with S. Paul, seem to have accused him before the prefect of Aretas of disturbing the people under a pretext of preaching the Gospel, and so drawing them away from heathenism, and consequently from Aretas. They wished to show that this would end in his betraying Damascus to the Jews and to Vitellius. Hence the prefect sought to take Paul, but Hebrews , being warned, escaped by being let down by the wall in a basket. Cf. Baronius (Annals, vol. i. p304).
