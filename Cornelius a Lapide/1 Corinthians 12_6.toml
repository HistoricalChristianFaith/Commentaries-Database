And there are diversities of operations, &c. Observe1. that the Apostle assigns gifts to the Holy Spirit, the fount of goodness; ministries to the Song of Solomon , as Lord; operations to the Father, as the first beginning of all things. So Theophylact and Anselm. 
2. The gifts here spoken of are what are sometimes called "graces gratuitously given;" the ministries are the various offices in the Church, such as the diaconate, the Episcopate, and the care of the poor; the operations are miraculous powers, such as the exorcism of demons, the healing the sick, the raising the dead. The word operations is explained in ver10 by being expanded into "working of miracles," which is translated by Erasmus the "working of powers." The Greek Î´ÏÎ½Î±Î¼Î¹Ï‚ is strictly power, might, ability, and ÎµÌ‰Î½Î­ÏÎ³ÎµÎ¹Î±, working ÎµÌ‰Î½Î­ÏÎ³Î·Î¼Î±, work. 
But it will be more satisfactory to say that the Apostle calls all graces gratuitously given (1.) graces, because they are given gratuitously; (2.) ministries, because by them each one ministered to the Church; (3.) workings, because by them the faithful received from the Holy Spirit a marvellous power to say and do things surpassing the power of nature. These graces are the work of the Holy Spirit equally with the Father and the Son; for all external works, as theologians say, viz, all that go forth to created things, are common to the Three Persons; yet, as they are workings they are fitly assigned to the Father, as ministries to the Song of Solomon , as graces to the Holy Spirit 
Which worketh all in all1. God works everything in nature by working effectively with second causes, as theologians teach in opposition to Gabriel Biel. Thus God brings about all the blessings of nature and of good-fortune. That one is poor, another rich is to be attributed to the counsel and will of God. Cf. S. Chrysostom (Hom29 Moral). 
2. God works all supernatural things, both the graces that make a man pleasing to God and the graces that the Apostle means here, viz, those gratuitously given, such as the working of miracles. Whatever the saints ask of God in prayer, or order to be done in His name, is done by God"s direct action, even in the realm of nature. 
It does not follow from this that the co-operation of God goes before and determines beforehand the working of secondary causes, and of free-will in good works, and of grace that makes a man pleasing; for in all these God works all things through His prevenient grace, by which He stirs up the will, and through grace co-operating, which, together with free-will freely working, works simultaneously everything that is good. But the Apostle is not dealing primarily with the works of grace that make a man pleasing to God, but with the workings of graces gratuitously given, as will appear from what follows. 
S. Hilarius (de Trin. lib. viii.) renders "works" "inworks," and so follows the Greek more closely, which signifies the inward presence and effectual power with which God works all things inwardly, especially miracles and all the other gifts. The whole chapter deals with these.
