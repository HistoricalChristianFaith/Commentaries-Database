For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. As careless birds are taken craftily by snares, so in the day of judgment shall the men of pleasure be2 "As the snare strangles the birds, so shall the day of judgment choke sinners." 3. "As the snare always keeps hold," says the Interlinear, "of that which it has once caught, so shall the sentence, given by one Christian Judges , be perpetual; and either for ever glorify him who is judged, in heaven, or consume him with fire in hell."
