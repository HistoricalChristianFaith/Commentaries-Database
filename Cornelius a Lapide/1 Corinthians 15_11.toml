Therefore whether it were I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed. So not only I, but all the Apostles, as was said in ver3 , preach and affirm as eye-witnesses, viz, that Christ died, and rose from the dead, and appeared to us. The Apostle returns here, as if after a long digression, to the point of the whole chapter, which is to prove, from the unanimous testimony of the Apostles, the resurrection of Christ, and of the rest who have died.
