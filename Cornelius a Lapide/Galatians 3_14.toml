That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Gentiles. This evidently is a corollary from the preceding verse. Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us, in order that the blessing of Abraham might be ours in place of the curse. 
The promise of the Spirit. To the children of Abraham, i.e, to those who believe on Christ, the descendant of Abraham, was promised the Holy Spirit to justify and sanctify us. For when God said to Abraham, "In thee," it was to his seed, which is Christ, that the blessing was appointed. Cf. notes to verse8 above.
