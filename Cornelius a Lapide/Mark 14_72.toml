And he began to weep: Gr. ÎµÌ‰Ï€Î¹Î²Î±Î»ÏŽÎ½ Î­ÎºÎ»Î±Î¹Îµ, i.e, literally, adding he was weeping; which you may translate, 1st, he began to weep; 2nd, he added to weep, i.e, "he began to weep very violently," says Theophylact. The Arabic Isaiah , and he betook himself to tears, not in the court before the Jews, that he might not betray himself to them, but when he was alone, having gone out of it as appears from S.  Matthew 26:75. (Top)
