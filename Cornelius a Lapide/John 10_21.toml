Others said, &c. For he is proud as Lucifer, and instigated by him, He calls God His Father and makes Himself the Son of God. 
He is thoroughly mad in saying that he lays down His life of Himself, though we see that He is alive, and no one does so except by compulsion. Moreover, Christ did not reply to these calumnies, as not being worthy of an answer, and also because He allowed those who supported Him to answer, for we give greater credit to others than to one who testifies of himself.
