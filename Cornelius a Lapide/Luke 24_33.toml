And they rose up the same hour (i.e, immediately and without waiting to finish their meal) and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together. Actually there were but ten assembled, for Thomas was absent and Judas had hanged himself. But the Apostolic college is spoken of as "the eleven," even though some of the members may not happen to be present. 
They "returned" (ÏÏ€Î­ÏƒÏ„Î¶ÎµÏˆÎ±Î½) quickly, filled with an eager joy. 
Them that were with them. The other disciples who were tarrying at Jerusalem with the Apostles.
