Of our authority, which the Lord hath given us for edification. The Council of Trent (sess. xxv. c3) lays down from these words that the sword of excommunication should be soberly and cautiously drawn for edification; otherwise we see that it is rather despised than dreaded, and produces ruin rather than salvation, not only to the excommunicated, but also to the whole Church.
