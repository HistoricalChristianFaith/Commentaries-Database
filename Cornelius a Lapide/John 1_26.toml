John answered them, &c. As though he had said, "God hath sent me to baptize with water, that I might stir you up to repentance and tears, so as to fit you for Christ"s baptism. For He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, for the remission of sins," as the remaining three Evangelists declare. Therefore John is silent about this. 
There standeth one, &c. That Isaiah , Christ is living in the midst of you, and yet ye know Him not. That Isaiah , you do not recognise Him as Messiah, but look upon Him as a mere Prayer of Manasseh , as vile and abject.
