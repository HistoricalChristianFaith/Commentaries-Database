But Martha was cumbered with much serving, × ×•×-×™×•×£× ×‘Ìƒ×¤×Ÿ × ×•×-ï¢“ × ×Ÿ×›×›×—Ì€× ×”×™×‘×š×Ÿ×ï¢“×‘×, was drawn aside and distracted, i.e. was anxious that nothing should be wanting for the entertainment of such a guest. Hence the Arabic, Martha was diligently serving to the utmost of her power. 
And came to Him, and said, Lord, dost Thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? bid her therefore that she help me. Came to Him: Greek, ×•Ì‰× ×™×£×¤×‘Ìƒ×£×‘, standing by Him. 
Dost Thou not care? Does not it displease you? Arabic. 
Martha spoke thus partly from her wish that all things should be properly prepared for Christ, partly from her knowledge of His consideration and kindness. Lord, my sister sees me overwhelmed with care because of my desire to honour Thee, and yet does nothing to assist me. Out of kindness to me, bid her, therefore, share my labour. She will obey Thy word, but will not, I know, listen to my request.
