For since by man came death. Adam brought death on all men, Christ resurrection. The word since gives the reason why Christ is called the firstfruits of them that rise, viz, because by Christ, as a leader of the first rank of God"s army and the subduer of death, the resurrection of the dead was brought into the world.
