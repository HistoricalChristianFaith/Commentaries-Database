But they that had laid hold on Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest, where the scribes and elders were assembled. S. John mentions that they led Him first to Annas, the father-in-law to Caiaphas. This was out of respect to Annas as the elder, or because he especially wished that Christ should be taken. Whence S. Cyril and F. Lucas think that the price of Judas" betrayal was paid him there, or because the house of Annas was on the road (see on S.  John 18:13). For it was in the house of Caiaphas that Christ was first examined, smitten, and denied by S. Peter, as is clear from S. Matthew , S. Mark , and S. Luke; and S.  John 18:19 also insinuates the same when he says "that the High Priest questioned Jesus." For when he says (ver24) that Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas, it must be considered an analepsis. For John merely goes back to what he had omitted, for fear any one should conclude from his previous statement that Christ had been examined by Annas and not by Caiaphas. Some transpose ver24and put it in after ver13 , as S. Cyril does. So Origen, S. Augustine (de Cons. Evang. cap. vi.), Jansen, &c. 
Were assembled. He says not "were called together," for this had been done when Judas requested Caiaphas" soldiers to take Christ. For it was then that Caiaphas summoned the Scribes and Elders to judge and condemn Him as soon as Judas brought Him before them. For they had conceived a deadly hatred against Christ, and thirsted for His death. "They sat watching all the night in Caiaphas" house," says S. Chrysostom.
