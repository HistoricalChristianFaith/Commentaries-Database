Then said He. The word "then" is illative, as is shown by what precedes and follows. Christ saw that He had silenced His enemies, the Pharisees, by His Wisdom of Solomon , and that the people rejoiced and praised both Himself and His word. When He saw them thus rightly disposed, He proposed to them the parable of the kingdom of heaven; for He saw that the way was now prepared for proclaiming this, and for His preachingâ€”that He might incite all to attempt its attainment, and therefore to receive His evangelical doctrine and life. I have explained the parable on S.  Matthew 13:31.
