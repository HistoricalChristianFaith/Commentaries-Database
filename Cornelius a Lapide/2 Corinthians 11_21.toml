I speak as concerning reproach. This belongs to the preceding. The "smiting on the face" spoken of is here explained to be mental, not physical—consisting in the ignominy and revilings cast, as it were, in their faces by the false apostles. This "smiting" is no less wrong than if they had been beaten like slaves. Others, however, interpret these words to mean: "I say this to your shame." This, however, would require Ï€ÏÎ¿Ì€Ï‚ instead of ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±Ì€. 
As though we had been weak. Refer this to the words, ye suffer. You suffer these bold and imperious false apostles; me you do not, but rather despise me as weak and timid, as though I could not have acted more imperiously than I have done, I could, indeed, have done Song of Solomon , but I would not, through humility, modesty, and abounding charity (Chrysostom). 
Whereinsoever any is bold. If any one ventures to boast foolishly, I too can do the same.
