SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. The Apostle passes on to the subject of lawsuits and trials, and reproves the Corinthians for instituting proceedings before the heathen Judges , and he declares those proceedings to be thereupon unjust and unfair.
ii. Then (ver9) he declares that the unrighteous, of whom he names several kinds, shall not inherit the kingdom of God.
iii. He passes on (ver13) to fornication, and condemns it on many grounds, which I will collect at the end of the chapter.

Dare any of you . . . go to law? Literally, be judged, i.e, contend in judgment. Cf.  1 Samuel 12:7;  Ezekiel 20:35; and  Jeremiah 2:35. The Apostle is not censuring those who were dragged before the heathen tribunals, but those who dragged their brethren before them, or who appeared before them by the consent of both parties. 
Before the unjust. The saints here is a name for the faithful, and the unjust, therefore, are Gentile unbelievers. So Chrysostom, Theophylact, Anselm. The heathen are so called as lacking the faith by which the just man lives, and as being therefore unjust, and as often committing injustice strictly so called. In other words, since these unjust men are the Judges , justice is not to be looked for from them. As they pervert the faith, so do they justice.
