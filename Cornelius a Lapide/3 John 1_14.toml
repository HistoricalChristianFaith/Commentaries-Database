Salute the friends by name. The Syriac renders this verse, The friends pray for your peace: pray for the peace of the friends, for every one by name. 
1S. Jerome uses the word cÅ“cutiat. I am not sure, having regard to the context, that he does not mean, "get out of their depth," as we say in English. 
2This word is not in Liddell and Scott, but I take it to be a feminine form of Ï€ÏÏÎ³Ï‚.
