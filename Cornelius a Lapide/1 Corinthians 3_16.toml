Know ye not that ye are the temple of God? This is a return to the image of ver9: "Ye are God"s building," and therefore not a heathen temple, but the temple of God, in which by faith, grace, charity, and His gifts He dwells. So Anselm and others. For a fuller exposition if this, see the notes to  2 Corinthians 6:16. 
How the soul may be dedicated as a temple to God is declared at length by S. Bernard (Serm1de Dedic. Eccl.). He says that there are five things observed in a dedication: the sprinkling, the marking with the cross, the anointing, the illumination, and the benediction; and all these take place also in the dedication of the soul. 
Observe that up to the present S. Paul has been dealing with those teachers and those of the faithful who build up the holy edifice of the Church. He now turns to those who undermine it.
