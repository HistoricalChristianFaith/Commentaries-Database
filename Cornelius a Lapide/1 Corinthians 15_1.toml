s35 , 36.—But some man will say . . . except it die. The Apostle strikes here at the root of their disease and the cause of their error, which was that some were despairing of and denying the resurrection of the body, because they saw that it rotted in the ground, and they thought therefore it was incredible and impossible for it to be raised again and refashioned. S Paul here answers this objection by pointing to a grain of corn which is sown. It first rots and dies away in the earth, and then as it were is born again and springs up, and brings forth, not merely one grain, but many grains from the one. In this way the one grain which is sown is clothed and laden at the harvest with many ears and grains, so that it seems to rise with greater glory. In the same way our bodies will rot in the ground, and thence rise to greater glory.

s3 , 4.—How that Christ died for our sins . . . according to the scriptures.  Hosea 6:2: "After two days will He revive us; in the third day He will raise us up," i.e, when He shall on the third day Himself rise from death to life; for the resurrection of Christ was the cause of our rising from the death of sin, and of our future resurrection from bodily death, so that we are to rise like Christ on the Judgment Day to everlasting life. See notes on  Romans 4:25. So Anselm, Dorotheus, in the beginning of his Synopsis, and also the Jewish writers of old in Galatin. lib. viii. c22. Theophylact, following S. Chrysostom, says that it was prophesied under an allegory that Christ should rise again on the third day; for Jonah brought from the whale"s belly on the third day, was a type of Christ brought back to life from death and hell on the third day. 
Isaac, too, typified the same event in his being rescued from death when about to be sacrificed by his father, and restored to his mother alive and well on the third day. So Christ was given by His Father and sacrificed, and raised again on the third day. But these two instances are drawn from the allegorical sense, that of Hosea is from the literal.

SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
He proves the resurrection of the dead against the false teachers who denied it:—
i. From the fact of Christ"s resurrection. Thus (ver12) he gives the bearing of it on our resurrection. 
ii. He proves the resurrection by the authority of those who are baptized for the dead (ver29). 
iii. He declares what the body will be like in the resurrection (ver35), and then names the four endowments of the glorified body (ver42). 
iv. He shows that we shall all rise again, but shall not all be changed, and that in the resurrection which shall take place, in a moment, when the trumpet shall sound, death will be completely swallowed up (ver51).
