Do we provoke the Lord to jealousy? I.e, to anger. Do we set up a rival to the Lord? De we leave Him, our Bride-groom, and cling to a devil, and the things offered to him, or at all events wish to serve both, and yoke together God and the devil? So Chrysostom, Anselm, Theophylact. S. Paul is alluding to  Deuteronomy 32:21. S. Jerome, commenting of Habakkuk ii, rightly says the unclean spirits preside over all idols, and answer those who call on the idols, and give oracular replies, and lend them help. 
Are we stronger than He? By no means; therefore our provoking God to anger will not go unpunished by Him.
