Therefore seeing we have this ministry. The ministry of the New Testament, the excellency of which has been dwelt on in the preceding chapter. To this God in His mercy has called us, His unworthy Apostles. 
We faint not. We do not yield, are not daunted by dangers and difficulties, are not wearied, as Erasmus turns it.

SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. From what was said in the last chapter of the glory and honour belonging to the office of a preacher of the Gospel, S. Paul proceeds to assert that he discharges that office holily, sincerely, and blamelessly. He declares this to be a fact plainly known to all except to those whose minds were blinded. 
ii. He declares (ver7) that he and the other Apostles undergo many sufferings on behalf of the Gospel without flinching, and that they with fortitude always bear about in their bodies the mortification of Jesus, on account of the hope of resurrection to a better life.
iii. He points out (ver17) that this our tribulation is but light and short lived, and works an eternal weight of glory.
