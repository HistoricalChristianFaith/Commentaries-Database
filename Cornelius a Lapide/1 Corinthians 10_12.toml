Let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall. S. Augustine (de Bono Persev. cviii.) says: "It is good for all, or nearly all, not to know what they will be, that each one, from not knowing that he will persevere in good, may humbly and anxiously pray for the grace of God, and with it do all he can to watch against falling and to persevere in grace."
