Even as Abraham believed God. This introduces the second argument, to prove that we are justified, not by the works of the law, but by faith; not by Moses, but by Christ. Abraham received the Spirit when uncircumcised and before the law, and was justified by faith in Christ, not by the law, which at that time was not in existence. Song of Solomon , argues S. Paul, are you justified by faith. 
And it was accounted to him for righteousness. By his faith he was justified. Cf. notes to  Romans 4:3.
