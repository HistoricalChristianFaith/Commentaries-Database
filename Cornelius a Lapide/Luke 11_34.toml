The light of the body is the eye. Figuratively the eye represents reason, intellect, especially good intentionâ€”for what the eye is to the body, such is reason or good intention to the mind. 
When thine eye is single, thy whole body also is full of light, i.e. illumined by a single, a clear and unclouded eye.
