I am the door, &c. Rupertus thinks that this relates to a different door and a different sheepfold from the other, according to what is said (ver16), "Other sheep I have," &c. But there is only one fold of Christ; one Church, that is. As He subjoins, "There shall be one fold and one shepherd." The meaning of the door already spoken of, Christ partly confirms, partly explains when He adds, "By Me if any Prayer of Manasseh , enter in, he shall be saved." That Isaiah , if any man believe in Me, and therefore through faith in Me and by My grace enters the Church, "he shall be saved," i.e, shall be justified and blessed, if he continues, that Isaiah , in My faith, grace and charity even unto death. So S. Gregory (Epist. lib. vii49). "He enters through the door into the sheepfold who enters through Christ. But he enters through Christ who believes and teaches the truth concerning Himâ€”the Creator and Redeemer of mankind, and abides by what he preached." 
And will go in and out. Will go out to the pastures, and after having fed will return to the resting-place, as sheep do. For the faithful will, when well fed, enter the fold of the Church, and again when hungry will go forth to the pastures of the soul, without any peril, for I will guide them to and fro. So Maldonatus. 
But to go in and out signifies among the Hebrews to act with freedom, do one"s own work, &c, and is connected with what follows. It means, the faithful man will move about everywhere without fear; will do his duty, and whatever he does, whether at home or abroad, will everywhere find food for his soul. The phrase denotes security, confidence, and freedom of converse; and of doing everything, everywhere, for and through Christ. So Cyril, Chrysostom. 
Symbolically and tropologically, S. Gregory (Hom. xiv.) "The faithful withdraws within himself by contemplation, and comes forth in action to do good works." "He will enter in," says S. Augustine, "for inward meditation, he will go forth for outward action." The author of De spiritu et anima, says, "He will enter within to contemplate My Godhead, he will go forth to contemplate My Manhood, and in either case will find wondrous pastures." And in another place S. Gregory writes, "Within, they have the pastures of contemplation; without, the pastures of good works; inwardly they enrich their mind with devotions, outwardly they satiate themselves with good works." And lastly, Theophylact says, "He will enter in who has a care for the inward man; he will go out who mortifies his members upon earth." 
Anagogically, Rupertus says, "He enters the Church by faith, to find therein pastures; he will go out when at death he migrates therefrom into heaven." "He enters," says S. Augustine, "into the Church through the door of faith, and goes forth through the same door of living faith into eternal life, where he will find pasture." And S. Gregory, "He will enter into faith, he will go forth to hope, and will find pasture in eternal satiety."
