I seek not, &c. It is God the Father who will most sharply punish those who seek not My glory, but in every way dishonour and discredit Me. S. Chrysostom. 
It may be said, "This is contrary to what Christ says (v22), The Father judgeth man." But there Christ speaks of the public and general judgment, here He speaks of the private and daily judgment with which He avenges the wrongs done to His Son and His saints, as by the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus for the death of Christ; as He here seems to hint. So Maldonatus and others. 
But the Gloss says, "There is one that judgeth who distinguishes My glory from yours; as David says, "Judge Me, 0 God, and distinguish My cause from that of the ungodly people"" ( Psalm 43:1, Vulg.)
