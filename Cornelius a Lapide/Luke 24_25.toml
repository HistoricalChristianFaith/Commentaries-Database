Them said He unto them, 0 fools. Î†Î½ÏŒÎ·Ï„Î¿Î¹, rendered here in the Vulgate "stulti," but  Galatians 3:1., "insensati." With these keen words Christ as the Master rebukes the disciples for their ignorance and slowness to believe. For a teacher is allowed to stimulate his disciples by sharp reproof to the pursuit of higher or more accurate knowledge. See S.  Matthew 5:22. 
So our nature, frail and dull of understanding, needs some such stimulus to, enable it to believe in spiritual things, and to keep itself steadfast in the hope of their realisation.
