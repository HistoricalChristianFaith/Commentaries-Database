As a matter of bounty. As a blessing (Latin version). That your beneficence may seem spontaneous and generous, not extorted from greedy persons (Anselm, Theophylact, Chrysostom). Why bounty is called a blessing is explained in the note to ver6. The Greek, ÎµÏ…Ì‰Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î± denotes both blessing and a good and fruitful contribution or almsgiving (Erasmus). In  1 Corinthians 16:1, the Apostle called these contributions or collections ÎµÏ…Ì‰Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î±Î¹. Both meanings have place here. S. Paul is urging the Corinthians to spontaneous and cheerful (denoted by blessing), as well as to fruitful and liberal, contribution. He is engaged in describing the spirit that should animate the giver, viz, one ready and cheerful, unforced, unconstrained, unstained by covetousness or meanness.
