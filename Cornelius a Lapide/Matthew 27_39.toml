And they that passed by blasphemed Him, wagging their heads. All their revilings and insults were blasphemies, as being against the Son of God. "They blasphemed the Holy One of Israel,"  Isaiah 1:4, and  Psalm 22:8. This was a greater torment even than the crucifixion. Whence it is said (Ecclus. vii11), "Laugh not at a man in the bitterness of his soul." And Christ complains ( Psalm 59:26), "They persecute Him whom Thou hast smitten, and added to the pain of My wounds;" and (Ps. xxii13), "They gaped upon Me," &c, so great was their cruelty.
