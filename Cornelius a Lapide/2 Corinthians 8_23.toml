Or our brethren. I trust that you will, as is right, receive them worthily, partly because of the brethren sent with Titus , and partly because of Titus himself. 
The glory of Christ. The Apostles are the glory of Christ, inasmuch as they spread and make known His glory. "Whether, therefore," says Chrysostom, "You will receive them as brethren, or as the Apostles of the Churches, or as those who promote the glory of Christ, you will have many reasons for showing them kindness." By metonymy, glory is put for the cause and care of Christ"s glory.
