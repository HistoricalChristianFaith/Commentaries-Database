Again, ye have heard, &c. Thou shall perform, i.e, Thou shalt pay, shalt fulfil what thou hast sworn unto the Lord, or by the Lord that thou wilt do. So S. Chrysostom properly explains that by oaths are here meant vows confirmed by an oath, that we are bound to render them, that Isaiah , perform them unto God. Suarez explains differently. "If thou desirest to swear, swear by the true God, not by idols."
