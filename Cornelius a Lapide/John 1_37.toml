And two of his disciples, &c. S. Chrysostom says, "There were indeed others of S. John"s disciples, but they not only did not follow Christ, but were jealous of John"s, their master"s, honour, and preferred him to Christ, as is plain from  John 3:26. 
Two: one of those was Andrew, as appears from verse40; who the other was is not known. S. Chrysostom asks, "Why is not the name of the other given? Either because it was the writer himself, S. John the Apostle, or because it was a person of no note." The first idea is the more probable. And what favours the conjecture is that John and James were companions in fishing with Peter and Andrew ( Matthew 4:18-21), when, shortly after Andrew and Peter, Christ calls John and James. Lastly, the great purity, the virginity, and holiness of S. John the Evangelist seem to have been the result of the teaching, the purity, and holiness of S. John the Baptist. 
They followed Jesus: that they might know Him more fully, says Euthymius, and contract a friendship with Him: and if they should experience that advantage, they would follow Him wholly, and be altogether His disciples. For from what follows it is plain they had not given themselves up entirely to Christ, but only desired to make trial of Him.
