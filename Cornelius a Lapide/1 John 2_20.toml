But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all things, so that it is not necessary to speak at greater length to these antichrists. By the word "unction" he refers to Antichrist, and also to Christ (the anointed One). See also what Christ Himself says,  John 16:13. 
But what is this "unction"? (1.) Å’cumenius and S. Jerome on Habakkuk 3. and S. Cyril Alex. say "baptism," when we are anointed on our head. (2.) S. Cyril of Jerus. says, "the sacrament of confirmation," when we are anointed on our forehead. (3.) Em. Sa. says, "the profession of Christianity;" others the Christian faith, grace, the gift of wisdom and understanding; others the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. But they all come to the same point, for in these various ways you will learn all the duties and doctrines of Christianity, and to discern and avoid heretics as opposed to Christ. The word unction stands for the ointment or oil, not for the mere transient act of anointing. In the Greek it is Ï‡Î¶Î¯ÏƒÎ¼Î±. It has reference to the name of Christ, and the sacraments of baptism and confirmation, which used to be given immediately after baptism as its complement and perfection. S. Cyril accordingly understands it to refer to confirmation, so also does Turrianus, and Bellarmine, de Confim. lib. ii. capp5 et8. For by anointing is here to be understood, not so much sanctifying grace, as the gift of wisdom and understanding. (See S. Gregory, Mor. v19 (al20), S. Irenæus iv43). For this gift was bestowed at first on baptized persons.  Acts 2:6,  Acts 10:46,  Acts 19:6; 
 1 Corinthians 14. And it is even now given in baptism ( Isaiah 11:1), though not so abundantly. The word also relates to the royal priesthood, which S. Peter ( 1 Peter 2:9) ascribes to all Christians. For as in old time prophets, priests, and kings were anointed to their office, so do Christians when anointed in baptism and confirmation receive grace, to rule themselves as kings; to foresee future good and evil, as prophets; and to present, as priests, the offerings of good works. So that this gift of the, Holy Spirit, conferred by the outward anointing, will teach Christians everything which concerns Christian life and conduct. For these reasons S. John rejoices in the word "unction," as representing Christ and His "love," of which it is said ( Song of Solomon 1:2), "Thy name is like ointment poured forth;" and S. John was, in consequence of his constant preaching of Christ, thrown about this time into a caldron of boiling oil, but escaped unhurt as having been strengthened by the anointing of Christ. See also  Psalm 45:8;  Isaiah 61:1;  Acts 10:38. S. Athanasius (Epist. ad Serap.) says that this ointment is the Holy Spirit with all His gifts and graces. For in justification is infused not only grace and charity, but the Holy Spirit Himself. See  Romans 5:5; Conc. Trid. Sess. vi. cap7. And S. Augustine (in loc.) says, This spiritual anointing is the Holy Spirit Himself, and the outward anointing is the sacrament thereof. Song of Solomon , too, in the "Veni Creator," we read of the "Anointing Spirit." The Holy Spirit then, inhabiting, enlightening, and directing the soul, teaches it at the fitting time all things befitting its salvation. S. Clement (Const. Apost. iii17) explains the
