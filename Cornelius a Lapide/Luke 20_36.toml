They are equal unto the angels. So the Arabic, Syriac, Egyptian, Persian, and Ethiopic; equal in celibacy, immortality, glory. As therefore the angels do not marry nor generate, so neither do the Blessed, because, being immortal per se, and glorious, they will remain for ever. For generation is desired in this life, because of death; as a mortal father might, as it were, survive and endure in the son whom he leaves alive. So S. Cyril: "As the angels are not of generation, so they who rise again will have no need of marriage." S. Chrysostom on Matt. xxiii: "Wives are married that the diminution, which is by death, may be supplied by birth. But death will not be there, and, in consequence, neither marriages, nor wives, nor generation." 
And are, &c. "They are called the children of God," says Theophylact, "as being born again through the Resurrection, not only through grace, but also through glory, that they may thus resemble God most closely, as is taught by S. John , 1Ep. iii2. Then as sons they shall enter into the inheritance of God the Father." 
"They are called the sons of the Resurrection," says Theophylact, "because they appear to be as it were born to a new, happy, and divine life." 
2. They will be the sons of the Resurrection, that Isaiah , worthy of the Resurrection, for the word "son" when it is added in Hebrew to the genitive of reward or punishment, means one subject to, one who deserves, or who is destined to, such a punishment or reward. Thus men are called the sons of Death and Gehenna, that Isaiah , men subject to death and hell; and the sons of the kingdom and the Resurrection, that Isaiah , they who are worthy of the kingdom of heaven, and of the Resurrection of the blessed.
