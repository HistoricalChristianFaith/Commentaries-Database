And He put forth a parable to those which were bidden, i.e. He taught, under the similitude of a man seeking the highest place at a feast, that we must beware of every kind of ambition. For sin continues to be sin, although the manner of sinning be changed. 
"When He marked how they chose out the chief rooms." For as teachers of the Law, they considered themselves entitled to the highest honour, and fought for precedence as eagerly as now-a-days ladies of rank and men of small brains. 
This is a kind of introduction to the parable, and indicates the occasion on which it was spoken, and the persons against whom it was directed.
