And the other Jews dissembled likewise with him. What was the nature of this dissimulation? Jerome, Chrysostom, and Å’cumenius say it was "economical," to prevent the Jews being scandalised; but Augustine, Anselm, and the Latins in general give a more satisfactory explanation in maintaining that it was an act of hypocrisy. The latter, too, have the Greek on their side, the literal meaning of which Isaiah , they acted hypocritically with him. They pretended to keep the law, which they knew to be abrogated. Barnabas followed them in pretending that there was a difference in meats, and that the Jews were to be preferred to the Gentiles, and Song of Solomon , though they did not consciously intend it, yet they made the Greeks to believe that the Old Law was necessary to salvation.
