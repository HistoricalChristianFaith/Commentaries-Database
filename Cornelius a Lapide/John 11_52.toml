And not for that nation only, &c. It is expedient that Christ should die; not only for His and our nation, that Isaiah , for the Jews, but also for all the nations dispersed throughout the whole world, and who should believe in Him. For these are called children of God, not in actual fact, but in the foreknowledge and predestination of God; because, that is to say, they were hereafter to be, by the grace of God, faithful men and saints, and therefore sons of God. So SS. Augustine and Chrysostom. This is what Christ predicted in chap. x. ver16: Other sheep I have, which are not of this fold (not of the Jewish synagogue) them also I must bring, and there shall be one fold, and one Shepherd.
