When he had said these words, &c. Christ appears not to have taken the straight road through Samaria, but to have crossed the Jordan, and after dismissing the multitudes, to have gone up to Jerusalem with a few of His favoured disciples, in secret (see  Matthew 19:1-2;  Luke 9:51-53;  Mark 9:29,  Mark 10:1).
