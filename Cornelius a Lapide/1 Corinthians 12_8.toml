To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom. The power of explaining Wisdom of Solomon , viz, the deepest mysteries of the Trinity, of the Incarnation, of predestination, &c. Cf. chap. xiii. 
To another the word of knowledge. The power of explaining the things pertaining to life and morals. S. Augustine distinguishes thus between wisdom and knowledge (de Trin. lib. xii. c14,15), and the Apostle so takes knowledge in chap. viii. Others understand by knowledge the power of explaining the things of faith by examples, comparisons, and human and philosophical reasonings.
