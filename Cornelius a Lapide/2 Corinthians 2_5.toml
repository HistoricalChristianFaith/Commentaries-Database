He hath not grieved me. The fornicator did not grieve me only. 
But in part. He grieved, says Anselm, many other good men as well as me; those, viz, who banished from their society with ignominy the man that I had already excommunicated. 
That I may not overcharge you all. Overcharge you by putting on you the suspicion that there are not many who are grieved on account of the incestuous person. In the First Epistle (v2) he seems to have charged them all with consenting to, or with treating lightly, the sin of incest.
