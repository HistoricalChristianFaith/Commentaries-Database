Rise, let us be going: behold, he hath come who will betray Me. He bids them rise, not in order to fly with Him, but to go forth to meet Judas. It is hence clear that Christ was heard in His last prayer; that, comforted of God by the angel, He had thrown off His sadness and sorrow, and went forth to meet Judas and the death of the cross with great and noble resolution. "For," as Origen says, "He saw in the spirit Judas the traitor drawing nigh, though he was not yet seen by the disciples." "He therefore in every way teaches His disciples," says S. Chrysostom, "that this was not a matter of necessity or of weakness, but of a certain incomprehensible dispensation, for He foresaw that they were coming, and so far from flying, He went forth to meet them." 
Christ in thus going forth, as indeed in the whole of His Passion, left three points most worthy of notice1st His innocence in boldly going forth to meet His enemies2nd His majesty, forethought, and power, wherewith as God He orders and foretells the approach of His enemies, and so moderates their fury that they could do no more than He permitted and foreordained3The readiness with which He voluntarily met Judas, to show that it was not from weakness or unwillingness, but with the highest dignity, condescension, and generous love that He suffered and died for us. "Rise, let us be going," to meet Judas; and, as S. Jerome says, "let us go of our own accord to death." 
Morally: Christ here teaches us to arouse ourselves, and go forth to meet our sufferings. It is the act of an heroic mind to weaken by its own resolution the force of any imminent evil, and by voluntarily embracing it to overcome and subdue it. Great evils are more easily overcome by a great mind than minor evils by a small one. As says the poet, "Yield not to trials; boldly go to meet them, as a lion shuts its eyes when rushing on its foes" (Plin. N.H. viii16). The cross therefore pursues those who fly from it, and flies those who seek for it As is said of honour.
