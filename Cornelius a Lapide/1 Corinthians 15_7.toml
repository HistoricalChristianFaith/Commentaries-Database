After that He was seen of James. The son of Alph√¶us, first Bishop of Jerusalem, and styled brother of the Lord. There is a tradition mentioned by Jerome (Lib. de Scrip. Eccles. in Jacobo) that James had taken a vow not to eat anything till he should see Christ risen. S. Jerome, however, does not think the tradition of any value. Its falsity is seen, too, (1.) for it is evident, from this passage of S. Paul, that Christ appeared to him after appearing to the five hundred brethren, and therefore long after His resurrection, too long for S. James"s fast to have been prolonged naturally. (2.) All the Apostles, and therefore S. James , were confounded at Christ"s death, and did not believe in His resurrection. It is not likely then that James would take such a vow. (3.) S. Jerome says that he took this story from the "Gospel according to the Hebrews ," which is apocryphal. It is also said there that Christ wore at the time a linen garment, and that He gave it to the servant of the priest, which also seems false; for the garments of Christ remained in the sepulchre (S. Matt. xxviii.), and a glorified body, such as Christ"s was, is not clad with linen or any such garments, but with splendour and rays of light. 
Then of all the apostles, and the disciples as well, says S. Anselm, at the ascension.
