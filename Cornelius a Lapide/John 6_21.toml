They wished therefore, &c. They wished Him, now that they recognised Him, whom they had before taken for a spectre, and been affrighted at. And immediately, i.e, by the power and virtue of Christ"s presence, the ship was at the land. As Nonnus says, "By the Divine impulse the ship of her own accord touched at the distant port, as it were a soul with wings." This land was Genesar, as S. Matthew calls it ( Matthew 14:34), or Genesareth, as S. Mark ( Matthew 6:53). The ancient name was Cenereth, from the city so called, which was near Capharnaum. From this place the whole sea of Galilee was called the Lake of Cenereth, or Genesareth. Moreover the city of Capharnaum was situated in this land of Genesareth, to which, John says expressly, Jesus sailed with His disciples (vi17 , 24 , 25). Here was uttered His prolonged discourse concerning heavenly bread and the Eucharist. For the6oth verse says expressly, These things He spake, teaching in the synagogue in Capharnaum. 
Observe the expression, and immediately. From this it follows that Christ caused this ship to fly in a moment to the harbour of the city of Capharnaum. Thus it sped eight or nine miles in one moment. For this was the distance between Bethsaida and Capharnaum. For the disciples in sailing from the place where Christ fed the five thousand which was midway between Bethsaida and Tiberias, had gone twenty-five or thirty furlongs, or four or five miles (see  John 6:19), and were about, or a little past Bethsaida, when Jesus, walking upon the sea came to them, and entering into the ship, caused it to fly from that spot, as it were, in a moment, and land at Capharnaum. Thus He caused the ship to traverse eight or nine miles, as it were, in a moment. Learn from this to accomplish all thine actions with Christ, having Christ for thy leader and guide. With Him thou wilt do great things, without Him nothing. Thus S. Peter, though he toiled all night, without Christ, caught no fish: but as soon as He came and bade him let down the nets, he caught an immense multitude of fishes. Therefore as Nazianzen says in his Poems, "Happy is the man who buys Christ with all that he has."
