When Pilate saw that he could prevail nothing, but that rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed his hands before the multitude. Î±Ì‰Ï€ÎµÎ½Î¯ÏˆÎ±Ï„Î¿, washed away. "He adopted," says Origen, "the Jewish custom, and wished to calm them down, not by words only, but also by deed." He washed his hands, but not his conscience. But this took place after the scourging and crowning, of Christ. (See S. John.) Here is a transposition. 
Saying, I am innocent. I condemn Him against my will. Ye are the offenders. Ye are guilty of His death. How foolish was this timid, heartless, and slothful Governor in speaking thus! Why opposest thou not the injustice of the people? "Seek not to be Judges , if thou canst not by thy power break through iniquities" (Eccles. vii6). At another time thou didst let loose the soldiers an the riotous mob (Joseph. B. J, xviii4). Why dost thou not act thus firmly now? If thou canst not, through the fury of the Jews, set Him free now, at least delay thy sentence till their fury subsides. 
S. Chrysostom (in  Luke 23:22) says, "Though he washed his hands, and said he was innocent, yet his permitting it was a sign of weakness and cowardice. For he ought never to have yielded Him up, but rather rescued Him, as the Centurion S. Paul" ( Acts 21:33). S. Augustine more forcibly (Serm. cxviii. de Temp.) "Though Pilate washed his hands, yet he washed not away his guilt; for though he thought he was washing away the Blood of that Just One from his limbs, yet was his mind still stained with it. It was Hebrews , in fact, who slew Christ by giving Him up to he slain. For a firm and good judge should not condemn innocent blood, either through fear or the risk of being unpopular." And S. Leo (Serm. viii. de Pass.) said, "Pilate did not escape guilt, for by siding with the turbulent mob he became partner of others" guilt."
