I pray not that Thou shouldest take them out of the world, but that Thou shouldest keep them from the evil. From the evil (1.) first of guilt, which alone is real evil. (2.) Of punishment, i.e, to preserve them from every adversity, or strengthen them to bear it. (3.) From the evil one, his snares and temptations. In Greek Ï„Î¿Ï…Ìƒ Ï€Î¿Î½Î·Î¶Î¿Ï…Ìƒ.
