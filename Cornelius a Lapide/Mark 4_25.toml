For he that hath, to him shall be given; and he that hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken away from him. Hath, that Isaiah , uses, and shows that he hath by using. For such a one hath indeed, but he who useth not a gift or grace hath it but in name. This is what theologians say, that he who uses his grace hath it in a second act; but he who uses it not hath it only in the first Acts , that Isaiah , in power and possession. The meaning therefore Isaiah , he who, by study or by imparting to others, uses learning given him by God, an increase of learning shall be given; but from him who uses not his learning, shall God take it away.
