And they (the Samaritans) did not receive Him, because His face was as though He would go to Jerusalem. Because He appeared to be going up to Jerusalem (Syriac), for it was plain, from the bearing of Jesus and His messengers, that they were on their way to keep the Feast of Tabernacles, S.  John 7:2. The Samaritans, contrary to the Law, had erected a temple on Mount Gerizim for the worship of God, and therefore there was on this account a constant enmity between the Jews and them. S. John iv, 20 , and Josephus. Hence they rejected Jesus, as despising their form of worship and favouring that of their enemies, the Jews. 
"His face was as though," a Hebraism for ××™×›ï¬», i.e. Ï€Î¶ÏŒÏƒÏ‰Ï€Î¿Î½, or face, is often used for the person himself.
