After this, &c. Tiberias is here named, because the desert in which Christ fed the five thousand was near to Tiberias. 
After this, not immediately, but almost a year afterwards. For the healing of the paralytic, and the dispute of Jesus with the Jews consequent upon it, which John had related in the foregoing chapter, took place in the beginning of the second year of Christ"s ministry. But the things which he relates in this sixth chapter took place at the close of the same year. This is plain because Christ healed the paralytic at the Passover (v1). But He did the things now to be related shortly before the Passover of the year following, as appears from the4th verse. John therefore omits all that Christ did in the second year of His ministry, viz, His creation of Twelve Apostles, His Sermon on the mount, His sending His Apostles forth, as well as many other things. John omits them because they had been fully narrated by the other Evangelists. But he here inserts the narrative of the multiplication of the loaves, because, though related by the other Evangelists, it was the occasion of Christ"s discourse concerning spiritual food, and the food of the Eucharist, which John here gives at length, and which was wholly passed over by them.
