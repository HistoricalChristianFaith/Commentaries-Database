And they arrived at (sailed over to) the country of the Gadarenes, which is over against Galilee. 
Gadarenes. Gergesenes (S. Matt.), or as it is written in some MSS, Gerasenes. Some think that one and the same place is here signified, but Adricomius shows that Gadara, and Gerasa or Gergesa were two distinct cities, but that the surrounding country was named indifferently after either. 
The Vulgate translates "the country of the Gerasenes," because this was the best known name.
