But one of the soldiers opened His side. As somewhat doubting, says S. Cyril, whether He were really dead; and if He were not, to hasten His death. For it was the duty of these soldiers to carry out the sentence, and to see that criminals were not taken away before it was certain that they were dead. S. Chrysostom adds, "To please the Jews, they lay open His side and insult Him when dead0 most evil and most atrocious wish." Some suppose that this soldier was the centurion, who cried out "Truly this was the Son of God!" (Matthew xxvii54.) But it is not likely that he who so cried out would dare to commit such an act. Nazianzen in his "Christus Patiens" suggests that he was blind, and that he then regained his sight. Many stories on this matter were collected by Barradius, which Baronius rejects as apocryphal. Here note—1. That the soldier was one of the guuard who brake the legs of the two malefactors, and would have broken Christ"s also had he been alive. But they pierced His side, to show that He was dead, and this was why they brake not His legs2. Some say it was a spear, others a sword which was used3. The Vulgate seems to have read, Î®Î½Î¿Î¹Î¾Îµ, but the Greek is Î­Î½Ï…Î¾Îµ. 4. This wound was so large that a hand could have been thrust into it. See  John 20:275. It was on the right side, as represented by painters. Some think it was so foretold by Ezekiel 17:2. S. Francis also received his wound on the right side. See S. Bonaventura, Ribadeaeira, &c6. Christ therefore received six wounds7. This wound seems to have pierced through both sides, as Prudentius says in several passages. As, e.g,
As struck the cruel spear through either side,
Water and Blood poured forth in mingled tide:
For victory this, and that to cleanse applied. 
De Pass. Christi [apud Diptych, num. xlii.]; Peristeph. Hymn viii.  151; and Cathomer, Hymn ix.  85]; [Pseudo]-Cyprian also (de Pass.) says the same. Theophylact speaks of this wound in the plural number, Prudentius seems to imply that the larger wound emitted blood, and the smaller wound on the left side water. But this wound on the left slide was so small as not to be taken into account. Hence there were only five wounds. S. Bridget"s Revel. iv40 , vii15 , and ii21 , are also referred to. 
And forthwith came thereout blood and water. Both together (not separately, as Nonnus paraphrases), but yet not mixed, but so that they could be distinguished from each other. But this could not be the case naturally, because the blood of a dead body congeals, and pure blood cannot flow from it. And this was pure blood, not serum, as Innoc. III. lays it down (Lib. iii. Decret. Titus 41 , de Celebr. Miss. cap. viii.) Calvin is therefore wrong in saying that water is contained in the pericardium. Therefore this flowing forth of blood and water was miraculous, as S. Ambrose on Luke xxiii, Euthymius, and Theophylact say. The latter remarks, "The contumely is changed into a miracle, and wonderful it was that blood flowed forth from a dead body. But a caviller might say that some vital force might probably remain in the body. But the water which flowed forth puts the matter beyond all dispute." He says afterwards, "Confounded be the Armenians, who in the Mysteries mix not water with the wine. For, as it seems, they do not believe that water flowed forth from the side (which would be more wonderful), but blood only. And in this passage they do away with a mighty miracle. The blood then is the symbol of a crucified Prayer of Manasseh , but the water of one who is above Prayer of Manasseh , that Isaiah , of God." See Adam Coutzen and Francis Lucas on this passage. 
But this took place by way of mystery. But what mystery? (1.) To show the reality of Christ"s human nature. See  1 John 5:7. (2.) To signify that the Church was formed as the Spouse of Christ out of the side of the second Adam dying on the Cross. Symbolically, i.e. and figuratively, as meaning that the Church was purchased, founded, and sanctified by the Blood of Christ. As S. Ambrose (on Luke 23) says, "Life flowed forth from that dead body. For water and blood flowed forth, the one to cleanse, the other to redeem;" and as S. Cyril and Chrysostom say, that the water signifies baptism, which is the first beginning, of the Church and the other sacraments, and the blood represents the Eucharist, which is the end and completion of the sacraments, to which they all refer as to their beginning and their end. Whence S. Augustine says (in loc.), that all sacraments flowed forth from the side of Christ, in mystery, as I said. His words are, "It is not said that he "struck" or "wounded," but that he "opened" the side of Christ, that the door of life might thus, as it were, be opened, from whence the sacraments of the Church flowed forth, without which there is no entrance to true life." And S. Chrysostom. "Because the sacred mysteries take their rise from thence, when thou approachest the awful Chalice, thou shouldest approach it as if thou wert about to drink from the very side of Christ;" and the reason Isaiah , as S. Chrysostom and Theophylact say, "The Church exists and consists by means of the sacraments." For it is born by Baptism, strengthened by Confirmation, fed and perfected by the Eucharist, healed by Penance, fortified by Extreme Unction, governed by Holy Orders, and continued and extended by Matrimony. 
As a symbol of this, Cyprian and others say that water must be mixed with the wine in the consecration of the Chalice. 
Tropologically. Tertullian says (de Baptismo), that Christ by this effusion of Blood and Water indicated the two kinds of Baptism, by water and by martyrdom. 
Anagogically. This opening of Christ"s side shadowed forth that heaven, which had been closed for4000 years, was opened by His death. Ruffinus adds, In Expos. Symb, "He poured forth water to cleanse believers, and blood to condemn unbelievers." See Suarez, Par. iii. Qust. li Disput. xli. &sect; 1 , where, however, he thinks that only the left side of Christ was pierced, and that the blood first ran forth, and afterwards the water, both which are equally probable.
