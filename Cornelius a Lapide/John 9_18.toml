But the Jews did not believe, &c. They hoped to elicit something from them to refute either the blind man or Christ, "by finding that he was not born blind," says S. Chrysostom, or was not quite blind but dim-sighed, or that he regained his sight by magic, and not by the miracle wrought by Christ. "They sought," says S. Augustine, "how they might accuse him, that they might cast him out of the synagogue," as they shortly afterwards did. Theophylact states that this was their dilemma. It is either false that your son now sees, or that he was blind at first. But it is admitted that he sees, it was therefore false that he was, as he says, previously blind. His parents reply cautiously. They knew him to be their Song of Solomon , and that he was born blind. But how he gained his sight they knew not. They speak with prudence so as not to deny the truth, nor yet incur the peril of excommunication. And hence they say, "He is of age," meaning, says S. Augustine, "we should justly be compelled to speak for an infant, for it could not speak for itself. But he is a man who can speak for himself, therefore (say they) ask him."
