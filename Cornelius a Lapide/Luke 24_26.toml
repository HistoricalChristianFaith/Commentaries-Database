Ought not Christ . . . to enter into His glory? He calls His glorious resurrection and ascension, the sending of the Holy Spirit, His exaltation over every creature, the adoration of His name, the spread of the gospel throughout all the world, and His eternal kingdom, "glory." 
"Ought not," ("futurum erat," the Arabic and Syriac). It behoved Christ through the Cross to enter glory: 
1. Because the prophets had foretold it. 
2. Because God the Father had decreed it from all eternity. 
3. Because it was necessary that He should purchase our redemption by His death upon the Cross. 
4. Because it was fitting that such glory should be obtained through the merit of such sufferings and labour. 
5. Because it behoved Christ, as leader, to become an example to the martyrs, and to all those who strive through much tribulation to enter into the kingdom of heaven. 
The meaning Isaiah , "My death upon the Cross has shaken your faith and hope in My resurrection, therefore ye said "we trusted" (sperabamus). But ye spake rashly and without cause. For this ought to have confirmed your faith, for there is none other way to the resurrection save through death, nor to glory save through suffering, and the reproach of the Cross."
