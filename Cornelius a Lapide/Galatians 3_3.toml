Having begun in the Spirit. With the spiritual doctrine of Christ, and the spiritual gifts received from Him, enabling you to live the spiritual life. 
Are ye now made perfect by the flesh? The flesh is put for circumcision and other carnal ceremonies of the law. The interpretation which sees here a reference to the carnal lusts of the flesh is disproved by the context. Made perfect is in the Vulgate consumemini. 
S. Bernard (Serm33in Cant.) applies this text to those who exhaust their strength by unrestrained devotion, through excessive prayers and penances. Afterwards, he says, they become lazy, and are consumed by the flesh, while seeking for health, and so become sensual and carnal. Cf. notes to  1 Corinthians 3:2. 
Theophylact observes that S. Paul uses the passive, not the active—"Are you made perfect?" not, "Do you make perfect?" i.e, he hints that they were like brute beasts, in suffering themselves to be circumcised by others. He also notes that he does not say merely Ï€ÎµÎ³ÎµÎ¹ÌƒÏƒÎ¸Îµ, but ÎµÌ‰Ï€Î¹Ï„ÎµÎ»ÎµÎ¹ÌƒÏƒÎ¸Îµ: After being perfected in Christ, will you seek a perfection beyond in the Old Law? Do you want to add a fifth wheel to the coach?
