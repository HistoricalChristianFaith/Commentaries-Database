And now come I to Thee (1shall soon come at My ascension); and these things I speak in the world, that they might have My joy fulfilled in themselves. I speak of these things, in order that the Apostles may fully rejoice with Me at these great blessings, and hope that they will hereafter be received by Me into heaven, to the same glory with Myself. 
S. Augustine says, "He stated before the nature of this glory, when He said "that we may be one." For this is the peace and blessedness of the life to come."
