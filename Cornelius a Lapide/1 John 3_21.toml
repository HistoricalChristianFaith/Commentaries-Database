If our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence towards God, viz, that we shall obtain from Him all that we ask. See  Psalm 119:6. The contrary is the case with the wicked. See  Proverbs 28:9, as S. Gregory says (Mor. x15 , or17), "He who remembers that he still refuses to listen to the command of God, doubts whether he will obtain what he wishes for. And our heart blames us when we pray, when it calls to mind that he opposes the will of Him whom he is addressing. "As oil makes the light to shine, so do good deeds give confidence to the soul.""
