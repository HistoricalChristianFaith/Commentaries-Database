And it came to pass, as the angels were gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even unto Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass. This thing, a metenomy, common in Scripture, by which the word is put for the thing signified by it, as in  Luke 1:37, "No word"—that Isaiah , nothing "shall be impossible with God." And in2Kings i4 , "What is the word that is come to pass?" 
Which the Lord hath made known unto us. In the Greek ÎµÌ‰Î³Î½ÏŽÎ¶Î¹ÏƒÎµ—revealed, made known. Yea, and has given us, rather than the scribes and all others, a sign by which we shall find the Messiah that is born. Wherefore, if we, who have been invited by Him through an angel, do not visit and adore Him who is born for us, and revealed first to us, we shall be ungrateful to God, to the angels, and to Christ, and enemies to ourselves.
