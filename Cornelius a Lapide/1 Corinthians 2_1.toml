And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom. The Apostle here descends from the general to the particular. In other words: I said in the preceding chapter that God in preaching the Gospel willed not to use the wisdom of the wise in this world, but rejected it and scorned it, but willed by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe; and therefore He chose not many noble or wise to spread the Gospel, but the low-born and untaught Apostles. From this I infer and say "And I" i.e, and so I as one of the number of the Apostles, who, according to the election and will of God, did not use eloquence and worldly Wisdom of Solomon , was unwilling to use those means, and I came to you not in excellency but in simplicity of speech and wisdom.

SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
He proceeds to exalt the spiritual wisdom of Christ above all natural and animal wisdom. Therefore he says:â€”
i. That he knew and preached nothing but Christ crucified; and that not with enticing words of man"s Wisdom of Solomon , but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power.
ii. Nevertheless in ver5 he says that he speaks wisdom among them that are perfect, wisdom hidden from the world, which eye hath not seen nor ear heard, but which the Spirit of God alone has revealed.
iii. He shows in ver14that the natural man does not perceive the things which are of God, but the spiritual man perceives and judges all things.
