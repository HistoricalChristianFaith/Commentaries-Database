Jesus said therefore, &c. For when the others were scandalized and went away from Christ "the Twelve remained," says S. Augustine, "for not even did Judas go away:" partly for shame"s sake, not to be the only Apostle to go away, and be called an apostate; partly that he might be fed by Christ without labour on his part, as he had been hitherto; and that as he bore the bag and was a sort of purveyor for Christ"s family, he might steal and enrich himself. For he was a thief. 
Christ asks the question of the Apostles for five reasons. The first was that He might leave them their liberty. As though He said, "I give you your choice: if ye wish to go away, depart: if ye wish to remain with Me, remain. I will not retain you either by force, or shame." Listen to S. Chrysostom. "Jesus neither flattered, nor drove away: but He asked the question, not because He despised them, but that they might not seem to be retained by compulsion." For if they had remained unwillingly, He would have been in exactly the same condition as if they had gone away. 
(2.) To show His greatness of soul; and that He did not need the work of Apostles, forasmuch as He by Himself could do all things: and when they were sent away, He could substitute others who were better in their place. 
(3.) That the Apostles might understand that by remaining, they did not commend, or show favour to Jesus, but to themselves. "That they received rather than conferred a benefit," says Theophylact. 
(4.) That by this freedom of choice He might the more bind them to Himself, and invite them to remain. For it often occurs, as a natural consequence, that when we are asked, we decline; when we are not asked, we desire; when we are invited, we flee; when we are not invited, we draw near. 
(5.) That by this interrogation He might prove their affection, and try their constancy, and draw a confession of their true faith concerning Himself. So S. Cyril. And that such a confession was drawn forth is plain from the next verse.
