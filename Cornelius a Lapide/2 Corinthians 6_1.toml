We then, as workers together with Him. We, as workers together with God, beseech you to accept this proffered reconciliation, spoken of in vers18 , 19 , and20 , of the preceding chapter. 
Beseech you also that ye receive not the grace of God in vain. He receives grace into a vacuum, says Anselm, who does not work with it, who does not give it his heart, and who, through sloth, makes that grace ineffectual, by not doing, all that he can to express it in good works. In other words, do not suppose that faith alone is reconciliation, for a good life and good works are also indispensable. So Theophylact, following Chrysostom. 
Observe that the Apostle applies the word grace to the general benefit of reconciliation of the world through Christ"s redemption; for it was of this that he had just been treating. Nevertheless, under that he comprehends that particular grace which Christ has merited for each one, and which God gives to each one, to enable each one to become a partaker of the general redemption wrought by Christ.
