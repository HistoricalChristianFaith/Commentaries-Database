SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. That the Corinthians may esteem him above the false apostles, he describes his being carried up into the third heaven. 
ii. He goes on to say (ver7) that to prevent his being puffed up a thorn in the flesh was given him; for strength is made perfect in weakness. 
iii. He clears himself (ver11) from any charge of self-love, by pointing out that it was they who had compelled him to praise himself, instead of commending him, as they ought to have done, for his long-suffering, miracles, preaching without charge, charity, and care for them. 
iv. He refutes the calumny (ver17) brought against him, that he collected money from them craftily, not personally, but by means of Titus. 
v. He expresses a fear (ver21) lest, when he should come to them, he might find some of them involved in dissensions and other sins; and thus he tacitly warns them that he may with grief be compelled to castigate them.
