For the Jews require a sign . . . but we preach Christ crucified. A Theban, when asked what he thought of the Romans , said that "the Romans boasted themselves in their spears, the Greeks on their eloquence, the Thebans in their virtues." But the Apostle says that he and other Christians boast themselves in Christ crucified. This is our spear, our eloquence, and our virtue.
