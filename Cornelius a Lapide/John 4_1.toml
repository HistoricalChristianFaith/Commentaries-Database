When therefore Jesus knew, &c. . . . than John , that Isaiah , than John had made and baptized, says S. Augustine (lib2 , de cons. Evang, c18), for John was now in prison. For these things had happened through the occasion of John"s imprisonment. For Jesus, knowing of John"s imprisonment, and fearing the envy and calumny of the Pharisees, who had already stirred up Herod against John , that they might not be the means of casting Himself also into prison through the instrumentality of Herod or Pilate, and put him to death before the time predetermined by the Father, prudently retired out of Judea into Galilee. See what has been said about this on Matt iv12. 
Although Jesus, &c. Both because Jesus was occupied in the greater works of preaching and Healing the sick; as Paul saith, "Christ sent me not to baptize, but to preach the Gospel" ( 1 Corinthians 1:17), also that He might show that the efficacy of His baptism was greater than that of John"s. See what has been said on iii32. 
He left Judea, &c. Not as though He feared death, but that He might mollify the envy of the Pharisees, says S. Chrysostom. For the Pharisees were very influential. For most of the priests, senators, and magistrates belonged to their sect. This was the second occasion of Christ retiring into Galilee, the first being in chap143.
He must needs, &c. For Samaria lies betwixt Judea and Galilee. Cyril observes that Christ does not here go counter to his own command, by which He enjoined on His apostles not to go into the cities of the Samaritans (S. Matt. x5). For He there forbids them not to go to the Samaritans of set purpose, nor to continuously evangelise them, lest they should prejudice the Jews, who were their enemies, against themselves and the faith of Christ. Jesus on this occasion was only passing through Samaria on His way to Galilee. 
Samaria was the district which was occupied by the tribe of Ephraim, and half the tribe of Manasseh. It took its name of Samaria from the royal city, which was built upon the hill Somer. See  1 Kings 16:24.
