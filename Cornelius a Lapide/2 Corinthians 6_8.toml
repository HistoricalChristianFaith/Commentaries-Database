By honour and dishonour. Whether we are honoured and praised, or dishonoured and abused, as, e.g, when the Lycaonians wished to worship Paul as God, and directly afterwards to stone him as an impostor. The preposition by is here equivalent to in. See note to 
 1 Timothy 2:15. 
By evil report and good report. Whether we are spoken evil of, or are in great repute. 
As deceivers. Regarded as such, says Ambrose, when yet we are true. 
As unknown, and yet well known. Looked upon by unbelievers and heretics as unknown and obscure, but yet well known to God and our own consciences (Ambrose).
