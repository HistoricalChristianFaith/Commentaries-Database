For he that soweth to his flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption. He who does carnal works, and casts them as it were seed into his flesh, shall of this carnal seed reap death now and hereafter. The reference is chiefly to sins of gluttony and impurity. On the other hand, those who sow spiritual things strengthen the spirit within, and shall reap life everlasting. 
But although the phrase is couched in general terms, the Apostle"s immediate reference is to the works of beneficence done by catechumens for their teachers. In either case the meaning is the same.
