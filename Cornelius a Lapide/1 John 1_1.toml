Every one that believeth, with a living faith, which extends itself to charity, and worketh by love, that Jesus is the Christ, i.e, the Messiah, the Saviour and Redeemer of the world, is born of God, by a divine and spiritual birth, which takes place by faith, love, and grace, by which a man becomes not only a friend, but a son and heir of God, and a partaker of the Divine nature ( 2 Peter 1:5). 
And every one . . . loveth also Him who is born of Him. Born: 1Christ the Son of God is properly He who is born of God the Father2d Born of God applies to every believer, who is adopted of God through the grace of Christ. And this is S. John"s reasoning, by which he proves that our neighbours ought to be loved: Whosoever loveth God the Father who begat, loveth equally God the Son who was begotten. But he who loveth God the Son loveth also all the other sons of God, as being His brethren and members. Therefore he who loveth God the Father loveth also all the children of God who are born of Him. It is in favour of this exposition, says S. Augustine, that the Apostle here says Son in the singular as understanding the Only Begotten of the Father. But presently, in the next verse he says sons in the plural as intending the just, by adoption and regeneration sons of God.

That which was from the beginning, &c. The beginning of this Epistle corresponds with the beginning of St. John"s Gospel. Both here and there he sets forth the eternity and the Godhead of Christ, and next His Incarnation, these being the two chief Mysteries, and the cardinal points, of the whole Christian faith. 
The word "was" points, says St. Basil, "to eternity," "that thus we might understand," says Bede, "that the Word which was coeternal with the Father was before all time," for whatever time you may assign, or imagine beforehand, it is true to say that the Word then was; thousands, or millions of years, or ever the world was, for He was before any imaginable number of years, even from all eternity. Nor does it mean merely that He was before the beginning of the world, and of time, but that even then He was from all past eternity. And we speak of the Word in the imperfect, and not in the past time, to signify that He still exists. So St. Cyril, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others, on John i1. And St. John wrote thus against the Arians who would afterwards arise, and say that there was a time when He "was" not, denying that He was eternal. This also was condemned by the Nicene Council, and therefore St. John repeats the word "was" to show that whatever time you may think of, or imagine, the Word at that very time "was". "Carry your thoughts back (says St. Basil, Contr. Eunom.) as far as you can, and you will not be able to rise beyond that time."
