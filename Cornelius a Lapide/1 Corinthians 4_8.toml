Now ye are full. This Isaiah , as Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Anselm say, ironical. Ye are filled with wisdom and grace, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and so it is your boast that you are not so much Corinthians as teachers, having nothing further to learn of Christianity. You think yourselves perfect as teachers when you are scarcely disciples at all of the true and perfect wisdom. S. Chrysostom says, To be satisfied with little is the mark of a weak mind: and to think one"s self rich by a small addition of means is the mark of one that is sick and miserable; but true godliness is never satisfied." 
S. Thomas notices that S. Paul here points out four kinds of pride in the Corinthians, or rather in their teachers. First, when one thinks that he has from himself and not from God whatever good he possesses: this is alluded to in the words, "Why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it?" In these words also is contained the second, which Isaiah , when any one attributes to his own merits whatever good he has. The third is when one boasts that he has what he has not, and this is touched in the words, "Now ye are full; now ye are rich." The fourth is when one despises others, and wishes to stand in a class by himself: this is pointed at in the words, "Ye have reigned as kings without us." 
Ye have reigned as kings without us. Without our help, you think, O Corinthians, that you triumphantly excel over all God"s saints; and especially you, O teachers, as if you had been given a kingdom, claim for yourselves, while excluding us, a supreme dignity. 
And I would to God that ye did reign, that we also might reign with you. As your followers and rivals, or better as being your fathers: for this as a matter of fact we are. So Theophylact, Chrysostom, and Anselm. He does not decline to have partners in the kingdom of God, i.e, in the government of the Church; he only requires them to rule as they ought, that Isaiah , to devote themselves to the salvation of the faithful.
