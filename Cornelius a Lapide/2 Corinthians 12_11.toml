I am become a fool in glorying. I seem to have done foolishly in praising myself, but you, who had of me a lower opinion than you ought, and who gave more credence to the false apostles than to me, have compelled me to recover my influence over you by thus praising myself. 
Though I be nothing. That I am an Apostle is not my doing, it is of the grace of Christ (Anselm). Cf. xi5 , note.
