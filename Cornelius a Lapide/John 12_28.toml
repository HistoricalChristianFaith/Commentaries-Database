Father, glorify thy Name. That in My death, which I willingly undertake, I may glorify thy Name, by the entire obedience and devotion with which I will offer myself as a Victim for the sins of the whole world, thus restoring to the life of grace men who were lost in sin, reconciling them to Thee, and taking them to heaven to glorify Thee for ever. So S. Augustine, Chrysostom, Euthymius. It was said in like manner to S. Peter, that He would by his death glorify God ( John 21:19). Hear S. Augustine: "Glorify Me by my Passion and Resurrection." And S. Chrysostom: "His dying for the truth He calls "the glory of God:" for after His death the Name of God would be acknowledged by the world." And the gloss, "I seek salvation, but I refuse not to suffer, and for the sake of this passion glorify Me, for that is the glory of thy Name."

Glorify Me at this very instant; that both Gentiles and Jews may acknowledge that I have been sent by Thee to redeem Prayer of Manasseh , and will therefore glorify Thee for thy goodness. So Theodore of Heraclæa. 
Then came there a voice, &c. I have glorified It—(1) By communicating to Him, as my only begotten Song of Solomon , my majesty, glory, and Godhead from all eternity. As He said chap. xvii5. So S. Augustine and Bede. 
(2.) In creating the world, and all things therein by Him. So Rupertus. 
(3.) Most sensibly. By the voice from heaven at His Baptism, and by the miracles and mighty works which He wrought. And also by the voice at this time uttered from heaven. He glorified Him also by His death and resurrection, His ascension, His sending the Holy Spirit, by the preaching of the Apostles, and the miracles, which will lead all nations to acknowledge, worship, love and adore Him as the Son of God. So S. Chrysostom, Cyril, and others.
