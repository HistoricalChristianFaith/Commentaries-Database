And when the fruit is brought forth, immediately he pulleth in the sickle. Greek, ÏŒÏ„Î±Î½ Î´ÎµÌ€ Ï€Î±ÏÎ±Î´Ï‰Ìƒ ÏŒ ÎºÎ±ÏÏ€ÏŒÏ‚, that Isaiah , when indeed the fruit has brought itself forth; for fruit is here in the nominative case. The Syriac has, when it has become fat; Arabic, when it is perfect. This is a Hebraism, for in Hebrew verbs in the conjugation Hitpael have a passive, or reflex, signification, by which the agent receives the action in himself, so that the agent is the same as the recipient of the action. Wherefore some codices read, when the fruit has produced itself. Otherwise Maldonatus explains, "When the fruit, that Isaiah , the seed itself, which was the fruit of former seed, shall have brought forth, that is to say, other seed from itself."
