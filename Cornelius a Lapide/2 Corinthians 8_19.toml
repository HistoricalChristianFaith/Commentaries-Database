But who was also chosen of the churches. For this work of grace of collecting the alms of the Church. The word rendered here chosen is Ï‡ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿Ï„Î¿Î½Î·Î¸ÎµÎ¹Ì€Ï‚, i.e, ordained by imposition of hands—consecrated either deacon or priest. It was the deacon"s office to have care of the poor, and to distribute the alms to them; but the priest"s to help the Apostle on his journeys in preaching and administration of the sacraments. The sacrament of Order is called by the Greeks Ï‡ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿Ï„Î¿Î½Î¯Î±, from the imposition of the Bishop"s hands on the ordinands. Cf. 
 1 Timothy 4:14;  1 Timothy 5:22;  Acts 14:22. From this it is evident that to lay hands on presbyters is to ordain them, and by ordaining to make them presbyters. 
Which is administered by us to the glory of the same Lord. The Latin version reads, in the last clause of this verse, "to our destined mind;" the meaning of this Isaiah , to show the readiness of our mind in this pious service to God and the poor. The Greek is Ï‡ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿Ï„Î¿Î½Î¯Î±. "Destined," therefore, as S. Thomas remarks, does not here mean "predestinated by God," but ready, prompt, and cheerful. But the Greek MSS. give your, not our. We have received, says S. Paul, this grace, this ministry of almsgiving, to glorify God by it, and to make you more ready for it by the exhortations of Titus and Luke (Theophylact).
