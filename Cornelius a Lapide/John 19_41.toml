Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden (for where could Jesus, the Author of all verdure and vigour, be buried, except in a garden?) See notes on  Matthew 27:60. And in the garden a new sepulchre, wherein was never man yet laid; as S. Augustine says, "As no one before or after Him was conceived in a virgin"s womb, so no one either before or after Him was buried in that tomb."
