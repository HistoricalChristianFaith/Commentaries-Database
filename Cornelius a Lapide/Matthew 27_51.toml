And behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom. At the death of Christ the Creator the whole Creation was agitated with indignation. S. Augustine (de Cons. Evang. iii19) observes that the veil was rent immediately on His death, to show that it was on account of it. S. Luke , therefore, who connects it with the darkness which took place before His death, speaks by anticipation. Now there were two veils, one before the Holy of Holies, the other before the Holy Place, which the priests entered every day. But the Holy of Holies the Chief Priest alone entered, and once only in the year. Some consider that the outer veil was rent (S. Jerome, Ep. cl. ad Hedibiam). But it was clearly the inner one. (See S. Leo, Serm. x. de Pass.; S. Cyril, in John xix.; Euthymius and others.) But why was it rent? S. Cyril, Theophylact, and Euthymius say to show that the temple was indignant that the Priests, who should have been the first to acknowledge Christ, had denied and slain Him. And that it thus foretold, and threatened, as it were, that they were to be deprived of their Priesthood (S. Leo, Serm. x. de Pass.). 
Mystically: Theophylact says it was to signify that the temple was to be profaned, and done away with, and set aside, with all its rites and sacrifices (nay, more, says S. Chrysostom, "to be laid waste"). "God in this way made it manifest," says Theophylact, "that the grace of the Holy Spirit was flying away from the temple, and that the Holy of Holies (before inaccessible) was brought within view of all." "For then," says S. Cyril (xii27 on John), "Israel fell utterly away from the grace of God when it so madly and impiously slew its Saviour." And S. Hilary, "The glory of the veil was taken away, and the protection of the guardian angel." Hence S. Ephr. (Serm. de Pass.) records that when it was rent asunder, a dove, the type of the Holy Spirit flew out of the temple. 
Allegorically: To signify that the veil of legal ceremonies was thrown open, as fulfilled in Christ, so that henceforth both Jews and Gentiles should clearly know God, and Christ, and His Mysteries, which the Jews figuratively shadowed forth in so many ways; nay, more, that the service and Church of God should be transferred from Jerusalem, and the temple to the Gentiles and to Rome. So Origen, S. Jerome, S. Ambrose, and others. S. Leo says (Serm. xvii. de Pass.), "There was then so clear a change made from the Law to the Gospel, from the Synagogue to the Church, from the many sacrifices to the One Victim, God Himself, that when our Lord gave up the ghost the veil was violently and suddenly rent asunder." And S. Jerome, "The veil of the temple was rent, and all the mysteries of the Law, which before were kept secret, were then laid open, and handed over to the Gentiles." 
Anagogically: S. Paul says (Heb. ix.) that the way to Heaven, was then opened, for the Holy of Holies was a type of Heaven, and the veil signified that it was closed till Christ burst through it by His death. S. Jerome mentions that the huge lintel of the temple was then broken (Epist. cl.). But Josephus says that it was at the destruction of Jerusalem. 
And the earth did quake1. That Isaiah , the whole earth, as the darkness (ver45) was universal. Many authorities are quoted for this. Didymus (in Catena) says it was prophesied by Job ( Job 9:6). Both Pliny and Suetonius speak of a great earthquake in Asia at this time. By this earthquake was indicated the Godhead of Christ, for He it was who shook the earth, earthquakes being frequently ascribed to divine power, e.g,  1 Kings 19:11; Exodus 19.;  Psalm 18:7;  Nahum 3:6. In the Passion, then, of Christ is fulfilled the prophecy of  Haggai 2:6. 
2. It signified the natural indignation of the earth at the awful crime committed against its Lord. 
Mystically: It signified the new heavens and earth ( Isaiah 45:17), for the old earth seemed to be passing away. 
Tropologically: It signified that the earthly and stony hearts of men would be moved to repentance by the death of Christ, since the earth, the sea, the sun, and the heavens, the darkened air, and the riven rocks, proclaimed their indignation at the death of their Creator. But see here how Christ, in His lowliest estate, manifested His supreme majesty and power, that He might not seem to be compelled to die, and that men, learning who and how mighty He was, who was suffering for them such vile indignities with such great dignity, might be astounded and awe-struck. For, as S. Ambrose says (de Fide v2), "Jesus was wearied by His journey, that He might refresh the wearied; He asks for drink, though about to give spiritual drink to those who thirsted for it; He is hungry, though about to give the food of life to the hungry; He dies, though about to quicken; He is buried, though about to rise again; He hangs on the trembling tree, though about to strengthen the trembling; He covers the heaven with darkness, that He may illuminate it; He shakes the earth, in order to make it firm; He lifteth up the sea, that He may calm it; He unbars the tombs of the dead, to show that they are the abodes of the living; He is fashioned of a Virgin, that He may be believed to be the Son of God; He assumes ignorance, that He may instruct the ignorant; He is said to worship as a Jew, to the end that He may be worshipped as indeed the Son of God." 
And the rocks rent. First in Golgotha. Whence S. Cyril Hieros. says (Catech. xiii.), "Up to this day Golgotha bears its witness, where on Christ"s account the rocks were rent." And S. Lucian, too, giving a reason for His faith to the Governor, says, "With these, too, agree the very spot at Jerusalem, and the rock of Golgotha, which was burst asunder by the weight of the Cross." Adrichomius (Descr. Jerus. Numbers 252) speaks more fully. "There can be seen even now the fissure which was made at Christ"s death, and also the stain of His Blood," and then describes at length its size, &c. But in many other places besides, says Baronius (ad An34 , Numbers 107), the rocks were rent, as at Mount Alverno, where it was revealed to S. Francis that this took place at the crucifixion. He had accordingly a great devotion to the place, and he there received the Stigmata. S. Ambrose therefore justly exclaims, "0 breasts of the Jews! harder than rocks, for the rocks were rent, but their hearts were hardened," &c. 
Allegorically: S. Jerome (ad Hedib. q8), "The rocks were rent, that Isaiah , the hard hearts or rocks of the Gentiles; the universal predictions, too, of the Prophets (who, as well as the Apostles, were termed rocks, by the Rock which is Christ), that whatever was concealed in them by the hard covering of the Law might be rent open and revealed to the Gentiles. The tombs also (of whom it was written that they were as whited sepulchres) were rent, that they who were dead in unbelief might come forth; might live with Christ who had risen; might enter the Heavenly Jerusalem, and have their citizenship no longer on earth, but in Heaven; might die with the earthly, to reign with the Heavenly Adam." Eusebius mentions that at Paxos a voice was heard, "Great Pan is dead," which he explains of Lucifer, whom Christ destroyed by His own death. Others say that Pan was Christ, being "our God and all," and that the devils bewailed His death, because they were thereby despoiled of their dominion over the world.
