For neither doth the Father Judges , &c. The Arabic omits for, but the Greek has it, and appositely. For this is the second reason by which Christ proves that He is God, and the second greater work which He said the Father would show Him. As Cyril says, "He brings forward another Divine and excellent argument, by which He shows that He is by nature truly God. For to whom else does it belong to judge the world but to God only?" 
To His Son. One God with Himself, but by His Incarnation made man. As S. Austin says (lib1 , de. Trin, c13), "No one shall see the Father at the judgment of the quick and the dead, but all shall see the Song of Solomon , because He is the Son of Prayer of Manasseh , that He may be seen by the wicked also, when "they shall look on Him whom they pierced."" 
You will say, Christ has been created judge as Prayer of Manasseh , according to the words ( Acts 10:42), "Who has been constituted by God the judge of quick and dead," therefore Christ cannot prove from His being judge that He is God. I answer, that this correctly proves it, because the power of judgment is a thing peculiar to God: it is a matter of the highest and most ample right. Wherefore neither would God communicate it, nor could it be fittingly communicated to a mere Prayer of Manasseh , but to Christ alone, who is both God and man. For He as God has the supreme authority to Judges , but as Prayer of Manasseh , He is able to exercise this judgment visibly before men, to acquit, or to condemn. For a judge ought to be seen and heard by those who are accused.
