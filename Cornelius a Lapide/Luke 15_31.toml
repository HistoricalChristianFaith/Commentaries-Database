And he said unto him, Song of Solomon , thou art ever with me, and all that I have is thine. "The law, the prophets, the oracles of God," says St. Jerome. To this we must add, the worship of the one true God, and faith in Him, in the teachings of the Church, and the benefits arising therefrom. For all these blessings, which were lacking to the Gentiles before the coming of Christ, were the possession of God"s people Israel. 
The sense Isaiah , "Thou, as my Song of Solomon , art at liberty to enjoy all my possessions, as seems to thee good. Thou oughtest not then to envy thy brother, or to take it amiss that out of our common property, I have ordered a calf to be slain, in honour of his return, especially as thou also art invited to the banquet." St. Ambrose. And the Interlinear adds, "All mine is thine, if so be, thou ceasest to envy thy brother," for, says St. Augustine, "desire obtains nothing without want, charity nothing with want, and when we shall have obtained that blessedness, the higher things will be ours to live upon, equal things ours to have fellowship with, the lower things ours to rule;" and he assigns the reason, "for it is thus that all things are looked upon by perfect and immortal children, that each is the possession of all, and all of each." Hence there will arise for the blessed hereafter the perfection of mutual charity and love, and the fulness of glory and of bliss.
