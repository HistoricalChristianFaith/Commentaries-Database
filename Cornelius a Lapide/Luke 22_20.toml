This cup is the new Testament in My blood. That Isaiah , this cup is the authentic instrument, and, as it were, the chart and tabula testamentaria, in which My new covenant is written and signed for giving you My heavenly inheritance, written, I say, not with ink, but in My blood.  1 Corinthians 11:23, &c.
