For in this, &c. A word, i.e, a proverb, which is "current in the mouths of many," says S. Chrysostom. This proverb, one soweth, &c, which is spoken of the natural harvest, is still more true with regard to the spiritual sowers and reapers. "The sowers were the Prophets, the reapers are you, 0 ye Apostles, who by My doctrine will bring to perfection the seeds of faith which were sown by the Prophets, and will gather them, when ripe, into the storehouse of the Church." Wherefore He subjoins an explanation.
