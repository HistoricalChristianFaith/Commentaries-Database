For where your treasure Isaiah , there will your heart be also. This is a conclusion from the former, showing why our Lord said, "Sell that ye have," namely, that you may show that your heart is not in your money but in heaven. If, therefore, you place your treasure gained by alms-giving in heaven, you will show that your heart is fixed in heaven, not on earth—in God, not in gold. For a man"s treasure is that which he loves—holds dear—values at a great price, on which he rests his hopes. See  Matthew 6:20.
