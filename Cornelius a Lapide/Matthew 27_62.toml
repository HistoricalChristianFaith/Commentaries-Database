Now the next day, that followed the day of preparation, the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate. The day of the preparation was the Friday, so called because they then prepared everything needed for the Sabbath, on which day they had to rest. 
But it was the day after, that Isaiah , on the Sabbath, that they came together unto Pilate. Theophylact says, "He names not the Sabbath, for there was no Sabbath (or rest) in the Jews" madness." They raged, indeed, like madmen against Jesus, to abolish utterly His name and memory. And it increased their rage to see Him so honourably buried, as though it were the prelude to His future resurrection, whether it were actually to occur, or would be a mere invention of the disciples.
