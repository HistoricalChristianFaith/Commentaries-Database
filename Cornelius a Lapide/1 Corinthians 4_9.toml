For I think that God hath set forth us, the Apostles, last, as it were appointed to death. (1.) He contrasts himself and the true Apostles with those vain teachers who sought their own glory and their own advantage. I would, he says, that we Apostles were reigning with you; for so far, I think, are we from reigning triumphantly, that God has exhibited us to the world as the last and most despised of all, as though destined to a well-deserved death. (2.) The simpler meaning Isaiah , we are the last to have been sent into the world in these last times. We have been marked out by God for death, as. e.g, by means of wild beasts—not for a kingdom or triumphs, but for death, persecution, and martyrdom. So Tertullian understands it. 
Observe that the Apostles are called last, as comperes with those Prophets that went before them, as Isaiah and Jeremiah and others, who were sent by God as Apostles to the Jews and others (Isa. vi9). Especially does he call himself last of all, as having been called to his Apostleship by Christ ascended, after the other Apostles had been called by Christ living on the earth. 
Moreover, "set forth" denotes (1.) marked out, (2.) made or exhibited, and, as Ephrem terms it, appointed. Cf.  Psalm 60:3 and  Psalm 71:20.  (3.) It denotes put forward publicly as an example to others. Hence it follows—
For we are made a spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and to men. They were placed, as it were, in a theatre, like those condemned to die by fighting with wild beasts before the eyes of the populace. There seems to be as allusion here to the public games of Rome and other places, where men fought with wild beasts in the arena. The world, he says, delights to regard us as fools, dealers in secret arts, or babblers of novelties, or better still, as men condemned to the beasts. 
Observe that "the world" here is a generic name for "angels and men" for they were the only beings to gaze upon the Apostles. Hence, in the Greek, "world" has the article, and the two other terms are without it. We are made, he says, to the good angels an object of compassionate regard, as well as of worthy admiration and honour. But since evil angels and evil men rejoice in our being despised, persecuted, and put to death, we are made a spectacle to evil angels of hatred and rejoicing, as well as of confusion and terror. To good men we are a spectacle and example of fortitude, faith, innocence, patience, meekness, constancy, and holiness of life. So Titelmann. 
S. Chrysostom (Hom12in Moral.) applies thus to the theatre of this life, in which we do everything in the presence of God. Song of Solomon , Suetonius says. S. Augustine, when about to die, said to his friends standing round him, "Have I played my part pretty well on this stage and in the theatre?"—"Very well," his friends replied. Then he rejoined, "Applaud me, therefore, as I take my departure;" and having said this he gave up the ghost. Better and still more appropriate was the use of these words made by Edmund Campian, England"s noble martyr, well named Campianus, a true wrestler and champion of Christ, who, when about to suffer martyrdom, publicly gave out these words as the text of his last sermon. Such a theatrical spectacle was what the Apostles here primarily intends. Cicero says (qu2 , Tuesul.) that there is no fairer sight than that of a virtuous and conscientious life, and so among Christians there is nothing more beautiful than martyrdom. 
The illustrious Paula appositely and piously replied, as S. Jerome says in his eulogy of her, to some caviller who suggested that she might be considered by some insane, because of the fervour of her virtues: "We are made a spectacle unto the world and to angels and to men; we are fools for Christ"s sake; but the foolishness of God is wiser than men. Hence, too, the Saviour said to His Father, "Thou knowest My foolishness!" and again, "I was made as it were a monster unto many, but be Thou My strong helper. I became as a beast before Thee, and I am always with Thee"" 
Lastly, S. Chrysostom (in Ep. ad Rom. Hom17) teaches from this that we ought to fly from eye-service, that Isaiah , from serving the eyes of men, that so we turn our eyes towards the eyes of God, and live perpetually in His sight and before Him. There are, he says, two theatres: one most spacious, where sits the King of kings, surrounded by His shining hosts, to view us; the other most insignificant, where stand a few Ethiopians, i.e, men ignorant of what is going on. It Isaiah , therefore, the height of madness to pass by this mist spacious theatre of God and of the angels, and to be content with the theatre of a few Ethiopians, and laboriously to strive to please them. When you have a theatre erected for you in the heavens, why do you gather together spectators for yourself on earth? S. Bernard (Serm31inter parvos) treats these words somewhat differently, though his application of them is the same. He says: "We are made a spectacle unto the world, to angels and to men, good and bad alike. The passion of envy inflames the one, the compassion born of pity makes the others minister to us continually; the one desires to see our fall, the other our upward flight. We are undoubtedly half-way between heaven and hell, between the cloister and the world. Both consider diligently what we do, both say, "Would that he would join us!" Their intention is different, but their wishes, perhaps, not unlike. But if the eyes of all are thus upon us, whither have our friends gone, or why did they alone go from us? . . . Let us, then, before it is too late, brethren, rise, nor receive in vain our souls for which, whether for good or evil, others so zealously watch."
