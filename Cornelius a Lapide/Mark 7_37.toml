He hath done all things well: Gr. ÎºÎ±Î»Ï‰ÌƒÏ‚, i.e, beautifully, becomingly, harmoniously. Christ did nothing which the Pharisees or such like fault-finders could justly blame. Again, the Heb. for well is heteb, i.e, beneficently, because He gave hearing to the deaf, speech to the dumb. Indeed, Christ"s whole life was one continuous beneficence. (Top)
