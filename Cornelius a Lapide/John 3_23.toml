Now John , &c. Ã†nnon, or Ennon, was a town on the banks of the Jordan, eight miles from Bethshan, which was afterwards, from its occupation by the Scythians, called Seythopolis. Ã†nnon is derived from the Hebrew ain, or an, a well or fountain, because, as it is said, there was much water there. 
Near to Salim. There were two Salims, or Salems; one which was afterwards called Jerusalem, the other near Seythopolis, which was called, in S. Jerome"s time, Salumius, as he tells us in his Locis Hebraicis. Salem means in Hebrew, health, peace, perfection. For these penitents received from John , being transmitted to Christ, who baptized not far from John. There was much water there. From this we may gather that John baptized so as not only to lave the head, for which only a moderate quantity of water was needed, but the whole body.
