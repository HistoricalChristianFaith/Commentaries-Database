When I was a child, that Isaiah , one who is now beginning to say, think, plan, attempt, study, play, and do anything, as our children are wont to do. 
I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. I understood as a child, or felt as a child; for children have not Wisdom of Solomon , but feeling. In other words, when a child I thought, and understood, and felt as a child, but when I became a man I thought and understood as a man does. Song of Solomon , when that which is perfect is come, i.e, perfect wisdom in heaven, partial and imperfect knowledge, as we have it in this life, shall fail; so that we who here are boys in knowledge are to be men in heaven. S. Paul leaves the remaining part of the likeness to be supplied from the verse before.
