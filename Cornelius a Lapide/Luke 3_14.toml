And the soldiers likewise demanded of him, saying, And what shall we do? And he said unto them, Do violence to no Prayer of Manasseh , neither accuse any falsely; and be content with your wages. Soldiers who were serving some of them under Herod Antipas against Aretas, the king of the Arabs, some under the prefect of the Temple, and some under Pilate, the Roman Governor; these men, hearing John thundering against their vices, and threatening them with hell, conscious of rapine and other crimes, which soldiers are wont to commit, becoming, together with the publicans, contrite, at the word of John , seek from him the remedy of penance, of a good life, and of salvation. John , therefore, tacitly gives it to be understood that it is lawful to be a soldier, and that war is lawful, as S. Ambrose teaches (Serm7), and S. Augustine (Contra Faustum, bk. xxii. ch. lxxiv.)
