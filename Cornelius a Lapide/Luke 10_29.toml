But Hebrews , willing to justify himself. To justify himself, i.e. to show himself to be more just than others. "Show me any one who comes nigh me in righteousness, who is as just and upright as I am. Such an one you will scarcely find." So Titus , Euthymius, and Isidore of Pelusium, who think that the lawyer spoke with the pride and arrogance of a Pharisee. 
"He thought," says Isidore, "that the neighbour of a righteous man must be righteous, and the neighbour of an exalted man one of high degree. Show me some one so great as to be worthy to be compared with me." 
But the answer of Christ proved the contrary, as is clear from a consideration of the passage. For when this lawyer heard Christ commend the answer he had given, his purpose changed, and his aversion turned into love and reverence for the Lord. Hence he earnestly asked, Who is my neighbour? that by loving him he might fulfil the law. 
Hence, "willing to justify himself," means that he wished to show his love for that which was right, that he was anxious out of an awakened conscience to understand and learn the law of God, in order that he might fulfil its precepts. Toletus, Jansenius, and others. 
And who is my neighbour? There was much questioning amongst the scribes concerning this, and much error. For because it is written,  Leviticus 19:18, "Thou shalt love thy friend" ( rea), they inferred the contrary, "thou shalt hate thy enemy," i.e, the Gentile, every one not a Jew: an error which Christ corrected, S.  Matthew 5:43. 
Hence the scribes thought that the Jew alone, as a worshipper of the one true God, and, of the same religion and race, could be a friend, or a neighbour, and even of their countrymen only those who were faithful in their observance of the law, were to be loved or to be held in honour. 
Well, therefore, might this lawyer ask, Who is my neighbour? I love all my countrymen who walk uprightly, and regard them as my neighbours, but are there others whom I ought to love? Christ answers that all men are our neighbours, because they partake of the same life, the same grace, the same salvation through Christ, the same sacraments, the same vocation and calling and are journeying with us to the same eternity of happiness. 
Every Prayer of Manasseh , therefore, is our "rea," our friend and our fellow; or in the Greek × ×›×—×£ï¢“×Ÿ×¢, near to us, from × ×•×›×‘×-×© or × ×›ï¢×©, I draw nigh, which is more forcibly rendered in Latin by "proximus," because we are "proximi" next or nearest to each other in a direct sense by virtue of the life we live in common with them, and the blessings which we enjoy. 
But by proximus Cicero and the Latins understood vicinissimus, i.e. neighbour in the strictest sense. Hence Isidore (lib. x. etymol.). We call him the nearest to us, who is next of kin; and Cicero (lib. II De legibus), "Whatever is best, that we must look upon as next or nigh unto God." But now all men are our neighbours by creation, and by their redemption and calling in Christ. 
Figuratively. The word "neighbour" is suggestive of the tenderest affection and love, such as that of brother for brother, or of a son for his father, for no one comes between them, inasmuch as there is no higher relationship; yet there are degrees of this love, for we must love our father more than our brother, and our brother more than any more distant relation, for amongst our nearest of kin one is nearer to us than another, and therefore more to be loved.
