For I am the least of the apostles, that am not meet to be called an apostle. Not only the least and unworthy because of my sins, but not fit for the apostleship; for it is not meet that one who was a persecutor should be a leader and Apostle of the Church. 
Morally, see the humility of S. Paul in calling himself the least; by so doing he was the greatest. S. Bernard (Serm. xiii. an the Canticles) says well: "A great and rare virtue surely is it that you, who work great things, do not know your own greatness; that your holiness, which is evident to all, escapes your own observation; that you seem wonderful to others, despicable to yourself. This, I think, is more wonderful than your very virtues. You surely are a faithful servant, if, of the great glory of God, which passes through you rather than proceeds from you, you let none stick to your hands. Therefore you will hear the blessed words: "Well done, good and faithful servant; because thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make thee ruler over many things.""
