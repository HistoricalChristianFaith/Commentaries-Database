In Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything. Whether you be Jew or Gentile matters nothing; neither brings you nearer Christ. What is of importance is a new creature, i.e, a soul regenerated in baptism, and fortified by grace to walk in newness of life. Cf.  Revelation 3:14, where Christ is called "the beginning of the creation of God," and  Isaiah 9:6, where He is called "the Father of the world that is to be " (Vulg.), for from Him began a new creation. Cf. too Virgil (Ecl. iv8), where Virgil transfers to Salonius, the newly born son of Asinius Pollio, Roman Consul, the predictions by the Cum√¶an Sibyl of the birth of Christ, in which the Christian era is described as a golden age.
