I say unto you, Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend, yet because of his importunity he will rise and give him as many as he needeth. 
Impotunity—Î±Ì‰Î½Î±Î¯Î´ÎµÎ¹Î±Î½, i.e, impudence, used as the Latin word impudens—e.g, labour impudens (i.e. unceasing labour) omnia vincit. 
Here S. Augustine asks, "Why because of his importunity? Because he continued to knock and did not go away because his request was denied him. He who was unwilling to give what his friend had need of, gave at last because the other continued his demands. Much more then will God who in His goodness bids us make known our requests to Him, and is displeased with those who seek Him not, grant our requests." 
God wills that we should continue instant in prayer, and is pleased with our "importunity," for persistent prayer is "violence pleasing to God." Tertullian.
