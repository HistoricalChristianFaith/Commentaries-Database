But if a woman have long hair it is a glory to her. To let the hair grow long is contrary to what becomes Prayer of Manasseh , is the mark of a weak and effeminate mind, unless it is done because of ill-health or intense cold. Hence S. Augustine reproves some monks who wore their hair down to their shoulders, to gain the appearance and reputation of holiness ( Deuteronomy 0p. Monach.).

Hence we get the name of Gallia Comata. Homer, too, frequently speaks of the "long-haired Achæans."
