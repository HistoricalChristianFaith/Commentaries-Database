For the Truth"s sake. He means, I love them in the Truth, because they themselves constantly adhere to the Truth, i.e. to the true faith. And Electa and her daughters showed that they had this true faith, because they showed it in works of love to the brethren. Therefore did S. John love them. "I love them," he means to say, "for the Truth"s sake, because they live a life agreeable to the truth of the Gospel."
