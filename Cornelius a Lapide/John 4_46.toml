A certain nobleman. The Latin translator seems to have had in his Greek copies Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»Î¹ÏƒÎºÎ¿Ï‚, i.e, regulus, a little king. The present reading is Î²Î±ÏƒÎ¹Î»Î¹ÎºÎ¿Ï‚, i.e, royal, understand counsellor, or public minister, of Herod Antipas; a prefect, or intimate friend of his. The Syriac has, a royal servant: S. Chrysostom says, "because he was of the royal race, or discharged some princely function." Nonnus says, "he was a courtier, who was over the army." Origen says, "he was perhaps of the family of Tiberius Cæsar, employed by him in some office of Judea." 
Capharnaum: it is probable that this nobleman"s son lay ill at Capharnaum, because it was his father"s usual place of abode. And his father, hearing that Jesus, who healed so many sick, was come out of Judea into Cana of Galilee, went thither, to ask of Jesus the healing of his son; as is plain from what follows. The nobleman seems to have been a Jew, not a Gentile, as both S. Jerome and Origen think. We may think Song of Solomon , because he had little faith, and for that reason was reproved by Christ; whereas the Gentiles were prompt to believe, and so were praised by Him, as was the case with the centurion, and the woman of Canaan. 
Some, as Irenus, think that this nobleman was the same person as the centurion mentioned in  Matthew 8:5. But they were different persons. For the centurion, when Christ was willing to go to him, asked him to remain where he was. But this nobleman asks Christ to come to his sick son. The former came to Christ as He was descending from the mountain to Capharnaum. The nobleman comes to Jesus as He is going into Cana. The boy of the former was sick with palsy; this one"s child was ill with a fever. Christ was all but present when He healed the former: this He healed being absent. The one was a servant, the other a son. So S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others.
