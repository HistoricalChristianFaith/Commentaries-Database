Hereby we know that we are of the truth, that we have true love, that we are the sons of truth, of true and genuine charity. 
Secondly, we are of God, who is the chief and highest truth, and true charity. See John xiv6 , xviii37. And accordingly S. Augustine rightly concludes (de Moribus Eccl. cap. xxxiii.), "Let our meals, our words, our dress, our appearance be blended with charity, and be united and joined together in one charity; to violate this is counted as sinning against God . . . if only this be wanting, everything else is vain and empty; where it exists is perfect fulness." 
And shall assure our hearts before Him. (1.) Hugo, Lyranus, and Dionysius explain, We shall induce our hearts to please God daily more and more. (2.) Ferus explains it, We shall gain confidence to ask anything of God. (3.) We shall have our hearts at peace, for we shall persuade them that we are striving after true charity, when we love, not in word, but in deed and in truth. (4.) The sense most clearly is this, We, shall approve our hearts to God in manifesting the fruits of love. We can lie to men by pretending love in our hearts, but we cannot lie to God, who sees the heart. They then who love their neighbour in deed and in truth fear not the eye and judgment of God, but would boldly appear in His sight, lay their hearts before Him, and show that they were resting on real charity. So Å’cumenius; and see Gal. i10 , "Do I wish to persuade men or God?" That Isaiah , I strive to prove my cause to God. So S. Chrysostom. S. Augustine reads in this passage, "I wish to make myself approved to God, and not to men." As S. Augustine (contra Secundi, num. i1) says, "Think as you please about Augustine, provided only my conscience accuses me not in the sight of God." 
Morally. S. John here teaches us to examine all our deeds by the rule of God"s judgment. For frequently we are deceived into thinking that we are acting purely from the love of God, when in fact we are acting from the impure motive of self-love. Before beginning anything conform thyself to this rule, act as in the sight of God, who sees, and will call thee to account. Do it as though it were thy very last act. And in any doubt, adopt that course which thou wouldest wish thou hadst adopted when thou comest to die. So did the Psalmist ( Psalm 16:8); Elisha (  2 Kings 3:14); and S. Paul ( 2 Corinthians 1:12). 
And S. Francis Xavier, "Wherever I Amos , I would remember that I am on the stage of the world." And Campion, when about to suffer martyrdom, said, "We are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men" (1Cor iv9). Let us imitate these, and thus "shall we persuade our hearts in His sight."
