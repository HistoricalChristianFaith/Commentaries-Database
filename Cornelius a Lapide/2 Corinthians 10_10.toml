For his letters, say they, are weighty and powerful. My detractors, the false apostles, say that my letters are hard and bitter, severe and threatening, but my appearance is mean, contemptible, and puny. Nicephorus (lib. ii. c37) thus describes the stature and form of S. Paul from tradition and early representations. "Paul was small of stature, spare in form, round-shouldered, and somewhat inclined to stoop. His face was pale, and showed the marks of years. His head was small, and his eyes shone with a pleasant light. He had bushy eyebrows, a nose beautifully curved and somewhat long, and a thick and long beard, which, like his hair, was plentifully interspersed with white." S. Chrysostom (Hom. de Princip. Apost.) says that "Paul was but three cubits high, and yet he touched the heavens." Lucian again, in his Philopater, laughs at Paul for having a head bald in front. 
And his speech contemptible. Unlearned, inelegant, unadorned. Cf.  1 Corinthians 2:1-2.
