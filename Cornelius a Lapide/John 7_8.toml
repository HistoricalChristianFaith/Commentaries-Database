Go ye up unto this feast. For ye have no danger to fear (says Euthymius). 
But I go not up yet to this feast. I am waiting for the anger of the Scribes to subside. For they are looking out for Me to kill Me at the beginning of the feast, but after three days I shall come up secretly and with less danger by myself. For it is clear from verse10 that He came up a little while after. It is probable that Christ said, as the Vulgate reads, "I go not up," for had he said, "I go not up yet," his kinsmen would have proposed to wait for Him. But Christ"s meaning was, I go not up yet, though He did not say so to His kinsmen, to relieve their vexation. Secondly, S. Augustine and Cyril explain "I go not up on this first day of the Feast, but afterwards on the fourth day." But the truer view is that He determined to go up on the first day ( John 7:14). Maldonatus explains, "I go not up as ye wish and suppose, as a mere man to be honoured and followed by the people. But I shall soon go up thither as the Messiah and Son of God to teach them the way of salvation, and thus seek to extend His glory and not My own. But this seems somewhat forced.
