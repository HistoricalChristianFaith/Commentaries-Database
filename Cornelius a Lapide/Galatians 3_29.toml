If ye be Christ"s. Ifyou are members of the Head, and are the mystical body of its Spirit, then, as Christ Isaiah , so are ye Abraham"s seed, and hence inheritors of the righteousness promised to Abraham. Accordingly, Ambrose reads here: "If ye are one in Christ, then are ye Abraham"s seed," which gives the meaning very clearly.
