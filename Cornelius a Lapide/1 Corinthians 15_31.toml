I die daily. I.e, I expose myself every day to danger of death, on behalf of the Gospel and the conversion of the Gentiles.
By your rejoicing. That Isaiah , I die daily for the sake of the glory which awaits you in heaven, in order that I may win it for you; or, better still, as your father and Apostle, I swear, and call God to witness, by your glory, i.e, by the glorying with which I glory over you as my children in Christ, that I die daily, and expose myself to death in hope of the resurrection. Hence S. Augustine ( Ephesians 89) proves the lawfulness of oaths. [Cornelius  Lapide follows the Latin Version, which gives glory where the A. V. has rejoicing.] 
Which I have in Christ. This Isaiah , according to Anselm, the future glory which, in reliance on Christ, I hope that you will have, or, better, the glory or glorying which I have, i.e, with which I glory in Christ; for I glory that by the merits of Christ I have obtained it. Gagneius and Photius explain the phrase differently, and make it a protestation rather than an oath, and read it, "I die daily because of your" (or, according to some Greek writers, "our") "glorying;" i.e, that I am able to boast of you as having been converted and won to Christ by my efforts. 
Take notice that the Apostle here proves the resurrection of the body from the immortality of the soul alone, because these two things are naturally connected, and because men doubted then not so much the resurrection in itself as the immortality of the soul; so that if any one should prove to them the immortality of the soul, they would at once admit the resurrection. So S. Thomas.
