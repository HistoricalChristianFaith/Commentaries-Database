But I receive not, &c. I do not require the witness of John , for I am God, and the Son of God, to whom John , Moses, and the Prophets ought to yield, and be taught by, and receive authority from. 
But this I say that ye may be saved: meaning, as S. Chrysostom says, "I do not need the testimony of Prayer of Manasseh , for I am God. But since John , whom ye admire as a prophet, is of so great authority with you, when ye do not believe Me working miracles, I bring back to your remembrance his testimony, that I may draw you and save you."
