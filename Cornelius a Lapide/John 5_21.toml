For as the Father &c. Behold here is the first greater work which Christ said the Father would show, that Isaiah , communicate, to the Son. As S. Cyril says, "Marvel not that one who was utterly weakened by long disease was strengthened by a word, and took up his bed, and went away, for I am about altogether to destroy death, and to judge the whole world." 
So also the Song of Solomon , &c. He tacitly signifies that He is God, equal to the Father in power and liberty to raise and quicken whom He will. 
Whom He will. It is not that the Father wills to quicken some, and the Son wills to quicken others, but the same, because His will is conformable, yea, the same as the will of the Father. So Augustine. 
Quickeneth, i.e, raiseth from the dead, both in this life, as He raised Lazarus, and in the day of judgment, when He will raise all mankind.
