There was a certain rich man. You ask, Is this a parable or a true history? I answer, A history! 
1. Because Christ does not call it a parable. 
2. Because the poor man is named Lazarus, and the rich Prayer of Manasseh , according to a Hebrew tradition quoted by Euthymius, is called a native of Nice. 
3. Because the torments of the rich man are related as an actual reality. 
4. Because in memory of Lazarus many hospitals for those suffering from leprosy and such like diseases are called by his name. 
5. Because with the exception of Justin, Theophylact, and Eucherius, all the Fathers are of my opinion. 
Euthymius infers from the mention made of Abraham and Moses in verses24,31 , that this rich man was a Jew, and mentions a Hebrew tradition to the effect that he was living in the time of Christ, who gave his history as that of a well-known Prayer of Manasseh , in order the more to impress his hearers, and to teach them to despise the good things of this present life. 
Was clothed in purple and in fine linen. The one denoting luxury and pride, and other softness and effeminacy. There are some, says S. Gregory, who do not think that extravagance in apparel is a sin. But if it were not Song of Solomon , the Word of God would not have so directly stated that Dives, who was tormented in hell, had been clothed in purple and fine linen. No one seeks fine clothing but out of vainglory, in order to appear better than his fellow-men. 
And fared sumptuously every day. The Greek ÎµÏ…Ì‰Ï†Î¶Î±Î¹Î½ÏŒÎ¼ÎµÎ½Î¿Ï‚ signifies both gladness and feasting. So Dives, not content with the richness of his banquet, sought to add to the pleasures of the feast the delights of music, dancing, and whatever else could add to his enjoyment. Forgetful of the future, perhaps not believing that there was any future at all, he lived without God, a follower of him who bids men "eat, drink, and enjoy themselves, for death makes an end of all delights." He lived as they live who "take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of the organ. They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to the grave" ( Job 21:12-13). 
Hence S. Gregory teaches that we cannot indulge in revelling without sin. For when the body is given up to the enjoyment of the feast, the heart is led away to empty rejoicing. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play" ( Exodus 32:6). 
Conversation generally follows after a feast, for when the appetite is satisfied, the tongue is let loose. Hence Dives is fitly described as desiring water to cool his tongue, for feasting ministers to gluttony, wantonness, pride, evil speaking, envy, and many other vices.
