And yet if I judge (i.e, bear witness of Myself) My judgment (i.e, witness) is true, i.e, fit to be taken in court, for I am not alone, &c. S. Chrysostom explains, "If I Judges , I should justly condemn you, because I should not judge by Myself, but I and the Father together." But the true meaning is that given in  John 8:15. 
I and the Father that sent Me. "For I took the form of a servant, but lost not the form of God," says S. Augustine; "Thy Incarnation was Thy mission." And the Interlinear Gloss, "Though I am a Prayer of Manasseh , yet I left not the Father; though sent in the flesh, yet I and the Father are ever One by Our Godhead; the judgment of both and the will of both are alike One." As He says elsewhere, "I do nothing of Myself," for I have never proceeded to any punishment, which was not in the mind of the Father. "For whatever thoughts the nature of the Father entertains, the same are completed in Me also, for I shine forth from His bosom, and am the true offspring of His substance," says S. Cyril.
