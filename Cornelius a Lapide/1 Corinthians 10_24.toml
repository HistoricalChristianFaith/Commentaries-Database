Let no man seek his own, but every man another"s wealth. Let no one seek or buy flesh which, e.g, has been offered too idols, and which is useful and pleasant to himself, just because it is of a low price; but in such matters let each one seek his neighbour"s edification, and not to buy it or eat it, so as o cause him offence or spiritual loss. So Theophylact.
