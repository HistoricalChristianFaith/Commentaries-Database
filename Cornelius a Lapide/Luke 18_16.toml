Suffer the little children to come unto Me. The Arabic: For the kingdom of God is theirs who are like them"â€”not in infancy but in innocence, simplicity, humility. So Bede. "He does not say theirs, but such as they, meaning their manner of life, not their age." And S. Ambrose: "It is not childhood, but the goodness of that simplicity which emulates child-like innocence, that is meant; for it is not a virtue not to be able to sin, but not to will to do so." I have explained the rest on  Matthew 19:13 and following.
