For she said, If I shall touch but His garment, I shall be whole. Matthew ( Matthew 9:20), instead of garment, has the hem of His garment. This hem was a fringe of threads attached to the bottom of the robe, of a hyacinth or violet colour, which God commanded the Jews to wear, that it might put them continually in mind of God"s precepts and of heaven itself. This Christ wore, according to the law, as a mark that He belonged to the Jewish race and religion. 
There is here an example and proof of the use and efficacy of holy relics. For of such a nature was the hem or fringe of Christ which healed her that had the issue of blood. Calvin replies that the woman was superstitious, and that a certain amount of superstition was mingled with what she did. But Christ and Mark refute this; for they ascribe her healing not to superstition, but to her faith, and commend her for it. For in the30th verse it is said, And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that virtue was gone out from Him (de illo), i.e, from (de) His fringe. And34 , Daughter, thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace. Rightly says S. Hilary, "Like as the Author of nature has given to a magnet the power of attracting iron, so did Christ give to His garment the power of healing her who touched in faith." And if it were so with a garment, how much more with the Eucharist? Hence S. Gorgonia was healed of a severe disease by touching the Eucharist. (See Nazianzen, Orat11.) Song of Solomon , too, was S. Catherine of Sienna, and many others. (See Salmeron, tom6 , tract15.) 
Tropologically: The issue of blood, says Bede, is fleshly delight, as gluttony, luxury. The most pure flesh of Christ heals these when piously received in the Eucharist.
