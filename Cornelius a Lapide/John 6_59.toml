This is the bread, &c. He intimates the same thing which I have said at the end of the foregoing verse. For Christ came down from heaven not as Prayer of Manasseh , but as God. Wherefore he who eateth Him in the Eucharist shall live for ever, because in truth he eateth God and the Godhead, which being ever present with him who eateth, continually breathes into him His own life. Hear S. Ambrose (Serm18 in Ps. cxviii.), "How shall he die whose food is Life?" And presently, describing its wonderful effects, "Draw nigh unto Him, and be filled, for He is Bread. Draw nigh unto Him, and drink, for He is a Fountain. Draw nigh unto Him, and be enlightened, for He is Light. Draw nigh unto Him, and be free, for where the Spirit of the Lord Isaiah , there is liberty. Draw nigh unto Him, and be absolved; for He is remission of sins." And S. Bernard (Serm. de CÃ¦na. Dom.) says, "Two things that Sacrament worketh in you: it diminishes the sense (of sin) in the least matters, and in graver sins it wholly takes away consent." And again he says, "If any of you feel neither so frequently nor so severely the motions of anger, envy, lust, and such like passions, give thanks to the Body and Blood of the Lord, forasmuch as the virtue of the Sacrament worketh in you." And S. Chrysostom on  Psalm 22:5 (Vulg.), saith upon the words, "Thou hast prepared a table before me, against them that trouble me," "Let those who have trouble of the flesh come to the table of the Mighty One, and tribulation shall be turned into consolation." Lastly, S. Cyril says, "The body of Christ quickens, and by our participation of it restores us to incorruption. For it is the body of none other than of the Life itself. It retains the virtue of the Word Incarnate, and is full of the power of Him by whom all things live and have their being."
