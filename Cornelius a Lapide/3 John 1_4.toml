Greater grace than these I have none. (Vulgate.) That Isaiah , nothing can be more grateful or pleasing to me than that they so act that I may hear they are walking in the truth that I have spoken of. Instead of Ï‡Î¬Î¶Î¹Î½, grace, some Greek MSS. read Ï‡Î¬Î¶Î±Î½, joy. This is followed by the Syriac. S. Jerome on the5th chapter to the Ephesians mentions that celebrated axiom of Christ, "Never be joyful except when ye shall see a brother in charity."
