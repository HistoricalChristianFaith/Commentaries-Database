And it came to pass when the time was come (i.e. was drawing nigh) that He should be received up. The time when, after having fulfilled His earthly ministry, He was to return again to the Father. The day foreordained of God when He was to be taken up into heaven. Euthymius. Up to this time Christ had, for two years and a half, been preaching the Gospel everywhere, but chiefly in the towns and villages of Galilee. There yet remained to Him six months of life. He therefore now set forth to preach more particularly to the inhabitants of the holy city and Judæa, in order to prepare for His passion in Jerusalem and resurrection from the dead. S. Luke therefore implies that hitherto he had written of those things which Christ had done in Galilee, but was henceforward about to tell of what was done in Judæa. 
He stedfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem. With a firm and undismayed mind. Bede. Christ turned not aside, as timid and hesitating people are wont to do, but went direct to Jerusalem, eager for the dread encounter. Titus , Theophylact, and others. 
"For," says Jerome, "He who of His own will was hastening to His passion, needed both fortitude and firmness." 
Thus it behoves us also to nerve our hearts, after the example of the martyrs, to endure hardship, like the lions described by Pliny, who tells us that, "when a lioness fights for her young, she keeps her eyes fixed on the ground, that she may not be terrified by the sight of the hunters." 
S. Mark adds, ( Matthew 10:32, "and Jesus went before them: and they were amazed;" because they saw Him cheerfully and with a good courage going up to suffer and to die, and "as they followed, they were afraid" lest they might be called upon to die with Him. 
It seems clear, as I have said in my chronological table, that this journey of Christ from Galilee to Juda, is the same as that mentioned by S.  Matthew 19:1; by S.  Mark 10:32; and S.  John 7:2 and  John 7:14. 
From the latter Evangelist it is apparent that the journey was undertaken at the time of the feast of tabernacles, which falls in the September of our year, and since Christ suffered in the following March, it follows that the events here recorded happened about six months before the crucifixion. It is also evident, from what is recorded by S. Luke in the subsequent chapters, that during this period Christ often went to Jerusalem, and returned thence through Juda, preaching and working miracles, as He had before done in Galilee; but we must bear in mind that S. Luke at times interrupts his narrative to recapitulate certain things which had happened before our Lord had come to Juda. Jansenius, Francis Lucas, and others. 
On the other hand, Maldonatus places this journey a year before the death of our Lord, and is of opinion that Christ returned again to Galilee, and only went up to Jerusalem to suffer and to die. But this explanation does not agree with the words of the fifty-first verse, "when the time was come that He should be received up"—words which would not have been written if the time had been a year distant.
