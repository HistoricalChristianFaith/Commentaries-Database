The thieves also which were crucified with Him uttered against Him the like reproach. The Greek Fathers, and S. Hilary among the Latins, think it probable that both the thieves blasphemed Christ at first, but that one of them afterwards repented. But the Latin Fathers consider that the plural is here, by synecdoche, put for the singular. "Thieves," i.e, "one of the thieves" (as  Luke 23:36, "the soldiers," meaning one of them); S. Matthew wishing by the word thieves to point out not so much the persons of the thieves, as the condition of those who insulted Christ; all vying in insulting Him, even the thief at His side. S.  Luke 23:40 gives the story of the other thief (see Comment. in loc.).
Here comes in the third word on the Cross, "Woman, behold thy Song of Solomon ," &c. (see  John 19:26, and the notes thereon).
