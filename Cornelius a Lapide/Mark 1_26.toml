And the unclean spirit tearing him, &c. Tearing (Vulg. discerpens), not by lacerating or mutilating the man who was possessed by him, for Luke says ( Luke 4:35) that he did no harm to him, but by contorting and twisting his limbs this way and that, as if he wished to tear him piecemeal. For the Greek ×£× ×‘×¡ï¢×¤×¤×©, signifies to pull or tear in pieces. The devil did this through rage and madness, that being compelled by Christ to go out of the Prayer of Manasseh , he might injure him as much as he could. But the nearer and the more powerful the grace of Christ Isaiah , the more impotently does the devil rage. For, observe, the devil only raised a dreadful tempest, but one that was vain and ineffectual. For he cannot hurt when Christ forbids. Christ permitted it for three reasons1. That it might be plain that this man was really possessed by the devil2. That the malice and wrath of the demon might be made apparent3. That it might be clear that the demon went forth, not of his own will, but because he was compelled to do so by Christ. 
Tropologically: S. Gregory teaches (Hom12 , in Ezek.) that the devil wonderfully tempts and vexes sinners when they are converted. "As soon," he says, "as the mind begins to love heavenly things, as soon as it collects itself for the vision of inward peace with its whole intention, that ancient adversary, who fell from heaven, is envious, and begins to lie in wait more insidiously, and brings to bear sharper temptations than he was wont, so as, for the most part, to try the soul which resists in a way that he had never tried her when he possessed her. Wherefore it is written, My Song of Solomon , if thou come to serve the Lord, stand fast in justice and fear, and prepare thy soul for temptation." 
And crying out. With dreadful howlings, shrieking, and roaring, to show how unwillingly he went out, and what great power was applied to him by Christ. For he uttered no articulate speech. For Christ had forbidden him to speak when He said shut thy mouth. Thus Euthymius says, "Being scourged by the Lord"s commands, he cried out with a loud voice, and yet he spake not when he cried, because he uttered cries which signified nothing." Titus adds, "When the man was restored to himself, then he uttered the speech of a man."
