Awake to righteousness and sin not. Awake from sin to be righteous. The Greek copies give "awake righteously;" Ephrem, "Stir up your hearts righteously." Sin not, because some know not that God can call the dead to life. 
I speak this to your shame. It is a shame for a Christian to have any doubt about the resurrection or the power of God.
