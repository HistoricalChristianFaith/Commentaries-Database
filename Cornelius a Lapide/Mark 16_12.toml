He appeared in another shape: Arabic, garment, i.e, of a traveller, as they were going into the country: Arabic, to the village; Gr. into the field, i.e, to a country-house at Emmaus. For, as S. Austin says (Consens. Evang.), "under the name of country not only villages, but towns and boroughs outside the capital, which was the mother city of all, were wont to be called." These disciples, therefore, were going from Jerusalem into the country, that Isaiah , into the neighbouring small town of Emmaus. This place was made a famous city by the Romans , and called Nicopolis, as a monument of their victory in the capture of Jerusalem. This appearance of Christ is the same as that related by S. Luke ( Luke 24:13), as is plain from the circumstances, which are the same in both cases. So commentators generally. Euthymius alone thinks they were different, because Mark adds that the Apostles did not believe them when they told them that Christ was risen, whilst Luke intimates the contrary, that they did believe. But the answer is easy, that some believed, but others did not believe.
