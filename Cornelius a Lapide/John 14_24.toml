He that loveth Me not, &c. The reason then why any one does not keep God"s commandments is because he loveth not God. 
And the word which ye have heard is not Mine, &c. Listen to S. Augustine, "He said that the word was not His, but the Father"s, intending Himself to be understood, who is the Word, the Image and the Son of the Father. Rightly does He attribute to the Originator what the equal does, from whom the equal has that He is an equal."
