And when He had so said, He showed them His hands and His side. It is clear from this verse (and still more clearly from ver27) that Christ after His Resurrection retained not only the scars, but even the very holes, of His wounds, and that really and not in appearance. So S. Augustine teaches in answer to Porphyrius (Epist. xlix. [al cii.] ad Deogratias). He did not fill them up with His glorified flesh, but left them open, in order that they might be incontrovertible proofs of the truth of His Body, and of Its Resurrection. So S. Cyril and Leontius. S. Augustine says (in loc.), "The nails had wounded His hands, the spear had pierced His side, and the marks of the wounds were left, to heal the hearts of the doubtful." 2. This was a sign of His victory over sin, the world, the flesh, and the devil. So S. Augustine and S. Ambrose in Luke (cap. ult.) 3. To inspire us with greater confidence, inasmuch as Christ, by displaying these wounds to the Father, intercedes for us. See S. Anselm on Hebrews 9 and [Pseudo]-Cyprian, de Baptismo Christi4. To enkindle our love, and to lead us in return willingly to bear even death itself for His sake. So S. Ambrose (ut supra), and S. Gregory in  Song of Solomon 3:5. That Christ might in the day of judgment convict Jews and reprobates of impiety and ingratitude, in neglecting such great grace. So S. Augustine. All theologians teach us (as well as S. Cyril, xii58) that Christ carried these wounds into heaven, and will retain them for ever. See  Zechariah 13:6,  John 19:37. It was miraculously so ordered by God that these wounds interfered not with the actions and motions of His Body. (See Suarez, iii. part, Qu√¶st. xliv, Disput. xlvii. art4 , sect2.) 
S. Augustine accordingly thinks (de civ. xxii20) that it will be thus with the wounds of the martyrs. He thus writes, "Are we so inspired with love for the martyrs as to wish to behold in their bodies the scars of the wounds which they suffered for Christ? And it may be we shall see them. For this will not be a deformity, but an honour; and even though some of their limbs have been cut off, yet will they not appear without them at the resurrection. For it was said to them, "Not a hair of your head shall perish."" He adds, and "these proofs of their virtue must not be counted as defects." 
S. Cyril (ut supra) seems to deny this; but he is not speaking of martyrs, but of those who have some natural defect, as those who are blind, deaf, &c. These will rise again with all their faculties. 
Then were the disciples glad when they saw the Lord, and recognised Him by His wounds. S. Augustine (de Civ. xxii19) says, "The brightness with which the righteous will shine as the sun, seems to have rather been veiled in Christ"s person than wanting. For man"s feeble sight could not have endured it, when steadily looking at Him, in order to recognise Him." 
They were glad, not only because they saw that Christ was risen, but also because they hoped that all His gracious promises would now be made good.
