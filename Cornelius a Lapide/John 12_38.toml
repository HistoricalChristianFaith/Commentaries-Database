That the saying of Esaias, &c. The word "that" does not signify the end and purpose intended by God, but simply the result. The fulfilment of the prophecy resulted from the unbelief of the Jews. So S. Chrysostom, Cyril, and others. 
The passage quoted is  Isaiah 53:1, on which see a full comment. 
Our report. Our hearing, the Hebrew word scemaa, hearing, being put for that which was heard by an ordinary Hebraism. 
The arm of the Lord. That is Christ. (1.) So called as being "of one Substance with the Father," as the arm is of the same substance as the body. (2.) Because Christ, as God, is the "arm" of the Father, His virtue and strength, whereby He works all things mightily. (3.) Because as man He performed, in the flesh, the mighty and powerful works of God. (So S. Augustine, Maldonatus, and others, on this passage; and S. Jerome on Is. liii. and S. Athanasius, "De communi essentia Patris et Filii et S . Sancti opus dubium.") But it may be more simply understood of the Divine power which manifested itself in Christ"s miracles. The meaning being, How few Jews recognised the power of God, working as it did in Christ"s Person so many and great miracles. So Jansenius and Maldonatus.
