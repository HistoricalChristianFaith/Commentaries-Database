And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there. Christ therefore declaring his death, showed that He knew it not in a human manner, but in a Divine. For how, says Augustine, should the thing be hidden from Him who had created the man who was dying? and into whose hands his soul had gone forth? Nevertheless let us go unto him. Christ speaks of the dead as though he were living, because He was about to make him Song of Solomon , by raising him from the dead. So Cyril.
