The neighbours therefore, &c, and they that saw him, that he was a beggar, &c. (Vulg.) "The greatness of the deed brought about incredulity," says S. Chrysostom. "And the opening of the eyes had changed the appearance of the blind Prayer of Manasseh ," says S. Augustine, "so that looking on him they doubted whether he who saw was the one who aforetime was blind; but carefully watching him as he walked along the long way, they acknowledged him to be the same, and that it could not be denied." So S. Chrysostom. 
The wondrous mercy of God healed most carefully those who were beggars, counting those who were mean of birth to be worthy of His providential care; for He came for the healing of all. Thus many poor people and of slender means obtain of the Blessed Virgin miracles of healing, at her shrines at Loretto and Sichem, both because they are in greater need than the rich, and are more innocent in their lives, also exhibit greater faith and devotion, and because she specially cares for them, as being destitute; just as it is said, "The poor committeth himself to Thee [is left to Thy care]; Thou art the helper of the orphan" ( Psalm 10:14).
