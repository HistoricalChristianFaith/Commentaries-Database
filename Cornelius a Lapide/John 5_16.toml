Wherefore the Jews persecuted Jesus, &c. Some Greek MS, also the Syriac and Arabic Versions, add, And sought to kill Him. Wherefore, i.e, on this pretext, for the true cause was envy. For the Jews, especially the scribes and Pharisees, were envious at this glory of Jesus, and grieved that the people should prefer Him to themselves. They were indignant that their wickedness was reproved by Him, and condemned by His holiness. For they wished to be paid court to as Rabbis, and doctors of the Law, and oracles of wisdom and sanctity.
