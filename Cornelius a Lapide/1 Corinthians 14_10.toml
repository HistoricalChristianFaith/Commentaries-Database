There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification. As a matter of fact, or for example, there are many different languages: no nation is without its language, no language without its meaning. Others, as Å’cumenius, refer the none to the instrument, and say that no pipe or harp but has its proper sound; others, more generally, no object is without its voice. As Ausonius sings to Paulinus:—
"No creature silent Isaiah , nor winged bird, 
Nor beast that walks the earth, nor hissing snake: 
The cymbals smitten sound, the stage when struck 
By dancers" feet, the drum its echo gives." 
The best meaning, however, is that no tongue is void of meaning.
