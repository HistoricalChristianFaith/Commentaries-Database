And when they heard, they marvelled, &c. They marvelled at the wisdom of Christ, who thus easily extricated Himself from the snare which to the Pharisees seemed so impossible of escape, and twisted it round their own necks, who had laid it, according to the words of the Psalm , "In their own net which they laid privily is their foot taken." And again it is said ( Proverbs 21:30), "There is neither Wisdom of Solomon , nor prudence, nor counsel against the Lord."
