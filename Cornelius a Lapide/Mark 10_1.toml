Christ disputeth with the Pharisees touching divorcement: 13blesseth the children that are brought unto him: 17 resolveth a rich man how he may inherit life everlasting: 23telleth his disciples of the danger of riches: 28 promiseth rewards to them that forsake anything for the gospel: 32foretelleth his death and resurrection: 35 biddeth the two ambitious suitors to think rather of suffering with him: 46 and restoreth to Bartimus his sight.
