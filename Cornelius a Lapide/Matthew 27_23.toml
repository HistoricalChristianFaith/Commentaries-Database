The Governor said, Why, what evil hath He done? But they cried out the more (vehemently, Ï€ÎµÎ¶Î¹ÏƒÏƒÏ‰ÌƒÏ‚), saying, Let Him be crucified. The more Pilate insisted on His innocence, the more did they clamour for His crucifixion, "not laying aside their anger, hatred, and blasphemy, but even adding to them" (Origen). They thus fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 12:11), "Mine heritage (the synagogue) is made unto Me as a lion in the forest; they have uttered their voice against Me;" and David"s ( Psalm 22:13), "They opened their mouth upon Me, as a ravening and a roaring lion;" and Isaiah"s ( Isaiah 5:7), "I looked for judgment, and behold iniquity; and for righteousness, and behold a cry." (So S. Jerome.)
