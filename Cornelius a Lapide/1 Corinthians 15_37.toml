Thou sowest not that body that shall be. When you sow you do not sow the body which will rise from the seed, as, e.g, a tree or an ear, but bare seed, of apple, or of wheat, &c, and yet God gives to this seed sown, when it spring from the earth, not any other seed, but a complete and beautiful body, e.g, of a tree or of an ear, which is beautifully composed of its own stalk, beard, blossoms, and grains. Hence S. Augustine says ( Ephesians 146) that the Apostle implies, "if God can add to the new seed something it had not before, much more can He at the resurrection restore man"s body."
