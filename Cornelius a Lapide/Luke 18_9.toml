And He spake also this parable unto certain that trusted in themselves. Which, however, might truly happen, nay often has happened, so that it may be historical. The introduction to the parable shows its scope and the design of its introduction, namely, to rebuke the supremacy of the Pharisees, and their boasting and contempt of other men. 
In the former parable Christ taught one condition of prayer-perseverance. In this He teaches anotherâ€”humility, for the humble prayer is heard by God, the proud one is rejected, as Ecclus. xxxv21. See what has been said thereon. The Fathers thus connect these words with the preceding verse, that is with faith. S. Augustine (Serm. xxxvi.), on the words of the Lord that faith is not of the proud but of the humble, says, "Christ subjoins a parable on humility as opposed to pride:" Theophylact, "Because pride more than other feelings vexes the minds of men, He very frequently speaks of it." The Gloss, "That no one, from what has been said, may flatter himself on his knowledge, or his confession of faith," Christ shows that our works, and not our professions, will be judged by God, and amongst these He chiefly notes humility.
