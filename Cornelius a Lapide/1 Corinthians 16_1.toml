Now concerning the collection for the saints. The saints here meant were the poor Christians living at Jerusalem. Cf. ver3and  Romans 15:26. For the Christians at Jerusalem, as appears from Heb. x34 , were robbed of their goods and grievously harassed by their fellow-countrymen, who were the most bitter foes of Christ. Hence an injunction was given to S. Paul in the Council of Jerusalem to be as mindful of the poor Jews as of the Gentiles ( Galatians 2:10). He orders, therefore, that alms be regularly collected for them; and this practice lasted till the time of Theodosius. Cf2Cor8
