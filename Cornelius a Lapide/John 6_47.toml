Verily, verily, &c. Hath, by right and merit, or in certain hope, but not yet in fact. Christ goes back to verse29 , and again and again inculcates faith in Himself, because that is the beginning of all good: the root of salvation, and the necessary means for obtaining from Christ the Bread of Life, i.e, the Eucharist. 
Eternal life: thus He impels those unwilling to faith by a firm hope of the reward. For what is better or sweeter than eternal life to those who fear death and corruption?
