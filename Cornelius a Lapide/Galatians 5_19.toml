The works of the flesh are manifest. The works that spring from the flesh, i.e, from concupiscence, as I said in the note to ver17. 
Fornication. On the works of the flesh in detail, see Jerome, Anselm, and S. Thomas. 
Uncleanness. Effeminacy. The effeminate are guilty of mutual pollution, contrary to the instincts of nature. 
Lasciviousness. Any wanton, and, according to Jerome, extraordinary form of lust. He adds: "The works of the married even, if not done with delicacy and modesty, as in the sight of God, and if merely for the procreation of children, come under the Apostle"s description of uncleanness and lasciviousness." This, of course, must be understood of mortal sin; cf, e.g, the act of matrimony is performed otherwise than nature dictates, or if its consummation is purposely prevented; for then both are guilty of mortal sin, excluding them from the Kingdom of heaven. Otherwise lust in the married is only venial.
