And he said, He that showed mercy on him. Then said Jesus unto him, Go, and do thou likewise. Hereby we understand, says S. Augustine, "that he is our neighbour to whomsoever we must show compassion, if he need it, and would have shown it if he had needed it." Hence it follows that even he who must in turn show us this duty is our neighbour. For the name of neighbour relates to something else, nor can any one be a neighbour except to a neighbour. 
Hence it is clear that to no one, not even to our enemy, is mercy to be denied. And S. Augustine very appositely adds, "What more remote than God from men? For God possesses two perfections, righteousness and immortality. But man two evils, sin and death. God was made Prayer of Manasseh , and so like unto us, yet not like us, for He was without sin, and by bearing the punishment, but not the guilt of sin, He abolished both the guilt and the punishment." 
Isidore of Pelusium assigns the cause. Relationship is reckoned according to nature, not virtue; in essence, not by worth; by compassion, not by place; by the manner of treatment, not by neighbourhood. For we must account him as a neighbour who is most in need of our aid, and be willing at once to render him help.
