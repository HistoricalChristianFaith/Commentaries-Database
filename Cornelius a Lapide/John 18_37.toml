Thou sayest that I am a King, i.e, I am in truth the King of the Jews, to rule in the faithful by faith and grace, and bring them to My heavenly Kingdom. 
To this end was I born, and for this cause I came into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. To evangelical truth, which mainly consists in these things—(1.) In the true knowledge of God, namely, that He is One in Essence, and threefold in Person. 
For every being is true, that is a true and not an imaginary thing, and is true in itself. Wherefore God, who is Very Being (I am that I am) is also truth, and good itself. Because His essential Being is Truth and Goodness. Again, the Son who proceedeth from the Father, as His Word, is Truth Itself, not merely of existence but of mind. Whence S. Augustine says, when Jesus bears witness to the truth, He bears witness to Himself, for He Himself is truth. 
(2.) In the knowledge of the Incarnation; namely, to know that the Son was sent into the world in the flesh, that He might save the world, and that no one can be saved, except by faith in Him (see John xvii3). 
(3.) In the knowledge of true blessedness: viz, that it consists not in wealth, honours, &c, but in the kingdom of heaven, i.e. in the vision and possession of God. For the sum of Christ"s preaching was, "Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand" ( Matthew 3:2). 
Christ says that He was born to bear witness to the Truth. (1.) To keep Pilate from wondering that He owned Himself to be a King, for it was but speaking the truth. (2.) That Pilate might learn the innocence and candour of Jesus; for in this truth consists. (3.) To remind him of the justice with which he ought to decide His cause, and that he should not be so moved by the false charges and clamours of the Chief Priests, so as to condemn Him against truth and justice. 
Every one that is of the truth heareth My voice. Those, i.e, who are studious and desirous of the truth; who earnestly and with their whole heart seek the Truth, i.e, the true God and the true Messiah, true happiness and salvation. And who when they have found it embrace it before all things beside. They are opposed to those who are "of contention" (Rom. ii8), who, like the philosophers of that time, are ever striving to contend, dispute, and argue. To be, then, "of the truth" is the same as being "of God." For the Son of God is the Son of the Truth; for God is truth, according to  John 8:47, "He that is of God heareth God"s words. Ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God." Because, though ye are "of God" by creation, yet ye are not "of Him" by election, faith, and grace. "He commended," says S. Augustine (in loc.) "that grace which calls according to His purpose." For he that hath received his testimony (the testimony of the Baptist) "hath set to his seal that God is true" ( John 3:33). And how true it Isaiah , is shown by the statements of enemies. For Josephus (Antiq. xiv8) writes, "At that time lived a wise man called Jesus, if indeed it is allowable to call Him a Prayer of Manasseh , for He performed wonderful works, and taught those who willingly received the truth." 
Christ tacitly answers Pilate"s objection, viz. "If Thou bearest witness to the truth, why do the Scribes and Pharisees, who profess the truth, hear Thee not—nay more, persecute Thee even to the death?" He answers, "Because they themselves are not of the truth, but of a lie. For they follow the false opinions of wealth, honours, &c, which the devil suggests to them." See  John 8:44.
