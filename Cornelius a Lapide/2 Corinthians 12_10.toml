Therefore I take pleasure in infirmities. Not because they are desirable in themselves, but in so far as through them the power of Christ is perfected. He then goes on, as I said before, to mention what is included under the generic term infirmity. 
For when I am weak then am I strong. When I am afflicted then do I gain strength by the power of God"s grace, long-suffering, fortitude, humility, and hope, which virtues are then implanted by God (Chrysostom). Å’cumenius thinks, however, that he means that he then becomes strong to work miracles. S. Basil too (in PS. xxxiii.) says, that "great bodily power is an impediment to the salvation of the soul." S. Bernard says beautifully and truly (Serm29 in Cantic.): "Do you see that the weakness of the flesh adds strength to the spirit? Song of Solomon , on the other hand, be assured that the strength of the flesh works spiritual weakness. What wonder is it if you become stronger when the enemy is weakened?—unless perchance you are insane enough to suppose that the flesh, which is always lusting against the spirit, is your friend. . . . The saint who prudently keeps his eye fixed on his salvation prays to be shot at and attacked. Pierce my heart with Thy fear. That fear is the best of arrows, for it pierces and slays the lusts of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved. But does not he that castigates his body and brings it into subjection seem to you to himself help the hand of him that fights against him?
