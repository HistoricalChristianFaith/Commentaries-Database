Amen, i.e, Verily I say, &c. He alludes to the servant who, because of his merit in faithfully and prudently ruling his master"s household, deserves to be exalted by him and set over all his goods, so as to enjoy them as an associate and companion, and almost like an equal of his master. Such was Joseph, who was set by Pharaoh to preside over Egypt, and was virtually king of Egypt (Gen. xli10). In like manner will God bless prudent and faithful Bishops, who have ruled all their flocks, and have guided them to everlasting salvation. He will bestow upon them greater glory than He will upon private believers. He will cause them to preside, not only over them, but He will make them kings and lords of the whole universe. Thus Remigius says, "He will make the good hearers to sit down, as Luke saith: the good preachers He will set over all His goods. For as the difference of merits is great, so also is the difference in rewards." This is what is spoken of in Apoc. iv10 , "The four and twenty Elders," i.e, Bishops and Prelates, "cast their crowns before Him that sitteth on the Throne and worshipped Him that liveth for ever, saying unto the Lamb," that Isaiah , to Christ, "Thou hast made us unto God a Kingdom and Priests, and we shall reign for ever and ever." What I have said of Bishops applies to every father of a family, for he Isaiah , as it were, a bishop of his own house; and as S. Augustine saith, every faithful soul is a bishop of himself. 
In the Life of S. Amandus, who flourished about A.D870 , and who converted Sclavonians and many other tribes to Christ, it is related, that at the very hour when he departed this life, he appeared to S. Aldegonde in glory, encompassed with a white-robed throng. And when she knew not what it meant, she heard an angel saying, "Amandus, the man of God, has passed in glory to celestial joys. The white-robed throng are they who by means of his earnest preaching have been enrolled as citizens of Heaven, and from henceforth he shall appear as a prince over them for ever." Among the more illustrious of his disciples were S. Landvald, S. Bavo, S. Amantius, S. Gertrude, S. Maurontus, and many others. 
Over all His goods; Gr. over all the things which belong to Himself. The good things of God are twofold, viz, 1Things external and created, as Heaven and earth, and all creatures contained in them. Song of Solomon 0rigen2d Things internal and uncreated—such are His infinite majesty, goodness, Wisdom of Solomon , power, and glory. For God Isaiah , as it were, an infinite ocean of all good things; and over them all He will appoint His faithful servant His bishop and pastor. He will make him to rule, as it were, not only over all creatures, but also over all the immense and infinite goodness which God contains in Himself, that he may enjoy them with God, and be blessed and glorified for ever. For if Jacob, wrestling with the angel of God, and overcoming Him, willing to be overcome, was called Israel, i.e, "ruling God"2
 Genesis 32:28), much rather shall blessed Bishops, by their own virtue, as it were, overcoming God, be called and become Israels, that Isaiah , "rulers of God," that "they may have these eternal rewards, both because of their own life, as well as for their care of their flocks," as Rabanus says. For in that they have rightly presided over the flock of God, they have therefore deserved that they should, in a certain sense, through God"s wonderful condescension, be appointed over the good things of God, and even over Himself. For God makes Himself over to them, as their peculiar possession, as it is said in the16th Psalm , "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance, and of my cup." 
But if that evil servant, i.e, such a servant as has been set by his master over his household, shall say, &c It means, "If a Bishop shall think, "The day of death and judgment is far away: wherefore I will abuse my life and my office for the purposes of luxury and ambition."" Therefore He adds—
