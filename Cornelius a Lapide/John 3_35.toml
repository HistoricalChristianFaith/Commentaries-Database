The Father loveth, &c. As God the Father loveth the Son without measure, so He giveth all things into His hand, that Isaiah , at His disposal and power without measure. All things, both corporeal and spiritual: all things, both in heaven and earth, and consequently all the gifts of the Holy Ghost, that He may bestow them upon those who believe in Him, according to His own good pleasure. Again, all things, that Isaiah , every right which the Holy Trinity has over men and things created, this He hath given to the Song of Solomon , not only as He is God, but as He is Prayer of Manasseh , that He may do with them whatsoever He willeth. Hear Euthymius, "As God had all things (for all things were made by Him), this possession also hath He given to Him (Christ) as He is man. In a suitable manner it hath been said, "He loveth, and He hath given," as is said among men. For fathers are wont to love their sons, and to give them what is theirs."

He that hath received, or that receiveth His testimony (by believing), hath signed (Vulg.), &c. For the Vulgate signavit the Greek has ÎµÌ‰ÏƒÏ†Î¶Î¬Î³Î¹ÏƒÎµÎ½, or hath marked, and sighed with a seal. He who receives Christ"s testimony, and believes in Him, testifies by so doing, and as it were attaches a seal to his profession of faith, that God the Father is true, who by His Song of Solomon , as by His own mouth, speaks things most true and Divine. For the Son heard them, and received them from the Father. Or, as S. Cyril says, such an one testifies that God the Son is true, who declares these very things. He who believes in God and in His Son gives great honour to God, because by his belief he professes that God is true, yea, primal and infallible Truth. On the contrary, he that believeth not greatly dishonours God, because in reality he makes Him out false, which is the highest possible contempt and blasphemy of God. S. John says in his Epistle ( 1 John 5:10-11), "He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God, hath made Him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of His Son. And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son." Alcuin explains somewhat differently. He hath sealed, i.e, he hath put a sign, as it were something peculiar and especial, in his heart, that this is the true God, who hath been sent for the salvation of the human race. 
Moreover, God is said to sign and seal His words and His oracles when He confirms them by miracles; but man is said to sign and seal these same words of God when he believes them to be true. Faith therefore is the seal by which we attest the words of God.
