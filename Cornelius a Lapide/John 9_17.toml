They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of Him who hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a Prophet. That is a specially holy Prayer of Manasseh , a wonder-worker. So Abraham ( Genesis 20:7) is called a Prophet (see what is said on1Cor14ad rem, and Sirach 48:12 , on the various meanings of the word Prophet). "Being at present not anointed in heart, he did not confess Christ to be the Son of God. But yet he did not speak falsely of Him. For the Lord said of Himself, "A prophet is not without honour, save in His own country." 
They asked the blind man the same question again and again, out of bitter hatred of Christ, and also to involve him in the same guilt with Christ. They wished also to elicit something out of his mouth to make him contradict himself, that so they might convict Him of a lie. But God caught them in their own craftiness. For by this frequent examination, the consistent confession of the blind Prayer of Manasseh , and consequently the glory of Christ, shone forth. S. Chrysostom wisely says, "It is the nature of truth to become stronger by the snares laid against it." And that was now the case, for the parents are brought forward, who fully acknowledged their Song of Solomon , and confirmed his words.
