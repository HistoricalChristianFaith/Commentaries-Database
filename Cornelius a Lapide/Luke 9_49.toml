And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting, out devils in Thy name; and we forbad him, because he followed not with us, i.e. because he was not Thy disciple. For he thought that only the Apostles, to whom that power was given, were permitted to do this. Cyril and S. Ambrose remark, "He thinks that he who does not render obedience, should not enjoy the benefit arising therefrom." S. John asks the question, because from his love he was the more zealous for his Master"s honour.
