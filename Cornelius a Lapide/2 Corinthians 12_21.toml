Lest my God will humble me among you. Lest He sadden me, and cause me to sorrowfully punish many of you, viz, those who persist in their sins. The Apostle"s words point to the public penance inflicted on those who were strictly called penitents. Cf. Augustine (Ep. ad Salvinam, 108). 
Just as the Apostle and every preacher rejoice chiefly in the progress of their disciples, and to be able to say, "Ye are my joy and crown," so do they mourn most to see them fall away into sin, and make no return for all their exhortations and labour. Again, such an one is forced to punish against his will and with grief. The words of Nero at the beginning of his rule are well known: when obliged to sign a sentence of capital punishment against some criminals, he exclaimed: "Would that I knew not letters." 
And have not repented of the uncleanness. Oftheir effeminacy and other lusts, which make them sin against nature, and subject her to violence. The Apostle draws a distinction between uncleanness and fornication. 
Lasciviousness. Wanton delight in lustful kissing and touch.
