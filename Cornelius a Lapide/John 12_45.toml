And he that seeth Me, seeth Him that sent Me. Because the nature of us both is one only. And just as through My manhood he sees the Godhead which is latent therein, so does he also see the Godhead of My Father, since it is one and the same. And so S. Augustine says, "He shows that there is no difference whatever between Himself and the Father, insomuch that He who seeth Him seeth the Father." 
Hear S. Cyril in the Council of Ephesus (speaking in our Lord"s name): "Oh, my faithful hearers, do not think meanly and humbly of Me. But rather be most fully persuaded of this respecting Me, that if ye believe in Me, ye will believe in Him who is not merely one among many, but in the Father Himself through Me His Song of Solomon , and that though I became man for your sakes, yet am I in every respect equal to the Father, and in no respect whatever severed or separated from Him, inasmuch as I am endowed with the same nature, power, and glory with Him."
