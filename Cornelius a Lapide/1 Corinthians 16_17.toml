I am glad of the presence of Stephanas, and Fortunatus, and Achaiacus. (1.)

According to Theophylact it is the presence of these men with S. Paul, to supply him with what he needed for his ministry from their own resources, and so to help forward the cause of Christ. This is undoubtedly S. Paul"s meaning, and suits better with what follows.
