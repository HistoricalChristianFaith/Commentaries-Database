But if any man love God, the same is known of Him, If any, for God"s sake, love his neighbour, so as not to make him stumble at seeing him eat of idol sacrifices, &c, but seeks instead to edify him, then that man is approved of and beloved by God, and in His knowledge God is well pleased. 
Note that he that loves God loves also his neighbour; for the love of God bids us love our neighbour for God"s sake; and the love of God is exhibited and seen in the love of our neighbour ( 1 John 4:20).
