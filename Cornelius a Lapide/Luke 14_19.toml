And another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, and I go to prove them, &c. Another kind of avarice is here described, viz, the desire of possessing oxen, and animals for tillage, or food, or some other purpose; for the riches of the patriarchs lay in their herds. So think Theophylact and Titus. S. Gregory, however (Hom36), says, "What are we to understand by the five yoke of oxen but the five senses? which are rightly called yokes, because they are double in the two sexes."
