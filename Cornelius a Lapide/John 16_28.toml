I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world. Again I leave the world and go to the Father. I came forth, not by birth of the Virgin, as Jansen maintains, but by My Eternal Generation from the Father. So say the Fathers. Listen to S. Augustine (in loc.), "He came forth from the Father, because He is of the Father, and He came into the world, because He showed to the world the Body which He took of the Virgin." And Cyril, "To have come forth from the Father, is nothing else than to have been born, and to have shone forth from the Substance of the Father by that going forth by which He Isaiah , and is thus understood to be as in proper subsistence." Euthymius, "I came forth from the Father, signifies that He is of the Substance of the Father, or by every right the Son of the Father." So also Bede, S. Thomas, Lyranus, Ribera, Toletus, and others. This will be more clear from verse30. And Song of Solomon , too, it is said "they came forth from the Joins of their father" ( Hebrews 7:10; and  Isaiah 39:7). To go forth from the Father is the same as being begotten of Him.
