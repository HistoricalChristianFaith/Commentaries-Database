For the administration of this service not only supplieth the want of the saints. Î‰ Î´Î¹Î±ÎºÎ¿Î½Î¯Î± Ï„Î·ÌƒÏ‚ Î»ÎµÎ¹Ï„Î¿Ï…ÏÎ³Î¯Î±Ï‚, literally, "the ministry of this liturgy." In this collection of alms there Isaiah , as it were, a liturgy, a mystic sacrifice of the Mass, in which the Corinthians, as offering the victim of alms, are the priests; the poor make the altar; the sacrifice is the alms. Paul may be the deacon, the minister exhorting, collecting, and distributing the alms, through whom the poor who receive and the rich who give, seeing and rejoicing at the grace of Christ, are stirred up to give thanks unto the Lord. S. Cyprian says (Tract. Deuteronomy 0pere et Eleemos.): "Since thanksgiving is directed to God in the prayers of the poor for our alms and good deeds, the total is increased by the reward given by God, who works in us." S. Chrysostom (Hom20) says: "When you see a poor Prayer of Manasseh , think that you see the body of Christ, the altar of Christ, and do reverence, and offer the sacrifice of alms, that from it there may ascend, like incense, to God glory and thanksgiving." Thus almsgiving is an Eucharist or thanksgiving, and an Eucharistic sacrifice, not properly, but metaphorically speaking. Song of Solomon , too, in Rom. xv16 , the preaching of the Gospel and the conversion of the Gentiles are called a sacrifice. Nazianzen says beautifully (Orat. de Cura Paup.): "Out of all things none so honours God as mercy; for nothing is so peculiar to God as this Isaiah , before whose Face go mercy and truth. . . . Nothing is so Divine in a man as to do good. Learn, then, to open your heart to the needy. If you have nothing else to give, give your tears readily. Pity is a great solace to the afflicted."
