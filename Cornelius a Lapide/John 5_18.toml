Wherefore, &c. His Father, Greek, Ï€Î±Ï„Î­Î¶Î± Î¯Î´Î¹Î¿Î½,. i.e, His own Father, because Christ alone is the peculiar, and by nature, Son of God. 
Making Himself equal with God, because He had said that not merely like things, but that the self same things which the Father works, were wrought by Him, and therefore that He in all things co-operated, not as a servant, but as a Song of Solomon , of the same substance with the Father. As Cyril says, "Seeing that He was a Prayer of Manasseh , and not knowing that God dwelt in Him, they could not bear that He should call God His Father in a special manner." The chief priests and scribes therefore wished to kill Jesus, because they feared lest, as His glory increased, their authority should decrease; indeed lest Jesus, persuading the people that He was God, should be preferred by the people to the priests, and should deprive them of their authority, and should bring in His own new priests and pontiffs, which we see He actually did do.
