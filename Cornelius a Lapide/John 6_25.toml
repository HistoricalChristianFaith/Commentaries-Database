And when they had found Him . . . across the sea, that is to say in the synagogue of Capharnaum, as is plain from verse59. When, and how camest Thou hither? "For we know that yesterday Thy disciples went into the ship by themselves at the desert of Bethsaida, and that Thou remainedst there on the land." They did not know that Jesus had walked upon the sea in the middle of the night.
