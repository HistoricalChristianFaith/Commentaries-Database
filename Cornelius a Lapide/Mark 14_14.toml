Where is My refectory? That Isaiah , the place where I may refresh Myself with My disciples, and partake of the lamb. The Greek is ÎºÎ±Ï„Î¬Î»Ï…Î¼Î±, or inn; the Syriac, place of dwelling; Arabic, place in which I may eat the Passover. 
Furnished: provided with tables, couches, or beds and tapestry, decorated also with leaves and flowers, and all other requisites for celebrating the Passover. The Greek, Syriac, and Arabic add, Î­Ï„Î¿Î¹Î¼Î¿Î½, i.e, prepared. For God had put it into the heart of the master of the house to prepare the supper-room for the sake of Christ, that He might find a place well adorned for the celebration of the Passover, that as soon as evening came there might be no delay, but that the lamb might be roasted and eaten, and all the other things accomplished which were to be done by Christ.
