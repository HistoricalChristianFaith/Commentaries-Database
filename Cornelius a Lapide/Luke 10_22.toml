All things are delivered to Me of My Father. As all things were created by My Father, so all things are created anew by Me, and redeemed from the curse of sin. That thus I might raise up those who had fallen away, and might sanctify them, and might renew all the other creatures which had become corrupt through the sin of man. 
"For," says S. Athanasius (Serm. iv. contra Arianos), "after the fall of Prayer of Manasseh , all things were made partakers of his transgression. And so death reigned over all from Adam even unto Christ. The earth was given over to the curse, hell was opened, paradise shut, heaven became an enemy, and mankind being corrupted and lost, the devil triumphed over us." 
"Then He gave Him a human nature, that the Word Himself might take upon Him our flesh, and might renew in all the nature He had taken. 
"All things were delivered unto Him as the physician who could heal the serpent"s bite, as the life which could restore the dead, as the light which could illuminate the darkness, as the understanding which could renew the Powers of the mind." 
And in explanation, he adds, "After all things were delivered to Him, and he was made Prayer of Manasseh , all things were renewed and made perfect again. The earth received a blessing instead of a curse, paradise was unlocked. Hell drew back from fear, the graves gave up their dead, and the gates were thrown open that He might enter from Eden." 
Christ does not speak here of the essence and attributes which were communicated to Him from the Father by His divine generation, as S. Chrysostom, Hilary, and S. Ambrose explain, but of the plenary power which was given to Him as Prayer of Manasseh , to effect the salvation of men.
