But by those who seemed to be somewhat (supply nothing) was adding to my teaching. The Apostle, as is his wont, breaks off and interpolates a clause (whatsoever they were it maketh nothing to me), and then returns to his subject with a change of case. Peter, James , and John , the chief Apostles, added nothing to me (Anselm). 
They who seemed to be somewhat.(1.) These leading Apostles who seemed to be somewhat were illiterate and uncultivated fishermen, whilst I, a Roman citizen, excelled them in zeal and knowledge of the law (Ambrose and Anselm). Since Paul was pressed by the authority of the other Apostles, who were claimed as Judaisers, he exalts his own authority and his own teaching, though with all modesty. This is why he adds, God accepteth no man"s person, as appears from this choice of fishermen to be Apostles. (2.) Augustine turns the ÏŒÏ€Î¿Î¹ÌƒÎ¿Î¹ (quales) as implying sinners. No one need trouble to cast in my teeth the sins of my persecuting days, or remind Peter that he denied Christ. (3.) Chrysostom and Jerome, however, read it: Whatever they were in doctrine and observance of circumcision and the law is nothing to me; to God they will give account, for God accepteth no man"s person. The first of these three explanations is nearest the intention of the Apostle. 
God accepteth no man"s person. I.e, the conditions attaching to a person, which have nothing to do with the free calling of God. To pay attention to these in conferring benefices and offices is in men a vice contrary to distributive justice, which is called in Greek Ï€ÏÎ¿ÏƒÏ‰Ï€Î¿Î»Î·ÏˆÎ¯Î±. In God it would be no vice, but it would be inconsistent with His liberality and greatness. See  Romans 2:11 and comments. 
Added nothing to me. This is Valla"s translation [and that of A.V.], but the Greek is Ï€ÏÎ¿ÏƒÎ±Î½Î­Î¸ÎµÎ½Ï„Î¿, they communicated nothing—being content with my statement as sufficient. See  Galatians 1:16 and comments.
