Have we not power to lead about a sister, a wife, as well as other apostles? The Greek is áº£Î´ÎµÎ»Ï†Î·Ì€Î½ Î³Ï…Î½Î±Î¾ÎºÎ±, which the Latin version turns mulierem sororem; and Beza, Peter Martyr, Vatablus, and Valle render sororem uxorem. They argue from this that Paul was married, urging that, though the Greek word stands both for woman and wife, yet here its meaning is fixed to the latter by the term "lead about." Men do not, they say, lead about sisters but wives. 
They mistake: 1. Christ led about women, not as a husband might a wife, but as a teacher is accompanied by disciples and handmaidens, who see to his necessities. Cf.  Luke 8:3. 
2. It would be absurd to call a sister a wife, and the term sister would be superfluous. 
3. The definite article is wanting in the Greek, which would be required if a certain woman, as, e.g, a wife, were designated. 
4. It is evident from1Cor. vii8 that Paul was unmarried. This passage is explained at length is the sense I have given by Augustine (de Opere Monach. c. iv.), Jerome (contra Jovin. lib. i.), Chrysostom, Ambrose, Theodoret, Theophylact in their comments on the verse, and by other Fathers generally, except by Clement of Alexandria (Strom, lib. iii.) S. Jerome indeed says that, among the Apostles, Peter was the only one that had a wife, and that only before his conversion. Tertullian"s words (de Monogamia) are: "I find that Peter alone was a husband." 
I say, then, that the phrase here is literally "sister woman," and denotes a Christian matron who ministered to Paul"s necessities from her means. We have a similar phrase in Acts xiii26 , "men brethren," i.e, Christian men. S. Paul says then that he might, if he so saw fit, lead about a matron to support him, as much as Peter; but he does not do Song of Solomon , because it might be a cause of offence to the Gentiles, whose Apostle he was, and might only cause evil surmisings. So Ambrose, Chrysostom, Theodoret, Å’cumenius, Anselm. 
It may be said that Ignatius, in his letter to the Philadelphians, classes Paul among the married. Baronius (A.D57 , p518) and others well reply that Paul"s name was inserted there by later Greek copyists, to serve as an excuse for themselves being married. The oldest and best copies of the Epistles of S. Ignatius, including that of the Vatican and of Sfort, have not S. Paul"s name. 
It may be said again that Clement of Alexandria (Strom. lib. iii.) understands this passage of a wife of Paul. I reply, firstly, that that is true, but that he goes on to say that after he became an Apostle she was to him as a sister, not as a wife, which is against the heretics, and in the second place that all the Fathers are against Clement. 
And the Brethren of the Lord. Brethren is a common Hebraism for kinsmen. James ,, John , and Judas are here meant. So Anselm. 
And Cephas. Nay, as well as Peter, the prince of the Apostles and of the Church.
