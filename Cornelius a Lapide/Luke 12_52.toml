For there shall be from henceforth five in one house divided, three against two, and two against three. Five, that isâ€”Father, Song of Solomon , mother, daughter, daughter-in-law, for mother-in-law is the same as mother. So S. Ambrose. And this is plain from what follows. In the same house three unbelievers shall rise against two believers, or two unbelieving against three faithful, or father and Song of Solomon , who do not believe in Christ, shall rise against mother, daughter, and daughter-in-law who, do believe in Him, or the contrary.
