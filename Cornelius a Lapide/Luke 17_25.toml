But first must He suffer many things. The Arabic has, "Before this He shall endure much suffering, and be rejected by this generation."â€”"That Isaiah ," says Euthymius, "by this nation of a few Jews. He said this firstly, lest the Apostles, seeing Him suffering and being put to death on the cross, should be offended, and doubt whether He were the Christ." Secondly, as Bede says, "that when they saw Him dying, who, they thought should be glorified, the pain of His sufferings might be lightened to them by the hope of the promised glory." Thirdly, that He might arm them against future sufferings by this prophecy. "As if He had said," says Theophylact, "Wonder not if troubles come upon you, so great as to make you wish for the days when I was with you. For even I myself, who will come as the lightning, must first suffer many things, and be rejected, and so come into that glory. Let this be your example, for to you also shall come glory from perils."
