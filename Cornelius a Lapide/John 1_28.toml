These things were done in, &c. Bethany is the reading of the Latin, Syriac, Arabic versions, of many codices, including the Vatican, of Bede, Alcuin, the Gloss, &c. But instead of Bethany, Origen, S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, Euthymius, S. Epiphanius, and S. Jerome (in loc. Heb.) read Bethabara, where Gideon slew the Midianites. I observe with Toletus that Bethany and Bethabara were one and the same place, or at least that one was nigh the other, or on opposite banks of the Jordan. This was the place in which the Hebrews , when they came out of Egypt first crossed the Jordan under the leadership of Joshua , to enter the promised land. For Bethabara means in Hebrew a house of passage; Bethany, a house of ships. For vessels were waiting here to carry passengers over Jordan. This Bethany is derived from Beth, a house, and any, spelt with alpha, a ship. The Bethany of Martha and Lazarus was a different place, and spelt differently in Hebrew. That Bethany means the house of humility, from Beth, a house, and any, spelt with ain, humility. 
 John , then, chose this place wherein to baptize for several reasons, because of the abundance of water, also in memory of the ancient passage of the Israelites. S. Jerome says (loc. Hebris), "Even at this present time many of our brethren who believe, desiring there to be born again, are baptized in the life-giving flood." They did this in memory of Christ, who was there baptized by John. This place is distant about four leagues from the Dead Sea. 
Observe, Christ was baptized on the6th of January. It was fifty-five days afterwards that John bore this witness to Christ, or about the1st of March, when Jesus was absent. On the day following Jesus presented Himself before John , when John renewed his testimony, saying, Behold the Lamb of God. (See Epiphan. Hres51.) 
Whence there follows (Ver29), The next day again John saw, &c. Observe that after Jesus was baptized He went into the desert, where He fasted for forty days, as is plain from S.  Matthew 4:2. Then He came down from the Mount of Temptation, and returned to John , to visit and hear him; but especially that John might in His presence confirm the testimony which in His absence he had given to the messengers of the Jews; that he might point Him out with his very finger, and leave no place for hesitation to any. 
Behold the Lamb of God. Nonnus paraphrases, "He lifted up his finger, and pointed Him out as He drew near to the people who beheld Him." "The word Behold," says S. Chrysostom, "is used because many were inquiring for Him: therefore he pointed Him out being present, saying, "This is He of whom I have been speaking." 
Lamb, Greek, ÏŒ Î±Ì‰Î¼Î½Î¿Ï‚, the Lamb divinely prefigured and predicted by Moses and Isaiah. "He is led as a lamb to the slaughter," &c. ( Isaiah 40:7). 
Christ is thus called the Lamb by S. John the Baptist, and by His Apostle, S. John the Evangelist, in the Apocalypse1. Because He was prefigured by the Paschal Lamb, and by the daily morning and evening sacrifice of a lamb to God in the Temple, and by the other lambs which were offered for sin, according to the Law, and yet they could not take away sins. Wherefore they represented Christ, who was to take away sin by His Blood. So Origen, &c. 
2. Because Christ was called a Lamb by Isaiah and Jeremiah ( Jeremiah 11:19), who was to be offered for the redemption of the world. 
3. He is called a Lamb because of his lamb-like innocence, meekness, patience, and obedience, even unto death, which, like a lamb, He bore in silence. As S. Peter says, "Who, when He was reviled, reviled not again; when He suffered, He threatened not; but committed Himself to Him that judgeth righteously" ( 1 Peter 2:23). 
Christ truly is called the Lamb of God, i.e, the offspring, not of sheep, but of God, who by the will of God was offered for man"s redemption. Thus the sacrifice which Abraham offered is called Abraham"s sacrifice, as Theophylact says. Or because He was offered up to God Himself. Or the Lamb of God is the Divine Lamb, because of the Deity which was in Him. Or as S. Clement of Alexandria says, because He was made for us the child and babe of the Father. So we call children, lambs. These are the words of Clement, Since the Scripture calls boys and infants lambs, he called God who is the Word, who for us was made Prayer of Manasseh , who wished in all things to be made like unto us, the Lamb of God, the Son of God, the Infant of the Father" (Pdag. lib1 c5). 
Moreover, Christ for His strength and His victory is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah." He was a Lamb in His Passion, a Lion in His Resurrection. 
Who taketh away the sins: taketh away, both as regards the stain which sin in act imprints upon the soul, and as regards the guilt of sin, which makes the sinner liable to hell. This He takes away by making expiation, and bearing the punishment in Himself, thus in justice and equity satisfying for sin by His death upon the cross. John said this, that no one might think Christ came to his baptism to wash away His own sins, as others did; for He had no sin, but was most innocent and most holy. Therefore God made Him the victim for the sins of the whole world, that He might sanctify all who repent and believe in Him. As S. Augustine says, "He who had no participation in our sinfulness is He who takes away our sin." 
Sin: this is the reading of the Greek, Latin, and Syriac. The Arabic reads sins; but the sense is the same. By sin here is to be understood the first and universal sin of Adam, that Isaiah , original sin, which he by generation transmitted to all his posterity, and out of which all actual sins, whether venial or mortal, spring. Christ therefore, in taking away sin, takes away its source as well as its filth. So Bede, S. Thomas, Jansen, &c. As Isaiah saith, "The Lord laid upon Him the iniquities of us all." And, "He shall bear their iniquities;" and  1 John 2:2, "And He is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world." 
As S. Cyril says, "One is slain for all, that the whole human race may be won to God the Father." For there is in Christ a perpetual power of making expiation for sin in all ages and all nations, and in all men who are willing to receive His faith, His baptism, His repentance.
