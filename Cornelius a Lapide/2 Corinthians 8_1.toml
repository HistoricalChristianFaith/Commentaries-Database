SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. He exhorts the Corinthians to imitate the generosity of the Macedonian Christians in sending alms to the poor at Jerusalem. 
ii. He points (ver9) to the example of Christ, who for our sakes was made poor, that through His poverty we might be rich. 
iii. He urges them (ver10) to fulfil their purpose and half-promise, and bids each one give according to his means. 
iv. He says (ver13) that by so doing rich and poor will be equalised, through the former giving their temporal goods in return for spiritual benefits. 
v. He reminds them (ver16) that he had sent Titus and other Apostles to make this collection, and warns them that if they put His messengers to shame they themselves will also be put to shame before them. 
The first example of the almsgiving referred to in this and the next chapters is related by S. Luke ( Acts 11:28). This famine under Claudius is referred by many to his fourth year, by Baronius to his second, i.e, A.D44. From S. Luke"s narrative it appears that the Christians of Antioch zealously met the famine beforehand by sending alms by the hands of Barnabas and Paul. Many years afterwards, in A.D58 , the collection spoken of in this chapter was made in Corinth and the neighbouring places. Further, a greater and more lasting cause of the poverty of the Christians of Jerusalem was the constant persecution suffered by them at the hands of the Jews since the death of Stephen, frequently taking the form of banishment and confiscation of their goods ( Acts 8:1, and  Hebrews 10:34). From that time forward the Jews were sworn foes to Christ: and bitterly persecuted the Christians; and since the Church of Jerusalem was the mother of all others, the custom prevailed amongst Christians in all parts of the world of sending, help to the poor of that Church. When Vigilantius found fault with this custom in the time of Theodosius, S. Jerome, writing against him, testifies to its prevalence with approbation. He says: "This custom down to the present time remains, not only among us, but also among the Jews, that they who meditate in the law of the Lord day and night, and have no lot in the earth save God only, be supported by the ministry of the synagogues, and of the uhole earth." 
In this chapter, then, the Apostle is urging the Corinthians, as being rich, to the duty of almsgiving. Corinth was the most frequented emporium of Greece, and in it were many wealthy merchants

Moreover, brethren, we do you to wit of the grace. God has given to the Macedonian Christians great patience, liberality, and pity for others.
