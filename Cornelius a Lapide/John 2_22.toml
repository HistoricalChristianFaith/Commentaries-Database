When therefore He was risen, &c. They believed the Scripture, which foretold that Christ would rise from the dead. This, which they did not previously understand, they understood when they saw it actually fulfilled in the resurrection of Christ. Such a Scripture is that verse of the Psalm (xvi10), "Thou shalt not leave My soul in hell, nor suffer Thine Holy One to see corruption."
