And Jesus answered and said unto her, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things. The repetition of her name, says S. Augustine, "is a sign of affection, or perhaps of a desire to arrest her attention more particularly to what He was about to say. For she was so entirely engrossed by her household cares, that His words might have been unheeded had she not been specially addressed by name." S. Augustine adds, "Mary made no reply, because she preferred to commit her cause to her Judges , and knew that Christ would, as He was wont, stand by her and support her. Hence Christ, who was appealed to as Judges , became her Advocate." Interlinear Gloss. 
Thou art too anxious, Martha, and therefore thou are troubled. Thou desirest to prepare many things for me, whereas I need but few. Emmanuel Sa and all the others translate é·ç³‹å¡?, thou art confused, but the better rendering Isaiah , thou art troubled. For those who are anxious about many things experience much perturbation of mind—hence too much care and anxiety is the sign of excessive love or fear, and so they who love honour or riches, or any other thing too much, fear lest they may lose what they love, and become perturbed and anxious.
