For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God. "Glory" may here be taken in an active sense. They loved to give glory to men—to the Jews, e.g, and the Pharisees—by saying that they were wise and sound teachers of the Law, rather than to Jesus Christ, by acknowledging Him to be the Messiah. 
Secondly, in the passive sense (and this is the best meaning), they preferred to be glorified by men rather than by God, to hear the Pharisees say, "Ye are the true Israelites, who abide in the faith of your fathers, and prefer Moses to this innovator Jesus, and the ancient religion of the Israelites to the novelties of this sect of Christians." So Augustine, Cyril, Bede, Chrysostom, Theophylact, and others. They therefore had the faith of Christ, but not charity. For if they had had it they would have loved the glory of Gad, rather than that of men, and would have professed with their lips the faith of Christ which they held in their heart. See  Romans 10:10. 
Many such are found at the present time in England, Germany, and Poland, who cherish in their minds faith and piety, but who dare not profess them outwardly, for fear of incurring the derision and scoffs of worldlings or heretics. Against these Christ thunders forth, "Whosoever shall be ashamed of Me and of my words," &c. ( Luke 9:26.) 
The Gloss says wisely (quoting S. Augustine in loc.) The Cross is marked on the forehead, which is the seat of shame, to keep us from blushing at the Name of Christ, and seeking the praise of men rather than the praise of God."
