Being reviled, we bless. Infidels and Jews mock us, and call down imprecations on us, saying, "Let these new preachers of a crucified God be slain, let then perish and hang on the accursed cross." We, however, pray for their peace, that God would give them His light, His grace, and salvation. S. Basil (in Reg. Brevior226) points out that to do evil and to do good are connoted by reviling and blessing. He says: "We are bidden to be patient towards all, and to return kindly deeds to those who persecute us unjustly. We are to love fervently, not only those that curse us, but whosoever shows us unkindness in any way whatever, that so we may obey the precept, "Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.""
