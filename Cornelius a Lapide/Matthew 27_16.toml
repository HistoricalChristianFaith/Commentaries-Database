For he had then a notable prisoner called Barabbas. Notorious, that Isaiah , for his crimes. S. John terms him "a robber." S. Mark and S. Luke , "one who had committed murder in the insurrection." "Notorious," says S. Chrysostom, "for his bold bearing, and stained with many murders." Now to be thus compared with Barabbas, and counted his inferior, was a great dishonour and pain to Christ. And His patience under this wrong is a fitting pattern to all Christians when slights are put on them. 
Barabbas. In Hebrew "the Son of a father, of Adam, i.e, the first father of all sinners." And Christ was made lower than Adam when He took on Himself to atone for his disobedience and sin. 
S. Jerome explains it less correctly as Barabbas, the son of a Master.
