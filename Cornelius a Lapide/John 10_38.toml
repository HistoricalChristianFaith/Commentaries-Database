But if I do, &c, and I in the Father, working by the same Godhead and omnipotence which I have received from Him. Accordingly S. Augustine, Cyril, Leontius, &c, consider that the words, "I in the Father and the Father in Me," mean the same as "I and the Father are one." S. Augustine says (in loc.), "We are in God, and God in us. But can we say, "I and God are one?" Thou art in God, because God containeth thee; God is in thee, because thou art made the temple of God. But because thou art in God, and God in thee, canst thou therefore say, "He who seeth God seeth Me," as the only Begotten said, "He that seeth Me, seeth the Father also, and I and the Father are one?" Recognise what is proper to the Lord, and also the duty of the servant. What is proper to the Lord is equality with the Father; the duty of the servant is to be partaker of the Saviour."
