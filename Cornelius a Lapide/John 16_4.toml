But these things have I told you, that when the hour shall come, ye may remember that I told you of them. (1.) S. Cyril (x13) supplies the connection thus. I have not said these things to enervate you, but that, remembering I told you them before, your faith may be more firm and established in the time of peril. (2.) Rupertus, without supplying anything, explains the words more closely:—"I tell you these things now in order that ye may remember what I promised, that in all your sufferings not a hair of your head shall perish, and that though your enemies kill your bodies, ye shall in patience possess your souls." The latter part is not applicable, for, Christ reminds them only of what He had just said. (4.) Ribera and Maldonatus give the genuine meaning:—"Ye shall suffer these things, but I give you this remedy against them; that you should remember Me, that as being God, they could not escape my notice, and that I could have prevented them, had I so willed. And that you should therefore rely on Me as God, believing that I will be with you, and so strengthen you that ye may be able to overcome all adversities, and that I may crown you afterwards with the martyr"s chaplet." 
S. Augustine, Bede, and Rupert read "the hour for these things." S. Chrysostom, Theophylact, and Euthymius much more correctly, "remember them."
