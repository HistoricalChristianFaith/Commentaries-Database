And while He yet spake, lo, Judas, one of the twelve came, &c. This is more fully set forth, John xviii2. The truth of His prediction and foreordaining was thus made good. He so interwove Judas" sin and His Passion, that the whole action appeared to be partly permitted and partly ordained by Him. 
Lo, Judas, one of the twelve. Lo is an expression of wonder. An unheard-of portent, a stupendous crime, that one of the Apostles was not only a thief and robber, but the traitor, and the leader of those who killed Christ! "He went before them," says S. Luke. 
A great multitude: of Roman soldiers, high priests" servants, &c. 
Staves: tipped with iron, as spears, &c, or not so tipped, as clubs. Observe here the folly and madness of Judas and the Jews. He knew that He was a very great prophet, nay, the Son of God, who could not be overcome by force, as the Jews well knew, and yet, maddened with avarice and fury, they bring armed men to use violence towards Him, to seize and bind Him. Dost thou wish, 0 Judas, to bind God, to seize the Almighty, to fight, 0 petty men, against your Creator, and compel Him to give Himself into your hands? "It was avarice," says S. Chrysostom, "which inspired him with this madness, avarice which makes all its slaves cruel and fierce; for if the covetous man neglect his own salvation, what will he care for another?
