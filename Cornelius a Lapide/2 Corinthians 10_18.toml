For not he that commendeth himself is approved. How is it, then, that Saints have sometimes commended themselves, as, e.g, Hezekiah, in  Isaiah 38:3, and S. Paul in the next chapter, and in2Tim4.? I answer, They do indeed commend themselves, but at the same time they tacitly refer all their praise to God"s grace as its first cause, and say: "By the grace of God I am what I am." Again, this self-commendation came not from themselves, but was inspired into them by the Holy Spirit, who spoke by their mouth. The Holy Spirit suggested to each writer of the Holy Scriptures what he should write.
