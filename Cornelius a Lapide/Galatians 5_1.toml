Be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage. You once served idols and devils: why do you now wish to serve the shadows and burdensome ceremonies of the Mosaic law? The Greek for entangled is rendered by the Vulgate contained, by Vatablus implicated, by Erasmus ensnared. The Judaisers, says S. Paul, are enticing you to their law as into a net, in which, if you are once entangled, you will be unable to escape from its legal windings and toils.

SYNOPSIS OF THE CHAPTER
i. S. Paul proceeds to urge the Galatians not to submit to the yoke of the Old Law, lest they be deprived of the fruits of Christ"s righteousness, since in Him neither circumcision nor uncircumcision will avail anything, but only faith which worketh by love. 
ii. He invites them (ver13) to Christian liberty, and shows that it is based on charity, which causes him to pass from the dogmatic to the ethical portion of the Epistle. 
iii. He points out (ver17) how the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and then he enumerates the works of each respectively.
