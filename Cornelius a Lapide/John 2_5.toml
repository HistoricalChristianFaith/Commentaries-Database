His Mother saith, &c. His mother modestly holds her peace, and rightly yields to her Song of Solomon , as being the Son of God. Although the Son seems to deny His Mother, the Mother knows His filial piety. Therefore with all confidence she bids the servants what to do. S. Gaudentius comments in these words, "The Mother would not have said, Whatsoever He saith unto you do it, unless being full of the Holy Ghost from her birth she had foreseen the whole process of Christ"s turning the water into wine." Wherefore S. Bernard on these words (Hom2) says, "I see plainly that it was not as being wroth, or as wishing to confound the shrinking modesty of His Virgin Mother, that He said, What have I to do with thee, but for our sakes, that the care of parents according to the flesh should not trouble those who are converted to the Lord." For Christ presently obeys His Mother, and to honour her performs the miracle. Hear S. Chrysostom: "Although He answered thus, yet He complied with His Mother"s prayer, that He might give honour to her, and not seem stubborn (contumax) to her, nor put her to shame when so many were present." And Euthymius says, "How very greatly He honoured her is plain from many other reasons, and also from this, that He fulfilled her exhortation." 
Moreover, in these words of the Virgin her meekness, piety, charity, prudence, faith, constancy, and greatness of soul wonderfully shine forth.
