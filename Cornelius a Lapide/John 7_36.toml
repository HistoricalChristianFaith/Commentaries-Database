What is this saying that He said, . . . and where I Amos , thither ye cannot come? That is to the Gentiles scattered throughout the world. Hence the Epistles written to them are called Catholic or universal. The Jews scornfully termed the Gentiles "dispersed," whereas they themselves were gathered together in one spot, and again because they were "dispersed" among many errors and superstitions, while the Jews were united in one orthodox faith and served the one true and only God with one mind. 
The Jews did not understand Christ"s meaning, because they did not believe that He would go up again to heaven. And yet they spake the truth, for when the Jews rejected the faith, the Apostles transferred it to the Gentiles (see  Acts 13:46).
