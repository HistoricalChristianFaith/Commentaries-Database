Then said Jesus, Suffer her to keep this for the day of my burial. In the Greek it is "for the day of my burial hath she kept this," and also in the Syriac (see notes on Matthew 26:12 , &c.) Hear S. Augustine, "He saith not to him, It is on account of thy thefts that thou speakest thus. He knew he was a thief, but was unwilling to expose him. He chose rather to bear with him, and to set us an example of patience in tolerating evil men in the Church."
