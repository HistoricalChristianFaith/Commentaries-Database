For I say unto you, that none of those men which were bidden shall taste of my supper, because they made light of my invitation. So the Pharisees and the rulers of the Jews, given up to earthly enjoyments, are to be excluded from the heavenly feast because, called by Christ to accept the teaching of His gospel, they refused the invitation. "Because I have called and ye refused, I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh."  Proverbs 1:24. Then shall they, too late, repent of their ingratitude and folly, and shall say, "What hath pride profited us, or what good hath riches with our vaunting brought us? For those things are passed away like a shadow." Wisdom of Solomon 5:8. 
So far Christ had said all these things in the house of the Pharisee, whose invitation He had accepted, in order that He might instruct him and his friends. Let all those, therefore, who are followers of Christ, imitate His example, and not take part in any entertainment unless it be for the purpose of reaping spiritual fruit.
