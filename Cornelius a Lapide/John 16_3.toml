And these things will they do unto you, because they have not known the Father nor Me. He says this not to excuse the persecutors, but rather to comfort the Apostles. "The reason why Jews and Gentiles will persecute you, He would say, is because they refuse to acknowledge Me as the Son of God the Father, though established by countless miracles. And therefore their ignorance only aggravates their guilt. But it will be a consolation to you in your persecutions, that ye know Me and My Father, and are suffering for both Our sakes. For if it is glorious to die for one"s country, it is much more glorious to die for God." So S. Augustine. S. Chrysostom adds this, "If a prince or his ambassador enters a city, unattended and consequently not known, and is treated with indignity, he cares little for it, for when his retinue arrives, he will make himself known, and put to shame those who derided him."
