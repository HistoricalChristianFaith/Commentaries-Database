And it was revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord"s Christ. "It was revealed" by a divine oracle and promise—the Greek expression is Ï‡Î¶Î·Î¼Î±Ï„Î¯Î¾ÎµÎ¹Î½. "The Lords Christ"—the Messiah, anointed with the unction of the Holy Spirit and the plentitude of grace. ( Isaiah 11:2.) 
In this Simeon was privileged far beyond Abraham, Isaac, and all the patriarchs and prophets, who, as the apostle says,  Hebrews 11:13, "died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off, and embraced them." Hence it is plain that Simeon was a man of singular holiness, and full of holy aspirations and zeal.
