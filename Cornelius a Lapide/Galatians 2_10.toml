The poor. The Jews, who, for Christ"s sake, had been spoiled of their goods by their fellows (Heb. x34and Chrysostom). Jerome, however, understands the poor who became so voluntarily to be meant, those who had sold their possessions and had given the price to the Apostles, to be distributed among the faithfulâ€”especially the poor among them, of whom there was a great number (Acts ii45).
