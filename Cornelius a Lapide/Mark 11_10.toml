Blessed be the kingdom of our father David that cometh. It means, blessed by the benediction and goodness of God, i.e, "let it be happy, propitious, flourishing, firm, and abounding in all good things, this kingdom of our father David, which is the kingdom of Israelâ€”that kingdom which was most ample and flourishing under David and Solomon his Song of Solomon , and which fell to pieces at the Babylonian captivity, and subsequently. Now does that kingdom come. It returns, and is restored by this our Messiah, the Son of David, who shall restore it to its pristine glory and beauty, yea, who shall make it far more strong and flourishing."
