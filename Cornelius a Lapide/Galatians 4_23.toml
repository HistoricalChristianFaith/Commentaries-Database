He who was of the bondwoman. Ishmael was born according to the laws of natural generation, by which Abraham, though an old Prayer of Manasseh , was able to raise up seed from his youthful bondwoman, Hagar. 
He of the freewoman was by promise. Isaac was not born according to the usual laws of generation, for Sarah, his mother, was then sterile by age, so that Abraham could not in the order of nature beget a son by her. He was born by promise, i.e, by the supernatural power of God, in fulfilment of the promise made to Abraham.
