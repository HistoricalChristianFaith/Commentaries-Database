And He said unto them, . . . Why do thoughts arize in your hearts? i.e. why do you give way to them and permit them to arise? "These thoughts," says Augustine (serm69 De Diversis) "were earthly. For had they been from heaven they would have descended, not ascended, into their hearts. Thus Christ showed that He knew the hearts of men, (ÎºÎ±Î¶Î´Î¹Î¿Î³Î½Ï‰ÌƒÏƒÏ„Î·Ï‚, Acts i.. 24) and that He was God." Titus and Euthymius.
