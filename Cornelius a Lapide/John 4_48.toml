Jesus therefore, &c. Signs and prodigies mean nearly the same thing. Signs, however, are properly what take place in natural things, and by nature, slowly operating, but which Christ wrought in a moment, and therefore miraculously. Such are the healing of the sick. But prodigies are things which surpass the whole power of nature, as the raising of the dead. 
Christ reproved the small faith of the nobleman, in order that He might sharpen and augment it. As though He said, "Thou and thine hast heard of certain signs and prodigies which I have wrought; still thou believest not that I am the Messiah, unless I do very many more, and that thou thyself mayest behold them with thine eyes." "He teaches," says S. Chrysostom, "that it is not His miracles that we are to attend to, but His doctrine. He shows that signs are especially made gracious to the soul; and in this case He heals the father who was labouring under a disease of the mind, no less than the (bodily) disease of the son." Indeed, He first cures the unbelief, or the imperfection of faith, in the father, and then the fever of the son.
