And as He spake, a certain Pharisee besought Him to dine with him: and He went in, and sat down to meat. "As he spake," As He was on a certain occasion teaching the people, say St. Augustine and others; but Maldonatus considers that reference is here made to the preceding verses. The Pharisee therefore, having heard what our Lord had previously said, asked Him, from no good motive, but, as we learn from the two last verses of the chapter, in order to find some accusation against Him. 
"He sat down to meat," without having first washed His hands, after the manner of the Pharisees.
