Did not Moses give you the law? And yet, &c. The primary sense Isaiah , no wonder ye do not accept Mine and My Father"s law, since ye keep not the law of Moses, which ye value so much and urge against Me. For it strictly forbids murder ( Exodus 23:7). So S. Augustine and others. But secondly, F. Lucas thus explains it more profoundly and more closely to the context. "Ye accuse Me of disregarding the law, and breaking the Sabbath by healing the paralytic. But ye equally break it by circumcising a Prayer of Manasseh , which is a longer and more cruel act than healing with a word. Ye are therefore more deserving of death than I am."
