And behold there was a woman. "The spirit of infirmity, that Isaiah , an infirmity sent by the evil one," says de Lyra. Euthymius, "The devil of weakness not suffering her to live." The Arabic reads, "With whom was a spirit of infirmity for eighteen years, and she was bowed together and was not able to stand up by any means." This infirmity was a curving and bending of the whole body, so that the woman was compelled always to walk bent and stooping. Observe that diseases are often sent by the devils, through the permission of God, for sins of other reasons. Ver16 shows the cause of this infirmity, "This daughter of Abraham, whom Satan hath bound," Thus the devil afflicted Job with various diseases, chap. ii. The same is seen in  Psalm 78:49, and  Matthew 9:23. The devil, therefore, made this woman crooked and bent, to compel her always to look down upon the earth. 
Eighteen years. It was, therefore, an inveterate and incurable disease, and as such could not be healed by the physicians. 
And was bowed together. Looking towards the ground, (cernua) crooked, with her head and back bent downwards—nay, she was less able even than a beast to look up at the sun and heavens, but must always look down at the rocks and the earth. For at the creation (Gen. i.) 
Os homini sublime dedit, cÅ“lumque
 tueri 
Jussit, et erectos ad sidera tollere
vultus,- 
"God gave to man a lofty countenance, 
And to regard the heavens commanded him. 
Bade him to lift his form erect, and gaze 
Upon the starry host,"—
that he might look up at the sun and the heavens, and, by a heavenly life, journey towards God on high, and be received, into heaven and there enjoy the blessedness of the divine vision; for, as S. Basil says in the Catena, "We should seek heavenly things, and rise above those of earth." The devil, then, to turn men from heaven, makes them look downwards, so that they see, love, and pursue only earthly things.
