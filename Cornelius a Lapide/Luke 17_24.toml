For as the lightning. The Syriac has, "As the lightning shines from heaven and lightens all things under heaven." As the lightning most suddenly, swiftly, and openly descends from heaven and shines out, so shall I suddenly and unexpectedly return to judgment. There will be no need of watching for Me, or sign, or Mark , for I shall appear conspicuous and glorious to all in the whole earth. This and the following we have read in  Matthew 24:27 and following, where I have explained it.
