He hath showed strength, &c. The Virgin has been praising the mercy of God towards those who fear Him, and now she goes on to praise His severity and justice towards those who despise Him. 
With His arm. The strength and power of God are anthropomorphically expressed by the hand, the finger, the right hand, but most of all by the arm, for the strength of man puts itself forth in his arms. The meaning therefore Isaiah , God has in every age wrought many things by His mighty arm, as in the case of Pharaoh by Moses, &c. But much more has God shown His power by causing Christ to become incarnate in me, by Whom He will mightily overthrow Lucifer, hell, death and sin. Whence Bede and Theophylact understand by His arm here, mystically, the Son of God incarnate in the Virgin. For He is the power of God,  1 Corinthians 1:24. There is an allusion to  Isaiah 53:1, To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed? 
He hath scattered the proud; as He scattered and overthrew Pharaoh, Nebuchadnezzar, &c. 
In the imagination of their heart. Vulgate, mente cordis sui. Some refer these words to the heart of God, so that the meaning will be, God by His own heart, i.e. His will and decree, scattered the proud: so S. Augustine explains it. "In the imagination (or purpose) of His heart," he says, "that Isaiah , in His deep counsel He scattered them. It was deep counsel for God to become man for me, and for the innocent to suffer in order that the guilty might be redeemed." The Carthusian (Denis) follows this explanation, "In the purpose, i.e. in the intention and will of His heart, i.e. of His understanding, by which He discerns, Judges , and orders all things." But from the Greek it is clear that the word sui is not to be referred to the heart of God, but to the heart of the proud; for the Greek is Î±Ï…Ì‰Ï„Ï‰ÌƒÎ½, of them. Whence Euthymius says, God scattered those who were proud in their heart. 
Others refer the word sui, of them, to the word dispersit, scattered, so that the meaning Isaiah , God hath scattered the proud by means of the purpose (Greek, Î´Î¹Î±Î½Î¿Î¯Î±) of their heart, because He turns back their proud machinations to their own destruction, so that He disperses them, according to that saying  Job 5:13, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; as He did to Pharaoh when he followed the Hebrews through the Red Sea, by drowning him with all his followers in the same sea; and to the brethren of Joseph who sold him that they might destroy him, but God by this very thing exalted Joseph and constrained his brethren to bow down to him.
