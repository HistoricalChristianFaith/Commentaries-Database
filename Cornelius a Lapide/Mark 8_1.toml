Christ feedeth the people miraculously: 10 refuses to give a sign to the Pharisees: 14admonisheth his disciples to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod: 22giveth a blind man his sight: 27 acknowledgeth that he is the Christ, who should suffer and rise again: 34and exhorteth to patience in persecution for the profession of the gospel.
