But if a man walk in the night, &c. While it is day, that Isaiah , while the time of life remains to Me, ye will not stumble, 0 disciples, while following Me into Judea; but when the night shall have come, that Isaiah , death and the close of My life, then the Jews will persecute and kill you as My disciples, as they have persecuted and killed Me. So Rupertus. Mystically, he who follows the day, that Isaiah , the sun and light of faith and grace, does not stumble, does not fall into offences; but he who walks in the night, that Isaiah , in the darkness of ignorance and concupiscence, he falls into various faults and penalties.  Ephesians 5:8.
