But I say unto you, &c. Christ here corrects and settles the law of divorce1. Because the law easily conceded divorce for various causes. But Christ permits it only on account of fornication, if a wife be an adulteress; and from an adulterer the innocent wife is at liberty to depart, according to that maxim, "If a man break his marriage vow that may be broken with him." 2. The Law conceded both to the woman who was put away, and to the husband who repudiated her, the liberty of contracting a second marriage. But Christ denies it to both3. The Law conceded to the husband alone the power of giving a writing of divorcement. But Christ, with respect to this matrimonial right places the man and the woman upon a perfect equality, as S. Paul teaches,  1 Corinthians 7:4. 
Except for the cause of fornication. By fornication here some understand any sin whatever, that Isaiah , in the form of a sort of spiritual fornication with any creature, leaving God, the Creator and Husband of the Soul. Thus S. Augustine, Origen, in loc. But this is taking it in too loose a sense. 
By fornication others understand infidelity. For this is constantly called fornication by the prophets, that is to say, spiritual and mystical fornication. 
But expositors, ancient and modern, passim, understand fornication here in its strict, literal sense, as denoting all illicit sexual intercourse. 
You will say it is lawful to put away a wife if she endeavour to draw her husband into any sin, as is laid down in the chapter, Qusivi de divortiis, and as Christ Himself sufficiently indicates, ver29. Also if the wife practise sorcery, or compass her husband"s death; so that it is lawful to put a wife away for other causes besides fornication. 
I answer, what you say is true, but Christ here assigns fornication as the only cause of divorce, both because it is the only proper cause of divorce, speaking in a strict sense, from marriage, as being immediately destructive of it, whilst the others are general causes, and would absolve a Christian from any union whatever; also because the divorce of even a repentant adulteress is conceded in perpetuity, so that although the wife repent of her adultery the husband is not bound to receive her again to his house, whereas in the other cases he is bound to receive her back again to favour; lastly, because Christ here wishes entirely to exclude all such causes of divorce as the wife"s deformity, poverty, disagreeableness, &c, which were common among the Jews. And to them He is here addressing Himself. 
And whoso shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery. Cajetan and others here repeat the words, excepting for the cause of fornication, as though it were lawful for the man putting away the adulterous wife, and for the adulteress herself, to enter again into matrimony. But what S. Paul says ( 1 Corinthians 8:11), is plainly repugnant to this idea. For he there bids the innocent wife remain unmarried, or else be reconciled to her adulterous husband. See what I have there said; and this is the constant usage and interpretation of the Church, of which more on chap19:9.
