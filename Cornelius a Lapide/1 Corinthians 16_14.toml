Let all your things be done with charity. This, according to some, is not supernatural charity, but the sincere affection which penitents or even unbelievers can possess. But this is not the charity which Scripture and S. Paul commend to the faithful, but merely such natural love as pagans have. The sense properly speaking is therefore: "Do all your works, 0 Corinthians, not from ambition, nor from contention or schism, as I told you in chaps. ii. and xiv, but in Christian charity, which is a Divine virtue infused into you by Christ." This is partly a precept, partly a counsel of perfection, as was pointed out in the notes to chap. x31.
