My name is Legion; Syriac, our name, &c, adding, by way of explanation, for we are many. A legion contained properly6666 soldiers. See what is said in  Matthew 26:53. In this place a certain number is put for an uncertain. Observe, the devil is God"s ape. Hence he imitates God, who is "the Lord of hosts," that Isaiah , of angels. In a like way the devil calls himself legion, because he leads out many companions into line of battle to fight against God and His faithful people. Wherefore me have a right to dread that battle, knowing that their warfare is not with men, but devils, and those many in number, who conspire for their destruction. Therefore they ought to implore the help of God and the holy angels, as Elisha did ( 2 Kings 7:17).
