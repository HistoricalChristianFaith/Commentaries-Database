They inclosed a great multitude of fishes—for Peter had said, "At Thy word I will let down the net." "Behold here the fruit and reward of obedience. Jesus did this—1. In order that by providing them with food, He might prepare them for their vocation and ministry. I have chosen you to be My disciples, make not excuse that ye must work for your livelihood as fishermen. Behold this miraculous draft of fishes, and believe that I am able to provide you with all things necessary for life more easily and more abundantly than ye are able to provide them yourselves2. To teach from this miracle, that they were soon to become successful fishers of men.
