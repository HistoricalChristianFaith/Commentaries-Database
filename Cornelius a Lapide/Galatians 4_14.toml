And my temptation which was in my flesh ye despised not. Erasmus takes temptation in the active sense, viz, as though Paul had tempted the Galatians by his unattractive presence and speech. But it is better to take it passively, as being identical with the object of temptation. The meaning then is: You did not despise me in my weakness and my abject condition, which had the effect of making me a temptation to you, but you received me as an angel, nay, as Christ Himself. [Note.â€”The Vulgate is: "And your temptation which was in my flesh."]
