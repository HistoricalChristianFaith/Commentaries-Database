They answered, &c, in sins, both in mind and body, for thou wast born blind by reason of thy sin. For they held the tenet of Pythagoras that the soul existed before the body, and that it was in consequence of its sins thrust down into a deformed (i.e, a blind) body. So Cyril, Leontius, and others. Maldonatus explains, "Thou hast done nothing but sin from thy birth." So S. Chrysostom and Theophylact. And dost thou teach us? Thou blind sinner, wilt thou teach us who have our sight, and are wise and righteous? 
And they cast him out of the private house in which they were, as not deserving to be disputed with by such just teachers, says Maldonatus. Or out of the temple, as says S. Chrysostom, and consequently out of the synagogue, adds Leontius. That Isaiah , they excommunicated him. "But the Lord of the temple found him," says Chrysostom, "and took him up." Both statements are credible: that they drove him out of the house, and also excommunicated him, for this latter they had decided to do. As if they said, "Begone, thou apostate, and go to thine own Jesus." But this leads us to suppose that all this took place in the House of judgment, a public place (see on verse31). And that he was expelled from the synagogue appears more plainly from our Lord"s own words in the next chapter, I am the door.
