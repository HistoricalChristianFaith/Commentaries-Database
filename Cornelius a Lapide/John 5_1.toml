After these things, &c. Observe, John here omits many things which Christ did in Galilee, but which Matthew records from the4th to the12th chapter of his Gospel. For what Matthew relates in his12th chapter concerning the disciples plucking the ears of corn took place after the following feast, as will appear presently. 
A feast. SS. Chrysostom, Cyril, and others think that this was the Feast of Pentecost. With more probability, S. Irenus (lib2 , c39), Ruperti, and others, think it was the Passover. They show this (1.) Because in chap. iv, ver35 , Jesus said there were still four months unto harvest. That therefore must have been before the Passover: thus the Passover must have been the first great subsequent feast. 
2. Because the Passover was the feast of feasts. When therefore it is said absolutely, there was a feast, the Passover, which was the feast par excellence, is to be understood. 
3. Because Christ after His baptism preached for three years and a half, according to the common consent of divines. It follows from this that there ought to be notices in the Gospels of four Passovers, which is the case. The first is mentioned in  John 2:13; the second in this place; the third in  John 6:4; the fourth, just before His death, xix14. But if the feast mentioned in this5th chapter were not the Passover, we could only gather the mention of three by S. John. 
Here then comes to a close the account of the first year and three months of Christ"s ministry, that is to say, from January6 , when He was baptized, until this second Passover, which was kept in Nisan, or March.
