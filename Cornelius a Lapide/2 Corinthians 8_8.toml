The Latin ingenium, which is the rendering of the Greek Î³Î½Î®ÏƒÎ¹Î¿Î½, does not here denote the good disposition of charity, as Anselm thinks, in which case the meaning would be: I say this, not to test and show that your charity has a good disposition, by its suggesting, dictating, and advising that you do this good deed without any order from me; but Î³Î½Î®ÏƒÎ¹Î¿Î½ denotes, not ingenium, but ingenuum, or an innate disposition. Again, the word for prove has the double idea of testing and then demonstrating. Maldonatus, indeed (Notæ Manusc.), renders it, "longing to prove to others;" for, as he says, the Greek verb here denotes not the effect but the affection.
