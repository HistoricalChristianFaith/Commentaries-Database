But because I have said these things to you, sorrow hath filled your heart.â€”Maldonatus explains "but" by "for," i.e, This (your sorrow) is the reason why ye ask Me not. But Toletus explains it by "Nay, rather," meaning "Ye not only do not ask Me, but more than this, ye are overwhelmed with sorrow." But it is simpler to understand as conveying a tacit reproof for being so given up to sorrow, as to have no courage to ask Him that which would have alleviated their sorrow, and would have been to them the greatest consolation and joy: namely, that He was going to the Father, and would send His Holy Spirit to prepare a place for them in heaven.
