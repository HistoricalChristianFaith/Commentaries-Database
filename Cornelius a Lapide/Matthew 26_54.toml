But how then shall the Scriptures be fulfilled, that thus, it must be? And if Scripture foretells My sufferings, "Why do ye oppose it?" says S. Chrysostom. This, then, is the third reason why Christ prohibits His defence by arms. "Though He might have these legions, He was unwilling to have them, in order that the Scriptures might be fulfilled, that it was fitting He should thus suffer." For we owe that reverence to the word of God, as not to oppose, but to assent to it and make it good. But thou wilt say, "The Jews then did no sin in killing Christ, because they merely fulfilled the Scriptures." S. Athanasius (de Cruce) denies the inference. "For they did sin thus boldly against Christ, as fulfilling the words of prophecy, but merely of their own accord, so that the Prophet was not the cause of their Acts , but their own free will. Or rather, they themselves caused the Prophets to predict such things of them." The Jews then perpetrated this sacrilegious murder from their own wickedness and hatred of Christ, and the Prophets only foresaw and foretold it. They did not approve, or order the Jews to do it. But God ordered Christ to bear it all, and thus atone for the sins of men. " Pleasing the suffering, though the deed displeased." Hence S. Leo (Serm1. de Pass.) says, "We have nothing to thank you for, 0 ye Jews; we owe nought to thee, 0 Judas. For your wickedness promoted our salvation without your will, and that was wrought by you which the hand and counsel of God decreed to be done. That death thus sets us free, but is a charge against you. Ye only justly lose that which ye wished all to lose." See on  Acts 2:234. The fourth reason is given by S.  John 18:11. "The cup which My Father hath given Me, shall I not drink it? God ordained this cup of the Passion from all eternity, and now gives it Me to drink. Shall I not eagerly take it from His hand, and gladly drain it out?" Observe, He had before deprecated it as a very bitter cup of gall, but now, on knowing the Father"s will, He embraces it, as full of honeyed sweetness. For what is sweeter than for Him to obey God, to offer Himself as a holocaust to God, to make Himself a sacrifice to God for the salvation of men? "How sweetly," says S. Bernard (Serm. ii. in Pent.), "didst Thou hold converse with men! How abundantly didst Thou bestow on them many and great blessings! How boldly didst Thou suffer such indignities and cruelties for men, so as to draw honey from the rock, and oil from the hardest stone!" ( Deuteronomy 32:13). Which was hard set against Thy words, harder still at Thy wounds, most hard at the horrors of the Cross; for in all these sufferings He was as a lamb before His shearers, and opened not His mouth ( Isaiah 53:7).
