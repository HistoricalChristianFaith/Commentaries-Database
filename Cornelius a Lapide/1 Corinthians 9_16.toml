Woe is unto me if I preach not the gospel. It appears from this that strict injunctions were given to the Apostles (S.  Matthew 28:19) to preach the Gospel and teach all nations, insomuch that, if they had neglected to do Song of Solomon , they would have sinned mortally. For on those that neglect this their duty he pronounces the woe of the wrath of God and of hell. By the same injunctions all pasters, Bishops, and Archbishops are now bound. Cf. chap. i17.
