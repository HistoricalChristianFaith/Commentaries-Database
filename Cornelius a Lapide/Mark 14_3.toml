A woman having an alabaster box of ointment of precious spikenard. "Nard," says Pliny. (l12 , c12), "is a shrub which has a heavy and thick, but short, black, and easily broken root. It has a strong smell, like cypress, and a pungent taste. The leaf is small and thick, and the tops unfold into ears, so that spikenard is spoken of as being doubly endowed with both leaves and ears." From the leaves of nard ointment is made—that which is called foliated; but that made from the ears or spikes is called spikenard; and this is superior to the foliated, because it has more substance and marrow, so to say. Instead of nardus spicatus (Vulg.), the Syriac has nardus copitalis, i.e, chief, excellent, principal. As I have observed, the spikenard is superior to the foliated. The Greek has Ï€Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¹ÎºÎ·ÌƒÏ‚, which the Vulg. of S. John translates pistici. Pisticus is the same as spiked. Wherefore the Arabic trans, the best.
