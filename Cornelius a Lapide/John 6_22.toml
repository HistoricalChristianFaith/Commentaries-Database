The next day, &c, across the sea, understand, in respect of the disciples, who had sailed to the other side of the lake. The meaning Isaiah ,—The day after that on which Christ had fed the five thousand, the multitude who had been thus fed continuing in that place across the sea, when they knew that there was only one boat there, in which the disciples had embarked alone, Jesus being left on the land—they sought Jesus, must be understood. For they did not know that He had walked on the sea by night, and joined the ship.
