Pilate said unto them, Ye have a watch (i.e, the soldiers assigned you for His crucifixion; use them now to guard Him in the grave). 
Go your way, make it as sure as ye can. Guard Him as ye know how (Vulg.), i.e, in the best way ye know. I leave to your skill and prudence the mode of doing it. I do not wish to interfere any more in this matter. "As if taught by experience," says S. Chrysostom, "he does not wish to act with them any further." 
Some take the word (Î­Ï‡ÎµÏ„Îµ) imperatively, Take ye, summon ye the guard. But it is more forcible to consider it in the indicative mood, "Ye have," &c. (So Vulg, Arab, and A. V.)
