The father therefore knew. "From hence we may understand," says Bede (in Catena), "that there are degrees of faith, as well as of other virtues. There is the beginning, the increase, and the perfection of faith. This man"s faith had its beginning when he asked for his son"s safety: its increase when he believed the word of the Lord saying, Thy son liveth: it was perfected by the announcement of his servants." Moreover, because this nobleman dwelt at Capharnaum, as well as the centurion, we need not doubt that they were friends; and that the centurion through this miracle, which was prior in point of time, conceived so great faith in Christ that he said, "Lord, I am not worthy that Thou shouldst enter under my roof, but speak the word only, and my servant shall be healed" ( Matthew 8:8). 
Tropologically, listen to Theophylact, "The little king (regulus) is every Prayer of Manasseh , not only because, according to the soul, he is nigh to the King of all, but because he has assumed dominion over all things. The son is a mind fevered with depraved pleasures and desires. The going down of Christ is His merciful condescension. Christ saith, Go thy way, i.e, show continual progress in good things: then thy son shall live. Otherwise he will die, if thou ceasest to walk (aright)" 
Finally, he was healed at the seventh hour, 1. because as Origen says, seven is the symbol of the Sabbath, and of rest, in which is health2. Because the same number is the symbol of the seven-fold Holy Spirit, in Whom is all salvation.
