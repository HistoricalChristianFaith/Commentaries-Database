They were in admiration at His doctrine: literally, they admired in His doctrine. This is a Hebraism. For the Hebrews use Î± as a preposition of contact either corporal or mental in the place of an accusative. Thus they say, I touch in the hand, instead of, I touch the hand; I believe in God, instead of, I believe God; I admire in Wisdom of Solomon , for I admire wisdom.
