And I will ask the Father, &c, i.e, If ye persevere in My love, and keep My commandments, I will obtain for you by My prayers the Holy Ghost, which the Father will pour upon you at Pentecost. And He will work through you even greater things than I have wrought. 
And I will ask, as man. For Christ as man prays for us, says S. Augustine. 
Another Comforter, i.e, another than Myself. From hence it is plain that Christ also was the Paraclete of the Apostles and the faithful. That Isaiah , He is—1. an Advocate, an Intercessor, according to those words of Paul, "We have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous." 2. An Exhorter, an Inciter3. A Comforter, as the Syriac translates. All these meanings are included in the Greek Ï€Î±Î¶Î¬ÎºÎ»Î·Ï„Î¿Ï‚. But when Christ went away, He sent another Paraclete, even the Holy Ghost, who in these three things took Christ"s place. For, 1. He is the Advocate of the faithful, "Who intercedes for us with groanings unutterable" ( Romans 8:26). He likewise is our Exhorter and Consoler. To these two offices Christ here specially refers. As though He said, I, 0 ye disciples, have taught you until this present; I have called you, and comforted you, and you are very sad on account of My near departure. But lift up your minds and trust. For I will send you another Comforter in My place, who will teach, console, and protect you, not for a little while, but all through your life. The Holy Spirit then is this Paraclete, i.e, 1. An Exhorter, an Inciter, because He stirred up the Apostles to undertake noble works of virtue for the glory of God, that they should preach the Gospel throughout the whole world, not fearing tyrants or tortures, yea, being ambitious of the most dreadful deaths for Christ"s sake2. A Consoler, because He would comfort and support them in adversities, distresses, doubts and temptations. For the Holy Spirit is as it were a burning and shining fire, which drives all darkness, fear, and torpor from the mind. As S. Bernard says (Serm2 , de. Pent.), "Those whom He fills, He makes to be fervent in spirit, and to have knowledge of the truth." And again, "The Paraclete gives the pledge of salvation, the light of knowledge; and the strength of life,—that what is impossible by nature should be made possible, yea easy, by grace." 
He will give you, 0 ye Apostles, at the next Pentecost. From hence S. Jerome (Qus9 , ad Hedib.) refutes the heresy of Montanus, whom Tertullian followed, who said that long after the Apostles the Holy Ghost first came down upon the heresiarch Montanus, A.D220 , and therefore that Montanus was the Paraclete promised by Christ. 
That He may abide with you for ever. From this promise of Christ it is that the Holy Ghost always abides in the Church, and assists the faithful, so as to be a Comforter in afflictions, and a stirrer-up to heroic works of virtue. S. Augustine proposes the objection, "How shall we keep the commandments, that we may receive Him, when, unless we do possess Him, we cannot keep them?" He answers, "He who loveth hath the Holy Spirit, and by having Him deserves to have more of Him, that by having more of Him, he may love more." 
The Spirit of Truth. Why is the Holy Ghost called the Spirit of Truth? First, S. Cyril answers, because He is the Spirit of the Song of Solomon , proceeding by Spiration from the Song of Solomon , whose special attributes are wisdom and truth, according to the words, I am the way, the truth, and the life. 
2. Because the Holy Ghost has declared to the world that Jesus is God, and the Son of God, the Messiah and Saviour. For this was what Christ pressed home, saying, Philippians , he that seeth Me, seeth the Father also. And I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. So S. Basil (lib2 , de Spirit Sanc. c. i8). 
3. Euthymius says, He is called the Spirit of Truth, i.e, most true and excellent, as opposed to an angel, the soul, or wind, which are spirits in a sense. 
4. Of truth, because He is worthy of credit, says S. Chrysostom. 
5. Others say that the Spirit of Truth means that He is the Spirit of the New Testament. For to it was the Holy Ghost reserved, as the Spirit of liberty and love, whereas in the Old Testament He was the Spirit of bondage and fear. 
6. And most plainly, the Holy Ghost is the Spirit of Truth, because He is the Author of all truth, and the alone Teacher and Giver of pure and perfect truth. He teaches us all truths necessary for salvation, and delivers us from all errors. And so Christ explains this to us, saying in the16th chapter, "When Hebrews , the Spirit of Truth, is come, He shall teach you all truth." So too in  Isaiah 11:2, the same Spirit is called "the Spirit of wisdom and counsel," &c, because He inspires us with those virtues. 
The Spirit of Truth therefore is opposed to the evil spirit of the world, which is false and deceitful. Wherefore Christ adds, whom the world cannot receive. Whence S. Augustine (lib. de grat. Nov. Test.) says that the Holy Ghost is the soul of the Church. "The Holy Spirit is the love and bond of union of the Father and the Son. To Him pertains the Society by which we are made one. A man"s body consists of many members, and one soul animates them all, causing the eye to see, and the ear to hear. So likewise the Holy Ghost contains and animates the members of the Body of Christ which is the Church." 
Whom the world cannot receive, i.e. worldly and carnal men, who gape after earthly desires and vain riches. Such persons cannot receive the Holy Ghost, because He is altogether heavenly, spiritual, and Divine, who teaches us to despise all earthly things as vanity, and to love and embrace heavenly things as true and solid. For as the Apostle says (Rom. viii.), "The prudence of the flesh is the enemy of God." (Vulg.) Whence S. Basil says (lib. de Spir. Sc.), "As in an unpolished mirror the images of things cannot be received nor discerned, so cannot a man receive the illumination of the Holy Ghost, unless he cast away sin and fleshly lusts," 
Because it seeth Him not, &c. Because it bath the eyes of the mind earthly, and blinded by the lusts of the flesh. Wherefore neither doth it know Him, i.e. practically, so as to love and desire Him. 
But ye shall know Him, &c. Know, i.e, His power, efficiency, doctrine, holiness. For He by His presence in you shall exercise His Divine power and grace. By which it shall come to pass that ye shall know Him, love Him when known, and long that He may be known to others. It is as the taste of pepper when it is bruised, or as the hidden power of fire in wood, which bursts forth into a mighty conflagration. 
Shall abide with you. The Vulg, with S. Augustine and Nonnus, reads Î¼ÎµÎ½ÎµÎ¯ in the fut. The Greek with a different accent has Î¼Î­Î½ÎµÎ¹, abides. With this agree the Syriac and Theophylact. Listen to S. Bernard (Serm20 , inter Parv.), "The Holy Ghost proceeds, breathes, inhabits, fills, glorifies. He is said to proceed in two ways, from whence, and whither. From whence? From the Father and the Son. Whither? To the creature. By proceeding He predestinates. By breathing He calls those whom He has predestinated. By inhabiting He justifies those whom He has called. By filling He heaps merits upon those whom He has justified. By glorifying He enriches with rewards those upon whom He has accumulated merits."
