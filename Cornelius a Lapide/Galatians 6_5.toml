For every man shall bear his own burden. This seems primÃ¢ facie in conflict with ver2. Jerome harmonises the two by referring ver2to the present, and ver5 to the future, i.e, to the day of judgment. In the world we can help each other, but at the dread Tribunal neither Job ,, Daniel , nor Noah can free the souls of their own sons even, but each shall bear his own iniquities. Cf.  Ezekiel 14:14. Christ will examine us, not as to the doings of others, but as to our own. Let us prove our own doings, therefore, to make sure that they will be able to stand the last great trial. 
The Protestants therefore are wrong in twisting these words into an argument against purgatory, and against the prayers we offer for souls there. The Apostle is not speaking of purgatory, but of the day of judgment, and then he says each shall bear his own burden. Before that day, however, we can, as required by the article of the Communion of Saints, help one another, whether those we help be living or in purgatory. 
Observe that each of us, as he leaves this life, takes with him nothing but his own works. These works are, as it were, burdens that we carry as we travel towards the judgment-seat of Christ, which, when examined, will show whether our destiny is heaven or hell. As is the burden, so will the bearer be declared, and so will be the burden of reward or punishment.
