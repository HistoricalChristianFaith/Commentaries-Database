Then all those virgins, &c. At the sound of the Archangel"s trumpet, all Christians shall rise, and shall be anxious with what mind and conscience they shall go to the Judge. As Auctor Imperfecti says, "They shall examine their faith, they shall consider their works, they shall interrogate their conscience." "For," as S. Augustine says (Serm23 , de Verbis Dom.), "they began to trim their lamps, means nothing else but to prepare to render an account of their works to God." But S. Hilary says, "The taking up the lamps is the return of the soul to the body; the light is a bright conscience of good works, which Isaiah , as it were, contained in the vessel of the body." 
S. Montanus and his fellow-martyrs, disciples of S. Cyprian, received in a vision a warning from God of their martyrdom by means of lamps. "One of them, whose name was Reno, saw them, in his sleep, led out one by one. As they came forth, lamps were given to each. And no one came forth without a lamp going before him. And when we had come forth with our lamps, he awoke, and related to us the dream. Then were we glad, trusting that we should walk with Christ, who is a lantern to our feet, and the Word of God. Immediately afterwards we were dragged before the procurator." (See their Acta in Surias, Feb4.)
