Which now of these three, thinkest thou, was neighbour unto him that fell among the thieves? The true meaning of the passage is this, Which of these three seems to thee to have acted as neighbour to the wounded man? and in this sense it was understood by the lawyer who answered, "He that showed mercy upon him." Christ asked the lawyer which of the three by his actions showed that he looked upon the wounded man as a neighbour. For neighbour is a correlative term, and a man can only be a neighbour to a neighbour, just as a man can only be compassionate to one who needs pity. 
Hence Christ indicates the one by the other, and thus answers the lawyer"s inquiry. Christ inverted His answer, in order to give an example of the perfection of brotherly love, so that the lawyer and all men might learn to imitate the Samaritan. Hence Jesus said, "Go and do thou likewise," v37. 
So also in the parable of the two debtors, Christ asks, "Which of them will love him most?" See chap. vii42. S. Augustine, Bede, and all the Fathers.
