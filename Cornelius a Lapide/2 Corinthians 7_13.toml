Therefore we were comforted. By your repentance, zeal, &c, as was said (vers6 , 7 , 9 , 11). The Latin version points this verse as follows: "Before God, therefore, we were comforted. But in our comfort we joyed the more," &c. If with some Greek copies we read "in your comfort," S. Paul refers to the good news that he had heard of their repentance. "The tears of penitents," says S. Bernard, "are the wine of angels," nay, they are the wine of penitents, for nothing so makes glad the heart as compunction. How sweet to the penitent is it with the Magdalene to weep at the feet of Jesus, to bathe them with tears, to wipe them, to kiss them, and then to hear: "Thy sins are forgiven thee." None but one who has tried it knows this sweetness.
