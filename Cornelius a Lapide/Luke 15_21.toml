And the son said unto him, Father, I have sinned, &c. He desires, says the Interlinear, that to be done by grace, which he acknowledges himself to be unworthy of by any merit of his own. (See above on ver18.) He omits to say, "make me as one of thy hired servants," either because his father, out of love and joy, had cut short his confession, by bidding the attendants "bring forth the best robe," or because his father"s embrace and kiss had encouraged him to hope that again he might be acknowledged as a son. "He does not add," says S. Augustine (Lib. ii. Qu√¶st. Evang. q33), "what he had before determined to say, for after the kiss of his father he most nobly disdained to become a hireling." Titus , however, is of opinion that the words were actually uttered, although S. Luke , has not recorded them.
