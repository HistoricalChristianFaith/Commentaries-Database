To Demetrius testimony is borne by all, concerning his hospitality, probity, and all other Christian virtues. He proposes him therefore to Caius for imitation and assistance. Our Serarius conjectures that this Demetrius was the same as the chief of the craftsmen of Diana, who raised a tumult against S. Paul at Ephesus (Acts xix24), who afterwards repented, and changed his persecution for the propagation of the faith. But there is no mention of this in any ancient history. 
And by the truth itself: the testimony of men may be erroneous, but the testimony of the truth can never be deceptive. The truth bears testimony to Demetrius. That Isaiah , Demetrius leads a truly Christian life, and does Christian works. His life therefore is a true witness to his virtue. 
We also bear witness, which is most weighty and certain, inasmuch as it is episcopal, apostolic, and canonical, as being that of one of the sacred writers.
