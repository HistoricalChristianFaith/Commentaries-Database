And hath given, &c. Because Christ as God hath life in Himself, from hence, in that He is Prayer of Manasseh , He hath power to judge all men. The word because must here be taken specifically, and means inasmuch as. But it may be taken even more expressively in a reduplicative and causative sense, as giving the express reason why God gave Christ judicial authority. That reason is because Christ is the Son of Prayer of Manasseh , i.e, because He deigned to become Incarnate. As though it were said, "God hath willed to judge men by Christ a Prayer of Manasseh , that judgment might take place in a congruous manner, that Isaiah , after a sensible and human manner, that as He Himself saved the world by the man Christ, so He would also judge it by the same, by that Prayer of Manasseh , I say, who is God, who took human life, and laid it down for man"s salvation." 
Wherefore it is that He by this great emptying of Himself, by which He willed to become Prayer of Manasseh , merited this exaltation of judicial power, that He who was the Saviour of all should be the judge of all. So Maldonatus and others. S. Augustine gives also a twofold reason. The first Isaiah , "that those who are to be judged might see their judge. For those who shall be judged will be both good and bad. It was right that in the judgment the form of a servant should be shown both to the good and the bad, but the form of God should be reserved for the good only." The second reason Isaiah , "because the judge shall have that form in which He stood before His judge. That form which was judged shall judge: unrighteously was it judged, but righteously shall it judge."
