Jesus said unto her, I am the Resurrection and the Life. I am He who recalls to life, I am He who gives life; by Me both the dead rise and the living live; therefore I am able now, immediately, before the general resurrection, to raise up thy brother from death. Whence S. Augustine: She says, My brother shall rise again in the last day. Thou sayest truly; but He by whom he shall then rise is able [to raise him] also now, because He is the Resurrection and the Life: that Isaiah , Christ saith, "I am the cause of the Resurrection and Life, so that all rise again by Me, and no one except by Me can rise." Others explain thus, "I am the resurrection to life," which is an hendiadys. He that believeth in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. 
To Martha asking that the life of the body should be restored to Lazarus, Christ replies more fully, and assigns assuredly life also to the soul; so that his soul should live here a new life by greater grace, and in the future by glory. "The soul shall live," says Augustine, "until the body shall rise again, never afterwards to die!" The sense then Isaiah , "Not only thy brother shall rise again by My power, but whosoever is faithful, who believes in Me with a living faith, working by love, shall live even though he were dead: as well because his sou1shall live always by Me a life of love and grace, and of glory in heaven; as because his body shall be raised by Me from death to a life blessed and eternal in the day of judgment;" to which Christ here chiefly alludes. Wherefore, although it (the body) may die, yet this will be for a short time only, so that death will seem not so much death as sleep and repose; from which it shall awake and arise on the day of judgment. 
S. Cyprian (De Mortalit.) cites this place and explains: "If we believe in Christ, let us have faith in His words and promises; and since we shall not die for ever, let us come in glad security to Christ, with whom we shall live and reign for ever."
