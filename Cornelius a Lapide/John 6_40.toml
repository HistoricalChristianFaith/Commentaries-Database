And this is the will, &c. He that seeth, Greek, Î¸ÎµÏ‰Î¶Ï‰ÌƒÎ½, i.e, who considers and contemplates the Song of Solomon , seeing Him with the eyes not of the body, but of the mind, i.e, believing in Him, and obeying Him. Lactantius (lib7 , c9) observes out of Trismegistus that the word Î¸ÎµÏ‰Î¶Ï‰ÌƒÎ½, especially applied to Divine things. 
And I will raise him up: the Greek Î±Ì‰Î½Î±ÏƒÏ„Î®ÏƒÏ‰, may be translated either by the future indicative, I will raise; or by the aorist conjunctive, that I may raise (as the Vulgate has it in ver39). Christ teaches the Resurrection because "the hope of Christians is the resurrection of the dead," as Tertullian says. Hear S. Chrysostom (Hom46): "Everywhere He makes mention of life: for we are drawn by the desire of it, and there is nothing sweeter than not to die. In the Old Testament, indeed, long life and many days were promised: but now is promised not merely a long life, but endless life. At the same time also He wishes to show that He now revokes the punishment produced by sin, by remitting the sentence of death, and bringing in eternal life, contrary to the decree of the former times."
