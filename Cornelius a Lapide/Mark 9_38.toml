But Jesus said, Do not forbid him, for there is no man that doth a miracle in My name, and can soon (Gr.Ï„Î¬Ï‡Î±, i.e, easily) speak ill of Me. Do not hinder him in a good work, and one that honours Me; because even if he does not follow Me, yet he is doing the selfsame thing which you do, that is to say, he is celebrating My name, and he is making it known to men by casting out devils. Wherefore he does nothing that is against My name, but rather propagates and glorifies it.
