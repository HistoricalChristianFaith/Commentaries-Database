Rejoice with me; for I have found my sheep which was lost. Î£Ï…Î³Ï‡Î¬Î¶Î·Ï„Î­ Î¼Î¿Î¹, Let My joy be one with yours—partake of My joy. His joy is so great that he cannot confine it to Himself, His friends must rejoice also. He further indicates that the event is such a happy one, that it ought to afford matter for rejoicing to all. He says not, "Rejoice with the sheep that is found," but, "with Me." Because truly our life is His joy. S. Gregory.
