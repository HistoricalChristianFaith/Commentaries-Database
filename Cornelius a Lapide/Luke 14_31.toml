Or what king, going to make war against another king, &c. By this, says Titus , we are given to understand that we have a war to wage against the hostile powers of Satan and that law which, reigning in our members, is continually the cause of inward perturbation and strife. 
So also S. Cyril: "The ten thousand of him who is going to fight with the king who has double the number, signify the simplicity of the Christian about to contend with the subtlety of the devil." And Theophylact: "The king is sin, and devils are his satellites, who, compared to us, are considered to have greater strength." 
But S. Gregory (Hom37) gives another interpretation. "The king that is about to come against us is Christ, who will come with a double army against a single one. For while we are scarcely prepared in deeds only, He will discomfit us at once, both in thought and deed. Let us send Him therefore an embassy; our tears, our works of mercy, and propitiatory victim."
