I rejoiced greatly when the brethren came and bore witness to thy truth. Vulgate. Truth here in the first place means the faith. "They testify that thou dost constantly persevere in Christian faith and doctrine through all persecutions." 2d This truth means moral conduct. "They testify that thou livest according to the faith and truth of the Gospel, that thy character is conformable to the Gospel which thou professest." 3d Truth in this place may be taken to mean charity and beneficence. For this is especially taught and sanctioned by the truth of the Gospel. 4th. Truth may be put for sincerity and candour as opposed to hypocrisy and dissimulation. "They testify that thou art in all things candid and sincere."
