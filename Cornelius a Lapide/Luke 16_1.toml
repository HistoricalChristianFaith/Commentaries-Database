And He said also unto His disciples, There was a certain rich Prayer of Manasseh , which had a steward; and the same was accused unto him that he had wasted his goods. Having rebuked in three parables those who murmured because He received penitents, Christ now adds a fourth and fifth on almsgiving and frugality, for the proud and avaricious Pharisees refused both pardon to the penitent, and relief to those who were in want. Gloss. 
Unto His disciples, i.e. His hearers, those who were His followers, although they had not given up all, as the Apostles. 
A steward, Î¿Î¹Ì‰ÎºÎ¿Î½ÏŒÎ¼Î¿Ï‚, one who had the management of his master"s property, and was answerable for the letting of his land. 
Hence we learn "that we are not masters of what we possess, but rather stewards of that which is another"s." S. Ambrose and Theophylact. 
For although as regards men we are the absolute masters of our own possessions, yet with respect to God, who is Lord over all, we are but stewards. Because, whatever we possess was given us for our own moderate use and for the relief of our poorer brethren, and in the day of judgment we shall have to render a strict account of our stewardship. 
So S. Paul says, "Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God. Moreover, it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."  1 Corinthians 4:2. For all our gifts and endowments are not our own, but belong to God who gave them. Hence we are bound to use them not for our own pleasure, but according to His will. Thou hast genius, a keen judgment, a retentive memory, Wisdom of Solomon , eloquence, or the like! Forget not that thou art a steward of these gifts, not a master. Remember that thou hast to give an account of their use, and take heed to use them to the honour and glory of God. Hear S. Chrysostom, "There is an erroneous opinion that all the good things of this life which we possess are our own, and that we are lords over them. But we are as it were guests and strangers, whose departure draweth nigh, and dispensers of another"s bounty. We ought therefore to assume the humility and modesty of a steward, for nothing is our own, but all things are the gift of God." 
Was accused, Î´Î¹ÎµÎ²Î»Î®Î¸Î¸, denounced, Arabic. Hence the devil Î´Î¹Î¬Î²Î¿Î»Î¿Ï‚, is called the "accuser" ( Revelation 12:10), because he accuses us before God. "We are accused," says the Interlinear, "not only when we do evil, but when we omit to do good." For a steward ought to omit nothing which concerns his own duty or his master"s good. 
Had wasted his goods, i.e. by carelessness and riotous living.
