s20 , 21.—Peter, turning, saw that disciple, &c. Peter, in obedience to Christ, was beginning to follow Him,—presently John also, and the rest of his companions followed. Peter then, being anxious about John and his companions, turned and looked back. Seeing them following, he omitted mention of the rest, and asked Christ what was to become of John , whether, namely, John was to follow Christ in the same way as himself, and to die upon a cross. Peter asked this, both because he loved John above the rest, and also because he knew that Christ loved him above the rest, and that he had reclined upon His breast at supper. He wondered that Christ should pass over this very dearly beloved John; and so he calls him to His remembrance. As though he said, "What will be the fate of Thy well-beloved John? Surely, as Thou didst prefer him to me at the supper, Thou mightest now rightly prefer him in the pastoral office, and subject me to him as a pastor. But since it has seemed good to Thee to do otherwise, at least I would desire to know what is to he the history of his life and death." Finally, the question was asked, because Peter here pays back, as it were, to John , the question which John at his instigation had asked at the last supper, when he asked Jesus who should betray Him? Peter asked Jesus concerning John , thinking that John desired to know what was to be his future lot, and yet did not dare to ask Christ. Listen to S. Chrysostom. "Because the Lord had foretold him great things, and had committed, the whole world to him, and prophesied his martyrdom, and testified larger love, desiring also to receive John as his partner, he said, But this Prayer of Manasseh , what (of him)? For Peter dearly loved John , and thinking that he wished to ask a question concerning himself, but did not dare, he undertook to ask for him." 
From hence let prelates learn not to follow their own affections, not indulge their love, but to follow reason in all things, and to appoint such pastors only as they deem most meet for the pastoral office. Even so here Christ did not appoint John , although he was His most dearly beloved kinsman, to be His Vicar, and successor, and the Pontiff of the Church, but Peter.

After these things, &c. From this it appears that Peter and the other Apostles had gone from Judea into Galilee, as Christ had bidden them (S. Matthew 23:10). For this appearance of Christ took place in Galilee, when Hebrews , being about to go into heaven, in order that He might provide for the government of the faithful, appointed Peter to be the Head of the Church, and His Vicar upon earth. This is why S. John subjoins these things, and so concludes his Gospel.
