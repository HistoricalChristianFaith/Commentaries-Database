Isaiah is speaking of the Incarnation of Christ and of this present life. And hence Chrysostom, Ambrose, Theophylact, Oecumenius take this verse of the miracles of Christ, and of the wisdom, virtues, and grace which Christ by living here on earth has imparted to us. (Cornelius a Lapide Com. on 1 Cor 2:9)
