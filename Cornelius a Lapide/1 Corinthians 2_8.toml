Which none of the princes of this world knew. The pronoun is better referred to glory than to Wisdom of Solomon , and the sense is: if this Wisdom of Solomon , or rather this glory and its being predestined in Christ, had been known by Pilate, Annas, Caiaphas, and the other princes of the world, they would never have crucified the Lord of Glory, viz, Christ, by whose merits this eternal glory was predestined and prepared for us from eternity. Gabriel Vasquez comments well on this passage (lib. i. disp2 , c3). The Apostle tacitly implies that none other of the princes of this world knew this glory and wisdom of Christ. For, Ã  fortiori, the Jews were wiser than the Gentiles, especially in Divine things; if, therefore, they did not know it, much more were the others ignorant of it.
