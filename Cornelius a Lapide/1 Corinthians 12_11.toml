Dividing to every man severally as He will. Dividing to each one individually his own gifts and graces. Cf. S. Jerome (contra Pelag. dial1). Origen understood "as He will" to refer to each several man. It refers, of course, to the Holy Spirit1. Hence, as Theophylact says, the Holy Spirit is Lord and God. Hebrews , is not produced as an effect, but He effects all things equally with the Father, who worketh all in all (ver6). The working all in all assigned to the Father in ver6 is here assigned to the Spirit. 
2. It follows that the Holy Spirit, being God, has free-will and works freely. 
3. Ablard, Wyclif, and Calvin may be refuted by this verse, in their teaching that God cannot do anything but what He actually does do. This is to rob God of His omnipotence, and to subject Him, like Prayer of Manasseh , to fate, and therefore to transfer His Divinity to fate. For, if this were Song of Solomon , God would not work as He chose, but as fate willed, under whom He and all things would be placed.
