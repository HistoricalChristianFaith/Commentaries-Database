Since the world began, &c. Granted that Moses and the Prophets wrought many miracles, yet they never restored sight to one who was born blind. Jesus who has restored my sight must needs be a greater Prophet than they. He retorted the words of the Pharisees on themselves, "Ye prefer Moses to Christ, but I prefer Christ. Ye choose to be Moses" disciples, I am Christ"s."
