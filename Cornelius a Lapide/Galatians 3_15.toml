I speak after the manner of men. Cf.  Job 31:33, and  Hosea 6:7. S. Paul"s meaning is that in dealing with spiritual things he uses material illustrations, as, e.g, that of a testator and his testament, to prove that we inherit Abraham"s blessing, not through the law, but through faith in Christ, according to the covenant made with Abraham, and that, therefore, the Galatians should feel shame for attributing less to God than to the testaments and covenants of men. This is his fifth proof, that we are justified by faith and not by the law. 
Though it be but a man"s covenant. No one adds to or subtracts from a man"s testament when once it is duly drawn up.
