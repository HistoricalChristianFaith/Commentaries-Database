It is sown in dishonour. Man"s body when it is buried and thrown like seed into the ground, is base, thick, heavy, opaque. 
It is raised in glory. It will rise glorious clear, resplendent. The Apostle here strikes at another root of their error. There were some who at that time denied the resurrection of the body on the ground that the body, as being heavy and fleshy, was unfitted to be the home of the soul in bliss, and to enjoy the Divine life, as S. Dionysius testifies when refuting them (Eccles. Hierarch. c7). The Apostle cuts this away by declaring that to the soul in glory a corresponding glorified body must be given. 
It is sown in weakness. Is weak, slow, inert when it dies and is buried. 
It is raised in power. Powerful, quick, agile.
