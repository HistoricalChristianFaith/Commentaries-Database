I receive not brightness (Vulg. claritatem), Greek, Î´ÏŒÎ¾Î±Î½, i.e, glory, from men. There is an anticipation, "Ye, 0 ye Scribes, suspect, and object that I preach such great things of Myself, and so carefully endeavour to prove My dignity and authority out of the desire of vain glory, that I may catch the breeze of popularity, being desirous of being taken to be the Son of God. I answer that I do not preach these things about Myself in order that I may get glory from men, but for your own sakes, that I may save you. For I am even athirst for your salvation. For I know that no one can be saved, and possess eternal life, but by Me, whom God has appointed the Saviour of the world." So S. Cyril.
