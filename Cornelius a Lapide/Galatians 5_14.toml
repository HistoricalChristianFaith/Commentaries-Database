For all the law is fulfilled in one word. That Isaiah , the whole law so far as it concerns our neighbour, or according to what was said in the preceding verse, as we serve one another. Cf.  Romans 13:8. S. Augustine (de Trin. lib. viii.), S. Thomas, Anselm, however, say that the whole law rests on the love of God or of our neighbour, but that the latter presupposes the former, inasmuch as our neighbour is to be loved for the sake of God. Therefore he who loves his neighbour both fulfils the law, which says, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and also loves God and fulfils the law, which says, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God.
