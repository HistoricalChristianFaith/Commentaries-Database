The things which are seen are seen are temporal; but the things which are not seen are eternal. S. Augustine (Sentent. No270) says well: "There is this difference between things temporal and things eternal, that the former are loved more before they are obtained, but, seem worthless when they arrive. Nothing satisfies the mind but a true and certain eternity of incorruptible joy. But eternal joy is more ardently loved when obtained than when longed for. No one can value it above its true worth, so that when he attains it it seems vile in his eyes through having been too ardently longed for. But so great is the excellency of heaven that charity will obtain far more than faith has believed or hope desired." See also S. Gregory, Hom. in Evang, where he draws out at length this distinction between carnal and spiritual pleasures.
