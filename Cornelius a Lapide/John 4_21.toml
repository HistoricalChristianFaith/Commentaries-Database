Jesus saith, &c. Ye, i.e, whosoever rightly, according to God"s ordinance, wish to worship God the Father. The meaning Isaiah , the hour cometh, the time of the Evangelical Law and doctrine, about to be instituted by Me, by which, immediately after My death, which is shortly to come to pass, the Law of Moses shall be abolished, and all its rites for worshipping God in the Temple at Jerusalem, as well as in this your rival temple on Garizim. For throughout the whole world Christian churches shall be built, in which God shall be worshipped in spirit and in truth. This is what Malachi predicted under the reign of Christ ( Malachi 1:10-11). 
The Hebrew for the pure or clean oblation is mincha, sc, the Eucharist, or the oblation of the Body and Blood of Christ, which alone has succeeded to all the ancient sacrifices of animals.
