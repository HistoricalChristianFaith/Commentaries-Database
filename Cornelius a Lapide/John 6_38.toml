For I came down, &c Christ gives the reason why He will not cast out him whom the Father hath given Him, viz, because He Himself came in flesh, and into the world, for this end alone, that He might do the Father"s will, which Isaiah , that those whom the Father wills to give to Him, and to save, Christ should accept and save. This is why He adds in explanation, This is His will, &c. Listen to S. Cyril in the Council of Ephesus, profoundly handling these things. "When He adds that He was accomplishing not His own, but His Father"s will, He quells indirectly the madness of the Jews, who were always labouring to bring about their own will, and holding cheap the Divine laws, and making of no value what was pleasing to their Lord- whilst, I say, He here openly commends their prompt profession of obedience, He nevertheless darkly rebukes their rebellion."
