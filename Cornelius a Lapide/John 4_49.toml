The ruler saith, &c. My child, Greek, Ï€Î±Î¹Î´Î¹Î¿Î½ Î¼Î¿Ï…, i.e, my little Song of Solomon , meaning, my most beloved, my only delight. "The ruler," says S. Chrysostom, "being distressed by his son"s affliction, did not pay much attention then to the words of Jesus, but was wholly taken up with the cure. See how he grovels on the earth—Come down, ere my child die—as if Jesus could not raise the dead, or knew not that he had a son."
