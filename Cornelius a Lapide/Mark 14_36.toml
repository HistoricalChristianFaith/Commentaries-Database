Abba Father: Gr. Î±Ì‰Î²Î²Î±Ìƒ ÏŒ Ï€Î±Ï„Î®Î¶, where Father is in the nominative, as Mark interprets the Syriac word Î±Ì‰Î²Î² by the Greek Ï€Î±Ï„Î®Î¶; or rather the nom. Ï€Î±Ï„Î®Î¶ is put for the voc. Ï€Î¬Ï„ÎµÎ¶. For by a mark of affection, with the deepest feeling of the heart, Christ repeated the word Abba, or Father. Wherefore the Syriac has Abba Abi, i.e, Father, My Father. The Arabic has0 Father. S. Augustine (lib. de Consens. Evang. l4) thinks that Christ used both the Greek and the Syriac word; and that He spoke precisely as Mark has it, namely, Î¬Î²Î²Î±Ìƒ ÏŒ Ï€Î±Ï„Î®Î¶. For so the Apostle speaks, "In whom we cry, Abba Father" ( Romans 8:15, Vulg.). "We must think," says S. Augustine, "that the Lord said "Abba Father" to intimate the mystery of His Church, which was to be gathered out of Jews and Gentiles." And the Scholiast in S. Jerome says, "He speaks in Hebrew and Greek, because there is no distinction between Jew and Greek."
