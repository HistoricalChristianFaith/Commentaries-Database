And the publicans justified God. Confessed the goodness of God in sending the Baptist, and in offering them salvation :through his baptism and preaching. See verse Luke 35;  1 Timothy 3:16; and S. Matthew 11:l9. 
There is a question whether this verse and the one following, give the words of the Evangelist or of our Lord Himself. But as the opening words of the31st verse, "and the Lord said," are absent from the best MSS, we may conclude, with Maldonatus, that these two verses are a part of the continuous discourse of Christ.
