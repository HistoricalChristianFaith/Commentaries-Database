And we believe, &c. The Greek has the article to both Christ and Son: ÏŒ Î§Î¶Î¹ÏƒÏ„Î¿Ì€Ï‚, the Christ promised by God, and expected for so many ages: ÏŒ Ï…Î¯Î¿Ì€Ï‚, i.e, the Son of God by nature and substance, not adopted by grace. "Diligently consider this," says Cyril, "that everywhere, especially with the prefix of the article, they say, Thou art the very Christ, the very Son of the Living God, truly and naturally separating (this) Son from other sons of God, who being called, are adopted by grace. And we being conjoined by likeness to Him, are called sons." 
We know, from the testimony of John the Baptist, our prophet and master, from the many and great miracles which Thou hast wrought, from Thy heavenly doctrine, and the holiness of Thy life, which we who are in constant intercourse with Thee, know to be heavenly and Divine. 
Son of God: the Greek adds, Ï„Î¿Ï…Ìƒ Î¾Ï‰Î½Ï„Î¿Ï‚, the living, so also the Syriac and Arabic read. The meaning Isaiah , We believe that Thou art the Son of God. Wherefore, we also believe that all Thy sayings are Divine and most true, even when we do not understand them, and therefore that they are life-giving, and confer salvation and eternal life. For Thou art the Son of the Living God, who in His Essence is Life, which He communicates to Thee: therefore nothing can proceed from Thee but what is vital and life-giving: neither do we expect anything else from Thee.
