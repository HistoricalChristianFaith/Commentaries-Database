He that saith he knoweth Him, that Isaiah , with true and saving knowledge, such as leads to eternal life, and keepeth not His commandments is a liar. As the Apostle said ( Romans 1:21) of the philosophers who knew God, but only in a speculative and barren way, "When they knew God, they glorified Him not as God."
