Then Pilate entered into the judgment-hall gain. He had gone out, to hear the charges which the Jews brought against Jesus, and then came back again to examine Him. 
And said unto Him, Art Thou the King of the Jews? It appears from  Luke 23:2, that when the Chief Priests saw that they could not move Pilate by their mere authority to condemn Jesus, they brought against Him the charge of perverting the nation, of forbidding to pay tribute to Csar. Pilate caught at this last charge, and put this question. See notes on Matt. xxvii11.
