If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator. This admits of being rendered, "If any man that is a brother be called a fornicator." Hence S. Augustine (contra Parmen. lib. iii. c2) says: "Is called," i.e, is judged and declared guilty of fornication. 
Or covetous . . . or an extortioner. The first word here denoted one who stealthily seizes others" goods by fraud, the second one who seizes them by open violence. But the miser who clings to his money too tenaciously will not be excluded from heaven, unless he refuse to give alms to the poor in their great necessity: much less is he to be excluded from the society of the faithful. But the Apostle orders this in this verse. Therefore "covetous," as I said, must mean a thief of robber. Cf.  2 Corinthians 7:2 and  2 Corinthians 12:18.
