But He turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of. By spirit we must understand "disposition of mind," whether for virtue or vice. Ye know not what spirit worketh in you. Ye think ye are led by the spirit of God, when ye are prompted by impatience and the spirit of vengeance. Ye know not to what spirit ye are called. Ye know not that ye should be meek and lowly, as I your Lord and Master am. Ye would imitate the zeal of Elijah, and demand "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth," Exod. xxi24. But this is not my spirit, nor is it the teaching of the new and Gospel Law, for I say unto you "Love your enemies, and do good unto those that hate you." S. Matt. v44. Have ye not heard and learned this from Me, or are ye so soon forgetful of my doctrine and teaching? He who had come, not for judgment but to show mercy, not in power but in humility, not in the glory of His Father but in lowly fashion as a Prayer of Manasseh , rebuked them because they were forgetful both of His teaching and of the merciful precepts of His Gospel. S. Jerome.
