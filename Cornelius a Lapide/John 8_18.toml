I am one that bear witness of Myself, &c. But thou wilt say, no one"s testimony is accepted in his own case, and therefore Christ"s testimony to Himself ought not to be accepted. But the answer Isaiah , that Christ as God witnesses to Himself as man. But God and man are two beings, and in Christ God was different from man: in nature, I mean, not in person. And from this very passage the Fathers gather against both Nestorians and Eutycheans, that in Christ there was one Person, the Divine, but two natures, the Divine and the human. So Cyril, Chrysostom, and S. Ambrose (de Fide v2). Besides this, God the Father and God the Son bore witness that Jesus was the Christ by the miracles which they wrought both through Him and for Him ( John 5:31-32). And especially when the Father spake in thunder out of heaven, This is My beloved Son. So Bede.
