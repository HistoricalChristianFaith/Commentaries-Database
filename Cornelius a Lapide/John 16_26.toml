In that day ye shall ask in My Name; and I say not unto you that I shall pray the Father for you. I said (xiv16), "I will pray the Father, and He shall give you another Comforter." But now there will be no need of My praying, for I shall soon send the Holy Spirit, who will teach you to pray to God in My Name with such great earnestness, that the Father will grant you all things at your prayer, and therefore ye will not then need such prayers as I offered to God when present with you. Hence some Fathers think that Christ does not pray for us in Heaven with prayers, properly so called, but merely by presenting His wounds to the Father. (See Vasquez, par. iii. tome1 , Qu√¶st21). But it is more probable that Christ does pray for us in heaven with prayers properly so called, as I have explained in Rom. viii24. Christ means that His earthly presence was not needed in order to pray for them as He used to do.
