Bartimus, the son of Timus. This blind Prayer of Manasseh , then, was called by a proper name, Bartimus, i.e, the son of Timus, as Bartholomew is the same as son of Ptolemy. The same was called also by the same name as his father Timus. Timus was the name of that Pythagorean philosopher who wrote the life of Pythagoras. 
Moreover, Bartimus is interpreted by Pagnini in three ways (in Nom. Hebraicis). The first is from S. Jerome, to the effect that Bartimus means the blind Song of Solomon , or the son of blindness. He says that it is a Syriac name, but corrupted from Barsemia, or Barsamus. Bar is Song of Solomon , semaia, blindness. 
The second opinion Isaiah , that it means the son of honour; as if compounded of the Syriac Baruch , a Song of Solomon , and the Gr. Ï„Î¹Î¼Î®, honour. 
The third Isaiah , that it means the son of the admirer, or admirable corn, or admirable purity. For this was what the blind man received from Christ. For being illuminated in body, he was far more illuminated in his soul. For bar means meal, or wheat, or purity, as well as son. Tamah is to admire. 
And followed Him in the way. Moraliter: Says the Gloss, Let us consider the way in which He goeth, and follow Him by humility and labours. The way is that of which He saith, "I am the way, the truth, and the life." This is "the narrow way," which leads to the heights of Jerusalem and Bethany, to the Mount of Olives, which is the mount of light and consolation; yea, which leads to Zion and the heavenly Jerusalem. The blind man therefore sees and follows, for he who rightly understands the life of Christ ought to follow and imitate it by his works. (Top)
