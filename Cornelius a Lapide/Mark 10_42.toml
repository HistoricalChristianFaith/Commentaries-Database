Ye know that they who seem to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them. Gr. ÎºÎ±Ï„Î±ÎºÏ…ÏÎ¹ÎµÏÎ¿Ï…ÏƒÎ¹Î½ Î±Ï…Ì‰Ï„Ï‰ÌƒÎ½, i.e, dominate over them, or against them. For who seem, the Gr. is Î¿Î¯ Î´Î¿ÎºÎ¿Ï…ÌƒÎ½Ï„ÎµÏ‚, i.e, who please themselves, and rejoice in ruling. For none rule more imperiously and harshly than those who are delighted with ruling and commanding. Whence the Arabic translates, they who think themselves princes of the people are their lords, i.e, they exercise, as it were, a tyrannical domination over them.
