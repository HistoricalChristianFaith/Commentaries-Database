He sent to him the elders of the Jews, beseeching him that he would come and heal his servant. S. Luke ascribes the request of the Jews to the Centurion himself, because they asked in his name; but the Centurion sought not that Christ should come unto him, but only that the Lord should be told, "My servant lieth at home sick of the palsy, grievously tormented." S.  Matthew 8:6-8 The Jews asked therefore that which they knew the Centurion desired, although he was too humble-minded to seek it. 
"That he would come," i.e, would give up everything else, and apply himself to the healing of the servant. An expression equivalent to the Hebrew word Ï€Î°, ba, come. 
Thus God came to Abimelech, Gen. xx; to Balaam, Num. xxii.; and to the Hebrews , Deut. xxxiii, when He appeared to them and gave them the Law. So it is said of the Baptist. John came, showed himself, neither eating nor drinking. The force of the passage lies therefore in the word "heal," that he would heal his servant, whether he came—went down—to his house or not.
