When the Pharisees were gathered together, &c. This was in the Temple, as appears from Mark xii35. Christ made use of this occasion of the Pharisees tempting Him to instruct them concerning the Person and dignity of Messiah, that He might teach how to return good for evil, and turn a temptation into an occasion of instruction. He taught them that Messiah, or the Christ, was not a mere Prayer of Manasseh , as they supposed, but the God-Man. They must not wonder, therefore, that He asserted Himself to be the Son of God.
