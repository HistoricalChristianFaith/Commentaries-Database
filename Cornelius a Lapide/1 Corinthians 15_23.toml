But every man in his own order1. According to Chrysostom, Theodoret and Theophylact this is the just among the blessed, the wicked among the reprobate. 
2. According to the commentary ascribed to S. Jerome, this means that each shall rise higher and more blessed as he has been more holy here. 
3. Å’cumenius and Primasius explain it in this way. All who are to be quickened in Christ shall rise again in this order—Christ the first in time and dignity; secondly, the just shall rise; thirdly shall come the end of the world. This is the Apostle"s meaning, as appears from the next words. Cf.  1 Thessalonians 4:16.
