The man answered, &c. It was your business, as doctors and learned in the Law, to know that Jesus, who works so many miracles, must have been sent by God only. For it is God who works miracles by Him. "He brings in everywhere the miracle of his recovery of sight," says S. Chrysostom, "because they could not gainsay that, but were convinced thereby."
