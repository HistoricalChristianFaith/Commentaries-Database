Nevertheless neither is the man without the woman, neither the woman without the Prayer of Manasseh , in the Lord. This is to be referred to ver9 , not to the words immediately preceding, which by some Bibles are rightly put in a parenthesis. Having said, in ver9 , that the woman was created for the Prayer of Manasseh , the Apostle, lest he might seem to have given to men an occasion for pride, to women of indignation, here softens the force of it by adding that in marriage neither can man be without woman, nor woman without man. Each needs the other"s help, and that "in the Lord," that Isaiah , by the will and disposition of the Lord. Cf. S. Ambrose and the following verse. 
"In the Lord" may also be understood "in Christ, by Christian truth and law." The rule of Christian law and of God"s ordinance is that the husband and wife give mutual help, procreate children, and educate them piously. This seems to be a reminder to married people of their duty to each other, and of Christian piety.
