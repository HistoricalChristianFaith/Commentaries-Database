Not grudgingly or of necessity. Avarice makes reluctance, and regard for one"s reputation induces constraint. Let each man give what he likes, not influenced or compelled by my authority or that of Titus , and not because regard for his honour makes him ashamed of giving less than others. 
For God loveth a cheerful giver. Quoted from Prov. xxii9 , LXX. On cheerfulness in giving, see  Romans 12:8. S. Augustine (Enarr. in Ps. xliii.) says beautifully: "If you give your bread grudgingly, you lose both your bread and your reward." And again (Serm45): "If good works are good seeds, why are they sown in tears?" S. Chrysostom (Hom. on  1 Corinthians 11:19) says: "If we give cheerfully, our reward will be twofold, one for giving and one for giving cheerfully." S. Gregory (Morals, 21 , c11 , on  Job 31:16) says: "Job thus acted that he might increase his merits, not only by giving but also by the promptitude with which he gave his good things." Cf.  Proverbs 3:28, Sirach 35:11. Alms then should be given with cheerful mind, not sadly, reluctantly, and tardily. Thus shall we imitate God, who cheerfully distributes His gifts. 
The heathen depict the Graces as three sisters, embracing one another but looking in different directions. They meant by this to signify how gifts should be distributed. The first, named Aglaia, denotes generosity, it being better to give than to receive. "For he who receives a kindness sells his freedom," says the jester of P. Syrus. The second is called Thalia, i.e, flourishing in the midst of the course. The third is called Euphrosyne, or joy; for both he that gives and he that receives rejoice in the kindness doneâ€”God loveth a cheerful giver. Cf. Seneca (de Beneficiis).
