And1have declared unto them Thy Name, and will declare It (after My Resurrection and the sending of the Holy Spirit): that the love wherewith Thou hast loved Me may be in them, and I in them. That Isaiah , that Thou mayest continue towards them the love wherewith Thou lovest Me, and Mine also for My sake. And indeed manifest it in greater measure, and daily benefit them more and more, pouring Thy graces and blessings upon them: so that they may daily make great progress in sanctity and in their Apostolic work. And that in this way I may continually abide in them together with Thee, and may cleave more closely to them through Thy ever-increasing grace and charity within them. For God, when He loves rational creatures, pours into them that most precious and most Divine gift of grace, and charity. And this He does not do to irrational beings, as the sky, the sun, the stars, though He still loves them, by creating, adorning, and governing them by His love. This is the meaning of "Thy love may be in them," for, as S. Paul says, "the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given us" ( Romans 5:5). Rupertus explains it somewhat otherwise, "that the Holy Spirit, who is the Love wherewith Thou lovest Me, may ever firmly dwell and abide in them." But it comes to the same thing. For the Holy Spirit cannot be separated from charity, any more than fire from heat. For to whom charity is given, the Holy Spirit is given also. And as long as charity abides in a Prayer of Manasseh , so long does the Holy Spirit abide, and indeed the whole Trinity. See above, xiv23.
