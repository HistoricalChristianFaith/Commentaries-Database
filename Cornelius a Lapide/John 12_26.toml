If any man love Me, let him follow Me. "Let him imitate Me by death and mortification, and by good works," says S. Chrysostom, "walk in my ways, and not his own, and not seeking his own, but the things which are Jesus Christ"s ( Philippians 2:21); and whatever good he does, either in temporal or spiritual things, doing it for Him." 
And where I Amos , there shall my servant be. "Behold the fruit and the reward," S. Augustine proceeds; "He is loved freely, and the reward of His ministration is to be with Him, to be adopted by Him to whom he is united, in heaven, i.e. in the vision and possession of God, in happiness and joy eternal." So S. Chrysostom. See notes on  Luke 22:7. 
If any man serve Me, him will me Father honour, with heavenly honour, before the angels and the whole world. He says not, "I will honour him, for they had not yet attained a right knowledge of Him, but thought more of the Father," says S. Chrysostom.
