And in that day ye shall ask Me nothing. The word ÎµÌ‰Î¶Ï‰Ï„Î®ÏƒÎµÏ„Îµ signifies either, ye will ask Me no questions, or ye will ask Me for nothing, make no request. 
1. S. Cyril explains it in the first sense: There will be no need to ask Me anything, when I have risen and sent the Holy Spirit. For I by my rising, and He by His coming, will teach you all things which concern your office. They had in their ignorance asked Him many things: "Whither goest Thou?" "How can we know the way?" "Show us the Father." "Why dost Thou manifest Thyself to us, and not unto the world?" see chap. xiv5 , 8 , 22. And here too as to the meaning of the words "a little while." He fittingly replies, the Holy Spirit will so enlighten you, that ye will have no need to ask questions, as ye did before." So also Euthymius. 
2. S. Chrysostom (Hom78), Theophylact, Ribera, and others explain it thus, "After My Resurrection ye will have no need to pray to Me, ye will have only to ask the Father in My name. This is supported by what next follows." (3.) S. Augustine combines both these explanations, and refers to the day of heavenly glory. "He was asked by the disciples," he says, "when He would restore the kingdom to Israel. He was asked by S. Stephen to receive his spirit. I therefore think that what He here says must be referred to the time when we shall see Him as He Isaiah , when nothing will remain to be desired, no secret will have to be inquired about."
