And if thy hand scandalize thee, cut it of. For a scandal is so pernicious that it harms not only the doer but the sufferer of it. Wherefore, if thou sufferest a scandal from thy hand, cut it off. That Isaiah , if any one, relative or friend, as useful and as dear to thee as thy hand, thy foot, thine eye, scandalize thee, that Isaiah , draw thee into sin, separate such an one from thy company, lest he drag thee with him into Gehenna.
