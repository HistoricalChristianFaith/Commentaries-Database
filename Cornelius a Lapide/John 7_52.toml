They answered, &c. And thou, as being of the same country, dost thou favour and defend Him? 
Search (the Scriptures, Vulg.) and see that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet. They reply insolently, as though he knew not the Scriptures. Attend to us and learn. "They insult him," says Theophylact; "go and learn, for up to this time thou hast not learned that out of Galilee ariseth no prophet." This was not true. For Deborah was of Galilee ( Judges 4:4-6), and Anna of the tribe of Aser ( Luke 2:36), and Nahum the Elkoshite from Elkosh, a city in Galilee. And in Samaria which adjoined Galilee there were many Prophets, as Elijah, Elisha, and the hundred which Obadiah hid in a cave. 
2. It is rash to assert that because, up to that time, no Prophet had arisen from Galilee, none would afterwards arise. 
3. It was foolish, because Nicodemus had never said that Jesus was a Prophet, but merely that He should not be condemned without being heard; but they were so blinded by hatred, as to do many rash and foolish things contrary to reasonable judgment.
