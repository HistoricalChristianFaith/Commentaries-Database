Great is my boldness of speech toward you. My boldness is great because my love is so great. Hence comes my "glorying of you" (Theophylact and Ambrose). Paul says all this to banish all suspicion of his good faith, and to gain credence to his declaration, "We have wronged no Prayer of Manasseh ," &c. "I have not said this," he seems to sail, "out of any distrust of your good opinion of me, but out of the boldness engendered by my great love for you; hence it is that I am wont to glory of you." Let superiors learn of S. Paul, to beware lest those under them distrust them, from a belief that their superiors do not believe them, do not trust in them, and do not therefore confidently entrust themselves and their goods to their superior; let them rather endeavour to deal openly with them, and let them know that they are loved; let them show that they have a good opinion of their inferiors, and by so doing they will bind their hearts to themselves, and turn them wherever they please. 
I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulation. Viz, because you have corrected what in my First Epistle I condemned. You have so comforted me that I not only am filled with comfort, but more than filled. This exuberance of joy drowns all feeling of my afflictions, even as floods of water put out a small fire. 
Observe here that friendship produces four affections in the souls of friends. The first affection is one of trust, of which Paul says: "Great is my confidence in you;" the second is one of glorying, of which he says: "Great is my glorying of you;" the third is one of comfort, of which he says: "I am filled with comfort;" the fourth is one of superabundant joy, of which he says. "I am exceeding joyful in all our tribulations."
