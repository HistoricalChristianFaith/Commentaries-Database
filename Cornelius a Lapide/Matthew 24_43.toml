But know this, &c. Here we must supply what is to be understood, somewhat as follows. But forasmuch as a man knows not this hour, and is not willing or able to watch at every hour, therefore the thief, as his manner Isaiah , comes at the hour in which he thinks the householder is not watching, but sleeping, and so robs his house while he is asleep. It is clear that this is the meaning from the Greek, which has in the past tense, If the master of the house had known in what hour the thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his house to be broken through. You must supply, "But because he did not know the hour, he did not watch, and did suffer his house to be broken into and robbed." 
By the thief, S. Hilary understands the devil. "The thief," he says, "shows that the devil is very watchful to take from us our goods, and to plot against the houses of our souls, that he may dig through them whilst we are careless, and given up to the sleep of our own devices; and he would pierce through them with the darts of enticements. It behoves us, therefore, to be prepared, because ignorance of the day sharpens the intense solicitude of expectation ever suspended." But it is better to apply the words to Christ. For so He Himself explains, applying this parable of the thief to Himself in the following verse. 
Be ye also ready, &c. the Son of man shall come, to judgment, both the particular judgment of your own soul, and the general Judgment of all men at the end of the world. Christ therefore compares Himself to a thief, not as regards the act of stealing, but as regards silence and secrecy, in that the thief chooses the hour in which he thinks the householder will be absent or asleep, that so he may come upon him unawares, and rob his house. In like manner Christ summons those who are careless, and not waiting for Him, to death and judgment. Whence the Apocalypse warns every one saying, "Behold, I come as a thief" ( Revelation 16:15). And S. Paul ( 1 Thessalonians 5:4) says, "But ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should overtake you as a thief. Ye are all children of the light, and of the day." Truly hath the wise man said, "The life of mortals is a vigil." 
The truth of this sentence of Christ is seen in daily experience. For we see very many men seized by death at a time when they think themselves to be in good health, and are forming grand projects in their minds. They think death is far distant, and promise themselves many years of life. And yet both experience and the warning of Christ should teach them to do the very opposite. When they appear to themselves to enjoy the most perfect health, they should think that death is lying hid at the very threshold of their doors, and should believe that they are then about to die when thoughts and hopes of long life are suggested to them, either by the devil or their own concupiscence. So would the day of death never come upon them unawares, nor overtake them as a thief. 
Thus did the wise and holy men of whom we read in the Lives of the Fathers (lib5 , libello3 , de Compunc. n2). Abbot Ammon gives this precept of salvation to a certain person, "Entertain such thoughts as evil-doers who are in prison have. For these men ask, "Where is the Judges , and when will he come?" And they weep in expectation of their punishments. After this manner ought a monk to do. He should ever be chiding his soul, and saying, "Woe is me, who have to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, to render unto Him an account of all my deeds." For if thou wilt always meditate thus, thou wilt be safe." And Abbot Evagrius said, "That is divine, to picture the dreadful and terrible judgment. Consider the confusion which is laid up for sinners, which they shall endure in the presence of Christ and God, before angels, and archangels, and powers, and all men. Think of the everlasting fire, the undying worm, the blackness of hell; and in addition to all these things, the gnashing of teeth the fears and torments. Consider likewise the good things which are laid up for the righteous—confidence before God the Father and Christ His Song of Solomon , and before the angels. Consider the heavenly Kingdom and its gifts of joy and rest." And, Abbot Elias saith, "I am afraid of three things—the first, the going forth of my soul from the body; the second, when I shall meet God; the third, when sentence shall be pronounced against me." Abp. Theophilus, of holy memory, said, when he was about to die, "Blessed art thou, 0 Abbot Arsenius, because thou always hadst this hour before thine eyes." In the same work we read that a certain old man saw one laughing, and said to him, "We have to give an account of our whole life before the Lord of heaven and earth, and dost thou laugh?"
