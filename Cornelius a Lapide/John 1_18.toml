No man hath seen God, &c. He gives the reason why neither Moses, nor any one else, but Christ alone, hath taught us the perfect truth concerning God and Divine things—because He alone hath seen God. It is as though he said, those things of which thus far I have been speaking, concerning God and the Word, are so sublime, that inasmuch as no mortal man (and therefore not Moses), except the Son of God, hath seen God, therefore that Incarnate Son alone is able perfectly to declare these things. Thus the Fathers passim; who teach from this passage that Moses saw not the essence of God, but only a certain luminous substance assumed by an angel, in some manner representing to the eyes of Moses the glory of God. Thus S. Gregory says in the Catena: "So long as we live here in mortal flesh, God may be seen by certain manifestations or images of Him, but as He is in His own nature He cannot be seen." 
Tropologically, & Gregory teaches (lib18 , Mor. cap. ult. et. penult.), that no one can behold God and Divine things, unless he first die to this world and its pleasures. For thus he expounds the words in the18th chapter of Job , It is hid from the eyes of the living: "Because whoever seeth Wisdom of Solomon , which is God Himself, dieth wholly to this life, lest he should be holden of its love. For no man seeth It who still liveth to the flesh, because no man can at the same time embrace God and the world. For he who seeth God dieth in this respect, either in will, or in reality, for with his whole soul he is separated from the pleasures of this life." 
The Only Begotten who is in the bosom: Syriac, in the lap: S. Cyril, in the womb, for this is one meaning of the Greek ÎºÎ¿Ì€Î»Ï€Î¿Ï‚. It is a figure of speech. For by bosom is signified the highest possible union of the Son with the Father. It means that the Song of Solomon , who is most closely united, and consubstantial with the Father, is partaker of the wisdom of the Father, and conscious of His most secret counsels. And because He knoweth them most perfectly and intimately, therefore He alone is able most fully and plainly to declare them. And so in fact He has declared them. Thus SS. Chryostom, Cyril, and Augustine. S. Athanasius observes (lib3de Unica Trin. substant.) that this expression, the Only Begotten, which is in the bosom of the Father, is made use of lest when it is said that He was made flesh, it should be supposed that He was divided from the Father. For in truth He abideth, and is with the Father, even as He was in the beginning, and everlasting. 
Listen to S. Chrysostom, who by this word bosom thinks it is signified that the Son not only sees, but comprehends the Father. "Many," saith Hebrews , "know God, yet none but the Only Begotten Son know of what nature His substance is. He has certain knowledge, sight, and comprehension, such as it is befitting a son to have of his father. For as the Father knoweth Me, He said, so also know I the Father, (John x15). Observe therefore with what fulness of language the Evangelist speaks; for when he says, no man hath seen God at any time, he does not go on to say, the Son who hath seen, hath declared Him, but He who is in the bosom of the Father hath declared Him. For he who only seeth hath not certain knowledge of the thing seen: but he who dwelleth in the bosom, to him are all things plain and certain. Lest therefore when you hear, no man knoweth the Father save the Son (Matt. xi27), you should say that though He hath greater knowledge of the Father than others have, and yet knows not what His nature Isaiah , therefore the Evangelist says, "He is in the bosom of the Father."" 
There is an allusion to the words of David concerning, Christ in the110th Psalm ( Psalm 110:3), "From the womb, before the morning star, have I begotten Thee" (Vulg.) That Isaiah , "From my fruitful understanding I have, as it were, as a Word spoken this, and as a Son have I begotten thee." S. Jerome says, "From the womb, i.e, of My substance, of My nature, of the very essence of My substance, have I begotten Thee." So also Theodoret says, "From the womb," that Isaiah , "of My substance. For as human beings produce from the womb, and that which they bring forth hath the same nature as those who bring it forth, so art Thou begotten of Me, and Thou showest forth in Thyself the substance of Him who begat." Moreover, Jerome himself translates this verse of the110th Psalm thus, "The dew of Thy youth shall arise to Thee as it were from the womb;" Aquila, "The dew of Thy childhood arising to Thee early from the womb." It means, "Of My Deity have I begotten Thee God:" as it is in the Creed, "God of God." So SS. Hilary, Ambrose, Augustine, Athanasius, and others against the Arians. For dew means in Hebrew the same as flower in English. "Dew," says R. Song of Solomon , "means sweetness, joyfulness, purity of heavenly generation, as it were dew born of the heavenly dayspring." 
He hath declared: that Isaiah , He hath clearly explained and set forth to His disciples, and through them to the whole world. The Greek is ÎµÌ‰Î¾Î·Î³Î®ÏƒÎ±Ï„Î¿, which S. Chrysostom says means clearly to explain secret and hidden things, as Christ has explained to us the secrets of the Father concerning the Trinity and the Word, concerning the vocation of Prayer of Manasseh , grace, resurrection, heavenly glory, and such like. "This word," says S. Chrysostom, "sets forth more express and certain doctrine: wherefore also Christ is called the Word, and (the Angel) of great counsel."
