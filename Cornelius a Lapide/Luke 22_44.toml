And being in an agony, He prayed more earnestly. The "et" here in the Hebrew is causal, and means quia, because. That Isaiah , the angel comforted Him; because being in an agony and praying more earnestly, He sweated blood, and then appeared to need comfort, and to merit it. The following, was the order of events. Christ had prayed the first and second time, but felt no help of God. Then His feeling growing on Him, Hebrews , permitting the agony (that Isaiah , a more vehement horror and anguish) to arise in Himself, He sweated blood. To overcome this, He prayed a third time more earnestly, teaching us that as temptation increases our prayers should increase equally. The angel therefore appeared to Him immediately, comforting Him; whereupon He ceased to pray and to fear, and to grieve, and, suppressing and overcoming His agony, He manfully prepared Himself for His Passion, and went forth of His own accord to meet Judas. 
More earnestly. The Greek is ÎµÌ‰ÎºÏ„ÎµÎ½Î­ÏƒÏ„ÎµÎ¶Î¿Î½, that Isaiah , more exclusively, more intensely. For this, as appears from SS. Matthew and Mark , was the third prayer of Christ, and He appears to have remained in it longer. More earnestly, because, as the anguish pressed upon Him, Christ, to overcome it, at once directed the contention of His mind, by praying; and He prayed with a more intense feeling and ardour. Luke includes in one as in a compendium, the three prayers of Matthew and Mark , and therefore relates some things of it, which took place in the first and second, and some which took place in the third. 
And His sweat was as it were great drops of blood. The Greek has Î¸Î¶ÏŒÎ¼Î²Î¿Î¹, gouts, thick masses. The Arabic and S. Irenæus have globi. The Arabic says, "His sweat was (made) as distilling blood descending on the ground." 
Note. Firstly, Some copies have nothing about this bloody sweat, as S. Hilary shows (De Trinit. lib. x.); S. Jerome (lib. ii. against Pelagius), lest men should ascribe infirmity of mind and weakness to Christ. But now all versions, Greek, Latin, Syriac, Arabic, have the same account, so it is certainly to be read, according to the agreement of the Council of Trent, Session IV. 
Secondly, Christ is said to have sweated blood not improperly or as a by-word, and an allegory, as we say of one who is grievously afflicted and tormented, "he sweats blood," as Euthymius and Theophylact explain it—but truly and properly. Hence the words "as it were" denote not resemblance but the truth. So SS. Hilary, Jerome, Augustine passim. The Ethiopic renders it plainly, "And His sweat was made as the sweat of blood flowing down upon the earth." The Persian agrees with it. S. Athanasius, also, in his sixth book to Theophilus, which is on the Beatitude of the Son of God, says, "Anathema to those who deny that Christ sweated true blood." 
S. Bernard, treating of this prayer of Christ in the garden, says, "Not only with His eyes does He seem to have wept, but, as it were, with all His members, that His whole Body, which is the Church, might be the more effectually purged by His tears" (Serm3on Palm Sunday). The love of Christ indeed was not content with the watery tears of His eyes, but wished, by the bloody tears of His whole Body, to lament and blot out our sins, and these tears of Christ were most efficacious with God the Father. "For," says S. Irenus (Lib. v. cap. i.) "the blood of Christ has a voice and "speaketh better things than that of Abel," Heb. xii24. The blood of Abel calls for vengeance, that of Christ for mercy." 
Symbolically, "the reason was," says S. Augustine, "that Christ might show that from His whole Body would proceed the passions of martyrs" (Seutent. sent68). Again, "The blood of Christ," says Bede, "flowed down upon the earth to show that men of the earth would be moistened by it."
