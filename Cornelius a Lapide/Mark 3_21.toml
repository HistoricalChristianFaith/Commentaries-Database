He is beside himself. See what has been said on S.  Matthew 12:46. The Arabic has, saying that He is foolish. The Greek is ÎµÌ‰Î¾Î­ÏƒÏ„Î·, i.e, He has gone out of his mind, through too great piety and zeal. The Syriac renders literally. Others render differently, saying that He has swooned, from hunger, because, on account of the multitude, He had no leisure to eat. (Top)
