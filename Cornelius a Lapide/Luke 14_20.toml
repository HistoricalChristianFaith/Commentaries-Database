And another said, I have married a wife, &c. What, asks S. Gregory, are we to understand by a wife but carnal gratifications? The Pharisees, like many at the present time, were ensnared by avarice and luxury. These are the thorns which choke the word of God. S.  Luke 8:14. 
Let us all then give heed to the warning of S. Paul, and remember that "the fashion of this world passeth away" ( 1 Corinthians 7:31). "For the "res temporalis" consists in possession, and "res eterna" in expectation," S. Gregory (Hom36). Not that marriage is censured here (save so far as it interferes with the work of salvation), says S. Ambrose, but purity is held up to greater honour, for "the love of the things of this world is a fetter to (viscus est) the wings of the spirit." Gloss. 
In carnal things, desire begets satiety, and satiety disgust; but in spiritual things, satiety provokes desire. S. Gregory. 
S. Augustine (serm33 , De Verb. Domini) explains and applies somewhat differently the excuses of the invited guests: 
"The piece of ground which was bought denotes government. Therefore pride is the first vice reproved. 
"The five yoke of oxen are taken to be the five senses, by means of which earthly things are pursued. For the oxen till the ground; but men at a distance from faith, given up to earthly things, are occupied with carnal matters. 
""Love not the world, therefore, neither the things that are in the world," for "the world passeth away, and the lust thereof"  1 John 2:15-17. Away then with wicked and vain excuses, and let us come to the supper wherewith we may be inwardly nourished. Let not the lifting up of pride hinder us, neither let lawless curiosity fright us, and turn us away from God. Let not the pleasures of the flesh keep us from the pleasure of the heart. Let us come and be filled."
