But the foolish, &c. This belongs to the emblema of the parable. For, with reference to what is signified by it, the reprobate in the Day of Judgment will not ask for the oil of good works from the elect; for they will know that they will neither give nor be able to give it to them. For then shall every one be judged by the works which he hath done in this life before death. This emblema, then, is introduced to express that the repentance of the reprobate will be too late, when, after death, they behold the dreadful judgment of God hanging over them. Too late will they grieve that they in this life neglected goodness. Too late will they wish that they had loved virtue. But it will be in vain. They will not be able to procure either the works or the help of the elect. For there will be neither time for working, nor the help and prayers of the Saints. Yea, in that terrible judgment, there will be no one who will appear to have any confidence in himself, or in good works. 
Our lamps are gone out. In truth they were extinguished, because they had died in a state of mortal sin. Yet they say, are going our (extinguuntur), because in this life their souls seemed, through their common profession of the true faith, and through participation of the Sacraments, to be alive. But then, that Isaiah , in death and judgment, when all those things are vanishing away, they will see that they are extinct. S. Augustine says (Serm23 , de Verb. Domini), "Before those virgins slept, it is not said that their lamps were being extinguished. Wherefore, then, were they alight? It was because they did not lack the praise of men. But in the presence of the Bridegroom, that Isaiah , Christ the Judges , they will be extinguished, because Christ will illuminate the hidden things of darkness, and then shall every one have praise of God ( 1 Corinthians 4:5), not of men." For to the slothful and reprobate will be confusion. 
The words are gone out signify that charity, which is the flame of the lamps, that Isaiah , of souls, is nourished by good works, as by oil. When, therefore, they are withdrawn, it is extinguished. This is because many virtuous works are commanded by God, such as are all those which are commanded in the Decalogue. If, therefore, any one does not fulfil what God has commanded, he loses the grace and love of God. For charity, without the exercise of good works, fades and languishes. And then, when any temptation attacks him, a man easily glides into mortal sin, by which charity is extinguished. Dost thou wish then to secure the grace of God, yea, to grow in the friendship and love of God? Be thou very earnest in all good works. For by these charity is constantly nourished and strengthened. It grows and increases.
