And He made as though He would have gone further. This was no deceit: for He would have gone on if the disciples had not constrained Him, but as He knew that they would thus constrain Him to abide with them, in this respect he was not willing, but was making as if (Ï€Î¶Î¿ÏƒÎµÏ€Î¿Î¹ÎµÎ¹ÌƒÏ„Î¿) He would have gone further. 
Hence S. Augustine (Qust. Evang.) says, "When one feigning has reference to a certain meaning, it is not a falsehood, but a certain figure of the truth." And again, "A fiction founded on truth is a figure; not so founded, it is a lie." And S. Gregory (hom23in Evang.) writes, 11By the word "fingere" we mean to put together or form, hence modellers of clay we call "figuli." He who was the truth did nothing by deceit. He manifested Himself to them in the body, such as He came before them in their midst. He would prove them whether they could show charity to Him as a stranger, although they might not yet love Him as God."
