But we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel from the power of their enemies, e.g, from the power of the Romans. 
"We trusted that he had been the Messiah who would have restored the kingdom of Israel to the same, or even greater, dignity than it had possessed in the time of David and of Solomon. But now that he has been so unworthily put to death, although we do not despair, we have but little hope." 
This was their grief, the wound which their faith had received, which Christ desired to hear from them, in order to heal. 
"0 disciples," says S. Augustine (serm140 De Temp.), "ye were hoping, therefore ye do not now hope. Behold Christ lives, but your hope within you is dead;" and again, "He was walking with them as their companion, and yet was their leader and guide." 
And beside all this, to-day is the third day, &c. For Christ was crucified on the sixth day, and after three days rose from the dead. This is an aposiopesis, for the disciples, anxious and perplexed, knowing not what to think about Christ, as good as say, "Jesus when He was alive said that He would rise from the dead on the third day; but although this is the third day we know not whether He has risen or is yet to rise." They were doubtful, balanced between hope and fear. "They speak thus," says Theophylact, "as men in doubt, and seem to me to be very undecided in their minds, for they are not absolutely unbelieving, nor do they believe aright. For their words "we trusted that it had been Hebrews ," &c, indicate incredulity, but when they make mention of the third day, they show themselves mindful of the words of Christ, "on the third day I shall rise again;"" and again, "On the whole they spake as men in perplexity and doubt."
