Receive us. Embrace us with the arms of love, as with all our heart we do you (Theophylact). Cf. vi11-13. Strictly, the Greek denotes "make a place for us"â€”a large place in your hearts. Maldonatus (Not. Manusc.) renders the words. "Bear with me if I have praised myself over-much." 
We have defrauded no man. We have obtained no man"s goods, either by violence or fraud. Cf. ii11.
