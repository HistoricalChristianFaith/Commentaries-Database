Remember My word, &c. For if I suffer the hatred of the Jews, yea even the death of the Cross, ye ought not to be unwilling to undergo the same. For as S. Peter saith, "Christ hath suffered for us, leaving us an example that we should follow His steps." 
If they have persecuted Me, &c. If they have kept My word, &c. My ward, i.e. My doctrine, law, and precepts. 
But all these things will they do because of My name, i.e. on My account, because ye are called, and are, Mine. 
Because they know not Him that sent Me: i.e, Because they know not that God the Father sent Me, they say that I pretend to be the Son of God, and sent by Him into the world as the Messias. For if they knew and believed this, they would not persecute Me, nor dare to fight against God. He means, This will be glorious for you, that not only for My sake, but for God the Father"s sake, who sent Me, ye will endure persecutions.
