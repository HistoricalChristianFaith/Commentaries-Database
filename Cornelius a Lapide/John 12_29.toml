The people therefore that stood by, and heard it (this trumpet voice of God the Father) said that it thundered. Because it was very loud and resonant. Or perhaps because it was not articulate, but like the confused sound of thunder. S. Chrysostom says, "The voice was clear and significant enough, but they being dull and carnal, it soon passed away, and they retained merely the sound of it." And further on, "They knew it was articulate, but did not take in its meaning." But the truer meaning, Rupertus, and after him Maldonatus, say is this, "That they all heard this articulate voice and understood its meaning, viz, that Jesus was the Son of God; but that on account of the loudness of the voice they could not persuade themselves it was really a voice, but that either it was thunder, and that they were mistaken in supposing they had heard an articulate voice as of a Prayer of Manasseh , or that it was certainly the voice of an angel." They thought also that the Evangelist mentioned this, in order to show that it was not a low or indistinct voice, such as Christ only could hear, and that there were no other witnesses, but that it was so loud and so clear that they not only all heard it, but heard it so plainly that some thought it was thunder, some the voice of an angel, while none considered it to be the voice of a man. And this consequently proved that what they considered thunder was in truth the voice of God, for thunder is commonly spoken of as His voice. 
Symbolically. This thunder signified that Jesus was the Son of God, who thunders from heaven, and consequently that He Himself was God. For the thunder"s voice refers us back to its source, and leads us to venerate Him, and announce Him to the Gentiles. Again, it signified that Jesus, even as Prayer of Manasseh , not merely thundered Himself with His mouth and flashed forth from His heart, to move hard hearts to penitence and to warm cold hearts with love; but also that He caused the Apostles and His followers to thunder and lighten. In fact, He gave that name to James and John , calling them Sons of Thunder ( Mark 3:17). And S. Paul is called by S. Jerome (Epist. lxi.) "The trumpet of the Gospel, the roaring of our Lion, the thunder of the Gentiles," adding, "for as often as I read him, I seem not to hear words only, but thunder." Hear S. Chrysostom (Hom. xxxii. in Rom.), "Thunder is not so terrible, as was his voice to the devils. For if they dreaded his garments, much more did they dread his voice. For it led them bound and captive, it purified the world, it cured diseases, it expelled vice, it brought in truth; it had Christ dwelling within. For He accompanied him everywhere, and just as were the Cherubim, so also was the voice of Paul. For as God sat in the midst of these heavenly Powers, so sat He on the tongue of S. Paul." And Nazianzen (Orat. xx.) says, "The words of S. Basil were as thunder, because his example shone as lightning." Hence the voice of Christ is compared to the voice of many waters ( Revelation 1:15) and to the voice of a multitude ( Daniel 10:6). 
Others said, an angel spake to Him. For this voice was more dignified than that of a man. It was therefore angelic, or rather divine. For an angel, assuming the Person of God the Father, had uttered it.
