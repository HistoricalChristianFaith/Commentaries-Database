The Father, &c. . . . hath borne witness, as at My baptism. Again, He hath borne witness concerning Me, through the Scriptures by Moses and the prophets. 
Observe, Christ in this place, besides the testimony of John , adduces three other and greater witnesses to show that He is the Messiah: 1. By His miracles (ver36); 2. By the Father"s voice at His baptism; 3. By the Scriptures (ver39).
