On the first day of the week. Literally, of the Sabbath, the week being called the Sabbath, after its principal day, or the day of the Pasch. (see on  Matthew 28:1) 
Mary Magdalene came. The other gospels speak of the other women but she only is mentioned here, as being their leader, and more zealous and active than the rest. 
When it was yet dark. In the early dawn (profundo diluculo), says S. Luke. Note here her activity, watchfulness, and ardour. She seeks Christ in the dawn, and hence she is the first to see Him as the rising sun. As S. Ambrose says on the title of Psalm 55 ,* "For the morning undertaking." This morning undertaking we can ascribe to Mary Magdalene, who went very early in the morning to watch at the tomb, and first greeted the resurrection of the Lord, and as the sunlight grew brighter, she only, and before the rest, recognised the rising of the Sun of righteousness, and as by this morning greeting she rejoiced at the return of daylight, so did she rejoice the more that Christ was raised from the dead, and in her was fulfilled the prophecy, In the evening weeping will tarry (see vulg.) (heaviness may endure for the night, E. V.) but at morning is joy ( Psalm 30:6). 
Unto the sepulchre. To anoint the Body of Jesus, says Nonnus. 
And saw the stone taken away. And the Angels, who said that Christ had risen, but the Magdalene did not believe it, and ran to Peter and John , saying, "They have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid Him." See notes on S. Matt. xxviii8. S. Jerome remarks (Ep. cl. Hedibiam), Her error was connected with pietyâ€”piety in longing to see Him whose Majesty she knew, but her mistake was in what she said.
