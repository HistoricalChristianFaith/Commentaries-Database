Prophesy unto us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote Thee? They jest at Him for saying He was a Prophet. If Thou art a Prophet, prophesy to us. They seem to have said this insultingly, after they had covered His face. If Thou art the Christ, Thou canst not be ignorant of what is hid from Thee. Tell us who smote Thee? They jested at Him as a pretended soothsayer. "The King of Prophets," says Theophylact gravely, "is jested at as a false Prophet." "They insultingly covered His face, so as to make mock of Him, and next that they might not be deterred from beating Him by His Divine countenance," says Jansen. "For His majesty beamed forth in His countenance," says S. Jerome. 
Mystically: Christ when veiled signified that He hid His face from the Jews, who were deprived of faith and the knowledge of God. Just as Moses, a type of Christ, when he veiled his eyes on coming down from the Mount, signified the same thing ( 2 Corinthians 3:13). In his own words, "I will hide my face from them" ( Deuteronomy 32:20). 
Tropologically: it signifies that He atoned for Adam and Eve"s sin, for they sinned both with their eyes and their mouths, in looking at and then eating the forbidden fruit. Christ therefore, to expiate this sin, suffered His mouth and eyes to be covered. For, as S. Augustine says, "Christ suffered in all the members in which man has sinned, that He might expiate all." 
Christ, moreover, endured all these sufferings with steadfast patience. "As Hebrews ," says S. Chrysostom, "omitted no act of gentleness, so did they omit no act of insult or impiety, but sought to glut their rage both in word and deed." 
The Delphic Sibyl thus foretold— 
"Then impious Israel
Will buffet Him, and from their sinful lips
Will pour their poisonous spittle,
And will give, for food the gall, and vinegar to drink," &c, 
And the Erythræan Sibyl (Lact)— 
"The innocent will give His back to blows," &c. 
The reason for these insults was—First, That Christ should thus expiate the infinite sins with which men (so far as they can) inflict the greatest injuries on God. For the sinner, so far as he can, spits upon God, buffets and beats Him, because he despises Him, and esteems Him less than the creature which he loves. So Origen, "He suffered all these indignities to save us who deserved them all." "His reproaches took away our reproach," Pseudo-Jerome on S. Mark. "It was not Christ that suffered, but we suffered in Him," says S. Athanasius. Christ wished to endure all these dire sufferings in order to honour God the more, and to make the greater satisfaction for the wrong done Him. His Passion therefore honoured God more than Adam"s sin dishonoured Him. Add to this, that wicked men insult God, and invent fresh ways of insulting Him. Christ therefore willed to be insulted, and to expiate their newly-devised sins by His newly-devised insults. 
Secondly, to set forth the highest pattern of patience and virtue. If any one, therefore, desires a specimen of the greatest humility, gentleness, obedience, patience, constancy, charity, let him look on Christ suffering and crucified, and imitate Him as far as he can. "According to the pattern I showed to thee in the Mount" of Calvary ( Exodus 25:40). "Wondrous is Thy Passion, 0 Lord Jesus," says S. Bernard (Wednesday in Holy Week), "which hath driven away all our sufferings, makes propitiation for all our iniquities, and is never found ineffectual in all our diseases. For what is so deadly as not to be healed by Thy death? In this Passion, then, three things we must specially look at: the Acts , the mode, the cause; for in the Acts , patience; in the mode, humility; in the cause, charity,—is specially commended to us." 
Thirdly, to animate the martyr to endure every kind of torment, and the faithful to bear any injuries, by whomsoever imposed. "He endured them all with great courage, teaching us to bear injuries," says Euthymius, deriving from Christ adamantine hardness; as Isaiah ( Isaiah 50:7) says, "I have set my face as a flint, and I know that I shall not be confounded. He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me?" For as iron is hardened the more it is struck with the hammers, and is so far from being broken by them that it breaks them itself; so let us, the more we are afflicted, exhibit the greater courage, and thus by our patience overcome the hatred of our adversaries (see  Ezekiel 3:9). Again, as iron breaks iron, so do the patient overcome the obstinate wickedness of the ungodly, of whom Zecharias says ( Zechariah 7:12), "They made their hearts as adamant, lest they should hear the law." "For nothing is so hard as not to be surpassed by something harder," says S. Bernard. Moreover, S. Athanasius says (de Cruce), "Just as when a man strikes a stone with his hand, he does not break the stone, but hurts his hand; so they who strove against the Lord, as contending against incorruption, were corrupted, and as plotting against the Immortal, themselves perished." 
And so the Jews, for these insults offered to Christ, were rejected by God, and exposed to universal reprobation. "They received," says Origen, "a lasting blow, and lost all their Prophets; whereas God exalted Jesus, who humbled Himself even unto death, and gave Him a name which is above every name." 
After Caiaphas had with the whole Council proclaimed Christ to be guilty of death, the servants of the High Priest and some of the Council insulted Him for three whole hours, while the others lay down to rest, to be ready to proceed with the case in the morning. 
Indeed, He was subjected all the night through to cruel injuries, and bore them all with sweetness and fortitude. 
S. Bernard (Serm. xliii. in Song of Solomon 1:12), on the words, "My beloved is as a bundle of myrrh," wisely and piously observes, "He made up this bundle from the reproaches and insults of these attendants," and adds, "This healthful posy is preserved for me; no one shall take it from me. It shall lie between my breasts. These I said meditated wisdom; in these I established the perfections of my righteousness, in these the fulness of Wisdom of Solomon , in these the riches of salvation, in these abundance of merits. From these there came to me one while the heathful draught of bitterness, at another the sweet ointment of consolation. They sustain me in adversity, those check me in prosperity; and amidst the joys and sorrows of this present life they afford me safe guidance on either side as I walk along the royal road, and ward off imminent dangers on both sides."
