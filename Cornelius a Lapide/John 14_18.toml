I will not leave you orphans, &c. Forasmuch as Christ called His disciples sons, He now says to them, I will not leave you orphans, i.e, without a Father. Because, although I am going away from you to the Father, I will send you another Comforter in My stead. It is not that going away I will desert you, but that going away I will return, and will come unto you. 
Christ did thisâ€”1. And especially, when after the resurrection He appeared to His apostles in bodily presence, and taught them, and made them glad2. He did it, when at Pentecost He visibly sent them the Holy Ghost in the appearance of tongues of fire3. He did it invisibly, by often spiritually visiting them from heaven, and communicating to them His heavenly gifts4. He will do it visibly in the day of judgment when He will make His Apostles assessors with Himself. All this Christ further explains in what follows.
