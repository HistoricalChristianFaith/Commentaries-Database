Is not ambitious. Ephrem translates it: "Does not commit what is shameful." Clement (Pædag. lib. iii.c1). "Doth not behave itself unseemly." Our translator with Chrysostom, Theodoret, Theophylact, Å’cumenius, takes it thus: Charity thinks that nothing is dishonouring or unbecoming to it, though it suffer or do what is vile, ignominious, or degrading. Or more shortly: Charity is not ashamed, because it is ambitious of nothing, and of no honour. Our translator therefore has, from the effect, understood and rendered the cause—the cause why any one is not ashamed Isaiah , because he seeks for no honour or glory. Whence Chrysostom and Theophylact think that this is said by Paul against the arrogant. "Charity," says Chrysostom, "knows not what dishonour and disgrace are; she covers with her wings of gold the vices of all whom she embraces." So the love of Christ did not spurn or reject harlots, scourgings, or washing of men"s feet. S. Basil understands it (in Regul. Brev. Reg246): "Charity doth not depart from her habit and form." But Å’cumenius: "Charity doth not treat bitterly as a prisoner the man who is her enemy." 
Thinketh no evil, i.e, charity, if she is provoked by any one, does not reckon up the injury nor seek revenge, but conceals it, excuses it, forgives it. For the Greek word, as Vatablus and the Greeks understand it, Isaiah , imputes not his evil to any one.
