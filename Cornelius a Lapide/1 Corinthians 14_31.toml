For ye may all prophesy . . . and all may be comforted. All the prophets can exhort in their turn, if only the method and order laid down above be observed, and so all can receive exhortation and consolation. The word for "may be comforted" occurs again in2Cor. i6. Some take it as active, when the meaning becomes, "that all may learn when they hear, and may teach when they speak and exhort."
