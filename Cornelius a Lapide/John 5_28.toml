Marvel not, &c. . . . the hour, i.e, the time of the Evangelical Law, which is the last, and in the end of which shall be the resurrection of the dead, and the final judgment. 
In their graves: those who are dead and buried, including also the unburied dead. For as S. Augustine says, "By those who are buried in ordinary course, He signified also those who do not receive ordinary burial." 
The voice of the Son of God: this shall be the sound of the archangel"s, probably Michael"s trumpet, Arise, ye dead, come to judgment. This shall be accompanied by the sound of the trumpets and voices of other angels. The sound is spoken of as the voice of God, because by His command, through the ministry of angels, an effect shall be produced on the air which shall resound throughout the whole world, and be effectual as at least a moral instrument to raise the dead. For it is not necessary to attribute to this trumpet any physical power of raising the dead.
