In fleshy tables of the heart. Not in hard stone, as was the law of Moses, but in a heart tender, soft, and teachable. There is an allusion to  Jeremiah 32:33. The Apostle, we should notice, makes a distinction between ÏƒÎ¬ÏÎºÎ¹Î½Î¿Ï‚, used here, and Î¿Î±ÏÎºÎ¹ÎºÏŒÏ‚: the first denotes the natural condition of flesh—its softness, &c.; the other that which has the vices and corruptions of flesh. Cf.  Romans 7:14 and  1 Corinthians 3:3. Other writers, however, do not observe this distinction. Nazianzen, e.g, applies the latter of these terms to the incarnation and manhood of Christ.
