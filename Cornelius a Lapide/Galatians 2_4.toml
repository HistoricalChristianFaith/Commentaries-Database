And that. I.e, not even though the false brethren of the Jews urged it was Titus circumcised (Chrysostom, Å’cumenius). S. Jerome takes away the adversative but, and makes the verse follow immediately on the construction of the preceding. But it is better to take the Greek Î´Î¹Î±Ì€ Î´ÎµÌ€, which our version renders sed propter, in the sense of Î´Î·Ì€ or Î´Î·ÌƒÏ„Î±, i.e, "nempe," in spite of it all, he was not circumcised. 
The interpretation of Primasius and some others, who take the Î´ÎµÌ€, sed, in its strictly adversative sense, as meaning that Titus was not indeed compelled by the Apostles to be circumcised, but yet was circumcised because of the importunity of the false brethren, is clearly inconsistent with the following words, To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour, and also with a sound faith. For circumcision having been already done away, and having given place to baptism under the Gospel, it was forbidden to Gentiles to be circumcised. But Titus was a Gentile by both parents. Cf. S. Augustine (Ep. xix. ad. Hieron, and de Mendacio, c5). 
Unawares brought in, who came in privily. Like spies preparing for traps to be laid for us, they crept in by stealth. Cf.  Romans 5:20 and comments. 
To spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus. Our liberty from the yoke and burden of the numerous legal ceremonies from which Christ has set us free by His faith and His Church.
