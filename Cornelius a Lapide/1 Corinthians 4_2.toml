Moreover, it is required in stewards that a man be found faithful. You have been called from the study of wisdom and human eloquence to the simple and lowly teaching of Christ, so as not to dispute whether Paul or Apollos is the wiser or the more eloquent; and I have said that both of us are stewards of this teaching. Perchance, as you are always ready to draw comparisons between us, you will now begin to dispute about our stewardship, and ask, as men will, which of us is the more faithful in his office of preacher. Many of you say that Paul is the more faithful and more powerful, but Apollos more eloquent. Each will boast of his own teacher, and say that he is better and more faithful than we. Therefore to cut away all occasion for comparison let me tell you that I care nothing for the judgment of you or of any other Prayer of Manasseh , but for God"s alone. So says Theophylact, following Chrysostom. 
The chief quality requires in a steward is faithfulness. S. Paul alludes to the words of Christ: "Who then is a faithful and wise steward?" (S.  Luke 12:42). Theophylact says: "He is faithful if he does not regard his master"s goods as his own, if he foes not treat them as if he were owner of them, but distribute them as another"s and his master"s: of he does not speak of them as his own, but on the contrary say that what is his own belongs to his master." Song of Solomon , too, is a teacher or preacher faithful who does not seek his own glory, but the glory of God and the conversion of souls, and do all he can to forward these two objects, not only by his preaching, but also by a perfect example of a holy life.
