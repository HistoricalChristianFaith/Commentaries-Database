We must therefore believeâ€”(1.) That He is the Saviour of the world. (2.) The long-expected Messiah. (3.) That He is God the Son of God. (4.) That He will give eternal life to those who believe in, and obey Him. "For," as S. Gregory says, "He truly believes, who sets forth his belief in his life."
