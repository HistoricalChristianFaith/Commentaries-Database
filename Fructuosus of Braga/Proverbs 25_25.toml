We have learned from the story in sacred Scripture how pleasing to a man is “good news from a far country.” And what other better news could we expect than the love of Christ, than the spotless profession and propagation of the catholic church, than the pure lives, successful work, and faithful doctrine of the friends of God and the bishops and priests of Christ? These, most blessed father, we confess that we vehemently yearn for and thirstily desire to learn.
