If one of the brothers who agreed upon a common pact shall suddenly on one occasion only fall into altercation with another, he may, according to the gospel, ask and receive forgiveness. But if he refuses to mend his ways, and if the one against whom a wrong has been done has not succeeded in changing the other’s presumption after a first and second admonition, then he shall report it to the abbot, lest both he and his brother be endangered by this silence. As the prophet says, “He who hides his enmity maintains deceit.”
