[[commentary]]

The hateful Iscariot, heedless,
By intent, of the law of friendship,
Readied for betrayal the feet
Which Christ had washed. And though he ate
Your bread, the divine Body,
He raised his heel against you, O Christ,
And knew not how to cry out:
“Praise the Lord, O his works,
and exalt him unto all ages.”

The man without conscience received
The Body which redeems from sin
And the divine blood poured out
For the sake of the world;
But he was not ashamed to drink
What he sold for a price;
He took no offense at his wickedness,
And knew not how to cry out:
“Praise the Lord, O his works,
and exalt him unto all ages.”
