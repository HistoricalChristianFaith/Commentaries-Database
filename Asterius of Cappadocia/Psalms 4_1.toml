“You have made room for me in distress.” God has made room for [the psalmist] in two ways; one, because he heard his prayer, and two, because he heard quickly. It is a double grace not just to be heard but to be heard quickly. To be heard quickly and immediately in calamity is what he called “room,” “In distress you made room for me.” An unexpected calm disrupts the surge of calamity; the foaming sea is turned into a lake; the storms and tempests are changed into dew; enemies are made friends; and suppliants become givers of praise. “In distress you have made room for me.” No longer as an infant do I open my mouth, for the providence of God, just like a mother, gives me food. “In distress you have made room for me.” When I was longing for food, he filled me from the fruit of the earth of grain, wine and oil, so that not I alone but all those subordinate to me could enjoy them.
