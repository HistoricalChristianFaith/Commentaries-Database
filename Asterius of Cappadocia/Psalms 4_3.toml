In the preceding psalm [David] suffered persecution from Absalom. He was ashamed because he was fleeing from his son, and he did not have the inner strength to make war. Now comes the prayer that hangs the tyrant and protects the one oppressed by his tyranny. Should you ask how he will overcome Absalom, how he will cast him down like Goliath, he responds, “Armed with prayer.” “When I called on him, the God of my righteousness heard me.” His prayer is uttered, and the tyrant hangs in the tree. In the same way when I sin, God arouses himself against me, but when I repent, he offers himself stretched out and trampled for my correction. Likewise, when we sin, God will arouse enemies against us. But, in our fight, the only thing we have to do is to seek the reasons for the conflict, and if we have sinned, correct it. If we do that, we will see the enemies fall before our eyes. It is, therefore, a rule for us that we do not avenge our enemies, because God will always stir them up against us on account of our sins. Do you wish to see the destruction of those opposing you: repent from your sins, and the enemies will fall.
