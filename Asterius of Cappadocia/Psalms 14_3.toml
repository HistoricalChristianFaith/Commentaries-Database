Everywhere they all have turned to tyranny. They no longer cling to the prophets. Come, King, appear, and they will fear your authority. All have turned from the ways of the prophets. Come, O Way, and lead back those who have wandered away.… Humankind was created right by God, … but they have turned away by choice to evil.… They have turned away from their right nature.… “There is no one who does good, no, not one.” From head to foot, from rich to poor, the whole world grows sick.

What do they know? That God is an avenger. He is coming as judge of the living and the dead. They know that he is going to return to each one according to his works.… And what do they not know? That God looks down from heaven. What do they not know? That those who do evil displease him. What do they not know? They do not wish to know the ways of God.… And now there are wars, pestilence and volcanoes [earthquakes]. Many never come to their senses concerning their sins, and they are punished with threatening evils. What do they not know? The will of God, his good and celestial promises, his treasures, the delights of paradise, eternal life.
