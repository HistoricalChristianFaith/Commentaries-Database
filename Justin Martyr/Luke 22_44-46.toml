“All my bones are poured out and scattered like water; my heart is become like wax melting in the midst of my belly.” This passage foretold what would happen on that night when they came to Mount Olivet to capture him. In the memoirs of the apostles and their successors, it is written that his perspiration poured out like drops of blood as he prayed and said, “If it is possible, let this cup pass from me.” His heart and bones were evidently quaking, and his heart was like wax melting in his belly. We therefore may understand that the Father wanted his Son to endure in reality these severe sufferings for us. We may not declare that since he was the Son of God, he did not feel what was done and inflicted on him. The words “my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue cleaves to my jaws” predicted that he would remain silent. He who proved that all your teachers are without wisdom did not answer a word in his own defense.
