“Likewise,” I continued, “the offering of flour, my friends, which was ordered to be presented for those cleansed from leprosy, was a prototype of the eucharistic bread, which our Lord Jesus Christ commanded us to offer in remembrance of the passion he endured for all those souls who are cleansed from sin. And … at the same time we should thank God for having created the world and everything in it, for the sake of humankind, and for having saved us from the sin in which we were born, and for the total destruction of the powers and principalities of evil through him who suffered in accordance with his will.
