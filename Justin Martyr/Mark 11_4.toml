The prophecy, “binding his foal to the vine, and washing his robe in the blood of the grape,” contained symbols of the things that were to happen to Christ, and of what he was to do. For the foal of an ass stood bound to a vine at the entrance of a village, and he ordered his disciples to bring it to him then. When it was brought, he mounted and sat upon it, and rode into Jerusalem, where the stately temple of the Jews was which you [Romans]13 have razed to the ground. After this he was crucified, in order that the rest of the prophecy be verified. For the words “washing his robe in the blood of the grape,” prefigured the passion he was to undergo, purifying with his blood those who believe in him.
