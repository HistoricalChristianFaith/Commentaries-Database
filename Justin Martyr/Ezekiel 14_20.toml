You are sadly mistaken if you think that just because you are descendants of Abraham according to the flesh you will share in the legacy of benefits that God promised would be distributed by Christ. No one can in any way participate in any of these gifts, except those who have the same ardent faith as Abraham and who approve of all the mysteries.â€¦ As people who have cut your souls off from this hope, it is necessary that you know how to obtain pardon of your sins and a hope of sharing in the promised blessings. There is no other way than this, that you come to know our Christ, be baptized with the baptism that cleanses you of sin (as Isaiah testified) and thus live a life free of sin.

Those teachers deceive both themselves and you when they suppose that those who are descendants of Abraham according to the flesh will most surely share in the eternal kingdom, even though they are faithless sinners and disobedient to God, suppositions that the Scriptures show have no foundation in fact.
