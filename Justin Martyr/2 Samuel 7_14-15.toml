It would be much better for you, therefore, if, instead of being so contentious, you should repent before the great day of judgment comes, for then, as I showed from Scripture, all those of your tribes who crucified Christ shall lament. Now, I have explained the meaning of the words “The Lord swore, [you are a priest forever] according to the order of Melchizedek.” I have also shown that the prophecy of Isaiah, “His burial has been taken away from the midst,” referred to Christ, who was to be buried and to rise again. I have stated at length that this same Christ will be the judge of both the living and the dead. Further, Nathan spoke thus of him to David, “I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son, and I will not take my mercy away from him, as I did from those who were before him; and I will establish him in my house, and in his kingdom forever.” And Ezekiel states that he shall be the only prince in this house, for he is the Son of God. And do not suppose that Isaiah or the other prophets speak of sacrifices of blood or libations being offered on the altar at his second coming, but only of true and spiritual praises and thanksgivings.
