The words describing the death of Isaiah, whom you Jews sawed in half with a wooden saw, were expunged from the Scriptures. This incident was a symbol of Christ, who is going to cut your nation in two, to admit the worthy half into God’s eternal kingdom with the holy patriarchs and prophets. But the rest, he has said, he will condemn to the undying flames of hell, together with all those of all nations who are likewise disobedient and unrepentant.

Notice how the Lord makes the same promises to Isaac and Jacob. Here are the Lord’s words to Isaac: “By your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.” And to Jacob: “By you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.” But the Lord does not address this blessing to Esau or to Rueben or to any other, but only to them from whom Christ was to come through the Virgin Mary in accordance with the divine plan of our redemption. If you were to think over the blessing of Judah, you would see what I mean, for the seed is divided after Jacob and comes down through Judah and Perez and Jesse and David. Now, this was a sign that some of you Jews would certainly be children of Abraham and at the same time share in the lot of Christ, but that others, also children of Abraham, would be like the sand on the beach, which, though vast and extensive, is barren and fruitless, not bearing any fruit at all, but only drinking up the water of the sea.
