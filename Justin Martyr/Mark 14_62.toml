In reference to his coming from heaven with glory, recall what was spoken to this effect through the prophet: “Behold how the Son of Man comes on the clouds of heaven.” … For the prophets foretold two comings of Christ—one, which has already happened, when he comes in the form of a dishonored and dying man, and the second, when as has been foretold he will come from heaven in glory.
