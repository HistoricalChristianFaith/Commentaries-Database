You know very well that Jerusalem was laid waste just as it was prophesied. That it would be destroyed, and no one allowed to live there, was promised through the prophet Isaiah in this way: “Your land is desolate.” … Indeed you are aware that it is guarded and no one is in it. - "First Apology 47.4–6"
