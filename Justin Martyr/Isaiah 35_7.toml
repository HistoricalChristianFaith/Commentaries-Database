You can easily perceive how the Scriptures foretold that they who were destitute of the knowledge of God (I allude to the Gentiles who had eyes and saw not, hearts and understood not, but worshiped material idols) should abandon their idols and place their hope in Christ.â€¦ The fountain of living water that gushed forth from God upon a land devoid of the knowledge of God (that is, the land of the Gentiles) was our Christ, who made his appearance on earth in the midst of your people and healed those who from birth were blind and deaf and lame. He cured them by his word, causing them to walk, to hear and to see. By restoring the dead to life, he compelled the people of that day to recognize him.
