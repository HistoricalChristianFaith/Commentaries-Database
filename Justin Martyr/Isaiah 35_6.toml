How it was prophesied that our Christ would heal all diseases and raise the dead, hear what was spoken, as follows: “At his coming the lame will leap like a deer, and the stammering tongue will be clear; the blind will see and lepers be cleansed, and the dead will arise and walk.” That he did these things you can learn from the Acts of Pontius Pilate.
