And what the people of the Jews shall say and do, when they see him coming in glory, has thus been predicted by Zechariah the prophet: “I will command the four winds to gather the scattered children; I will command the north wind to bring them, and the south wind, that it not hold back. And then in Jerusalem there shall be great lamentation, not the lamentation of mouths or of lips but the lamentation of the heart; and they shall not rend their garments but their hearts. Tribe by tribe they shall mourn, and then they shall look on him whom they have pierced; and they shall say, ‘Why, O Lord, have you made us to err from your way? The glory which our fathers blessed has for us been turned into shame.’ ”
