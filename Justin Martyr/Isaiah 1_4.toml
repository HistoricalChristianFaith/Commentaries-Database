The Jews who have the writings of the prophets did not understand this, and neither did they recognize Christ when he came. They even despise us who say that he has come, and, as it was prophesied, show that they crucified him. But in order that this may become clear to you, the following words were spoken through the aforementioned prophet Isaiah in the name of the Father: “The ox knows his owner and the donkey his master’s crib; but Israel has not known me, and my people have not understood. Woe, sinful nation, people full of sins, evil seed, lawless children, you have forsaken the Lord.”
