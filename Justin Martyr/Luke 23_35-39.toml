When the Word said, “I am a worm, and no man; the reproach of men, and the outcast of the people,” he foretold what would clearly happen to him. He is everywhere a reproach to us who believe in him, and he is the outcast of the people, for he was thrown out in disgrace by your people, and he endured all the indignities which you directed toward him.… Those who saw him on the cross wagged their heads, curled their lips in scorn, turned up their noses, and sarcastically uttered the words which are recorded in the memoirs of the apostles. “He called himself the Son of God; let him come down from the cross and walk! Let God save him!”
