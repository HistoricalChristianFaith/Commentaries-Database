“We are aware,” said Trypho, “that you [Justin] have quoted those passages for us at our request. But the psalm of David that you just cited seems to have been spoken of nobody else than the Father, who created the heavens and earth. You, however, claim that it refers to him who suffered, and who you are anxious to prove is the Christ.”“Please meditate,” I [Justin] pleaded, “as I repeat the words uttered by the Holy Spirit in this psalm, and you shall understand that I have not spoken maliciously, nor have you in truth been deceived.” Besides, you will thus, when you are by yourselves, be able to grasp many other statements of the Holy Spirit. “Sing to the Lord and bless his name; show forth his salvation from day to day, his wonders among all people.” With these words the Holy Spirit commands all those inhabitants of this globe who know this mystery of salvation [the passion of Christ], through which he saved them, to sing out and constantly praise the Father of all. They should do so since they realize that he is both to be feared and to be praised and is the Creator of heaven and earth. Christ, who redeemed the human race, after he died on the cross, was deemed worthy by him [the Father] to reign over the whole world.

And I will forsake them and will hide my face from them; and there shall be devouring and many evils and afflictions shall overtake them, so that they shall say in that day: ‘In truth it is because the Lord my God is not with us, that these evils have come on us.’ But I will hide my face from them in that day, for all the evils that they have done, because they have followed strange gods.”
