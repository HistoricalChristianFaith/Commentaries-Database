People from every nation look for him who was crucified in Judea, after whose coming the country of the Jews was immediately given over to you as the loot of war. The words “tying his foal to the vine and washing his robe in the blood of the grape” allegorically signified the things that would happen to Christ and the deeds he would perform. The foal of a donkey stood tied to a vine at the entrance to a village. He ordered his disciples to lead it to him. When this was done, he mounted it and sat on it and entered Jerusalem where was located the greatest Jewish temple, which you later destroyed.
