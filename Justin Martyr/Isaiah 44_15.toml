We do not honor with many sacrifices and garlands of flowers such deities as humans have formed and set in shrines and called gods. For we see that these are soulless and dead and do not have the form of God (for we do not consider that God has such a form as some say that they imitate to his honor). These are names and forms of those wicked demons that have appeared. For why need we tell you who already know, into what forms the artisans, carving and cutting, casting and hammering, fashion their materials? And often out of vessels of dishonor, by merely changing the form and making an image of the requisite shape, they make what they call a god; which we consider not only senseless but to be even insulting to God, who, having indescribable glory and form, thus gets his name attached to things that are corruptible and require constant service.
