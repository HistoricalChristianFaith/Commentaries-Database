But in no instance did the heathen … imitate the act of being crucified because they did not understand it, since all that was said about it in Scripture was in the form of symbols. And crucifixion, as the prophet foretold, is the greatest symbol of Christ’s power and role, as is also proven by the things that fall under our own observation. For consider all the things in the world that use this form or are associated with it. No one travels on the sea unless that trophy that is called a sail remains sound on the ship. No one ploughs the earth without it: diggers and mechanics cannot do their work unless they use tools that have this shape. And the human form differs from that of the irrational animals in nothing else than in its being erect and having the hands extended and having on the face extending from the forehead what is called the nose through which the living creature breathes. And this takes no other form than that of the cross. And so it was said by the prophet, “The breath before our face is the Lord Christ.” And the power of this form is further shown by your own symbols on what are called vexilla [banners] and trophies, with which all your state possessions are made, using these as the insignia of your power and government, even though you do so unwittingly. And with this form you consecrate the images of your emperors when they die, and you name them gods by inscriptions.
