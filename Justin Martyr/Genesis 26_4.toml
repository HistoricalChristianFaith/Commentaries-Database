By our similar faith we have become children of Abraham. For, just as he believed the voice of God and was justified thereby, so have we believed the voice of God (which was spoken again to us by the prophets and the apostles of Christ) and have renounced even to death all worldly things. Thus God promised Abraham a religious and righteous nation of similar faith and a delight to the Father; but it is not you, “in whom there is no faith.”Notice how he makes the same promises to Isaac and Jacob. Here are God’s words to Isaac: “In your seed shall all the nations be blessed.” And to Jacob: “In you and in your seed all the tribes of the earth shall be blessed.” But God does not address this blessing to Esau, or to Reu-ben or to any other but only to them from whom Christ was to come through the Virgin Mary in accordance with the divine plan of our redemption. If you were to think over the blessing of Judah, you would see what I mean. For the seed is divided after Jacob and comes down through Judah and Perez and Jesse and David. Now this was a sign that some of you Jews would be certainly children of Abraham and at the same time would share in the lot of Christ.
