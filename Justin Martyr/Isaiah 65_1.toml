This is really the nation promised to Abraham by God, when [God] told him that he would make Abraham a father of many nations, not saying in particular that he would be father of the Arabs, of the Egyptians or the Idumaeans.… And we shall inherit the Holy Land together with Abraham, receiving our inheritance for all eternity, because by our similar faith we have become children of Abraham.… Thus, God promised Abraham a religious and righteous nation of similar faith and a delight to the Father.
