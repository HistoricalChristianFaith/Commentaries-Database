We can show you that this actually happened. For a group of twelve men went out from Jerusalem, and they were ignorant men, not trained in oratory. But through the power of God they witnessed to every race of humanity that they were sent out by Christ to teach the Word of God to all people. Now we who once killed one another no longer war against each other, but moreso we gladly die for the confession of Christ in order not to lie to or deceive our interrogators.
