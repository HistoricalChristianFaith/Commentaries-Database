Our hearts are thus circumcised from evil so that we are happy to die for the name of the good Rock that causes living water to burst forth for the hearts of those who by him have loved the Father of all and that allows those who are willing to drink of the water of life. But you do not comprehend what I am saying when I speak these things. You have not understood what has been prophesied about what Christ would do. You do not believe us when we draw your attention to what has been written. For Jeremiah thus cries, “Woe to you! You have forsaken the living fountain and have dug for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water. Shall there be a wilderness where Mount Zion is, because I gave Jerusalem a bill of divorce in your sight?”

Jacob, as I have remarked before, being himself a type of Christ, had married the two handmaids of his two free wives and had sons by them. He did this to indicate ahead of time that Christ would receive even all those who among Japheth’s race are descendants of Canaan equally with the free and would have their children be heirs with them. This is what we are. But you cannot comprehend this because you cannot drink of the living fountain of God but of broken cisterns that can hold no water, as the Scripture says.

We do not receive that useless baptism of cisterns, for it has nothing to do with this baptism of life. This is why God also announced that you have forsaken him, the living fountain, and dug for yourselves broken cisterns that can hold no water.

By reason, therefore, of this bath of repentance and knowledge of God, which has been ordained on account of the transgression of God’s people, as Isaiah cries, we have believed and testify that that very baptism that he announced is alone able to purify those who have repented. This is the water of life. But the cisterns that you have dug for yourselves are broken and profitless to you.
