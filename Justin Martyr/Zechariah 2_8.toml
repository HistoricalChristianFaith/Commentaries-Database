Say no evil thing, my brothers, against him that was crucified, and treat not scornfully the stripes wherewith all may be healed, even as we are healed. For it will be well if, persuaded by the Scriptures, you are circumcised from hardheartedness. This is not that circumcision which you have from the tenets that are put into you; for that was given for a sign, and not for a work of righteousness, as the Scriptures compel you [to admit]. Assent, therefore, and pour no ridicule on the Son of God; do not obey the Pharisaic teachers; and scoff not at the king of Israel, as the rulers of your synagogues teach you to do after your prayers. For if he that touches those that are not pleasing to God is as one that touches the apple of Godâ€™s eye, how much more so is he that touches his beloved! And that this is he has been sufficiently demonstrated.
