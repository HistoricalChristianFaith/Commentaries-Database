Furthermore, from a verse of the ninety-sixth psalm of David they have left out the short phrase “from the tree.” For they have changed the verse, “Say to the Gentiles: The Lord has reigned from the tree,” to “Say to the Gentiles: The Lord has reigned.” Now, no one of your people was ever said to have reigned as God and King over the Gentiles, except the crucified One, who (as the Holy Spirit testifies in the same psalm) was freed from death by his resurrection and thus showed that he is not like gods of the Gentiles, for they are but the idols of demons.
