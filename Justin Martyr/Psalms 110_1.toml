If, sirs, it were not said by the Scriptures which I have already quoted, that His form was inglorious, and His generation not declared, and that for His death the rich would suffer death, and with His stripes we should be healed, and that He would be led away like a sheep; and if I had not explained that there would be two advents of His — one in which He was pierced by you; a second, when you shall know Him whom you have pierced, and your tribes shall mourn, each tribe by itself, the women apart, and the men apart — then I must have been speaking dubious and obscure things. But now, by means of the contents of those Scriptures esteemed holy and prophetic among you, I attempt to prove all [that I have adduced], in the hope that some one of you may be found to be of that remnant which has been left by the grace of the Lord of Sabaoth for the eternal salvation. In order, therefore, that the matter inquired into may be plainer to you, I will mention to you other words also spoken by the blessed David, from which you will perceive that the Lord is called the Christ by the Holy Spirit of prophecy; and that the Lord, the Father of all, has brought Him again from the earth, setting Him at His own right hand, until He makes His enemies His footstool; which indeed happens from the time that our Lord Jesus Christ ascended to heaven, after He rose again from the dead, the times now running on to their consummation; and he whom Daniel foretells would have dominion for a time, and times, and an half, is even already at the door, about to speak blasphemous and daring things against the Most High. But you, being ignorant of how long he will have dominion, hold another opinion.

That God the Father of the universe would bring Christ to heaven after his resurrection from the dead and would keep him there until he destroyed his enemies, the demons, and until the quota of those whom he foreknows to be good and virtuous was complete, because of whom he has always delayed the consummation of the world, listen to the words spoken through David the prophet: “The Lord said to my Lord: ‘Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.’ The Lord shall send to you the scepter of power out of Jerusalem; and rule you in the midst of your enemies. With you is the government in the day of your power, in the brightness of your saints. From the womb have I begotten you before the morning star.” The words “he shall send to you the scepter of power out of Jerusalem” signified the powerful teaching that the apostles, going out from Jerusalem, preached everywhere. And although those who teach, or even profess, the name of Christ, will be martyred, we everywhere both accept and teach it. But, if you also should read these words with hostile mind, you can do nothing more, as we already stated, than kill us, which does no real harm to us, but does bring the eternal punishment of fire to you and to all who unjustly hate and do not repent.

For instance, your teachers have presumed to refer the words, “The Lord said, to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool,” to Hezekiah as if he were ordered to sit on the right side of the temple, when the Assyrian king sent men to him with menacing messages and he was warned by Isaiah not to be afraid. Now, we all know and acknowledge that what Isaiah predicted did actually happen, and that in the days of Hezekiah the Assyrian king was stopped from waging war on Jerusalem and that an angel of the Lord put to death about 185, in the Assyrian camp. But, it is evident that the quoted psalm does not refer to Hezekiah, for thus is it worded: “The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, till I make your enemies your footstool. He shall send forth the scepter of power on Jerusalem, and he shall rule in the midst of your enemies. In the brightness of the saints, before the morning star I begat you. The Lord has sworn, and he will not repent: You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.” Now, who will not concede that Hezekiah was not a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek? And who is not aware that he was not the redeemer of Jerusalem? And who does not know that he did not send the scepter of power on Jerusalem and did not rule in the midst of his enemies? (For was it not God who turned his enemies away while he wept and moaned?) But, although our Jesus has not yet returned in glory, he has sent forth into Jerusalem the scepter of power, namely, the call to repentance to all the nations over which the demons used to rule, as David testifies: “The gods of the Gentiles are demons.” And the power of his word compelled many to abandon the demons whom they used to obey and through him to believe in almighty God, because the gods of the Gentiles are demons. Furthermore, we have proved earlier that the words, “In the brightness of the saints, from the womb before the morning star I begot you,” were addressed to Christ!
