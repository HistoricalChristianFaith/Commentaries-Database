There were prophets a very long time ago more ancient than these who are reputed to be philosophers, blessed and righteous and dear to God. They spoke by a divine spirit, and they oracularly predicted future events which are now taking place. They are truly called prophets.â€¦ Past events and events now taking place compel us to agree with what was spoken by them. Furthermore they deserved to be believed because of the miracles which they performed, since they were glorifying God the Creator and Father of the universe and they were announcing the Christ coming from him, his Son. The false prophets who were filled with the deceitful and filthy spirit never did nor now do this. They dare to work various supposed miracles in order to impress men, and they glorify the spirits and demons of deceit.
