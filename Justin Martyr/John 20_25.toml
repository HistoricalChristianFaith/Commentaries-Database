David refers to Jesus’ suffering and to the cross in a parable of mystery in Psalm 22[:16-18], “They pierced my hands and my feet.” … But you still maintain that this very psalm does not refer to Christ because, in your blindness, you fail to realize that no one in [the Jewish] nation who has been called king or Christ has ever had his hands or feet pierced while alive or has died in this mysterious fashion—that is, by the cross—except this Jesus alone.
