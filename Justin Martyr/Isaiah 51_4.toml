The law promulgated on Horeb is now old and belongs to yourselves alone, but this is for all universality. Now, law placed against law has abrogated that which is before it, and a covenant that comes after in like manner has put an end to the previous one; and an eternal and final law—namely, Christ—has been given to us, and the covenant is trustworthy, after which there shall be no law, no commandment or ordinance. Have you not read this, which Isaiah says: “Hearken to me, hearken to me, my people; and your kings, give ear to me: for a law shall go forth from me, and my judgment shall be for a light to the nations.” And Jeremiah, concerning this same new covenant, speaks this way: “Behold, the days come, says the Lord, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah; not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day that I took them by the hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt.”
