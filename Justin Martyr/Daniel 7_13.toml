Does not Daniel allude to this very truth when he says that he who received the eternal kingdom is “as a Son of man”? The words “as a Son of man” indicate that he would become man and appear as such but that he would not be born of a human seed. Daniel states the same truth figuratively when he call Christ “a stone cut out without hands,” for, to affirm that he was cut out without hands signifies that he was not the product of human activity but of the will of God, the Father of all, who brought him forth.
