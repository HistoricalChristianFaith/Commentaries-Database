I have already affirmed, and I repeat, that it had been predicted that he would do this after his ascension into heaven. It was said, therefore, “He ascended on high; he led captivity captive; he gave gifts to the sons of men.” And in another prophecy it is said, “And it shall come to pass after this, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and upon my servants and upon my handmaids, and they shall prophesy.”
