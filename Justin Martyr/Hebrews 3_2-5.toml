The Word of God … is also called “angel” and “apostle” for as angel he announces what it is necessary to know, and as apostle he is sent forth to testify to what is announced. As our Lord himself said, “He that hears me hears him that sent me.” This can be made clear from the writings of Moses, in which this is to be found: “And the angel of the Lord spoke to Moses in a flame of fire out of the bush and said, ‘I am he who is, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, the God of your fathers; go down to Egypt and bring out my people.’ ” … But these words were uttered to demonstrate that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, an apostle, who was first the Word and appeared, now in the form of fire, now in the image of the bodiless creatures.… The Jews, continuing to think that the Father of the universe had spoken to Moses when it was the Son of God, who is called both angel and apostle, who spoke to him, were rightly censured both by the prophetic Spirit and by Christ himself, since they knew neither the Father nor the Son.… What was said out of the bush to Moses, “I am he who is the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob and the God of your fathers,” was an indication that they, though dead, still existed and were Christ’s own people. For they were the first of all people to devote themselves to seeking after God, Abraham being the father of Isaac, and Isaac of Jacob, as Moses also recorded.
