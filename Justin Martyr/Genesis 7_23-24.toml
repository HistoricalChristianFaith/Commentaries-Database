When the sacred text states that the entire earth was inundated, as the water reached a height of twenty-three feet above the highest mountains, it is evident that God was not speaking to your land [that is, Israel] in particular but to all those who are faithful to him, for whom he has arranged a restful haven in Jerusalem. All the signs that accompanied the flood prove my assertion. For by the expression “by water and faith and wood” it is indicated that those who prepare themselves and repent of their sins shall escape the future judgment of God.
