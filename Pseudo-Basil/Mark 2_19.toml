True death is not a result of hunger for bread nor a result of thirst for this tangible water, but as a result of a hunger for hearing the word of the Lord. True death arises in the souls of those who do not hear. For one does “not live by bread alone, but by every word coming out through the mouth of God.” This is why … the attendants of the bridegroom cannot fast as long as the bridegroom is with them.
