By the fire and blood he signifies the wrath of God, which devours the multitude of the impious.

A third of the earth and the trees and all the grass is said to be burned up. The “earth” represents everything terrestrial, while persons who wave about through unfaithfulness are depicted as “trees.” For those blown about by “every wind of doctrine” are mentioned by the apostle Jude, “fruitless trees in late autumn, uprooted, twice dead.” The green grass represents flesh fattened with luxury, for “all flesh is grass.” Although in an earlier passage three fourths were set against one, that is, the church, this passage confines those opposed to the church to two thirds. One third consists of the false brothers who are mixed in among the good within the church, and another third that is separated by the error of the Gentiles or by heretical depravity or by open schism. And so the church (namely, the one third) must struggle against a double evil, as though it were simplicity resisting duplicity. It is as we read in the Gospel that a king with ten thousand went out to war against twenty thousand. And God did make a promise concerning this through Zechariah, saying, “In the whole land, says the Lord, two thirds shall be dispersed and perish, and one third shall remain in it; and I shall lead the third part through fire, and I shall refine them as one refines silver, and I shall test them as gold is tested. It shall call my name, and I will answer them and say, ‘You are my people,’ and they will say, ‘The Lord is my God.’ ”

The “trees” and the “earth” represent people who are the internal enemies of the church and whom [God] shall punish by a future judgment to everlasting punishment. The “grass” represents the flesh, which is fattened through the vices of sins and whose strength and beauty have dried through the heat of the sun. To be sure, the third part which it said was destroyed by being burned up refers to the heretics. For anyone who is found outside of the true church shall be condemned to perpetual torments, along with the devil, who is the author of such division. And so through Zechariah the Lord promised to strike the false shepherds and to free his sheep from their difficulties and to separate the third part, which he says is like the nations and “Sodom,” from the midst of his sheep, that is, from the midst of the pious. “Awake, O sword,” it says, “against the shepherds and those who are next to me, says the Lord Almighty. Strike the shepherds and scatter the sheep,” that is, my people. “And I shall test it as gold is tested. It will call me and I will answer it and say, ‘You are my people,’ and it will say ‘You are my God.’ ” Before this separation occurs, all are regarded as the people of God. However, after the separation has happened, then it will become apparent who are the people of God and who are of the devil.
