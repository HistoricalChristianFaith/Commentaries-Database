Babylon is interpreted as confusion. By it the city and the people of the devil are signified, as is also the entire seduction of the vices that it always exercises for its own ruin and for the ruin of the human race. It says that this city, which is hastening toward its fall, has already fallen. This is a common way of speaking in the Scripture, which often refers to events as past when they are yet in the future, especially when it knows that what it predicts will inevitably be fulfilled. Here is an example of this way of speaking: “They divided my clothes among themselves,” and other similar statements. However, it may also speak in this manner because it was already well known then that the haughty fall whenever they dare to become proud. Therefore the psalm says, “You have cast them down when they were lifted up,” for, to be sure, they were then thrown down when they were lifted up. According to this habit of speaking, then, the Scripture has said, “All nations have fallen because of the wine of their fornication,” because this city, which is drunk and is constructed from all nations that it gathers to itself, itself has drunk from the wine of fornication. For all the nations, made drunk by errors, constitute the city itself, but the Scripture, according to its style, talks only of the one [city].
