“I know where you dwell, where Satan’s throne is.” This he says to every church, since the tempter is everywhere, and to him it is said, “She shall watch your head, and you shall watch for her heel.” “For the world is placed in evil.” Those persons are the throne of Satan whom he owns in wickedness. The Evangelist reverts to the species, for although the entire sevenfold church is symbolized by these seven locales, nonetheless certain things have occurred in them specifically which he either praises or rebukes.

“You hold my name and you did not deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you.” Indeed, Christ is killed among many, who either do not believe that he rose again, or who deny him among themselves through condemnable faults, and this is “where Satan dwells.”
