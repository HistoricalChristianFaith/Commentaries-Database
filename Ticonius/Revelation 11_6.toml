It says, “they have,” not “they will have.” For whoever remains in the faith of the one church of God will in no way be wanting in that power conferred upon him by God. “They have power to turn the waters into blood and to smite the earth with every plague as often as they desire.” We have often said that everything that God is said to have done for the sake of his church is attached to the powers of the church. The Lord gives power to the church so that what is bound on earth is also bound in heaven. Heaven is spiritually closed “that no rain fall,” that is, that no rain of blessing fall upon the dry land. The Lord spoke of this concerning the vineyard of the Jews: “I shall also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.” And not only did they suspend the rain but even made useless that rain which had fallen. For the water was changed into blood, even as the very earth was struck with every plague. Nor did these things occur by way of accident or fortuitously. Rather, “as often as they desired,” that is, as often as he desired who conceded to them such power. As the apostle says of the Holy Spirit, “apportioning to each one individually as he wills.” And again, “As God assigns to each one a measure of faith.”
