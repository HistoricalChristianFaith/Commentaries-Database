He had said before, “who opens and no one shuts,” lest anyone say that the door of the church, which God opens in the whole world, can be closed by anyone in some part of the world.

The door, which Christ opened, he then began to reveal to the church when he opened the mind of his disciples so that they might understand the Scriptures. This door is never shut, by the power or the effort of anyone, which is already opened to those who preach to the whole world. For this reason the apostle says, “A wide door has opened for us in the Lord, and there are many adversaries.”
