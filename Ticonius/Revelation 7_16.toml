They will not hunger because they are fed by the living Bread. He said, “I am the living Bread who comes came down from heaven.” Nor will they thirst, for they will drink from a cup so excellent that it will be for them what the Truth said, “Whoever believes in me shall never thirst,” and again, “Whoever drinks from the water that I shall give him, it will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.” Nor will the sun strike them, nor will they be burned by the deadly heat of its fire. God promised something similar to his church through Isaiah, “A shelter from the storm, shade from the heat.” He proclaims that the strength of his sacraments will be strong in those who belong to him and that they will not be vexed by the heat of temptation.
