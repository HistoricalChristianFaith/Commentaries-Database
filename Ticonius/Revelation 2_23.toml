How is it that before God hands over adulterers to death the churches do not know that God is he who searches mind and heart? How is it that the church is said to know at the end of things and not at the beginning of her faith that God knows all secrets? When he said, “all the churches will know,” he was not saying that the church would know only after the event but that the church knows from faith. For the words “I will kill” do not refer to that death that is visible but to spiritual death. Just as his revenge on the mother specifically would become visible, so he here promises that among all the churches it would become clear that the children of the woman, that is, those born of the same spirit, were subject to spiritual death, although they were not [visibly] delivered over to it. David also made this distinction between the particular and the general when he fought Goliath. He said, “I will kill you and all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel.” … Then he adds the particular when he says, “And all this assembly will know that the Lord saves his people not with sword and spear.” He said “all this assembly” because there were persons there who doubted that David could prevail against Goliath. To be sure, there were also spiritual persons who believed that he would defeat [Goliath] in the name of God. Those among whom this event occurred in their presence saw with their own eyes, not by faith. However, through faith we see God at work today, not as they did but in a marvelous way. And so, as with Goliath we see the children of Jezebel, who do not want to be subject to the truth, punished with death. We recognize from the phraseology [of the text] itself that in her children the Lord signifies the woman’s posterity. For he threatened the mother with a temporal punishment that he might hand her over to eternal sorrows. However, he did not say, “I kill the children with the sword” but “I will slay them with death.”
