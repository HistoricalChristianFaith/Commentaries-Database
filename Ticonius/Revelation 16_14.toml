We are to believe that these will do wonders even as was the case through the magicians of Pharaoh. Not without reason did he recollect their deeds at the mention of the frogs, so that he might foretell that the ministers of Satan will themselves do similar wonders. For until the sign of the frogs the magicians had been allowed to prevail through their incantations. “They go out to the kings to gather them for war.” This does not mean that there will be an assembly from every place on the earth to one location but that each and every nation made captive in its own place to its own superstitions will wish to serve in the army [of Satan].… The “day of the Lord” must be interpreted according to various situations and contexts. Sometimes it refers to the whole time from the passion of the Lord, so that those who are going to be condemned to the last judgment are said now to be gathered together, as though to say, prepared. At other times “day of the Lord” can be understood to refer to the day of judgment itself, and at other times the phrase refers to the time of persecution, in which case it is clear that people of this kind are gathered together throughout the whole time of the present life.
