They say that death is a rest. And so, they seek death, not that they may die but that they might have rest from evil things while the evil vices die away. They desired to die, that is, that they might die to the world and, as the apostle says, live again to God. “They seek death but will not find it,” it says. They desire to be changed to better things, so that they might have rest after the labor of sins.… Therefore, “death will flee” while life is close by and we are truly dying while we are being freed from the chains of sins.
