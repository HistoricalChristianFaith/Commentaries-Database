With reason did his face shine “as the sun in full strength,” for he opened the book that had been sealed in mystery. “He placed his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the land,” so that he might confirm the precept of his law by land and by sea. Nor was it without reason that he placed his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. In the right foot he signifies the stronger members who have been made firm through great dangers. In the left foot he indicates the crowd of candidates who have not yet received the sign of the faith.
