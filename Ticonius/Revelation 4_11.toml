We also know of another translation: “Because you have created all things, and they exist and are created on account of your will.” Indeed, all things existed in the artful wisdom [of God] before they were formed in the act of creation. However, they were created in order that those things might exist also visibly which in their natures are according to the ideas written in the wisdom of God.
