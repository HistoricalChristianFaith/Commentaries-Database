When he says “Rise,” he arouses the church, for John, who is an image of the church, did not hear these things sitting down but standing up. “Measure,” it says, “the temple and the altar and those who worship there.” He did not command that everyone be measured; rather, he commanded that a portion be prepared unto the end [time], so that what is said in the Gospel might be fulfilled, “Many are called, but few are chosen.” “But do not measure the court outside the temple, leave that out.” The court, which is outside the temple, although it seems to belong to the temple, in fact is not the temple, for it has no relation to the holy of holies. These are those persons who appear to be in the church but are outside of it.… Those persons who are outside the temple are also the nations who have never believed the gospel of the Lord. Both groups will trample his church.
