He had earlier said that “you must prophesy again.” Now he desires to show this in his two witnesses. In the two witnesses, he wants us to understand the two Testaments by which his church is governed and ruled. For he did not say, “I make witnesses for myself,” as though they did not yet exist. Rather, he said, “I shall give to my witnesses,” who were with me from the beginning and have never at all departed from me. The 1, days are not a time of peace but of the last persecution, during which time the devil shall break out against the Christians, namely, when he receives power to test the church. And just as before the flood, when the sins of humankind raised their head to the heavens, there was not absent someone who might proclaim the wrath of God to those who were perishing, so also at that time there will be those who will announce the kingdom of God and the last day and by their own example will show the way of repentance to sinners. [The witnesses] were “clothed in sackcloth,” it says, that is, they were established in confession. As the prophet said, “When they troubled me, I clothed myself in sackcloth.” And Job said, “They have sewed sackcloth upon my skin.”
