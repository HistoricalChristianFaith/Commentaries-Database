In the one angel he clearly shows the body of the church. Although he speaks of one, he shows many. “He says to me, ‘You must preach again.’ ” When did the church ever cease from its preaching, so that she should preach again what she had preached before? However, in the whole world [the church] is commanded to preach again among the peoples, tribes, tongues and in many regions what she had preached before. For there is one church diffused throughout the whole world, which she has filled with its preaching.
