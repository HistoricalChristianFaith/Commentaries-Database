He speaks to every church that is poor in spirit yet possesses all things, as the apostle says, “as having nothing, and yet possessing everything.” “And you are slandered by those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.” Here certainly it is shown that he was not speaking only to a special church, for it was not only at Smyrna where there were or are Jews who slander. However, it is possible that there is a double meaning of “Jews” here, either those who are openly Jews outside or those who are Jews within [the church], that is, false Christians. For religiosity is characteristic of the Jews, as the apostle says, “He is a Jew who is one inwardly, and real circumcision is a matter of the heart, spiritual and not literal.” And again he says, “We are the circumcision who worship God in spirit, and put no confidence in the flesh.” Nor ought we ourselves to abandon those [in the church] when they are even called a synagogue of Satan. For we know that the Lord has presented us with an example of longsuffering by tolerating Judas even unto the end.
