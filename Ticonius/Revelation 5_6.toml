The throne, the animals, the elders are all the church. For the church is in the midst, and he continues to describe the scene and says, “A lamb standing as though slain.” For as often as Christ is preached in the midst of the church as slain, so often is the same Lamb seen as though sacrificed for the fault of the world, since what is unknown is made known to the uninitiated and the memory of the faithful is formed by a pious worship. For whenever the church, which Christ has put on, mortifies herself to the world that she might live to God, the Lamb is said to be sacrificed, as though the Head for the body. And so it continues: “Having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.” The variety of words teaches but one understanding, for the horns symbolize the most excellent gifts of the Holy Spirit by which Christ reigns throughout the world in his church. It continues, “which are the seven spirits of God.” For no one governs with a righteous prominence throughout the world or is especially glorified by the gift of the Holy Spirit spread abroad, except the church. As we know, seven signifies universality and completeness. And this is true, because the horns are upon the head, and so the exaltation of each church is rightly said to be placed upon Christ. For “upon this Rock I shall build my church,” which is as though he said, “I shall build you upon me.”
