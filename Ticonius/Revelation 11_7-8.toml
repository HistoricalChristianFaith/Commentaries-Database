When he says, “when they have finished their witness,” he clearly explains that these things will take place before the last persecution, at least that which they relate until the revelation of the beast who will ascend from the abyss, that is, from the depths of the iniquity of the hearts of the Jews. For, according to tradition, the antichrist will arise from the tribe of Dan. And “he will conquer them,” namely, in those who will have succumbed. However, “he will kill them,” indicating those who for the name of Christ will have been killed by a praiseworthy suffering. “And he will lay their bodies in the middle of that great city which is spiritually called Sodom, where also their Lord was crucified.” Another translation renders it [in the singular] “body.” And so it speaks of one body of the two, while elsewhere in subsequent verses it speaks of the “bodies.” In this way, he preserves the number of the Testaments, while the two witnesses demonstrate the one body of the church. This body—he speaks not only of those killed but also of those who are living—is thrown down, that is, it is despised, as [the psalmist says], “You have cast my words behind you.” [He casts them down] “in the middle,” that is, openly and visibly. This is, to be sure, that “Jerusalem which killed the prophets,” according to the words of the Lord who reproached it, saying, “and stoned those who were sent to you.” Rightly was [Jerusalem] reproved, nor did it deserve to be restored.
