The apostle also says, “He will come like a thief in the night.” … [The apostle] says, “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” I think that here he urges that these vestments be preserved so that they will not be torn asunder by repeated baptism or besprinkled and stained by the spots of sins. In either case the ugliness of their treachery is uncovered which might have been avoided had their intention been preserved with a greater vigilance.
