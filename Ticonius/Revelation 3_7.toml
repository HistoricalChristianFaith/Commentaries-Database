“Who has the key of David,” that is, royal authority. He says “the key of David” either because Christ was born from his family or because David himself foretold many things concerning Christ. Through the dispensation of Christ, as though by a key, the secrets of the law and of the prophets and of the psalms were made manifest. Christ himself attests to this when he says, “Everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms must be fulfilled.”

“Who opens and no one shall shut, who shuts and no one opens.” It is evident that Christ opens [the door] to those who knock, but to hypocrites who knock and say, “Lord, Lord open to us,” he closes the door of life and says to them, “I do not know from where you come; I never knew you, you evildoers.”
