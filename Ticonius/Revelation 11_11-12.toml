“And they went up to heaven in a cloud.” The apostle spoke of this, saying, “We will be caught up in the clouds to meet Christ in the air.” It is written that this cannot happen to anyone before the coming of the Lord, since at his coming all flesh is approved to arise from their graves. And so the faulty idea of those is excluded who think that these two witnesses are only two men who ascend on the clouds before the coming of Christ. For how could those “who dwell on the earth” rejoice at the death of two men if they died in only one city? Or how do they “exchange presents” if in a short period of time those who threw their bodies in the streets were disquieted by their resurrection although shortly beforehand they were rejoicing at their death? Their courage and reason were stupefied because throughout the earth the announcement came not of their death but of their resurrection. What kind of joy would it be, or what kind of pleasure for those who are feasting would it be, if along with the feast there was the stench of the dead? “And a great fear fell on those who saw them.” He says this of those who are alive when they see the resurrection of those who sleep and are shaken by a horrible fear. “And their enemies saw them [ascend].” Here he separates the unrighteous from the righteous and those who were steadfast in faith from those who were timid.
