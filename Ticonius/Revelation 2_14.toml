“But I have a few things against you.” To be sure, he speaks against some members who must be blamed, but not against those to whom he says, “But you did not deny my faith. You have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to practice immorality.” To eat and to commit fornication are the two principle forms [of sin] that the hypocrites struggle to enjoy, as the Lord says, “Inside you are full of plunder and incontinence and every iniquity.” Idolatry is spiritual fornication. “You have lost,” it says, “all who go whoring from you.”
