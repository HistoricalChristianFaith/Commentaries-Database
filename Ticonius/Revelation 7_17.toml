Earlier he had said that the Lamb seated on the throne received the book. Now he says that the Lamb in the midst of the throne rules them. In this way he teaches that there is one throne for the Father and the Son, since the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, that is, in the midst of the church, in which the one God, the entire Trinity, dwells through faith.

All of these things will happen to us spiritually when sins have been forgiven and we rise to life, that is, when the “old man has been stripped off and we have put on Christ” and are filled “with the joy of the Holy Spirit.” For this is the life that the Lord promised to his church when he said, “Behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy. I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and be glad in my people; no more will be heard in it the sound of weeping or the cry of distress.”
