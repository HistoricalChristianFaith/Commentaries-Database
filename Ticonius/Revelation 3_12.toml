“And he shall never go out of it.” The nations went out from God, and they gave to idols that worship which they owed to God alone. But “all the families of the nations will remember and turn to the Lord and shall worship before him.” This refers to those whom he foretold would come “from the synagogue of Satan.” For having broken the bond of charity, the schismatics have gone out of the house of God. They are those who have separated themselves from the body of the whole church which is throughout the world and who vainly glory in themselves and firmly believe that they are the whole church, even though they themselves are not everywhere. For when he says that “he shall never go out of it,” he shows that at the end of time there will be a struggle. For it will happen that after unity there will be a final struggle in which there will be another separation. And wherever anyone will have been freed, he shall certainly not go out, and he shall remain in the house, not as a slave but as a son. And therefore God allowed those who were saved from the flood in the ark to go out, because until that time there was still time for returning from one’s sins. However, at the end of time it will not be allowed one any longer to come out, for whoever at that time will go out, will have not occasion for repentance.

“And I will write on him the name of my God.” That is, we are signed with the name of Christian. “And the name of the city of the new Jerusalem which comes down from my God out of heaven.” The name of the church that daily comes down from God out of heaven, that is, from the church that is reborn by the Lord. He speaks of it as new because of the newness of the Son of man who is the new Jerusalem.… “Indeed, the name which is above every name.” However, this name is not new because it refers to the Son of God, who existed before the world and possessed this glory with the Father. Rather, this name is new in regard to the Son of man who died and on the third day rose again and, ascending to the heavens, sits at the right hand of the Father. For it is the Son of man who said “my new name,” whom [John] saw “in the midst of the seven lampstands.” This Son of man is God “at whose name every knee bows, in heaven and on earth and under the earth.”
