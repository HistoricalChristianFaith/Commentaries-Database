Here a “sea” is mentioned, which above was called a “bottomless pit” from which this beast would ascend. In both instances a people is indicated. Indeed, he sees a people arising from a people, namely, a beast coming forth from a people. Normally “beast” is a designation of that which is hostile to the Lamb, but in a narrative one must determine from passage to passage what aspect of the beast is signified. For sometimes the devil is the beast, elsewhere the beast is his body or one of the heads of that beast such as the one which rises up although he seemed wounded unto death, which is a false imitation of the true faith. In other passages the beast might signify only the leaders. In this present passage the beast that rises from the sea refers to the body of the devil, which has ten horns and seven heads and diadems upon its horns and a blasphemous name upon its heads. And rightly is he said to be named with a name of blasphemy, since he desires to be regarded as God.
