“To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna.” This manna is the invisible Bread which came down from heaven, which indeed was made man, so that “man might eat the bread of angels.” And the figure of this was indicated beforehand in the manna given in the desert. Whoever ate of that bread were said by the Lord to have died, because remaining faithless, they did not eat of this hidden and uniquely spiritual manna by which [Christ] offers immortality to the faithful. For he said, “Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you will not have eternal life in you.” For, indeed, whoever at that time was able to eat spiritually, they were worthy to obtain the same immortality, as were Moses and others. As the apostle teaches, “They ate the same spiritual food.” For the visible manna was in no way detrimental to those who used the bodily food in a spiritual manner. So also now, the spiritual manna of the Lord’s body does not profit persons in the present if they receive it unworthily, for “they eat and drink judgment upon themselves.”
