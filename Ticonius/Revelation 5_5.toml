In this one elder we recognize the whole body of the prophets, for their prophecies consoled the church as they foretold that Christ would come from the tribe of Judah and would redeem the world by his own blood. Of him it was foretold: “Judah is a lion’s whelp. For prey, my son, you have gone up. You lie in wait as a lion and as a lioness. Who will rouse him up?” Moreover, the same one is taught to be a lamb as well as a lion, for he assumed death with a devout innocence, even as he killed with power the death he had assumed. To death he had long ago truly issued threats, saying through Hosea, “I will be your death, O death, I will be your sting, O hades.” And through Isaiah, “Behold, the root of Jesse will rise for the salvation of the people. The nations will entreat him, and his sepulcher will be glorious.” For when anyone of the faithful individually and earnestly weeps for his or her own sins and recalls the promises of redemption “through the consolation of the Scriptures,” [that person] will recognize that he or she has the hope of eternal salvation. As I say, by one of the elders this is confirmed with a similar response. For this reason, he mentions what is past while he is also promising the future, because in the things of the past the Spirit shows future things by way of subtle hints.
