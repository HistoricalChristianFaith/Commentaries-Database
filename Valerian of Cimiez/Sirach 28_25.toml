All evil certainly issues from the heart. However harmful in itself, though, this can easily be tolerated if what has been fed by wicked counsel has not led to quarrels. In such a case one suffers silently or simply closes himself in his house and remains quiet. In fact, the infirmity of evil thoughts can be healed to the same degree that what is conceived in the heart is restrained by a taciturn mouth. But once the tongue is loosed and it bursts forth, it is useless to seek a doctor. Indeed, there is no remedy for a misdeed in words, because no amount of tears can eliminate an injury that has entered through the ears and had its effect. Listen to the Lord, who says, “Make gates and bolts for your mouths, and a balance to weigh your words.”
