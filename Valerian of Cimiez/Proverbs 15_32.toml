If the prophet deems those guilty whom discipline has never reached, what should we think of those whom it has abandoned? Discerning between the acts of these two classes of people, the prophet authoritatively regards the fault of never having come to discipline as one less serious than that of having rejected her law. Notice his words: “He that rejects instruction despises his own soul.” The case truly is just what he says. For the person who has spurned the warnings of discipline in order to occupy himself with the devil’s business is indeed the foe of his own soul.
