The cry of the hungry person is a challenge in your ears, and the sound of a failing voice from a hungry throat is striking at your door. Why do you not think of that phrase, “Blessed is he that understands concerning the needy and the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.” The businessman who keeps stored away in a sack the money with which he could carry on gainful trading is recognized as being quite a fool.
