Listen to Solomon, who says, “Do something good for yourself; give alms to the poor.” Whoever, then, desires to look out for his own advantage willingly sustains the poor. There is no lack of opportunities by which, every day, you may acquire gain if you pay attention to the needs of the poverty of others. In fact, the Scripture says, “Sins are cleansed by alms and by faith.” Look, this one seeks a meal with a famished mouth. And that one, by his nakedness, says that he lacks even the scantiest of clothing.
