Clearly, as often as we succor the wretched, we give to ourselves. The dispensing of our resources is our gain. For if you consider again the hope of future reward, whatever is given to the poor is reckoned as a profit. That is what the prophet states: “Blessed is he who understands concerning the needy and the poor: the Lord will deliver him in the evil day.”
