Who does not hate this kind of [merely verbal] “mercy”? In it an idle piety flatters the sick with elegant language. Fruitless tears are offered to heaven. What does it profit to bewail another man’s shipwreck if you take no care of his body, which is suffering from exposure? What good does it do to torture your soul with grief over another’s wound if you refuse him a health-giving cup?
