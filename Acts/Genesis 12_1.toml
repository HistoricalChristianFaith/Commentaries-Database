Then said the high priest, Are these things so?  And he said, Men, brethren, and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Charran,  And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee. [Genesis 12:1] Then came he out of the land of the Chaldaeans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.  And he gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on: yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child.  And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and entreat them evil four hundred years.  And the nation to whom they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
