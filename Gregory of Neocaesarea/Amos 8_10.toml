Let us keep [the Feast of Annunciation] with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs. From ancient times Israel kept their festival, but then it was with unleavened bread and bitter herbs, of which the prophet says, “I will turn their feasts into afflictions and lamentation and their joy into shame.” But our afflictions our Lord has assured us he will turn into joy by the fruits of repentance.
