These things, moreover, as I judge, he gives forth only and truly by participation in the divine Spirit. There is need of the same power for those who prophesy and for those who hear the prophets. No one can rightly hear a prophet unless the same Spirit who prophesies bestows on him the capacity of grasping his words. And this principle is expressed indeed in the holy Scriptures themselves when it is said that only he who shuts opens, and no other one whatever; and what is shut is opened when that word of inspiration explains mysteries.
