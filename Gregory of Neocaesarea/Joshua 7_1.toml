Look, did not Achan the son of Zerah dishonestly steal from the devoted things, and wrath came upon the whole people of Israel? And he alone sinned, but he was not the only one to die in his sin. Now to us, in the present circumstance every asset which does not belong to us but to someone else should be regarded as “the devoted things.” For he, Achan, took as spoil, and these men now have taken “as spoil”; but he took what belonged to the enemy, while these now have taken what belonged to their brothers, making for themselves a deadly profit.
