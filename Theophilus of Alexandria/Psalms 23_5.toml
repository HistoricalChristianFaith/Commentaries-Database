I am the true vine, â€¦ intoxicating like the most powerful antidote, joy, against the grief that sprouted in Adam. Behold, I have prepared a table for you over against those who afflict you. Opposite Eden I settled Adam, who had violated that celebrated place, that by his seeing the delight no longer permitted he might suffer a ceaselessly smoldering distress. Again, over against those who afflict you have I given you a table, life-giving and joy-creating, which offers in exchange for distress unspeakable joy before those who have envied you. Eat the bread that renews your nature. Drink the wine, the exultation of immortality. Eat the bread that purges away the old bitterness, and drink the wine that eases the pain of the wound. This is the healing of your nature; this is the punishment of the one who did the injury.
