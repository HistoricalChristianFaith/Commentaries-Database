Theophilus, bishop, to the well-beloved and most loving brother, the presbyter Jerome. The reverend bishop Agatho with the well-beloved deacon Athanasius is accredited to you with tidings relating to the church. When you learn their import, I feel no doubt but that you will approve my resolution and will exult in the church’s victory. For we have cut down with the prophet’s sickle certain wicked fanatics who were eager to sow in the monasteries of Nitria the heresy of Origen. We have remembered the warning words of the apostle, “Rebuke with all authority.” Do you therefore on your part, as you hope to receive a share in this reward, make haste to bring back with scriptural discourses those who have been deceived. It is our desire, if possible, to guard in our days not only the Catholic faith and the rules of the church but also the people committed to our charge, and to eliminate all strange doctrines.
