What is more contrary to expectation than this, what more awe-inspiring? He who is clothed with light as with a garment is girded with a towel. He who held the waters in the clouds48 and sealed the abyss with his fearsome name is bound about by a belt. He who gathers the waters of the sea like a wineskin pours water in a bowl. He who covers his upper chambers with waters, with water washed the feet of the disciples. He who measured heaven with his hand’s span and holds the earth in his grasp, with his undefiled palms wiped off the feet of servants. He for whom “every knee bends, of those in heaven, and on earth and under the earth” bowed his neck to attendant servants. The angels saw and recoiled; heaven beheld and shuddered; creation observed and trembled.
