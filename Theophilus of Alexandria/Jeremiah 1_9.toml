The Lord has said to his prophet, “See, I have this day set you over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out and to pull down and to destroy and … to build and to plant.” In every age he bestows the same grace on his church, that his body may be preserved intact and that the poison of heretical opinions may nowhere prevail over it. And now also do we see the words fulfilled.
