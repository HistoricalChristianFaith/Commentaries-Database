And in the days of Joshua, son of Jehozadak, why did an angel say to the adversary who was opposing him, “The Lord rebuke you, O Satan”? And why are the Jews called “sons of Satan” for transgressing the laws, if he [the adversary] perseveres in the command he received and they transgressed the commandment? And why would he be called utterly a liar, he who remains faithful to the rule? Because that evil comes not from him but from the very one who made him so. And why should he be sent into the “outer darkness”?
