But because [God] knows that some humans act according to his will and some do not, for that very reason he proclaims the virtue of the one part in order to incite the others to a zeal for the good from the womb. In the same way too, concerning those others, he proclaims their worthlessness. It is not as if he creates one worthless from the womb, and another useful. And if such were the case, why would it be necessary to praise the worthy and to blame the worthless if he himself is the creator of worthiness and worthlessness? Thus one ought not to be held blameable for that worthlessness if he had created him so from the womb.And now it is clear that God’s saying before-hand, “Jacob I have loved and Esau have I hated” means that this one will become beloved by his conduct, and that one hateful.… As it also says elsewhere: “God made man upright, and they thought a thought of evil.”
