Make no mistake about it. If a person is not inside the sanctuary, he is deprived of the Bread [of God]. For if the prayer of one or two has great avail, how much more is that of the bishop and of the whole church. Anyone, therefore, who fails to assemble with the others has already shown his pride and set himself apart. For it is written, “God resists the proud.” Let us be careful, therefore, not to oppose the bishop, so that we may be obedient to God.
