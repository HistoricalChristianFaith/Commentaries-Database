Do not talk about Jesus Christ while you desire the world. Do not let envy dwell among you.â€¦ I take no pleasure in corruptible food or the pleasures of this life. I want the bread of God, which is the flesh of Christ who is of the seed of David; and for drink I want his blood, which is incorruptible love.
