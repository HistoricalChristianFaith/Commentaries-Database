Some indeed there are, who carry about the name [of Christ] in deceitfulness and wickedness, and do certain other things unworthy of God. These ye ought to avoid, as ye would wild beasts: for they are mad dogs, biting in secret. Ye ought to be on your guard against them, since they are hard to heal. There is one Healer, of flesh and spirit, begotten and not begotten, in the flesh made God, in death true life, both of Mary and of God, first passible then impassible: Jesus Christ our Lord.
