Pray without ceasing on behalf of other people. There is always hope for the repentance that they may attain before God. For “cannot he who falls arise again, and he who goes astray return?” Permit them, then, to be instructed by you. Be therefore the ministers of God and the mouth of Christ. For thus says the Lord, “If you take forth the precious from the vile, you shall be as my mouth.” Be humble in your earnest prayers. While they go astray, stand steadfast in the faith.
