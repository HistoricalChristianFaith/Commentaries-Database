As children of light and truth, flee from division and wicked doctrines. Where the shepherd is, there you follow as sheep. For there are many wolves that appear trustworthy, who, by means of a pernicious pleasure, carry captive those that are running toward God, but they shall have no place in your unity. So, as children of light and truth, avoid the dividing your unity and the wicked doctrine of the heretics, from whom “a defiling influence has gone forth into all the earth.”
