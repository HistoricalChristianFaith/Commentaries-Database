To those that do not believe, but to us salvation and life eternal. "Where is the wise man? where the disputer? ".

My spirit has become an offscouring of the cross, which is a stumbling block to those who are unbelievers, but to us it is salvation and life eternal. Where is the wise man? Where is the debater? Where is the boasting of those who are called prudent?
