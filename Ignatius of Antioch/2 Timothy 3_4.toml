These make merchandise of Christ, corrupting His word, and giving up Jesus to sale: they are corrupters of women, and covetous of other men's possessions, swallowing up wealth insatiably; from whom may ye be delivered by the mercy of God through our Lord Jesus Christ! ... who are "lovers of pleasure, and not lovers of God, having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof."
