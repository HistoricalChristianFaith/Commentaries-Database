From Syria even to Rome I fight with beasts: not that I am devoured by brute beasts, for these, as you know, by the will of God, spared Daniel, but by beasts in the shape of people, in whom the merciless wild beast himself lies hid and pricks and wounds me day by day. But none of these hardships “move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself,” in such a way as to love it better than the Lord. Wherefore I am prepared for [encountering] fire, wild beasts, the sword or the cross, so that only I may see Christ my Savior and God, who died for me. I therefore, a prisoner of Christ, who is driven along by land and sea, exhort you: “stand fast in the faith,” and be steadfast, “for the just shall live by faith”;25 be unwavering, for “the Lord causes those to dwell in a house that are of one and the same character.”
