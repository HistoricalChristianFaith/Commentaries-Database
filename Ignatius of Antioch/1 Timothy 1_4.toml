Where is the boasting of those who are styled prudent? For our God, Jesus Christ, was, according to the appointment.
Be not deceived with strange doctrines, "nor give heed to fables and endless genealogies"

You must not be panic-stricken by those who have an air of credibility but who teach heresy. Stand your ground like an anvil under the hammer. A great athlete must suffer blows to conquer. And especially for Godâ€™s sake must we put up with everything, so that God will put up with us. Show more enthusiasm than you do. Mark the times. Be on the alert for him who is above time, the Timeless, the Unseen, the One who became visible for our sakes, who was beyond touch and passion, yet who for our sakes became subject to suffering and endured everything for us.
