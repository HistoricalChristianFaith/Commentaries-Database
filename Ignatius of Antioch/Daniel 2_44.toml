He, being begotten by the Father before the beginning of time, was God the Word, the only-begotten Son, and remains the same forever; for “of his kingdom there shall be no end,” says Daniel the prophet. Let us all therefore love one another in harmony, and let no one look on his neighbor according to the flesh, but in Christ Jesus. Let nothing exist among you that may divide you; but be united with your bishop, being through him subject to God in Christ.
