How could such a one be a mere man, receiving the beginning of His existence from Mary, and not rather God the Word, and the only-begotten Son? For "in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.
The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made."
