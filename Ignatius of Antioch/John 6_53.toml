Come together in common one and all without exception in charity, in one faith and in one Jesus Christ, who is of the race of David according to the flesh, the Son of man and Son of God â€¦ and break one bread, which is the medicine of immortality and the antidote against death, enabling us to live forever in Jesus Christ.
