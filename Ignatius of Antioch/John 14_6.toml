Now the way is unerring, namely, Jesus Christ. For, says He, "I am the way and the life.".
And this way leads to the Father. For "no man "says He, "cometh to the Father but by Me.".
The Comforter is holy, and the Word is holy, the Son of the Father, by whom He made all things, and exercises a providence over them all. This is the Way
