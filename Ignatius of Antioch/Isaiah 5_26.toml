I give glory to Jesus Christ, the God who has imbued you with such wisdom. I am well aware that you have been made perfect in unwavering faith, like men nailed in body and spirit to the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, and confirmed in love by the blood of Christ. In regard to our Lord, you are thoroughly convinced that he was of the race of David according to the flesh, and the Son of God by his will and power; that he was truly born of the Virgin and baptized by John in order that all due observance might be fulfilled by him; that in his body he was truly nailed to the cross for our sake under Pontius Pilate and Herod the tetrarch (we are the most blessed fruit of his passion) so that, through his resurrection, he might raise for all ages in the one body of his church a standard for the saints and the faithful, whether among Jews or Gentiles.
