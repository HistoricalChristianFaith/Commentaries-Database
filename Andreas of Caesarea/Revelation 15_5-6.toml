The seer says that a “tent” was in heaven, and it was according to the likeness of this tent that God commanded Moses to build the tabernacle below. He says that from this temple angels proceeded out, dressed in “pure linen” or, as some copies have it, in a “pure stone.” Their dress indicates the purity of their natures and the proximity that they have to Christ, the Cornerstone, and the brightness of their virtue. The phrase “girded with golden girdles” refers to the power and the purity and the honor of their nature and to the freedom they have in their works of service.
