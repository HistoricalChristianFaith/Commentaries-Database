We think that the “sea of glass” signifies the multitude of those who are being saved, the purity of the coming reward and the brightness that the saints will radiate by the sparkling of their virtue. The fire that is mixed with it may be understood from what was written by the apostle, “Fire will test the work of each, whatever it is.” Although this fire does not harm the pure and the undefiled, it is divided without mixture into two energies, according to the word of the psalmist: 18 it burns the sinners, and, as the great Basil understood, it illumines the righteous. It is possible that the “fire” indicates both the divine knowledge and the grace of the life-giving Spirit. For God appeared to Moses in fire, and the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles in the form of tongues of fire. The “harps” suggest the dying of members and the harmonious life in the symphony of virtues, plucked with the plectrum of the divine Spirit.
