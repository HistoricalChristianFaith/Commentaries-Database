There are two deaths, the first that of the separation of the soul and body, and the second that of being sent to Gehenna. Concerning those who ally themselves with the antichrist, there is reason to think that they will suffer the first death, that of the flesh, by the sword of God, that is, by his command, and that then the second death will follow. However, should this not be the case, then they will share with those who deceived them the second death, that of eternal torment. The birds are gorged on their flesh. To this we might add, that just as God spoke to some through Isaiah, “You have become loathsome to me,” so every fleshly deed is tiresome, grievous and loathsome to the saints.
