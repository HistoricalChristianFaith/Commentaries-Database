The apostle insists that the one who spoke by the prophets was the Holy Spirit of Christ. Nor was Christ a mere man, as the heretics say, but he was the incarnate Son of God, consubstantial with the Father. “Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.” … For this reason the Savior said: “Many prophets and righteous men desired to see what you are seeing, and they did not see it.”
