[To witness by eye and ear] is characteristic of one who is an apostle. Just as he said in the Gospel, “He who has seen bears witness, and his testimony is true,” so also in this passage [John] confesses that he is an eyewitness and earwitness of what has been foretold and so makes himself to be a guarantee of what has been seen.
