By the “hour of trial” he speaks either of the persecution against the Christians which occurred almost immediately by those who ruled Rome at that time, from which he promised that the church would be freed, or he speaks of the universal coming of the antichrist against the faithful at the end of time. From this coming he pledges to free those who are zealous, for they will beforehand be seized upward by a departure from there, lest they be tempted beyond what they are able [to endure].
