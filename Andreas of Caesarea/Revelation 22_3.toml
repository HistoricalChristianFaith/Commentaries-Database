Anathema can be interpreted in a twofold manner. It either refers to that which is holy for many but is dedicated to God alone, or it refers to that which is sacred to the whole of creation and to the holy powers but is attributed to the devil because of his utter alienation and separation from that which is good. We think that here katathema is used in an emphatic sense. For such a thing is not dedicated to anyone, but it is “put aside” for the devil, being subordinated to him and condemned along with him. Such a thing will not exist within that city.
