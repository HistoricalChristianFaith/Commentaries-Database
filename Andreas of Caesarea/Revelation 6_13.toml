“The stars fell.” As has been already written of those deceived by Antiochus, this refers also to those who think themselves to be lights of the world but who will fall, being crushed by the events of that time, as the Lord said, “to lead astray, if it were possible, even the elect by the great tribulation.” This is perhaps the reason the fig tree is taken as a parable, for when the wind of the devil shakes it, it casts down its immature fruit that is not yet ripened by the heat of temptations or made sweet by grace. We know that this can be understood in either a good or in a bad sense, whether from the two baskets of good and evil figs that appear in Jeremiah or from the fig tree that Christ made to wither25 and that mentioned in the Song. But whether these things will occur in a visible manner when Christ comes in glory as judge, only he knows who has the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
