To the one who thirsts after righteousness he promises to grant the joy of the life-giving Spirit that he supplied in the Gospels to those who believed in him. It is “without payment” either because “the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to the saints,” or because it is not possessed except by the good works and the goodness of him who gives it.
