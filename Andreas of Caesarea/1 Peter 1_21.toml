Peter did not stop at Christ’s death but went on immediately to remember his resurrection as well. Just because you hear that the Father has raised the Son, do not retort that the Son cannot raise himself. For listen to what Christ says: “Destroy this temple and in three days I shall raise it up again” and again: “I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up again.” The apostle says these things in order to teach us that the Father and the Son hold everything in common.
