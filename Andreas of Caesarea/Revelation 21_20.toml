This stone, which has the color of a shining human fingernail, symbolizes the person of James. For before the others he received the bodily death of martyrdom for the sake of Christ, which the nail characterizes, for when cut it experiences no feelings.

Sardion has a shiny red color and possesses therapeutic power for swellings and wounds from iron. For this reason I believe that this stone represents the beauty of the virtue of Philip. For by the fire of the divine Spirit this makes bright and heals the spiritual wounds of those who are deceived, which they received from the attacks of the devil.

Chrysolite glitters like gold and perhaps symbolizes Bartholomew, for he was made glorious by his precious virtues and by his divine preaching.

This stone [beryl] has the color of the sea and of the air and is close to that of the hyacinth. Beryl very likely represents Thomas, for he was sent on journeys far beyond the sea, even to India, for their salvation.

By means of the topaz, which is deep red and like charcoal, and which, as they say, sends forth a milk-like juice that relieves the pain of those suffering from eye disease, it is possible that the soul of Matthew is indicated. For he was inflamed by divine zeal and was adorned by the pouring out of his own blood for the sake of Christ. Through the Gospel he also healed those who were blind in their hearts and gave milk to drink to those newly born in the faith.

Chrysoprase is deeper in color than gold itself, and through it I think that Thaddeus is indicated. For to Abgar, king of Edessa, he proclaimed the kingdom of Christ, which is signified by gold, and his death, which is indicated by ashes.

It seems likely that the hyacinth, which is deep blue, that is, like the sky, symbolizes Simon. For he was zealous for the gifts of Christ and possessed a heavenly wisdom.

It seems to me that through the amethyst, which is somewhat like fire in appearance, Matthias is indicated. He was accounted worthy of the divine fire at the distribution of the tongues and he filled the place of him who had fallen away, for by a fiery desire he wished to please him who elected him.
