I think that these “horses” are either men who, like beasts, lust after women, or they are those who are submitted to demons and are ruled by them. For those who sit upon others are those who also govern them. It is common for these to use not only each other as servants but also to use evil people as instruments for plotting against people of similar kind. We interpret “the breastplates of fire and of smoke and of sulfur” to signify the aerial nature of the evil demons and of their destructive work, and that the heads of lions show their murderous and beastly nature.
