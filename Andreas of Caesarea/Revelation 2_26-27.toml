“To him who does my works,” the Lord says, “I will give authority over five or ten cities,” as he said in the Gospel. Or, this passage refers to the judgment of the unfaithful, through which the deceived will be crushed, as though beaten with a rod of iron, and will be judged by those who have believed in Christ. “The men of Nineveh will rise and condemn this generation.” The words “as I myself received from the Father” refer to his human nature, which he assumed through the flesh.
