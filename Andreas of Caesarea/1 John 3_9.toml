The divine seed is Christ, who dwells in believers and makes them become sons of God. Likewise, when it is said that in Abrahamâ€™s seed all the nations will be blessed, this too is a reference to Christ. John says that the Spirit is the seed which we receive through the blessing of our mind. For he dwells in us, making the mind of sin no longer welcome.
