“From the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand.” Zebulun is interpreted “abode of power” or “fragrance,” through which are indicated those who by the indwelling of Christ have been made firm against sufferings and have become his sweet smell, as Paul says. “From the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand.” Joseph is interpreted “addition,” that is, those who in addition to the kingdom of heaven receive those things necessary for eternal life, as the Lord says. “From the tribe of Benjamin, twelve thousand.” Benjamin means “son of sorrow” or “son of day” or “son of my right hand” and refers to those with sorrow in their heart. This refers either to those believers from the Jews who fled the siege of the Romans and equaled this number, or, what is rather more likely, to those from the Jews who are saved at the consummation when, as the apostle puts it, after “the full number of the Gentiles come in, all Israel will be saved.” Either interpretation is acceptable. The exact equality of each tribe seems to me to show the utter fruitfulness of the apostolic seed, since twelve multiplied by twelve and multiplied by the perfect number of a thousand yields the thousands here indicated. For these were the disciples of that seed that out of love for humankind fell upon the earth and brought forth the various fruit of universal salvation.
