He speaks of “Babylon,” which refers to the confusion of the world and the troubled disorder of this life, which in no way has abated. By “the wine of the wrath of her fornication” he means not only the frenzy that attends to idol worship and the ecstasy of their minds, but also to the drunkenness and derangement that attends all sin, by which everyone who whores against God is wholly destroyed, as the saying of the psalm goes. As it were, pulled up by its roots, such a Babylon falls completely at the appearance of the Jerusalem that is above, for those who have been workers of iniquity are sent to the everlasting fire.
