It is likely that through the jasper, which has the color green like the emerald, the chief apostle Peter is indicated. For he bore the death of Christ in the body and in his love for [Christ] made known that which is everlasting and always new, guiding us to green pastures through the warmth of his faith.

The sapphire stone is like the heavenly body, from which also the color azure comes, and symbolizes the blessed Paul. For he was caught up into the third heaven and drew there those who were persuaded by him, and there in the heavens he has his citizenship.

This stone [chalcedony] was not borne on the breastplate of the high priest, but rather anthracite, which does not appear here. We are then of the opinion that at that time the saint called anthracite by another name. But anthracite indicates the blessed apostle Andrew, who like coal was ignited by the Spirit.

The emerald is green in color, and when rubbed with oil [it] receives a brilliant shine and beauty. We believe that this stone indicates the proclamation of the Evangelist John, which by divine oil makes bright the sorrow that has come to us through sins and by the most precious gift of theology grants to faith that which is everlasting.
