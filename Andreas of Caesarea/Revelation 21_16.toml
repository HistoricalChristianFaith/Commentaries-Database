The city is foursquare because of its stability and solidity. That which is of equal length in its depth and breadth and height is called by some a cube, and it suggests stability. The twelve thousand stadia that the city measures perhaps signify the size of the city, for, as David says, its inhabitants “shall be multiplied beyond the sand.” Or perhaps they are mentioned because of the number of the apostles through whom the city was established. The number seven, which is mystical, presents a solution through a certain line of reasoning. The thousands of stadia, which are mentioned, are equivalent to 1, miles, the thousand representing the perfection of eternal life, the seven hundred indicating the perfection of the rest, and the fourteen indicating the twofold sabbath of the soul and the body. For seven times two is fourteen.
