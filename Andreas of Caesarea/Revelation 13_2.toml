The kingdom of the Greeks is signified by the leopard; the Persians are signified by the bear; the Babylonians are signified by the lion. The antichrist, who will come as a king of the Romans, will rule over them and destroy their empires, when he beholds the clay toes of their feet, by which is indicated the destruction of a weak and brittle kingdom. Satan, that spiritual dragon, will give all of his authority to the antichrist, who through false signs and wonders will work for the ruination of those who are weak and unstable.
