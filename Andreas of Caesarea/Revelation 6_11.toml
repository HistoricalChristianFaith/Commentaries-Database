In this passage the saints are shown praying for the consummation of the world. Therefore, they are told to have patience until the completion of the brothers, so that “apart from them they would not be made perfect,” as the apostle says. The white robes reveal the brightness that appears on them because of their virtues, in which they are clothed, although they “had not yet received the promises.” And so, putting away every dullness, in the hope for these things, which they see in the spirit, they rightly rejoice, resting in the bosom of Abraham. For to many of the saints it is said that each receives a place worthy of the doer of virtue through which they are judged of their future glory.
