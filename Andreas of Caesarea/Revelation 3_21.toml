“The throne” indicates the kingdom and the rest of the coming age. Therefore he says that those who have conquered the enemy “will be glorified with me and will rule with me.” When he says, “as I myself have conquered,” he is speaking in a human manner on account of the assumption [of the flesh]. For God the Word did not acquire the kingdom as a prize for virtue, for he has this essentially as an eternal possession. For if this were not so, he would not be able to share it with others. But according to the Theologian and the “son of thunder,” he shared from his fullness with all the saints. For this reason also he promised to his holy apostles that they would sit upon twelve thrones and judge the future twelve tribes of Israel. For when he who is God and the eternal King became man for us, he shared everything which is ours, except only sin, and shared everything of his with those who had conquered the devil, as it was possible for human nature to receive. Therefore, having made a cloud the chariot of his ascension into heaven, he said through the apostle that the saints would be snatched up to meet him on the clouds. And when he, who is the Creator and Lord of creation, shall come as judge, he will allow the saints to judge those who had rebelled against the truly divine and blessed service.
