by a flame of fire
The fire is either a visible fire as happened to the two commanders of fifty men in the presence of Elijah (2 Kgs 1:9-11) or the coming of Christ in glory will destroy them by the breath of his mouth (Is 11:4), and the aforementioned nations, also devouring their general, the devil, and He (Christ) will deliver the devil to the lake of fire together with the Antichrist and the false prophet to be tortured forever and ever.
