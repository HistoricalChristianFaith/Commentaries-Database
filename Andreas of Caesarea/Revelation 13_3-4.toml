That he had a head that was wounded indicates that one of his lieutenants, having been put to death, deceptively seems to be raised again by him through his sorcery, in a way similar to Simon the magician, who, in light of his magic tricks, was unmasked by the chief of the apostles. Or the phrase could indicate that the Roman Empire, having suffered a kind of wound through division, seems to be healed by a unified rule, as occurred at the time of Augustus Caesar.â€¦ The wonder directed at the antichrist will be transferred to the devil, who is working through him. For through him the devil will be worshiped, and through him he will seem, to those blinded in the eyes of the mind, to raise the dead and perform signs.
