The curse against those who falsify the divine Scriptures is terrible, since the daring insolence of such self-willed persons can deprive them of the blessings of the coming age. In order that we might not suffer that lot, he testifies to us who listen neither to add nor to subtract anything. Rather, we should regard the characteristics of the Scriptures as more trustworthy and venerable than Attic compositions and dialectical arguments. For even among those should anyone find anything that is contrary to the rules, he is referred to the trustworthiness of their poets and authors. How great the difference is between those who have a great reputation among them and those who are of repute among us is impossible to conceive. I would judge that it is greater than the difference between light and darkness.
