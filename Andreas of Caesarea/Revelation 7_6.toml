“From the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand.” Asher is interpreted “blessing,” through which are revealed those who are worthy of dominical blessings because of their life and are made worthy of standing at the right hand of Christ43 and are shown to be sons of the light and of the day. “From the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand.” Naphtali is interpreted “prayer,” through which those are characterized who are bound to God through unceasing prayer. “From the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand.” Manasseh is interpreted “forgetfulness,” that is, it refers to those who on account of love for God, have forgotten the things from the past and the homes of their fathers.
