They will be led to the pure and clear fountains of divine thoughts, for the image of water already indicates the abundant stream of the divine Spirit. For concerning the one who believes in him in a pure way the Lord said, “Rivers of living water will flow from his belly.” From this fount the saints will at that time drink abundantly, and they will be in infinite joy and gladness, possessing perfect knowledge after being rid of partial knowledge, and having become rid of the change which comes with corruption.
