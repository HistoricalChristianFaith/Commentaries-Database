It is possible that these things will happen at that time in a physical way. But we think that the “earthquake” symbolizes the transposition of those things that are shaking and tottering to something more firm and secure. That a “tenth of the city” falls refers to the corpse of impiety, which was not wise in the seizing of those prophets. The “seven thousand” who are killed signify those who remained attached to the seven days of the present life but did not wait for the eighth day of the resurrection and who must also be killed with “the second death” in Gehenna, namely, eternal punishment. Or, perhaps the seven thousand will be those Jews who were persuaded by the antichrist.
