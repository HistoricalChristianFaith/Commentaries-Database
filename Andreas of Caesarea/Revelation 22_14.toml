Those [who keep the commandments] are truly worthy of blessedness. For in life eternal they shall possess authority to find rest in the tree of life, namely, Christ our God, and to delight in the vision of him without any evil power becoming a hindrance [to that bliss]. And they shall enter into that city above by the apostolic gates, that is, by the apostlesâ€™ teachings, through the true door. Nor shall they, as though shepherds for hire, sneak in by some other way, but they will be guided in by the gatekeeper of life.
