The “beast” is the antichrist. He is the “eighth” because he arises after the seven kingdoms for the deception and devastation of the earth. He is “from the seven” because he arises from one of these. For he will not come forth from a nation other than those mentioned before, but as a king of the Romans for the defeat and destruction of those who believed in him. And after this he will go into the destruction of Gehenna.
