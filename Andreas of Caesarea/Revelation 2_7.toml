Every person has a physical ear, but only the spiritual person has a spiritual ear, such as was granted to Isaiah. And to such as conquer in the struggle against the demons, he promised to give “to eat from the tree of life,” that is, to grant them to share in the blessings of the future age, for eternal life is figuratively depicted through the tree. And Christ is said to be both, as is clear from what Solomon says and what our apostle writes in another passage. For, concerning wisdom, Solomon says, “She is the tree of life,” while John writes about Christ,“This is God and eternal life.” If, therefore, we are allowed to attain to these things, let us accomplish the victory over our sufferings. For, most certainly proper recompense will follow our trials, by the grace and beneficence of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father together with the Holy Spirit for ever and ever. Amen.
