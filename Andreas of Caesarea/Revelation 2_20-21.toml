Although on account of [your] faithfulness and your service for those in need I acknowledge your piety and your endurance, nonetheless I rightly blame you, because you allow the heresy of the Nicolaitans to exist openly. This heresy is figuratively called “Jezebel” because of its impiety and licentiousness. Because of this [heresy] my servants, through their simplicity of mind, are presented with a stone of stumbling and are drawn toward idolatrous practices from which they had [previously] fled. You must curb this [heresy], because it deceitfully calls herself a prophetess, being moved by an evil spirit.
