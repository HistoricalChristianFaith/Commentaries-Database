To the more simple, the Lord says, “Since on account of your simplicity you are not able to withstand those who are evil and have a facility with words,” namely, that you do not know “the deep things of Satan,” as you call it, I will not expect from you any war through words, but only that you preserve the teaching which you received until I remove you from there.
