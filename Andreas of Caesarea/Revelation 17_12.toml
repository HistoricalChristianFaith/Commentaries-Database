Daniel also saw these ten horns that precede the antichrist. After rooting out three of them, the accursed one will subdue the others. The “one hour” indicates either the brevity of time or the one hour of the year, or by way of figure of speech, clearly meaning a three-month period, after which they will submit themselves to the antichrist as to their leader.
