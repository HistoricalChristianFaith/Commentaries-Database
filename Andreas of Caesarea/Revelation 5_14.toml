Through these, one flock and one church from angels and from men is indicated which has been formed through Christ, the God who united that which was separate and has destroyed the partition wall of separation. And so, as we have heard, with the four living creatures who surpass the other angelic ranks, also the [elders], who represent the fullness of those who are being saved, are worthy of the hymn and worship of God. Of which may also we be found worthy in Christ himself, the Giver of peace and our God, with whom together with the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory and might forever and ever. Amen.
