That heaven is rolled out as a scroll symbolizes either that the second coming of Christ is unknown … or that even the heavenly powers grieve for those who have fallen from faith as though they experience a certain rolling out through sympathy and grief. However, this image symbolizes also that the substance of heaven does not disappear, but as though by a kind of unrolling changes into something better. As Irenaeus says, “For neither is the substance nor the essence of the creation annihilated—for faithful and true is he who has established it—but ‘the fashion of this world passes away,’ within which the transgression occurred, as the elders say.” … We think that the apostle is using the image of an old custom. For the Hebrews used scrolls rather than codices, which are common among us. To unroll a scroll did not cause anything to disappear but affected the appearance of that written within. So also the opening of the heavenly body shows the revelation of the blessing that lies in wait for the saints.

Our Lord asked the disciples concerning the destruction of the temple and the consummation of the world, and as they were able to receive, he foretold of the coming events. To some extent these events have already happened to the Jews who killed Christ during the siege under Vespasian and Titus, as the Jew Josephus recounts it. But at the end, with a superabundance beyond everything, so to speak, these things will come upon the world at the coming of the antichrist. At that time, the great men, whether those who hold office in the church or those who possess worldly power—here figuratively called “mountains”—and the churches of the faithful—metaphorically called “islands”—which are being renewed to God, as Isaiah said, they will flee from their places, changing from place to place on account of the false christ.
