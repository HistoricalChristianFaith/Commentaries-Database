It is often customary for the prophets to speak divine words as though it were from their own person. The words “I am coming soon” indicate either the shortness of the present time in comparison with the future age or the sudden swiftness of the death of each person. For the departure from here is the end of every person. Therefore, since “we do not know at what hour the thief will come,” we are commanded “to watch and to gird ourselves and to keep our lamps burning,” letting our godly behavior shine even for our neighbor. Therefore, let us not cease to beseech God with a contrite heart to “save us from all our pursuers,” lest our souls, having been defeated by them, be snatched away unprepared “with no one to rescue or to save.” [Let us also pray God] lest any soul, bound by the chains of earthly affairs and not able to free itself from them, should vainly turn again to them and then, when constrained to leave them by the authority of the angels and the command of God, will lament in vain for the lost opportunities of a life now passed. Rather, singing without ceasing the song of David, “I prepared myself and was not fearful to keep your commandments,” let us receive as a reward for keeping [his commandments] the praise of God, who will say, “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much; enter into the joy of your master.” Together with him glory, honor and power are fittingly given to the Father and also to the Holy Spirit now and always and forever and ever. Amen.
