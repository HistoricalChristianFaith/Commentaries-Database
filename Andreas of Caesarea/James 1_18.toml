The birth here applies in the first instance to the Son and then by extension to the creatures. For to him belong truth and consubstantiality with God, whereas to the creatures belong honor and inheritance. The fact that the same name is used does not mean that the same honor is given, nor should things which are said by extension be taken to mean that they apply in the first instance as well. By “first fruits” James means that we are the first and most highly honored. For by “creatures” he means the visible creation, of which humanity is the most highly honored part.
