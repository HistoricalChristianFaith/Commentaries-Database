For what need of a physical temple is there for one who will have God as protection and shelter, in whom we live and move and have our being? For he himself is both temple and in-dweller of the saints, dwelling in them and walking among them, as he promised. The “Lamb” is the Lamb of God who was slain for us, to whom manifestly the co-essential and life-giving Spirit is conjoined, who is mentioned a little later through [the image] of the river.
