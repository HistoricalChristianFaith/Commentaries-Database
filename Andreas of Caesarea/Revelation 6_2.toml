We understand the loosing of the first seal to signify the generation of the apostles. For, as though it were a bow, they stretch forth the gospel message against the demons and led to Christ those wounded by the arrows of salvation. And because they conquered the leader of deceit through the truth, they received a crown, and in hope they await a second victory, namely, the confession of the name of the Master unto a violent death. Therefore, it is written, “he went out conquering and to conquer.” For, the first victory is the conversion of the nations; the second is the willing departure from the body in persecution for the sake of that conversion.
