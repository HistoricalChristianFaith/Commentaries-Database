an angel. An angel administers such a sentence,it says, in order to show that the devil is both weaker than th√®se ministering powers in terms of power and that from the beginning in vain he boldly ruled over all.

Here he narrates the destruction of the devil which had taken place during the Master's passion, in which he who appeared to be strong, having bound us as his spoils, one stronger than he, Christ our God, redeemed us from his hands, condemning him to the abyss. This is shown by the demons calling upon him not to be cast into the abyss.(lk 8:31) chain. He (John) called the restraint of his evil activity chain for our clarification.

This passage expresses the destruction of the devil that occurred through the passion of our Lord. For through his passion the one who is stronger than [the devil], namely, Christ our God, bound him who seemed to be strong and freed us, who were his spoils, from his hands and condemned him by throwing him into the pit. This is shown by those demons who pleaded that he not send them into the pit. The demonstration that the devil is bound is the disappearance of idol worship, the destruction of pagan temples, the abandonment of the defilement of altars and the knowledge of the will of God throughout the world.
