Blessed are those who through temporary sufferings receive the fruit of eternal rest, and by suffering with Christ also reign with him and serve him continuously. In this passage, the words “day and night” indicate the absence of cessation or end, for then there will be no night. Rather, there will be one day which is illumined by the Sun of righteousness, not by the sun that we see with our eyes. In like manner, night refers to the hidden and deep mysteries of knowledge, while day refers to the mysteries that are open and easily obtained. “His temple” is the entire creation, which is being renewed through the Spirit, but especially those who have preserved the living and unquenchable gift of the Spirit, for among them he has promised to dwell and to walk.
