We think that this passage presents a transition from the times of the persecutions to the time before the arrival of the false Christ. For it has been prophesied that at that time there would be such tribulations, such as we know have never happened before. Indeed, throughout the Scriptures “earthquake” often signifies the change of things. The phrase “once again I will shake” signifies “the removal of what is shaken,” as the apostle says. And in the Old Testament it is said concerning the crossing of the Israelites from Egypt, “the earth quaked, the heavens poured.” The blackness of the sun and the dark, bloody appearance of the moon signify the darkness that will come upon those overtaken by the wrath of God, as Cyril often remarked.
