Some have interpreted this beast to be a certain power, a leader of the other demons, who is second to Satan, and that after this beast the antichrist arises from the earth. However, according to holy Methodius and holy Hippolytus and others this beast is to be interpreted as the antichrist who comes from the tumultuous and rough sea of this life. The ten horns with the diadems and the seven heads signify the unity that the devil has with him—for these characteristics were interpreted above as also belonging to him. The ten horns and seven heads also signify the division of the earthly government at the end of time into ten, and the earthly government corresponds to this world, which is calculated as consisting of seven days and is divided into seven successive kingdoms. For this reason, Satan, who operates in him, is called “the ruler of this age.” “A blasphemous name is upon its heads” clearly refers to his supporters. For from the beginning these never ceased from blaspheming Christ until the accession of Constantine. But after him, [the emperors] Julian and Valens again slandered against Christ.
