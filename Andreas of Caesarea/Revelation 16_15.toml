“To be awake and to keep one’s garments” means to remain vigilant and always concerned with good works. For [good works] are the garments of the saints, and were one to be without these, one would necessarily be made ashamed as one naked and full of shamefulness.… We are taught in this passage that it is a terrible thing to be naked of the garments of virtue, and … we have learned from the Gospel parable that he who is without this is thrown out of the bridal chamber. And … we have learned from the apostolic saying that speaks of incorruptibility, “that putting this on, we shall not be found naked,” that is clearly of good works. [Therefore] let us earnestly beseech the Lord that he wash the robes of our souls, so that, as the word of the psalm says, “they may be made whiter than snow,” lest we hear, “Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?” and “having our hands and feet bound, be cast into outer darkness.” Rather, as the wise Solomon says, let us “always have our garments white” and wear [robes] bright and white from a virtuous life, decorated with sympathy. And so [let us] enter into the bridal chamber with the pure and blameless Bridegroom of holy souls, Christ our God, with whom glory, might and honor is due to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, now and always, and forever and ever. Amen.
