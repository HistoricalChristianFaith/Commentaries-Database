This river waters the saints who are planted alongside it. They are here figuratively called the “tree of life” by virtue of their participation and imitation of him who is the Tree of Life. Moreover, they give forth “twelve fruits,” that is, they unceasingly yield the production of fruit. For there will be there no winter of sin that causes the trees of life to shed their leaves, such as we see now. Rather, the time of the production of fruit by the saints will be complete and uninterrupted, and [this time] is here said to be twelve months. It speaks in these terms equally because of the customary year among us, as well as because of the proclamation of the twelve apostles. This present passage may also be interpreted in another way. “The river” might signify the gifts of the life-giving Spirit, which flow down from the throne of the Father and of the Son, that is, from the ranks of the cherubim, among whom God is enthroned. [This river flows] into the streets of the city, that is, to the full citizenry of the saints, as coming from the first ranks into the second that are made to share in the well-ordered arrangement of the heavenly hierarchy. The “tree of life” signifies Christ, whom we know by the Holy Spirit and through the Spirit. For in him is the Spirit, and he is worshiped in Spirit, and he is the supplier of the Spirit, and through him the twelve fruits of the apostolic chorus give to us the inexhaustible fruit of the knowledge of God, through whom “the acceptable year of the Lord and the day of recompense” foretold by the prophet is proclaimed to us.

The “leaves of the tree,” namely, of Christ, are the more exalted understandings of the divine judgments, even as its “fruits” are the more perfect knowledge that is to be revealed in the age to come. The leaves will be for healing, that is, for the cleansing of the ignorance of those who have been deficient in the exercise of the virtues, for “there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars.” Moreover, “in my Father’s house there are many rooms,” so that one is accounted worthy of less and another of more brightness according to the measure of the works of each. This present passage may also be interpreted otherwise. The “tree of life” produces twelve fruits, namely, the apostolic chorus that shares in him who is truly the Tree of Life, who through his participation in the flesh has given us to share in his deity. Their fruits are those who yield fruit a hundredfold. The leaves are those who yield sixtyfold. These carry to those who come later the illumination of the divine light that they had received from those who had yielded a hundredfold, and they bring healing to those from the nations who yield thirtyfold. For at that time there will be a difference between those who are saved as great as there is a difference between fruit and leaves. Some will be glorified to a lesser extent, some to a greater extent, as it is written. It writes of a “tree” in the singular rather than “trees” in the plural to indicate the unity and harmony of the life which the saints have together.
