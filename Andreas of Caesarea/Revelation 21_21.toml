The twelve gates are manifestly the twelve disciples of Christ, through whom we have come to know the door and the way. And they are also the twelve pearls that have received their splendor from the one, most precious pearl, namely, Christ.

It is not possible to present in one image an exact description of the good things of the heavenly city. Therefore, he perceived the street of the city as gold on account of its costliness and its beautiful color, and as crystal, that is, as transparent glass on account of its purity. We are not able to bring both of these things together in one symbol. But the saint perceived all of these things as he was able. However, an unsullied understanding of the city above surpasses our hearing and sight and mind.
