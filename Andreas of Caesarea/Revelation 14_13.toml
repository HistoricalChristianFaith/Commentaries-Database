The voice from heaven does not bless all the dead, but only those who die in the Lord, who have died to the world and so carry about the dying of Jesus in the body and suffer with Christ. For these persons the departure from the body is truly a rest from their labor. Moreover, the obedience of their works is the reason for their unfading crowns and the rewards of glory that are the prizes given in great measure to those who prevail in the contests that the contestants of Christ, our God, endure to the end against invisible powers. “For the sufferings of the present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed” to those who please God, as the apostle says. It is necessary also that we who yearn for such glory should pray unceasingly to God, saying, “Incline our hearts, O Lord, to your testimonies, and turn our eyes from every vanity,” and “enter not into judgment with your servants, for no living creature will be righteous before you.” Rather, visit us with your bountiful mercies, for the might and the kingdom and the power and the glory are yours, namely, of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, now and forever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.
