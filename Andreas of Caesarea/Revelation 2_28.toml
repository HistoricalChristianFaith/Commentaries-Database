By morning star he means either that one of whom Isaiah spoke: “How have you fallen from heaven, O Day Star, O Morning Star?” and of whom it is promised that he will be “crushed under the feet of the saints,” or the Lord means that one of whom the blessed Peter speaks, of the “morning star who rises in the hearts of the faithful,” clearly meaning the illumination of Christ. Both John the Baptist and Elijah the Tishbite were called light bringers. For the one foretold of the first rising of the “sun of righteousness,” and the other is known as the forerunner of the second [rising]. And after these, we believe that those who have conquered the devil will receive their inheritance. Nor is it surprising that we should interpret this in so opposite a fashion. For we learn from the Holy Scriptures that the “lion” from Judah is Christ, while the “lion” from Bashan is the antichrist, the same image signifying both. And so is noted the rising of the coming day, in which the darkness of the present life will be hidden, and the angel proclaims this. For this precedes the “sun of righteousness” which will shine upon the saints and dispel the gloom of the present life, by whose rays may also we be made bright, by the good pleasure of the Father with the all-holy Spirit, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
