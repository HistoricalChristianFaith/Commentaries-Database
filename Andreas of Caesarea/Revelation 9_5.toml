That these spiritual locusts sting people after the manner of scorpions shows the baneful death of the soul that lies hidden at the end of evil deeds. Those are subjected to [such a death] who have not signed their forehead with the divine seal and with the enlightenment of the lifegiving cross through the Holy Spirit, so that, as the Lord says, “they may let their light shine before men for the glory of the divine name.” We think that the five months of their torment signifies either the shortness of time—“For had those days not been shortened, no flesh would have been saved,” as the Lord says—or a certain five-day period representing the five senses through which sin enters into people, or a determined period that is known to God alone.
