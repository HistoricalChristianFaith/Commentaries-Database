Also I who am speaking these things say to you, who are Life, “I am coming.” And you yourself also come, O Lord. Or perhaps he is saying this in the person of Christ, “I who witness to these things,” clearly the one who is testifying, “I am coming.” Then what follows is said in the person of the apostle, “Come, Lord Jesus Christ.” For the coming of Christ is much desired by the saints, since he will recompense those who have labored with a manifold reward. Therefore, this present book is holy and inspired by God and leads those who read it to their blessed end and inheritance.
