Although these, together with the kings and rulers who trusted them, arrayed themselves against Christ the Savior, both the antichrist and the false prophet, who by signs and wonders made the rogue acceptable, are bested and overcome by the divine wrath.… Perhaps these will not die that death that is common to all, but in the twinkling of an eye will be made immortal by being condemned to the second death of the lake of fire, just as the apostle spoke of others who “will not sleep but will be changed, in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye.” These [mentioned by Paul] will rightly go to judgment. But the two mentioned in this passage, being wicked and against God, will not go to judgment but to condemnation. And although some do not hold this opinion, we base ourselves on the saying of the apostle that the antichrist will be destroyed by the spirit of the command of God40 and on one of our teachers who said that some will be found living after the destruction of the antichrist. We affirm that those living are those blessed by Daniel, but that after the destruction of their power these two will be handed over with their incorruptible bodies to the fire of Gehenna. This will be their death and destruction by the divine command of Christ.
