Here we think that “heaven” signifies the air, and that the “red dragon” is that creature that was deceived and mocked by the angels of God, as it is written in Job. He is “red” either because of his murderous and bloodthirsty character or because of the fiery nature of his angelic essence, since he did fall from the angels. The seven heads that he has are seven powers more wicked than himself and that are opposed to the [seven] powers of the Spirit. Or perhaps they correspond to the seven spirits of whom Christ spoke in the Gospels and that established themselves in the man who had a heart swept clean and emptied of good thoughts and deeds. Or perhaps they are the seven evils that Solomon says are in the heart of the evil one, who with a great voice deceitfully seeks followers for himself. The horns signify either those sins that are in opposition to the Ten Commandments of the law, or they signify the divisions of the kingdom that bring credit to him who rejoices in seditions. And there are “seven diadems upon his heads,” since those who conquer the demonical powers receive again the crowns of victory, since they have gained victory with toils and sweat.
