The twelve “foundations” were twelve precious stones, eight of which were worn in ancient times on the breastplate of the high priest, and four have been added to show the agreement of the new [covenant] with the old [covenant] and the superiority of the things brought to light in it. And so, the apostles are decorated with every virtue, which is made clear through the precious stones.
