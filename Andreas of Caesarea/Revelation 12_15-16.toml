When the church fled to inaccessible places where the deceiver makes his approach, out of his mouth, that is, clearly by his command, came water like a river after her. That is, he sent out against her a host of godless people and evil demons and all kinds of temptations that he might enslave her. But the earth, it says, came to [the church’s] aid. This may refer to the very great distances of travel in the desert and the aridity and dryness of those places, and in this way the river of temptations were swallowed up. Or [the demons and their temptations were overcome] by the humility of the saints who say with utter sincerity, “I am earth and dust” and so bring to naught all the snares of the devil, even as the angel said to the holy Anthony.
