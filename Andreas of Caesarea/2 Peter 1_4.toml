God has blessed us abundantly—that is the meaning of this passage. We have received thousands of good things as a result of Christ’s coming, and through them we can become partakers of the divine nature and be turned toward life and godliness. Therefore we must behave in such a way as to add virtue to faith, and in virtue walk along the way which leads to godliness until we come to the perfection of all good things, which is love.
