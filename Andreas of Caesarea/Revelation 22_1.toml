The river that flows from the church in the present life indicates the baptism of regeneration that is made effective through the Spirit and makes those who are washed more clean than snow and crystal. But the river of God, filled up with waters, namely, the Holy Spirit, flows through the Jerusalem above, flowing from God the Father through the Son. And [this river flows] in the midst of the most excellent powers, which are named here the “throne of God,” making full the streets of the holy city, that is, the multitude of its inhabitants who are, according to the psalmist, “more in number than the sand.”
