These words are “trustworthy and true” because they come from the Truth.… Since Christ is “the God of the prophets, who sent his angel” by means of the blessed John who saw this vision, “to show his servants what is to take place,” it is clear that he gave the Revelation for the sake of the flesh according to the condescension of the economy of the Son, as it said at the beginning. For he who is the God of the prophets and who sent his angels as ministering spirits for the revelation of coming things would not be ignorant of the hour or the day of the consummation, so that he who has all “the hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge” would learn [these things] only now from the Father.
