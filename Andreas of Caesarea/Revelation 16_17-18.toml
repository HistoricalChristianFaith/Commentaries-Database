The angelic voice from heaven said, “It is done!” That is, the commandment of God has been accomplished. The flashes of lightning and the voices and the thunders are symbolic of the terrifying nature of these occurrences and of the future coming of Christ, just as long ago they announced the descent of God upon Mount Sinai. The earthquake signifies the transformation of that which exists, as the apostle explained: “Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.”
