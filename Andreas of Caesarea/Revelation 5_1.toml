We recognize the book to be the most wise memory of God in which, according to David, all people are recorded, as well as the depths of the divine judgments. Those things written on the outside through the letter are more easily comprehended. Those things written on the inside through the Spirit are more difficult to decipher. The “seven seals” signify either the obscurity of the book which is known to no one or the economies of him “who searches the depths of the Spirit of God.” No created being is able to open these seals. The “book” also is understood to be the prophecy that Christ himself said to be fulfilled in the Gospel, but the rest of [the prophecy] will be fulfilled in the last days.
