Peter said this because there were some subversive people who were saying that Christ had come to overthrow the state, teaching us that we should despise every earthly power. But when they see us submitting to them because it is Godâ€™s will, then they are silenced, because they realize that they were wrongly trying to tear the kingdom of Christ in two.
