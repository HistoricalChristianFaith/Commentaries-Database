Even at the end of his letter, John never stops insisting on the need for right doctrine. We have been given understanding to the extent that we have known the Son of God, who really has come into the world. This is what it means to say that “we have the mind of Christ.” The person who has this mind and understanding knows what is really true and is united with him because he shares the same mind.
