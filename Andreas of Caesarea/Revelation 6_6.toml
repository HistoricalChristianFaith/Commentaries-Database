The phrase “a quart of wheat for a denarius” figuratively indicates those who have struggled lawfully and have carefully preserved the divine image given to them. The phrase “three quarts of barley for a denarius” speaks of those who like cattle have through cowardice bowed the neck to persecutors but have later repented and have washed their defiled image with tears. The command “do not harm wine and oil” indicates that the healing of Christ through repentance, which healed him who fell among the thieves, ought not be rejected, nor that those be allowed to be seized prematurely by death who through patience would be retrieved from defeat. Therefore, that we also might possess God as our beneficent physician for the suffering of our souls, let us be zealous to be such to our brothers who have fallen, bringing to them the wine of consolation mixed with the oil of compassion, “so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed,” as the apostle says. And so becoming fellow workers with God, we may eternally enjoy his blessings by the grace and good will of our Lord, Jesus Christ.
