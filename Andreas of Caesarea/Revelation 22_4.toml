Those who become the throne of God because of the rest of the Lord among them will be the inhabitants of that city. They will see him no longer in shadows but face to face, even as the holy apostles saw him on the holy mount, as the great Dionysius says. And instead of the golden breastplate worn in ancient times by the high priest, they will have the divine name imprinted not only on their foreheads but also within their hearts, and this shows their firm, bold and immoveable love toward him. For the writing upon the forehead symbolizes the ornamentation of boldness.
