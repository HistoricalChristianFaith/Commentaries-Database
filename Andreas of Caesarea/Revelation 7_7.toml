“From the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand.” Simeon is interpreted “obedience,” clearly referring to those who are becoming righteous through obedience to the divine commandments. “From the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand.” Levi is interpreted “having been taken up,” through which are indicated those taken up by Christ through a life proper to the priesthood. Levi is listed eighth, since by the eighth day of the resurrection the true priesthood is made known. “From the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand.” Issachar is interpreted “reward,” that is, it refers to those who for the sake of the rewards from God have lived virtuously.
