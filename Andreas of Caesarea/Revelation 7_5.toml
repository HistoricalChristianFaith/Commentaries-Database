“From the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed.” Judah is interpreted “confession,” through which those are manifested who are being saved through the confession to Christ who came forth as a branch from Judah. “From the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand sealed.” Reuben is interpreted “son of vision,” through which those are shown who possess spiritual sight through purity of heart. “From the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand.” Gad is interpreted “temptation,” through which those are shown who through the endurance of temptations are being crowned, after the example of Job.
