[[commentary]]
quote='''
With zeal immense, Josiah,
Himself a prince, acted in such a way
As no one before or after him had ever done!â€”Idols he
Dethroned; destroyed unhallowed temples; burned
With fire priests on their altars; all the bones
Of false prophets were dug up; the altars burned,
The carcasses to be consumed did serve
For fuel!
