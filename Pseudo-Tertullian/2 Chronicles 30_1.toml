As corrector of an inert People
That emulator [of David] Hezekiah arose;
He restored the Law to a sinful, forgetful people
All God’s mandates of old, he first
Commanded the people to observe,
Who ended war by his prayers,
Not by steel’s point: he, dying, had a grant
Of years and times of life made to his tears:
Deservedly such honor his career obtained.
