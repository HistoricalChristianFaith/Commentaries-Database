For they who have esteemed domestic affection of relations higher than God, are unworthy to inherit good things to come.
Or; “They that are Christ’s have crucified the body with its vices and lusts.” And he is unworthy of Christ who does not take up His cross, in which we suffer with Him, die with Him, are buried and rise again with Him, and follow his Lord, purposing to live in newness of spirit in this sacrament of the faith.
Thus the gain of life brings death, the loss of life brings salvation; for bythe sacrifice of this short life we gain the reward of immortality.

Here the stated doctrine and its meaning run along the same course. After he commands us to abandon everything that is most valuable in earthly life, he adds, “He who does not take up his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.” This is because those who belong to Christ have crucified their bodies with their sinful practices and pleasures. We are unworthy of Christ if we do not take up our own cross, by which we suffer, die and are buried and resurrected together with him. Only by this pledge of faith in the Spirit will he triumph in new life in us.“He who finds his life will lose it, and he who loses his life for my sake will find it.” This obviously means that through the power of the Word and separation from our old vices, we will receive spiritual profit in death and a fine exacted against our life. Therefore we must accept death in the reformation of our life. We are to fashion our vicious selves on the model of our Lord’s cross, and we are to cling to an open profession of glory, even against persecutors and with disregard of things present.
