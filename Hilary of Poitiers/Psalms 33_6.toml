Is the preparation of the heavens a matter of time for God, so that a sudden movement of thought crept into his understanding, as if it had been previously inactive and dull, and in a human way he searched for material and instruments for the building of the world? The prophet, however, has a different explanation for the operations of God. The heavens were in need of a command from God in order to be established, for their splendor and power in this stability of their unshakable nature did not arise from the proper blending and mixture of any material but by the breath of the divine mouth.
