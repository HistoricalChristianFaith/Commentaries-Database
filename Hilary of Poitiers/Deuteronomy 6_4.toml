Let us see whether the confession of the apostle Thomas agrees with this teaching of the Evangelist, when he says, “My Lord and my God.” He is therefore his God whom he acknowledges as God. And certainly he was aware that the Lord had said, “Hear, O Israel, the Lord your God is one.” And how did the faith of the apostle become unmindful of the principal commandment, so that he confessed Christ as God, since we are to live in the confession of the one God? The apostle, who perceived the faith of the entire mystery through the power of the resurrection, after he had often heard “I and the Father are one” and “All things that the Father has are mine” and “I in the Father and the Father in me,” now confessed the name of the nature without endangering the faith.
