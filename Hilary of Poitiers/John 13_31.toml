That God is glorified in Him, refers to the glory of the body, which glory is the glory of God, in that the body borrows its glory from its association with the Divine nature because God is glorified in Him, therefore He will; glorify Him in Himself, in that He who reigns in the glory arising from the glory of God, He forthwith passes over into God’s glory, leaving the dispensation of His manhood wholly to abide in God. Nor is He silent as to the time And shall straightway glorify Him. This referring to the glory of His resurrection which was immediately to follow His passion, which He mentions as present, because Judas had now gone out to betray Him; whereas that God would glorify Him in Himself, He reserves for the future. The glory of God was strewn in Him by the miracle of the resurrection; but He will abide in the glory of God when He has left the dispensation of subjection. The sense of these first words, Now is the Son of man glorified, is not doubtful: itis the glory of the flesh which is meant, not that of the Word But what means the next, And God is glorified in Him? The Son of man is not another Person from the Son of God for, the Word was made flesh (John 1:14). How is God glorified in this Son of man, who is the Sonof God? The next clause helps us; If God is glorified in Him, God also will glorify Him in Himself. A man is not glorified in himself, nor, on the other hand, does God who is glorified in man, because He receives glory, cease to be God. So the words, God is glorified in Him, either mean that Christ is glorified in the flesh, or that God is glorified in Christ. If God means Christ, it is Christ who is glorified in the flesh; if the Father, then it is the Sacrament of unity, the Father glorified in the Son. Again, God glorifies in Himself God glorified in the Son of man. This overthrows the impious doctrine that Christ is not very God, in verity of nature. For how can that which God glorifies in Himself be out of Himself? He whom the Father glorifies must be confessed to be in His glory, and He who is glorified in the glory of the Father, must be understood to be in the same case with the Father.

In the words “Now is the Son of man honored, and God is honored in him,” we have first the glory of the Son of man, then the glory of God in the Son of man. So there is first signified the glory of the body, which it borrows from its association with the divine nature. And then follows the promotion to a fuller glory derived from an addition to the glory of the body.… Already before this [the Son] was reigning in the glory that springs from the divine glory. From this time forward, however, [the Son] is himself to pass into the divine glory … leaving behind the dispensation by which he is man so that his whole being may be eternally transformed into divinity. The time when this will happen is not hidden from us either.… At the moment when Judas arose to betray him, he signified as present the glory that he would obtain after his passion through the resurrection, but he assigned to the future the glory with which God would glorify him with himself. The glory of God is seen in him in the power of the resurrection. But he himself, after his state of humiliation, will be taken eternally into the glory of God, that is, into God, the all in all.
