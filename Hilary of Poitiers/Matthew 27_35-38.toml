That they distributed his clothes by casting lots for them rather than by cutting them up signifies the eternal incorruptibility of Christ’s body. The life and salvation of all things was hung from the tree of life with a thief on his left and a thief on his right. This demonstrates that the entire human race is called to the mystery of the Lord’s suffering.
