The Prophet recites five kinds of caution as continually present in the mind of the happy man: the first, not to walk in the counsel of the ungodly, the second, not to stand in the way of sinners, the third, not to sit in the seat of pestilence, next, to set his will in the Law of the Lord, and lastly, to meditate therein by day and by night. There must, therefore, be a distinction between the ungodly and the sinner, between the sinner and the pestilent; chiefly because here the ungodly has a counsel, the sinner a way, the pestilent a seat, and again, because the question is of walking, not standing, in the counsel of the ungodly; of standing, not walking, in the way of the sinner. Now if we would understand the reason of these facts, we must note the precise difference between the sinner and the undutiful , that so it may become clear why to the sinner is assigned a way, and to the undutiful a counsel; next, why the question is of standing in the way, and of walking in the counsel, whereas men are accustomed to connect standing with a counsel, and walking with a way.

Not every man that is a sinner is also undutiful: but the undutiful man cannot fail to be a sinner. Let us take an instance from general experience. Sons, though they be drunken and profligate and spendthrift, can yet love their fathers; and with all these vices, and, therefore, not free from guilt, may yet be free from undutifulness. But the undutiful, though they may be models of continence and frugality, are, by the mere fact of despising the parent, worse transgressors than if they were guilty of every sin that lies outside the category of undutifulness.

The one who is here extolled as happy by the prophet is the person who strives to conform himself to that body that the Lord assumed and in which he was born as human, by zeal for justice and perfect fulfillment of all righteousness.

The ungodly are those who despise searching for the knowledge of God, who in their irreverent mind take for granted that there is no Creator of the world, who assert that it arrived at the order and beauty that we see by chance, who in order to deprive their Creator of all power to pass judgment on a life lived rightly or in sin will have it that a person comes into being and passes out of it again by the simple operation of a law of nature. Thus all the counsel of these people is wavering, unsteady and vague and wanders about in the same familiar paths and over the same familiar ground, never finding a resting place, for it fails to reach any definite decision. They have never in their system risen to the doctrine of a Creator of the world, whether the world is for humanity or humanity for the world; the reason for death, its extent and nature. They press in ceaseless motion round the circle of this godless argument and find no rest in these imaginings. There are, besides, other counsels of the ungodly, that is, of those who have fallen into heresy.… Their reasoning ever takes the course of a vicious circle; without grasp or foothold to stay them, they tread their interminable round of endless indecision. Their ungodliness consists in measuring God not by his own revelation but by a standard of their choosing; they forget that it is as godless to make a god as to deny him; if you ask them what effect these opinions have on their faith and hope, they are perplexed and confused, they wander from the point and willfully avoid the real issue of the debate. Happy is the one, then, who has not walked in this kind of counsel of the ungodly, who has not even entertained the wish to walk in it, for it is a sin even to think for a moment of things that are ungodly.

[The psalm here speaks of] those who abide in the church but do not obey its laws; such are the greedy, the drunken, the brawlers, the wanton, the proud, the hypocrites, liars, plunderers. No doubt we are urged toward these sins by the promptings of our natural instincts, but it is good for us to withdraw from the path into which we are being hurried and not to stand in it, seeing that we are offered so easy a way of escape. It is for this reason that the one who has not stood in the way of sinners is happy, for while nature carries him into that way, religious belief draws him back.

Many, even God-fearing people, are led astray by the canvassing for worldly honors and desire to administer the law of the courts, though they are bound by those of the church. But although they bring to the discharge of their duties a religious intention, as is shown by their merciful and upright demeanor, still they cannot escape a certain contagious infection arising from the business in which their life is spent. For the conduct of civil cases does not suffer them to be true to the holy principles of the church’s law, even though they wish it. And without abandoning their pious purpose they are compelled, against their will, by the necessary conditions of the seat they are prone to use, at one time invective, at another, insult, at another, punishment; and their very position makes them authors as well as victims of the necessity that constrains them, their system being as it were impregnated with the infection. Hence, this title, “the seat of pestilence,” by which the prophet describes their seat, because by its infection it poisons the very will of the religiously minded.
