The Son of God here was not condemning the devout confidence of those who combine their confession that he is true God, the Son of God, with their own claim to be God’s children. What he is condemning here is the rash presumption of the Jews in claiming God for their Father when they did not love the Son: “If God were your Father, you would surely love me; for I proceeded from God.” … His proceeding is obviously different from his coming, for the two are mentioned side by side in this passage: “For I proceeded and came from God.” In order to elucidate the difference between “I proceeded from God” and “I came,” he further explains, “I did not come on my own, but he sent me.” These words tell us that he is not the source of his own existence. They also tell us that he has proceeded forth a second time from God [in the incarnation] when he was sent by him. But when our Lord says that those who called God their Father ought to love him because he has proceeded from God, there he means that his being born of God was the reason why he should be loved. This proceeding carries back our thoughts to the incorporeal birth, for their claim that God was their Father was supposed to be evident in their loving Christ who was begotten from God. For when the Son says, “Whoever hates me hates my Father as well,” this my is an assertion of his relationship to the Father that no one else has.… No one can worship the Father except those who love the Son. For the one and only reason that he gives for loving the Son is his origin from the Father, not by his advent [i.e. his incarnation] but by his birth [i.e., his eternal generation]. And love for the Father is only possible for those who believe that the Son is from him.
