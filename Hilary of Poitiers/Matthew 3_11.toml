The work of the law is now ineffectual for salvation. John appeared as a messenger of repentance to those about to be baptized. It was the task of the prophets to call people away from their sins, but it was proper to Christ to save those who believe. Thus John said that he was baptizing them for repentance. He also said that a mightier one would come whose sandals he was not worthy to untie. And he left to the apostles the glory of spreading God’s word. It would be their duty to go about with their trusty feet and proclaim God’s peace. He therefore points ahead to the time of our salvation and judgment in the Lord, saying, “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.”
