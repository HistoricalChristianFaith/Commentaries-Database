If sacred truth, when challenged by blasphemy, is met by silence, even that silence may be falsely construed as consent. This is what has happened in the case of the Arian assertion that because God is one, therefore his Son is not God.… The same one who authorizes us to confess the Son of God as God justifies us in proclaiming the one God.
