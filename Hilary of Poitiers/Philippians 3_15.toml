If we, because of the tendency to err that lies within the human condition, take the meaning of anything for granted, we are not to refuse increase of understanding through grace.… For the apostle has already explained the thought of those whose thought is perfect. As to those who think otherwise concerning God’s revelation, he hopes that their thoughts will be brought to perfection.
