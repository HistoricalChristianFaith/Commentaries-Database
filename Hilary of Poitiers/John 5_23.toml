It is only things of the same nature that are equal in honor. Equality of honor denotes that there is no separation between the honored. But the demand for equality of honor is combined with the revelation of Christ’s birth. Since the Son is to be honored as the Father, and since they do not seek the Son’s honor, even though he is the only God, he is not excluded from the honor of the only God. For his honor is one and the same as that of God.… He who does not seek the honor of the only God does not seek the honor of Christ also. Accordingly the honor of Christ is inseparable from the honor of God.
