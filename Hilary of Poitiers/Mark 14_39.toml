Is the cause of this sadness and this prayer any longer doubtful? He bids them to watch and pray with him for this purpose, that they may not enter into temptation; “for the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” If they had remained firm under the promise to faithful souls, they would not have violated their trust. Yet through the weakness of the flesh, they did fall away. It is not, therefore, for himself that the Lord is sorrowing and prays. It is for those whom he exhorts to watchfulness and prayer, lest the cup of suffering should be their lot, lest that cup which he prays may pass away from him should rest with them.
