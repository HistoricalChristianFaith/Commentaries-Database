The rich person does not easily attain riches of the soul, that is, the virtues of this world. He who says, “It is more difficult for a rich person to enter the kingdom of heaven” is clearly saying that it is easier for a poor person to do so. So that the poor person does not imagine that he has been excluded from God’s care because of his poverty, the prophet testifies, saying, “I created the poor and the rich, and I care for all alike.” “God does not make distinctions between persons.” And it does not say that he cares only for the rich with respect to worldly goods but for everyone. He cares for the poor as well, and he will reward anyone who has been humble in riches or patient in poverty.
