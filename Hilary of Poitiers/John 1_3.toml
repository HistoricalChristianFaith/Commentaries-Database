(ii. de Trin. c. 17) Or thus: [It is said], the Word indeed was in the beginning, but it may be that He was not before the beginning. But what saith he; All things were made by him. He is infinite by Whom every thing, which is, was made: and since all things were made by Him, time is likewisec.

(lib. ii. de Trin. c. 18) Or thus; That all things were made by him, is pronouncing too much, it may be said. There is an Unbegotten Who is made of none, and there is the Son Himself begotten from Him Who is Unbegotten. The Evangelist however again implies the Author, when he speaks of Him as Associated; saying, without Him was not any thing made. This, that nothing was made without Him, I understand to mean the Son's not being alone, for 'by whom' is one thing, 'not without whom' another.

“All things were made through him” needs qualification. There is the Unbegotten who no one made; there is also the Son, begotten of the unborn Father. “All things” is an unguarded statement, admitting no exceptions. While we are silent, not daring to answer or trying to think of some reply, you [John] break in with, “And without him was nothing made.” You have restored the author of the Godhead to his place while proclaiming that he has a companion. From your saying that nothing was made “without him,” I learn that he was not alone. He through whom the work was done is one; he without whom it was not done is another: a distinction is drawn between Creator and Companion.Reverence for the one unbegotten Creator distressed me, lest in your sweeping assertion that all things were made by the Word you had included him. You have banished my fears by your “without him was nothing made.” Yet this same “without him was nothing made” brings its own trouble and distraction. There was, then, something made by that other; not made, it is true, “without him.” If the other did make anything, even if the Word were present at the making, then it is untrue that “through him all things were made.” It is one thing to be the Creator’s Companion, quite another to be the Creator’s self. I could find answers of my own to the previous objections; in this case, fisherman, I can only turn at once to your words, “All things were made through him.” And now I understand, for the apostle has enlightened me with these words: “Things visible and things invisible, whether thrones or dominions or principalities or powers, all are “through” him and “in him.”
