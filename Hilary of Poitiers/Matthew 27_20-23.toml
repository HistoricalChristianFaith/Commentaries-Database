When Pilate offered to release Jesus, following the customary practice wherein the people were granted the privilege of gaining the freedom of one prisoner per solemn feast day, they were persuaded by their priests to choose Barabbas instead. Here already the mystery of their future infidelity is contained in Barabbas’s very name, which means “son of the father.” They preferred this “son of the father” to Christ. At the instigation of their leaders, they chose the Antichrist, a man of sin and son of the devil. They chose the one elected for damnation over the author of life. ON MATTHEW 33.2.WHAT SHALL I DO WITH JESUS? CHRYSOSTOM Since the crowd asked for the other, Pilate said, “What shall I do then with the Christ?” In this way he was trying to make them embarrassed, by giving them the power to choose, that at least out of shame they might release him and their generosity could be expressed. It made them contentious to hear it said that he had done no wrong. Yet they were being given an opportunity to save him out of humanity. Surely this is an offer whose plausibility cannot be disputed.
