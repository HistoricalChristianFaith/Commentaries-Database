The Lord, knowing the suggestion of the craft of the devil, says to Peter, “Getthee behind me;” that is, that he should follow the example of His passion; butto him by whom this expression was suggested, He turns and says, “Satan, thouart an offence unto me.” For we cannot suppose that the name of Satan, and thesin of being an offence, would be imputed to Peter after those so great declarations of blessedness and power that had been granted him.
