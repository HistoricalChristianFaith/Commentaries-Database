“He who receives a prophet because he is a prophet shall receive a prophet’s reward.” He who receives a prophet receives him who dwells in the prophet, and he becomes worthy of a prophet’s reward by receiving the prophet because he is a prophet. And a like reward is allotted for receiving a righteous person. One who does this becomes righteous by honoring righteousness. In this way righteousness is attained through faith, taking on mercy as its duty. This happens when someone receives a righteous person and becomes a prophet himself by reason of his own reverence. He will receive the honor due to a righteous person and a prophet.
