“I have hidden your words in my heart, so as not to sin against you.” Recall that something similar is often read, where it says, “It is good to hide the mystery of the king.” Recall that Paul also hid some divine words from the Corinthians, who were still young in the faith, saying, “I have given you milk to drink, not solid food. In fact, you were not yet ready, and neither are you now.” We also read in the Gospel of the treasure found in a fertile, fruitful field and that was hidden in the field once it was purchased. We know also that pearls should not be thrown before swine, and what is sacred should not be given to dogs. We thus understand that some things are enclosed in the secret of our hearts. If they were to be divulged, it would imply the guilt of an unpardonable sin. - "Homilies on the Psalms 118. Beth.6"
