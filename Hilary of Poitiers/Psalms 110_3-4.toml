Meanwhile, I ask each one’s opinion about the interpretation of “from him.” Are we to understand these words in the sense of coming from another person, or from no one else, or are we to believe that he himself was the one to whom he was referring? They are not from another person, because they are “from him,” that is, in the sense that God does not come from anywhere else except than from God. They are not from nothing, because they come “from him,” for a nature is revealed from which the birth is derived. He himself is not meant, because “from him” refers to the birth of the Son from the Father. Moreover, when it is pointed out that he is “from the womb,” I ask whether it is possible to believe that he was born from nothing, since the true nature of the birth is revealed by applying the terminology of bodily functions? God was not composed of bodily members when he spoke of the generation of the Son in these words: “From the womb before the day star I begot you.” He spoke in order to enlighten our understanding while he confirmed that ineffable birth of the only-begotten Son from himself with the true nature of the godhead, in order that he might impart to the faculties of our human nature the knowledge of the faith concerning his divine attributes in a manner adapted to our human nature, in order that he might teach us by the expression “from the womb” that the existence of his Only-Begotten was not a creation from nothing but a natural birth from himself. Finally, has he left us in any doubt whatsoever that his words “I came forth from the Father and have come” are to be understood in the sense that he is God, that his being does not come from anywhere else except from the Father? When he came forth from the Father, he did not have a different nature or no nature, but he bears testimony to the fact that he is his author from whom, as he says, he has gone forth.
