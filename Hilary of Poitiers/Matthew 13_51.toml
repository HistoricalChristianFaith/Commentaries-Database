He spoke not to the crowds but to the disciples, and he gave fitting witness to those who understood the parables. He compared them with a householder, for they understood the teaching of his storeroom of things new and old. He referred to them as scribes because of their knowledge, for they understood the new and old thingsâ€”that is, in the Gospels and in the law. He brought forth both of these on behalf of the same householder and from the same storeroom.
