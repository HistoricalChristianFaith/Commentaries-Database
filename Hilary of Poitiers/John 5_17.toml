He refers to the charge of violating the sabbath, brought against him. My Father works up to this time, and I work. He means that he had a precedent for claiming the right he did, and that what he did was in reality his Father’s doing who acted in the Son. And to quiet the jealousy that had been raised, because by the use of his Father’s name he had made himself equal with God, and to assert the excellence of his birth and nature, he says, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but what he sees the Father do.”

Their anger was so kindled against him that they wanted to kill him, because he did his works on the sabbath. But let us see also what the Lord answered: “My Father is still working, and I also am working.” … He speaks that we may recognize in him the power of the Father’s nature employing the nature that has that power to work on the sabbath. The Father works in him while he works. Without doubt, then, Jesus works along with the working of the Father.… We must regard Jesus as referring to that very work of the Father’s which he was then doing since it implies the working of the Father at the very time of his words.… If the Father works and the Son works, no union exists between them that merges them into a single person.
