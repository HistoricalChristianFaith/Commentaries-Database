Since, according to the Gospel, the Lord is the bridegroom and, according to John, he has a bride, must we think in terms of earthly, bodily spouses? Certainly not. But by this use of language we are taught that he is the one who has been promised to the nations. By the Father’s work, the inheritance of the church has been espoused to him, through the assumption of the body that he took from the Virgin. But, to learn what we should understand by the designation “bride,” we must examine closely what is said elsewhere regarding the term. For example, Solomon says, “I sought to take wisdom as my bride.” And because he seeks a bride, he wants her to be rich, and he recounts the benefits of his bride, saying, “She manifests her nobility in a life of communion with God, because the Lord of the universe loved her.” And “if one desires wide experience, she knows what is past and infers what is to come.” And further, “A strong woman, who can find? Her value is far beyond precious stones.” All of this was said in Proverbs, because a proverb does not explain what the words say but displays the power of what is said using ordinary words. In the Gospels, the Lord teaches how a proverb must be understood when he says, “The hour will come when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but I will speak openly to you of the Father.” Therefore, according to the rules governing proverbs, we must recognize that the strong woman is she whom Solomon desired to take as his bride. Of her he says further, “I therefore decided to take her as the companion of my life. I am enamored of her beauty.”
