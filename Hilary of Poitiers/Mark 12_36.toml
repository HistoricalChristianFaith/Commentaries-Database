The scribe, therefore, is not far from the kingdom of God when he acknowledges the one God who is to be loved above all things. But he is admonished by his own confession in that he does not fully grasp the mystery of the law as being fulfilled in Christ.… The scribe only recognized him according to the flesh and the birth from Mary, who was descended from David, rather than as David’s Lord.
