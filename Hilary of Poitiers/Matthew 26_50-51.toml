As to what he tells Judas, “Do what you have to do,” he authorizes his own betrayal by that very statement. For he who had it within his power to call upon twelve thousand legions of angels against his betrayers would have found it so much easier to oppose the plans and artifices of one man. At length he says to Pilate, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you.” He thus gives power against himself when he says, “Do what you have to do.” In other words, because the crime of what is willed is counterbalanced by what is perpetuated, Judas would accomplish in deed what he had already done in his will.

The apostle cuts off the ear of the slave of the high priest; that is, a disciple of Christ cuts off a disobedient ear from a man in the priesthood. What was once incapable of hearing the truth is now cut off.
