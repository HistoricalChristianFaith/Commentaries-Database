[Christ] offered himself to the death of the accursed that he might break the curse of the Law, offering himself voluntarily a victim to God the Father, in order that by means of a voluntary victim the curse that attended the discontinuance of the regular victim might be removed. Now of this sacrifice mention is made in another passage of the psalms: “Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body have you prepared for me”; that is, by offering to God the Father, who refused the legal sacrifices, the acceptable offering of the body that he received. Of this offering the holy apostle thus speaks: “For this he did once for all when he offered himself up,” securing complete salvation for the human race by the offering of this holy, perfect victim.
