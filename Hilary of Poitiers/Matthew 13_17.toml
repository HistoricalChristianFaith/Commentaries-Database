He teaches the blessedness of the apostolic times to those whose eyes and ears are fortunate to look upon and hear the salvation of God. These are the prophets and the righteous who have longed to see and hear the fulfillment of the expected times. They share in the joy of that expectation reserved for the apostles.

Or, He is speaking of the blessedness of the Apostolic times, to whose eyes andears it was permitted to see and to hear the salvation of God, many Prophets and just men having desired to see and to hear that which was destined to be in the fulness of times; whence it follows; “Verily I say unto you, that many Prophets and just men have desired to see the things that ye see, and to hearthe things that ye hear, and have not heard them.”
