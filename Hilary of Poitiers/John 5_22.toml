The statement that all judgment is given to the Son teaches both his birth and his Sonship. Only a nature that is altogether one with the Father’s could possess all things. And a Son can possess nothing except as a gift. But all judgment has been given to him since he gives life to whomever he will. Now we cannot suppose that judgment is taken away from the Father, although he does not exercise it. For the Son’s whole power of judgment proceeds from the Father’s since it is a gift from him.
