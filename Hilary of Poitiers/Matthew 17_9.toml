This is the Son, this the Beloved, this the Accepted; and He it is who is to beheard, as the voice out of the cloud signifies, saying, “Hear ye Him.” For He isa fit teacher of doing the things He has done, who has given the weight of His own example to the loss of the world, the joy of the cross, the death of the body, and after that the “glory” of the heavenly kingdom.
He enjoins silence respecting what they had seen, for this reason, that when they should be filled with the Holy Spirit, they should then become witnesses of these spiritual deeds.
