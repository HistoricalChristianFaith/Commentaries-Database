He rises in haste to perform the sacrament of His final passion in the flesh (such is His desire to fulfill His Fatherâ€™s commandment) and therefore takes occasion to unfold the mystery of His assumption of His flesh, whereby He supports us, as the vine does its branches: I am the true vine.

The useless and deceitful branches He cuts down for burning.
