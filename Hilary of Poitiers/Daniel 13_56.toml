Salvation was awaited by and offered to Israel but not to the carnal Israel. “In fact, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise who are considered his offspring.” As John also attests, the children of Abraham are not the children according to the flesh, since they are also children of vipers, and God can raise up children of Abraham from rocks. The Lord taught that the right of succession is constituted by works of faith and that we must not think of the birth of children according to carnal generation, when he says, “If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works that Abraham did.” And Daniel also, condemning the old men, does not say, “offspring of Abraham,” but, “offspring of Canaan and not of Judah.” Ezekiel also, confronting the people with their iniquities, says, “Your father was a Canaanite, your mother a Hittite. Your origin and your birth are of the land of Canaan.” We are not dealing, therefore, with this Israel that comes from carnal succession and to which is attributed the birth of a generation that is wholly profane because of its unbelief. It is not to this Israel, therefore, that salvation is given, because they did not accept it when it was offered, but to that other who, their slavery ended, has become the people of God.
