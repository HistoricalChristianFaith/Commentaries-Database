Because He had spoken all the aforesaid things in the power of His Father's majesty, therefore the Evangelist proceeds to tell what answer He made to one that told Him that His mother and His brethren waited for Him without; “While he yet spake unto the people, his mother and brethren stood without desiring tosee him. "Mark also follows up that which He had said concerning blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, by saying, “And there came his mother and his brethren.” Luke has not observed the order of action here, but has placed this earlier as he happened to recollect it.
And He cannot be held to have thought meanly of His mother, seeing that in His passion He evinced the most extreme carefulness for her.
Although they had like the rest power to come in, yet they abstain from all approach to Him, “for he came unto his own, and his own received him not.”
