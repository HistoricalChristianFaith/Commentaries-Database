But it may be argued that the apostle was not inspired by the Spirit of prophecy when he borrowed these prophetic words; that he was only interpreting at random the words of another man, and though, no doubt, everything the apostle says of himself comes to him by revelation from Christ, yet his knowledge of the words of Isaiah is only derived from the book.… Isaiah says that he has seen no God besides him. For he did actually see the glory of God, the mystery of whose taking flesh from the Virgin he foretold. And if you, in your heresy, do not know that it was God the Only Begotten whom the prophet saw in that glory, listen to the Evangelist: “Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and spoke of him.” The apostle, the Evangelist, the prophet combine to silence your objections. Isaiah did see God; even though it is written, “No one has seen God at any time, except for the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father; he has declared him.” It was God whom the prophet saw. He gazed on the divine glory, and people were filled with envy at such honor graciously granted to his prophetic greatness. For this was the reason why the Jews passed sentence of death on him.
