To Pilate’s question as to whether he was king of the Jews, he answered, “It is as you say.” How different was the statement he had made to the priest! When the latter asked him whether he was the Christ, he said, “You have said it yourself.” This answer is given to the priest as though pertaining to the past, for in many places the law had foretold the coming of the Christ.
