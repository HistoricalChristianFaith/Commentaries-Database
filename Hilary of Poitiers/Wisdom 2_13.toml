We see that all the powerful manifestations of God’s judgments ring out through the words of the prophets, which, it seems to me, are here called cascades. “Deep calls unto deep, in the roar of the cascades.” After the preaching of the prophets came the judgments of God, as though echoing back to the voice that had predicted their coming. The voice of one cascade was, “Let us plot against the righteous one, because he is an embarrassment to us and opposes himself to our actions, calling himself a child of the Lord.” Another sound of the cascade is, “He was like a lamb led to the slaughter, as a sheep mute before his shearers, and he did not open his mouth.” There is another voice, also: “They have pierced my hands and my feet, I can count all of my bones.” Then the voice, “They divide my garments among them, for my clothing they cast lots, and when I was thirsty they gave me vinegar to drink.” And what need is there now to recall all the voices of the cascades, since the prophetic books are full of the insults directed at the Lord and of his passion?
