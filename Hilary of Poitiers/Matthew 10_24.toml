For the Lord, the Light eternal, the Captain of the faithful, the Parent of immortality, set before His disciples this solace of the sufferings that should come upon them, that we should embrace it as our glory when we are made like toour Lord in suffering; whence He says, “The disciple is not above his master, nor the slave above his lord.”
