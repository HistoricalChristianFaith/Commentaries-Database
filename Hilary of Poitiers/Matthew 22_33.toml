It had been enough to have cut off this opinion of the Sadducees of sensual enjoyment, that where the function ceased, the empty pleasure of the body accompanying it ceased also; but He adds, “But are as the Angels of God in heaven.”.
The same cavil that the Sadducees here offer respecting marriage is renewed by many who ask in what form the female sex shall rise again. But what the authority of Scripture leads us to think concerning the Angels, so must we suppose that it will be with women in the resurrection of our species.
It should be further considered, that this was said to Moses at a time when those holy Patriarchs had gone to their rest. They therefore of whom He was the God were in being; for they could have had nothing, if they had not been inbeing; for in the nature of things that, of which somewhat else is, must have itself a being; so they who have a God must themselves be alive, since God is eternal, and it is not possible that which is dead should have that which is eternal. How then shall it be affirmed that those do not, and shall no thereafter, exist, of whom Eternity itself has said that He is? For they who in comparison of other men are most perfect before God, have God entirely in them, wherefore He is not said tobe their God in common, but of each in particular. As when we say, That farm is theirs, we show that each of them does not own the whole of it; but when we say, That farm is his, we mean that he is owner of the whole of it. When then it is said, “The God of the Hebrews,” this shows their imperfection, that each of them has some small portion in God. But it is said, “The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob,” because each one of these possessed God entirely. And it is to the no small honour of the Patriarchs that they lived to God.
