For a Jew was not worthy to bear Christ's cross, but it was reserved for the faith of the Gentiles both to take the cross, and to suffer with Him.

Such is the place of the cross, set up in the centre of the earth, that it might be equally free to all nations to attain the knowledge of God.

Or, He therefore refused the wine mingled with gall, because the bitterness of sin is not mingled with the incorruption of eternal glory.
