Listen now to Jeremiah: “This is our God, and there shall be no one else like him who has found out all the way of knowledge and has given it to Jacob his servant and to Israel his beloved. Afterward he showed himself on earth and dwelled among people.” For previously he had said, “And he is human, and who shall know him?” Thus you have God seen on earth and dwelling among people. Now I ask you what sense you would assign to “no one has seen God at any time, except the only-begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father,” when Jeremiah proclaims God seen on earth and dwelling among people? The Father most assuredly cannot be seen except by the Son. Who then is this who was seen and lived among us? He must be our God, for he is God visible in human form, whom human beings can handle.
