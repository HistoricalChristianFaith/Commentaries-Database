He calls to Him those that were labouring under the hardships of the Law, and those who are burdened with the sins of this world.
He holds forth the inducements of a pleasant yoke, and a light burden, that to the m that believe He may afford the knowledge of that good which He aloneknoweth in the Father.
And what is more pleasant than that yoke, what lighter than that burden? To bemade better, to abstain from wickedness, to choose the good, and refuse the evil, to love all men, to hate none, to gain eternal things, not to be taken with things present, to be unwilling to do that to another which yourself wouldbe pained to suffer.
