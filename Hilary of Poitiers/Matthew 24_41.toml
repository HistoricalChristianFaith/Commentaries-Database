And has indeed God the Father denied the knowledge of that day to the Son, when He has declared, “All things are committed to me of my Father?” but if any thing has been denied, all things are not committed to Him.
The “two in one bed” are those who preach alike the Lord’s rest after His passion, about which heretics and catholics have the same confession; but because the Catholic Faith preaches the unity of the Godhead of the Father and the Son, and the false creed of the heretics impugns that, therefore shall the Divine judgment decide between the confession of these two by taking one and leaving the other.
