The Lord has declared: “If I do not perform the works of my Father do not believe me.” Hence, he teaches that the Father is seen in him because he performs his works so that the power of the nature that was perceived would reveal the nature of the power that was perceived, wherefore the apostle, indicating that this is the image of God, says: “Who is the image of the invisible God … that through him he should reconcile all things to himself.” Accordingly, he is the image of God by the power of these works.
