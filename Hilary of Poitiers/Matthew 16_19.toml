By asking, “Whom do men say that the Son of Man is?” He implied that something ought to be thought respecting Him beyond what appeared, for He was the Son of Man. And in thus enquiring after men’s opinion respecting Himself, we are notto think that He made confession of Himself; for that which He asked for was something concealed, to which the faith of believers ought to extend itself.
This is the true and unalterable faith, that from God came forth God the Son, who has eternity out of the eternity of the Father. That this God took unto Hima body and was made man is a perfect confession. Thus He embraced all in that He here expresses both His nature and His name, in which is the sum of virtues.
This confession of Peter met a worthy reward, for that he had seen the Son of Godin the man. Whence it follows, “Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed artthou, Simon Bar-jonas, for flesh and blood has not revealed this unto thee, but my Father who is in heaven. "Others take it in the simple sense, that Peter is the son of John affirming that it is an error of the copyists in writing here Barjonas for Barjoannas, dropping one syllable. Now Joanna is interpreted ‘The grace of God.’ But either name has its mystical interpretation; the dove signifies the Holy Spirit; and the grace of God signifies the spiritual gift.
Otherwise; He is blessed, because to have looked and to have seen beyond human sight is matter of praise, not beholding that which is of flesh and blood, but seeing the Son of God by the revelation of the heavenly Father; and he was held worthy to be the first to acknowledge the divinity which was in Christ.
But in this bestowing of a new name is a happy foundation of the Church, and arock worthy of that building, which should break up the laws of hell, burst the gates of Tartarus, and all the shackles of death. And to show the firmness of this Church thus built upon a rock, He adds, “And the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”
