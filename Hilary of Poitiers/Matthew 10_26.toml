This refers to the day of judgment, which will make known the hidden conscience of our will and reveal to public knowledge those things that now seem obscure. Jesus is admonishing us, therefore, that we are not to fear our persecutorsâ€™ threats or stratagems or power, because the day of judgment will reveal that these all were nothing and empty.
