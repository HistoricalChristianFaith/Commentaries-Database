The Jew says, “You being a man”; you [Arians] say, “You being a creature.” You both join in the cry, “You make yourself God,” with the same insolence of blasphemy. You deny that he is God begotten of God; you deny that he is the Son by a true birth; you deny that his words “I and the Father are one” contain the assertion of one and the same nature in both. You foist upon us instead a modern, strange, alien god. You make him God of another kind from the Father, or else not God at all, as not subsisting by a birth from God.… You say, in effect, “You are not a Son by birth; you are not God in truth; you are a creature excelling all other creatures.”
