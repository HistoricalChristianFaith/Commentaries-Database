This entire saying of the Lord refers to the Jews and the heretics: “Brother will deliver up brother to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents.” The family in a single house will disagree among themselves. This means that whereas the people were formerly united (for the “people” is meant under the names of parents and relatives), we will now be exposed to vicious hatred. We will be offered up to earthly judges and kings, who attempt to secure either our silence or our cooperation. For we are to bear testimony to these people and to the Gentiles, and after that testimony has been borne, our persecutors will be deprived of the excuse that they are ignorant of divine things. When Christ has been prophesied by the words of the martyrs amid the tortures of savage persecutors, the way will be open for the Gentiles to believe in him, though they remain stubborn.
