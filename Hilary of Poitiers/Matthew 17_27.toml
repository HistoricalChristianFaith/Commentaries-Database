The Lord is called upon to pay the didrachma, (that is, two denarii,) for thisthe Law had enjoined upon all Israel for the redemption of their body and soul, and the use of those that served in the temple.
When Peter is instructed to take the first fish, it is shown therein that he shall catch more than one. The blessed first martyr Stephen was the first that came up, having in his mouth a stater, which contained the didrachma of the new preaching, divided as two denarii, for he preached as he beheld in his passion the glory of God, and Christ the Lord.
