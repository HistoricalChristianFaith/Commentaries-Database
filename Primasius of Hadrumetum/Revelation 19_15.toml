The sharp sword symbolizes either the two Testaments or what we read concerning wisdom, “She carries law and kindness on her tongue,” namely, judgment and mercy. On the other hand, the rod of iron symbolizes the unbending standard of justice.… As the action of threshing separates the wheat from the chaff so that it is stored in the barn, so also the weight of the pressure of the winepress purifies the wine as it is separated from the grape skins or the oil from the dregs. The prophet referred to this when he said, “He dug out a wine vat in her.” This occurs in the church when persecution arises or some other kind of calamity happens. Then, some like dregs will run down by an irremediable fall, while others will shine more brightly by their faith which now is tested.
