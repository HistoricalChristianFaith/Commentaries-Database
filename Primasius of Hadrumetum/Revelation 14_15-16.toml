From the explanation of the Lord, we know that the angels will be the reapers and that the end of the world is signified by the appearance of a ripe harvest. Moreover, it is known that after the harvesting of the crop there is chaff in the straw and fragile ears, while the wheat is in the grains. And so, we see with greater clarity in this passage that when it says that the sickle must be used on the ripe crop, the fate merited by the good and by the evil are symbolized. And to whom more appropriately than to the church is this said?… At the time of the last judgment, when she has concluded her spiritual warfare against the beast, the church will possess a greater illumination and will be able to know whom she must consider as her own and whom as outside. To sit on the cloud means that when she has received the judicial power from God, [the church] will distinguish between the good and the evil: “You will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.”
