The passage refers to the perpetual light of the Lamb. Indeed, the Lamb himself will be the eternal [light] in that city when the time of night has been removed. As Isaiah said, “It shall be for them from month to month and from sabbath to sabbath.” By month he signifies the light because of the full splendor of the moon; by sabbath he is signifying the eternal rest. It is as though it had said, “For them there continues light from light and eternal rest from rest.” That the gates are not closed is indicative of the most complete security. For [in that city] it is not said, “Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation,” but rather “Be still and see that I am the Lord.” There what is seen is truly loved; what is loved is praised without ceasing. There no one becomes feeble from sloth; nor does anyone grow weary from the activity of perpetual praise.
