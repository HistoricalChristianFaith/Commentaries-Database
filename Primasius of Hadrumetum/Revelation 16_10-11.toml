The throne of the beast, or his kingdom, as it were, his judicial authority, is said to be darkened, because [its followers] are darkened by the joy of earthly happiness. And although they heartily rejoice in their present good rather than in the possessing of the highest blessedness, they “suppress the truth by wickedness,” and so gnaw at their own tongues. The psalm adds its voice to this understanding when it says, “whose mouths speak lies and whose right hand is a right hand of iniquity,” and “they spoke iniquity from on high.” Just like smoke, they rise by the arrogance of their temporary prosperity, from which they ought to turn in repentance, and although they are in the dark, they rejoice. As Job said, “They spend their days in prosperity, and in a moment they go down to hell.”
