Just as the body consists of individual members, so is the temple constructed from precious stones. Although we are accustomed to material things, he does not want us here to think of something physical as is our habit. Therefore, relieving us from this manner of thinking, he says, “I saw in it no temple, for its temple is the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb.” For when the tares have been removed, then shall the church especially exult in the elect alone and remain consecrated in God as though she were resting completely in a temple. In this way the church may obtain a blessed habitation in him from whom she had received the origin of her existence and had come to know the gentleness of redemption. For the church’s wholeness is completed in these three things: in being, in knowing and in loving. God created her that she might be fashioned [according to his will]; having called her, he enlightened her; having elected her, he has made her blessed. God intends that when perfected [the church] will dwell in him by way of the promised glorification, when she no longer walks by way of faith but rejoices in his sight.
