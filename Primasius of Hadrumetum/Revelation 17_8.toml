The holy Scriptures teach that from the beginning of the world there has been the rise and the advance to the present time of two cities. Of these, one is of God and the other is of the devil, and in this passage [the city of the devil] is indicated by the beast as [representing] altogether the whole body of the wicked. And so it says that it was and is not, because in the passing away of generations that succeed one another, it is built up and supplemented. And, therefore, it follows that it is going to ascend from the abyss as well as go to destruction. For by the hidden yet just judgment of God, it is brought to its end, so that the psalm says, “Your judgments are like the great deep.” Or it claims that [the beast] will come forth from the hearts of the impious, of which the psalm speaks, “The deep calls forth the deep.”

He is referring to those very same people from whose members the body destined to damnation is built up. And should the names make for some ambiguity, in his epistle [John] has spoken of the same thing in the singular: “As you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now there are many antichrists.” And shortly thereafter he says, “They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.” Therefore, those whose names are not written in the Book of Life and who will still be living at the end of the world and who will experience the destruction of their own damnation, these will realize too late that he whom they had thought to be the Christ is not. And they will be amazed, for they had been deceived by the hidden seduction of the beast. Rather, when they have been most justly condemned, they [will realize that the Christ] is our Christ whom they will realize is indeed the judge. Therefore, since the foundation of the world, as “the Lord knows those who are his,” so he has also promised that he would say to them, “Come, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.” And so also, those who are not his, he has not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world. But as those unknown to him and foreknown from afar he will condemn to the punishment of that eternal fire “which is prepared for the devil and his angels.” “For the Lord is high and regards the lowly, but the haughty he knows from afar,” and so he says, “I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.”
