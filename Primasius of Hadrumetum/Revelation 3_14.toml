“He who is the Amen says these words, the faithful and true witness.” We must consider the meaning here of “is” and “Amen.” The term amen is certainly said to mean “true” or “faithful.” And so, in this passage without question it refers to that essence of the divinity of which God spoke when he said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘He who is has sent me to you.’ ” For he truly is, who is always the same.

Since in the person of the one Christ humanity is said to have been assumed, he says, “who is the beginning of the creation of God.” It is appropriate to regard the Lord Christ as the beginning of God’s creation because of the mystery of the incarnation. From his person we read, “The Lord created me as a beginning of his ways.” And the apostle said, “Since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest,” and following. For he himself is the Way, who is the fatherland, he himself the Author of faith, who is also its fulfiller, he himself both alpha and omega, he himself the beginning whom no ones precedes, he himself the end whom no one succeeds as ruler.
