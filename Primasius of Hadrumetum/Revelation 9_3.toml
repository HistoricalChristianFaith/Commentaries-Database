The “locusts” signify those who come forth from the smoke. For, like smoke, the heretics desire to rise high, since by their teachings they strive for positions of eminence, yet, again like smoke, they are dissipated. We read of this smoke, for in the person of those who are evil it was said, “Smoke is the breath in our nostrils, and reason is the sparks for moving our heart.” When the impious are said to strive by sin against wisdom, that is, against the Lord Jesus Christ, they are also described as fighting against his church, harming it by their malicious mouth, while they are hindered from harming the green grass and trees.
