“And he did great signs, even making fire come down from heaven in the sight of people.” Although it says that he would do many signs, he mentions only this remarkable sign. This translation speaks as though of the past, while it announces the future, although indicating that the future will also be different. And so it says, “so that he also makes fire come down from heaven.” That he causes fire to descend from heaven to the earth, that is, from the church to those who are earthly, indicates that whether from a variety of peoples or by the wiles of a falling enemy he causes his servants to speak in new and multiple tongues. In this manner they prattle as though they had received the gift of the Holy Spirit who in the form of fiery tongues had once truly shined upon the individual disciples of Christ. And, indeed, the Lord especially commended this sign of those who believe, saying, “These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons, they will speak in new tongues,” and the like. It is not surprising, therefore, if that beast which by imitation usurped the name of the Lamb who had been killed and now is living should also fraudulently lay claim by mimicry to that great gift of the Holy Spirit and feign that gift also for his servants, even as we recall what once Simon boasted but was unable to do. For when the very ministers of Satan listed their expulsions of demons and their various wonders and said, “Did we not cast out demons in your name?” and the like, the Lord did not approve of their boasting but reproved them as arrogant and worthy of damnation. And therefore, perhaps by emphasizing this sign [of fire], which represents the Holy Spirit, he wished to indicate especially that which is superior to all else. For although heresies seem to have some things in common with us, only the church of Christ can boast that she especially is possessed of this gift. Although the magicians of Pharaoh performed wonders similar to those of Moses, we are told that they were frustrated by the Holy Spirit. When they gave up on their own claims and were defeated, they spoke a true confession and said, “This is the finger of God.” The Gospel testifies that the Holy Spirit is called “the finger of God” when one Gospel says, “By the Spirit of God I cast out demons,” while another says, “By the finger of God I cast out demons.” And so the sheer force of the seduction is indicated, that the beast is thought to possess that Spirit that resisted the magicians and brought their deceptions to nothing.
