The bed here is to be understood as that security which sinners often promise to themselves when they have committed disgraceful crimes with impunity. That is, sinners at times do not experience the vengeance of present wrath and so neglect penance until sudden destruction comes upon them like the pain of childbirth and they are not able to escape. They are said to be given over by God to this neglectfulness that this security produces, for they are abandoned to a hidden, although not unjust, judgment. We read of such security also elsewhere: “The little ones are killed by their turning away, and the prosperity of the foolish will destroy them.” Another translation renders “mourning” for “bed,” whereby is designated the eternal misery that awaits those who do not repent from their works.
