It now says clearly that that power that they had received with the beast they will hand over to the beast, that is, to that head that seemed to have died and to have come to life again. For by a common consent and will they will give to him every worship of their desire and effort and exhibit their servitude.… Although it is describing the power of this adversarial body, it now rightly foretells the victory of the Lamb. And to indicate that he will triumph in his followers, it adds, “And those with him, the elect, the faithful and the called.” And with good reason does it mention the elect first, for the Lord said, “Many are called, but few are chosen.”
