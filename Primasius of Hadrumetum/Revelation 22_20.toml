The selfsame Christ who gave his testimony announces to the church that he is coming. And to him the church devoutly responds in the manner of the Song of Songs, “Amen, Come, Lord Jesus Christ.” And when the church prays, it says, “Your kingdom come!” and “in the way that is blameless, when you will come to me.”
