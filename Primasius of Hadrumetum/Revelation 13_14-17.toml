It is as though he had said that the deception had succeeded to such an extent that the earthly, led astray by the wonders of the beast, gave their full miserable assent to the beast and by a mutual devotion encouraged each other to make an image of the beast in the fraudulence of their hearts. And so they believe that there is no room for doubt but are convinced by the evidence of the fire that [the beast] is indeed the Christ, although the devil is in the antichrist and the same malignant spirit has taken the form of the Spirit and, with divine permission, lays down such seductive snares. Therefore, he is said “to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast should even speak.” This may be interpreted in two ways. Either the whole body of evil persons are persuaded by the demonstrations of power, since the devil is working and the leaders are urging the people, so that there is for everyone the same confession and that all are to proclaim it by a uniform formula, so that should anyone not speak this through the image of the beast, that is, through a mutual imitation, he should be killed.… Or, just as through conversation with a woman the first man was led astray by the mouth of a serpent, so then he deludes many by a similar fraud, when he causes his followers to receive messages by consulting an image, that is, the antichrist, to whom they believe honor is due, as to a god, although he is “the man of sin and the son of perdition.” … “And he causes all … to be marked on the right hand or the forehead.” He here distinguishes the individual members, although more often he includes them as a whole in the body or the person of the beast. The “hand” indicates works, and it is the right hand to simulate the truth. The “forehead” symbolizes the confession of faith. Since they are defrauded in regard to both of these good things, they are said to be marked on both.
