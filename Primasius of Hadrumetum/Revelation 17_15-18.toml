What the apostle said, “God gave them up to a base mind to do what they ought not,” that is also now said. For God has placed in their hearts to do that which is pleasing to him. Righteousness is pleasing to God, through which we know that retribution is visited upon the impious. Moreover, [it is according to God’s will] that they who have given their kingdom to the beast pay their just penalties with the beast, until the words of God be fulfilled, which, to be sure, consist of justice and mercy. For “all the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth.”

This woman is the very one who was given over to the corruptions of flesh and blood and who had prospered through the power of the earthly kingdom. And since she consists of those very kings over whom she is said to reign according to her habit, [the text] has divided the very same one into parts, as though separating a genus into its species, so that the words of the Lord will be fulfilled in the woman, in the city, in the kings, on the kings and on [the woman], when he redeems his own by his mercy and by his justice condemns the insolent.
