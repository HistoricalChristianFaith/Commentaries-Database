“And I saw seven golden lampstands, and in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man.” He saw Christ who rather often desires to be called by this name. He who is the enclothed Christ is the seven lampstands themselves. Whether the seven lampstands or the seven stars, both refer to the church.… On account of the exalted nature of the divine discourse, on occasion the genus cannot be described clearly, because it is more easily seen than expressed.… So also in this passage, among the seven lampstands he is describing the church in the Son of man. “For,” the apostle says, “the two shall become one flesh, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.” As I said above, the genus is clarified through various species.
