[The loud voice] indicates that through his servants he was proclaimed faithfully and with strength. As the prophet says, “And he made firm the glory of his strength.” “When he called out, the seven thunders sounded.” Because of the known use of the number seven, I think that the seven thunders signify the various manners of the church’s preaching. The apostle Paul spoke of this concerning his service to others, “As babes in Christ, I fed you with milk, not solid food,” however to others, “solid food is for the perfect,” yet also to others, “avoid the heretical man after the first and second admonition.” Therefore, the church is said to proclaim rightly through its usual offices of preaching.
