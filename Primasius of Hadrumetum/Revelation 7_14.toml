When it says that a number of the faithful had come out of the great tribulation, what else is indicated except what we read elsewhere, “Through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.” Therefore, the apostle also said, “Brothers, let us not grow weary, for in due time we shall reap.” It is through the endurance of struggles that the number of the faithful are sifted out, just as by the weight of the press oil is prepared with diligent care and grain that is to be stored in a barn is collected through the threshing machine. That they wash their robes in the blood of the Lamb reveals their reward, so that the labor of the aforementioned struggle might be endured with equinimity. And he rightly adds that they made their robes white in the blood of the Lamb. It is as though he said that the robes that some had befouled after the grace of baptism through neglect, ignorance or contempt, these had made white in the blood of the Lamb, that is, in the grace of Christ, or even in undergoing martyrdom. This reward is to be assigned especially to those in the church who have spilled their blood for Christ and have returned the robe of baptism with a greater brilliance by a better service of blood. But if this grace is to refer to all the faithful generally, we must finally conclude that if anyone is cleansed by the font of his Lord, is fed by his flesh and is enflamed by the call of the Spirit, he is in this manner made white as snow. For there are those who are proven to be martyrs before God by their inner character, even though they are not martyrs by way of a public act.
