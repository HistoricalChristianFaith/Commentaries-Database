The horses are men, and their riders are evil spirits. Just as we could say in a good sense “You mounted upon your horses,” referring to preachers, “and your victorious cavalry,” so here in an evil sense [these horses] are joined to iniquitous spirits.… And although little similarity can be found between locusts and horses, the same is true concerning lions. Yet each of these is suitable for symbolizing the persons of heretics.… The description of the breastplate signifies the punishments of the impious, for we read that those who worship the beast are promised fire and sulphur, and “the smoke of their torments goes up for ever and ever.”
