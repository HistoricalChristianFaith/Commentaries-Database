What the heavenly voice said was this, “Those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son,” and, “The Lord knows those who are his,” or something similar to this. There follows, “Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins.” To this point I think that [the narrative] has been of the first coming, when until the end of the world the good [people] allow the wicked to be intermingled with them, so that [the wicked] do not think that the good are to be abandoned on their behalf or that they are to be followed by a noxious imitation. For the prophecy, “Go out from her, my people, lest you touch any unclean thing,” is fulfilled in this way—when the righteous no longer commingle with the sinful, not so much by the separation of the body but by the difference of their fully sound will.
