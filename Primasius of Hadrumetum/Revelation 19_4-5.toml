When [the voice] commands that this [praise] be done and then it is reported that [such praise] was given, it indicates that [God] has accepted the praise of his elect as pleasing, indeed, giving his approval to the praise that had been given and indicating that it is to be perpetual. The “great” in the church are those of whom the apostle said, “We speak wisdom among the perfect,” and of whom the Lord said, “Whoever teaches men so shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.” The “small” are those of whom it is said, “As babes in Christ, I have given you milk to drink, not solid food.”
