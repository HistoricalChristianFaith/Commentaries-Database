Perfect knowledge of the Word of God is revealed to those who are worthy to be the body of Christ and members [of him], since the Head especially gives knowledge of himself to the body, and he knows what the church is worthy to know in him. The apostle says, “He who is united to the Lord is one spirit, for the two shall be one flesh.” Neither the Jews nor the foreigners nor the heretics will ever know this name, for “if they had [known], they would not have crucified the Lord of glory,” and again, “The world has not known you.” And the Lord said again to his disciples, “You will see me; because I live, you will live also. In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you.” And the disciples answered, “Lord, how is it that you will manifest yourself to us and not to the world?” Concerning the heretics, the Lord said, “To you it has been given to know the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, so that they may indeed see but not perceive.” He has a great name inscribed that no one knows except himself. However, we must beware lest by a purely carnal wisdom we think that the name of the Son is unknown to the Father or to the Holy Spirit.… If the Son alone is said to know something, the whole Trinity is also regarded as knowing it. Similarly, if the Father alone is said to know something, he is without doubt thought to know it together with his Wisdom, who is Christ, and with his Spirit, who is believed to be the Spirit of the Father and of the Son. For when the Father alone was said to know the day of judgment, certainly it was not denied that the Son and the Spirit also knew it. So also, when the Holy Spirit alone is said to know something, and the names of the Father and of the Son are unspoken, nevertheless it is declared that they know in the same manner. When the apostle says, “What person knows the thoughts of a man except the spirit of the man that is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God,” it would be foolish to separate the Father and the Son from such knowledge. When he says elsewhere, “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed for the day of redemption,” she is not excluding the persons of the Father and of the Son from the work of our redemption, even though he does not mention their names. For through the undivided power of the one nature, we teach that the works of the Trinity are inseparable.
