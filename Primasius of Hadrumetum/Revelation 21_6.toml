From this fountain [God] refreshes believers who are now on the way. However, to those who conquer he will provide abundantly [from this fountain] and give them to drink in the fatherland. He causes rain to fall upon both, so that those who are still on the way are not deprived of drink in this desert and so that those who become citizens [of the new Jerusalem] might continually be inebriated from the stream of delights that come from God.
