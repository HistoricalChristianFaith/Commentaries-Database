Whenever the faithful proclamation of the truth and the pure form of the virtues is confirmed by repetition, our spiritual mind is disposed toward a deeper worship. This is briefly yet meaningfully indicated at the end of this book when it signifies the deity of the Word by an Aand the assumed humanity by an W [he who is] the beginning without an end. When I note that in the present book A and W is repeated several times, I recognize that this occurs for a reason. For [they are repeated] either to assert more often the divinity and the humanity of the one [person] of Christ, in which we claim the fullness of the whole Christian faith to consist, or [they are repeated] to suggest the whole Trinity, which is of one nature. The Trinity spoke through the prophet, saying, “Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me. I am God and besides me there is no savior.” And it is he to whom it is said through the prophet, You are God, and in you there is God, and beside you there is no other God. And should there be some other better and deeper mystery hidden in this, I have no doubt that this has been repeated so that it might remain beneficial for the understanding of the faithful. To be sure, the Greek letters Α and Ω yield a number that we know is contained in the word dove. The Greek word for “dove” is περιστερά and this word has the value of 801: π=80, ε=5, ρ=100, ι=10, σ=200, τ=300, ε=5, ρ=100, α=1. The letters Α and Ω also yield 801: Α=1, Ω=800. In the form of the dove we rightly recognize the person of the Holy Spirit, for it was in this form that he chose to appear when he came down. And in this way the madness of the Arians and other heretics is brought to naught, who claim that he is alien to the nature of the Father and the Son. And so by the agreement of this number this revelation from heaven makes known that the Holy Spirit is consubstantial and co-eternal with the Father and the Son.
