The wall of the church is Christ, and we read [that this wall] is both great and high: “Great is the Lord and greatly to be praised in the city of our God, on his holy mountain,” and “The Lord is high above all the nations.” Of this wall the prophet Isaiah said, “In this day this song will be sung in the land of Judah, ‘We have a strong city; a savior is placed in it as a wall and bulwark. Open the gates, so that a righteous nation that keeps truth may enter in and the ancient error stay away.’ ” Singing together by one Spirit, they are seen to relate similar realities. He continues by speaking of the gates. There are twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels and the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel are inscribed [on the gates]. We know that our Lord originally offered entrance to the faith through the twelve apostles. However, the context of this passage prohibits that meaning when it now mentions the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. The passage intends that we first consider the patriarchs from whose stock we know that the whole race of the Israelites was directly propagated. From these, according to the apostle, “there is a remnant saved by the election of grace,” and he adds that “God has not rejected his people.” Therefore, in this passage we ought to interpret the [twelve] gates to signify the twelve patriarchs, especially since we hear that “you do not support the root, but the root supports you.” … I think that the angels signify those elders and princes whose administration and leadership marvelously ruled that nation [of Israel].
