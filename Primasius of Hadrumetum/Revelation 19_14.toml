In heaven the churches, as though “with unveiled face beholding the glory of God,” all being pure in heart and made whiter than snow by grace, are said to follow Christ.… They always go forward on white horses, that is, with pure bodies and minds, following the footsteps of Christ, who is going before and to whom it is said in the Song of Songs, “We run after you for the aroma of your ointments.”
