By saying that he opened his mouth, it shows that he spoke with that damnable bravado that while before he blasphemed secretly, he will at that time do so publicly. For he will have dared to attribute to himself that honor that especially belongs to [Christ]. And he speaks his inquities arrogantly, for he is hostile to Christ and wishes to be accepted instead of Christ, either by the use of force or by supplanting him with fraudulent means. For a time he will attain power, which he will use in an evil way to harm the body of Christ, so that as Christ suffers, the persecutors praise [the beast] all the more since [Christ] is crucified more cruelly with his [saints]. Of this power the Lord said, “You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above.” If, therefore, at the time of his passion Christ had temporarily given power to his persecutors, although the prince of this world could find in him nothing worthy of death, why is it surprising that in his church he allows evil persons to attack, so that one might say that [the beast] has defeated them? Even we must understand the part from the whole, namely, that part which he is able to conquer.
