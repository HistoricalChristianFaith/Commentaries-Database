This passage refers to three kinds of sins, and it also mentions the same number of those persons who transgress by them. It refers to avarice, which according to the apostle is also called a “servitude of idols”; licentiousness by the word fornication; and gluttony in that which pleases. Against this the Lord forewarned, saying, “Do not allow your hearts to be weighed down in dissipation and drunkenness.” It says that the kings of the earth have committed fornication with it. For merchants are enriched, as it says, by avarice, although some [interpreters] prefer to interpret this to mean that they are rich in sins rather than in wealth. By nations it designates that promiscuous multitude of the lewd crowd; by kings it refers to those among them who appear for a time to succeed; and by merchants it refers to those who in their desire for earthly riches trade their souls by an unhappy barter for temporal abundance. Such persons act wholly contrary to the words of the Lord: “What shall a man give in return for his life?”
