He is not expressing any doubts about the trustworthiness of John. Rather, he is commending this vision to the whole church as true, for he knew that in the future there would also be those who are to learn from it. [By speaking of his angel], he teaches that he has always looked after the welfare of all. He is the Spirit of the prophets who is also the Holy Spirit and indeed is the Lord. For this reason the prophet said, “I will hear what the Lord God speaks to me,” and “The beginning of the speaking of God to Hosea.” Because of the essence of the one, divine Trinity, he also fittingly mentions here the Holy Spirit, since above he had mentioned the Father and the Son. For when we read that “God is spirit,” it refers to the entire Trinity.
