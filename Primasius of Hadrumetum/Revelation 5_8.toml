The bowls that are accepted by God are the pious confession in which no one is hidden with a duplicitous heart but is rather sincere with an open affection. They are also the golden vessels that are in the great house, burning with the sweetness of the pleasant odor of Christ. Moreover, the prayers of the saints are the grateful deeds of those who rejoice over the salvation of the world and their intercessions for the wellbeing of the helpless. [The apostle] says, “Christ suffered for us, leaving for us an example that we should walk in his footsteps.” When, therefore, “those who belong to Christ crucify their own flesh with its passions and desires,” it is as though they are playing to Christ on harps, so that what he has done for them, they might do for him, “looking to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of our faith.”
