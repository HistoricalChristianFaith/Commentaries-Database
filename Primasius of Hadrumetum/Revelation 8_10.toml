[[commentary]]

It speaks of men who have fallen from heaven as though from the church, that is, of those who have the public reputation of shining brightly with good merits. For that reason they are compared to stars and torches, as did the apostle Jude, who called them “stars of seduction,” since they lead astray by a superficial splendor. And the Lord also compared such people with walls and “whitewashed tombs.”
