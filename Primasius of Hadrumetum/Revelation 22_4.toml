This implies that there is in store for us a reward for our faith, that vision that John had in mind when he said, “When he appears, we shall be like him, for we shall see him just as he is.” For, of course, face is to be understood not as the kind of face we now have as part of our body but as a manifestation of what God is.… God will be made known to and be perceived by us, in many ways. He will be seen in the spirit (whereby each of us will see him within ourselves and in one another); he will be seen in himself; he will be seen in the new heavens and the new earth and in every creature then existing.
