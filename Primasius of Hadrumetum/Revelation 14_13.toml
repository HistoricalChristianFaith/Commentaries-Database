Those are said to die in the Lord who showed themselves approved in both their faith and their life. And for that reason they deserved to be called out from there. And so the text continues: “ ‘Yes,’ says the Spirit, ‘they will rest from their labors.’ ” As … he says that those impious have no rest day or night, now he says that the faithful deserved the rest from their good works. Indeed, since he had made mention of the wicked, it was necessary also to mention the fullness of the bliss of those who are good. And since this [bliss] exists among the leaders and the people, he in summary fashion includes both, speaking first in an indefinite manner, “Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord.” However, on behalf of those who work in the vineyard, he says they rest from their labors and so manifestly declares happiness to all so that he might promise to those who work in the vineyard a special fruit of rest after their labor. Therefore the apostle says, “We beseech you that you respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and that you esteem them more highly in love because of their work.” And he speaks even about himself, “I worked harder than any of them.” “For their deeds follow them,” it says. Concerning these the prophet says, “Establish the works of our hands over us.”
