How is it that he who wishes may take [of the tree of life] when he had said, “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him,” unless because we know that one who was previously unwilling becomes willing through divine inspiration? So also here free will is fittingly included when he says, “Let him who desires take,” since immediately grace is proclaimed when he says, “the water of life without price.” To be sure, [this means] let him take the water of life without price, even though no good [works] have gone before. As the apostle says, “What have you that you did not receive?” Therefore, we receive by grace from God even the will to come, and to this we have brought nothing beforehand so that we might be [willing]. How much more, therefore, [do we bring nothing] so that from being sinners we might be made righteous.
