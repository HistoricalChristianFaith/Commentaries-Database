Having mentioned the patriarchs, he now mentions the apostles. Although we know that the church has but a single foundation, that is, Christ, it is not surprising that here it is said to have twelve [foundations]. In Christ the apostles have merited to be foundations of the church, and of [Christ] the apostle said, “No other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.” In Christ the apostles are also said to be “light,” as he said to them, “You are the light of the world,” although Christ alone is “the true light that enlightens every person coming into this world.” Therefore, Christ is the Light that enlightens, while the apostles are a light that is enlightened. The Holy Scripture often suggests many similar ideas.…70 Therefore, in this passage we ought to recognize the twelve foundations to be the apostles, although as those called to be in the one Foundation, which is Jesus Christ.… Therefore, the apostles are foundations, but in the one foundation, Jesus. Moreover, Jesus alone, even without the apostles, is rightly called “foundation,” while the apostles are without Christ in no way said to be foundations of the church.
