Earlier John had said that a measuring rod was given to him, namely, the commission given to him to preach. Now he says that the angel speaking with him has a golden measuring rod to measure the city and its gates and walls. It is necessary, therefore, to understand this angel as Christ, who is the Wisdom of God and by his power extends from one end [of the earth] to the other and “orders all things well.” Therefore, we read, “Receive wisdom as gold.” Moreover, to Christ alone is it given to measure the city, for it is he who distributes to each one of the faithful the gifts of the spiritual graces, and who, as we read, “has ordered all things in number and measure and weight.”
