[This bowl] contains all of the other nations who have been so overcome by natural error and enmeshed in impure lusts that they even think of divine things in a carnal manner. And so, by these waters one may understand the teachings of the Gentile nations. Therefore, it says, “They became blood,” just as it says in Genesis, “My spirit shall not abide in these people, for they are flesh,” and also in the book of Wisdom, “stirred up by filthy blood for rebuke.” In addition, the apostle says, “To set the mind on the flesh is death” and “the wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God.”
