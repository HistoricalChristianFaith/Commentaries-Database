By “grass” he refers to those small ones who are content with the milk of the Christian faith. By “green vegetation” he refers to those who have begun to live according to the virtues and who are moving not toward dryness but toward a fruitful fertility. By “trees” he refers to those persons in the church who already give spiritual thanks by the production of fruit. Of the first kind, the small ones, we read, “Who spread out the earth upon the waters,” that is, baptism. Of the second type, we read, “It shall rejoice in its drops when it comes forth.” And concerning the third kind we read, “I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of the Lord.” The number of the elect is perfected from all of these kinds of persons, which the bite of the locusts cannot harm, except for those who do not have the sign of God upon their foreheads. For the apostle says, “For not all have faith.” By such persons, it says, the sun will be darkened, however not extinguished, for although with the increase of iniquity the love of many will grow cold, “God’s firm foundation stands,” as it is written, “having this seal, ‘The Lord knows who are his,’ and ‘Let every one who calls upon the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.’ ”
