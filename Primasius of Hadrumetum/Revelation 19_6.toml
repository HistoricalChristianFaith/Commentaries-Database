The trumpets signify that preaching of which Isaiah spoke, saying, “Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet.” In this preaching the dread of the divine judgment is also indicated, which I think is also suggested by the mention of the thunder.… In the many waters those peoples are symbolized who praise God by saying “Hallelujah.” And so, when the church preaches and fears and praises, she exults with trembling, as we read, “Serve the Lord with fear; praise him with trembling.” “For our Lord the Almighty reigns.” The voice rightly mentions God’s omnipotence. For he created from nothing that which did not exist, and he sought those who had perished from sin, and he found those who were deserving of punishment, and from these he mercifully made righteous those whom he willed. Then from these, as though from members, he made for himself the church, and when he had redeemed her for such a dignity, he made her to be his bride since she did not merit to be his servant girl.
