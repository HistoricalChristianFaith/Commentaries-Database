He regards those as “naked” who are destitute of the works of righteousness, whom he also regards as “blind.” However, he is clothed with white garments who is vested with the baptism of Christ, and he enjoys that faith “working through love,” for “as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.” When he says that the eyes must be anointed with salve, he advises that the heart be directed toward the divine testimonies. For “the commandment of the Lord is clear, enlightening the eyes.”
