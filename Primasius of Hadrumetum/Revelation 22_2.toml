By the twelve months he signifies all of time, and to be sure all of eternity. Therefore, where there is an eternal paradise, no aridity will ever be permitted to intrude. Where there is a perfect and certain well-being, absolutely no infirmity enters in. This is what the prophet promised when he said, “They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.” This is the tree, as we read, which is “planted by streams of water,” and of which Jeremiah says that it “sends out its roots by the stream.” This is to say that it places its hope and trust in the Lord. We may also interpret this passage concerning the river of the water of life to refer to the Lord Jesus Christ, who is himself the fountain of life. For we read of him, “With you is the fountain of life; in your light we shall see light.” He is himself, as we read, “the image of God’s majesty, who is powerful in all things, and remaining in himself renews all things and in every generation rests in holy souls.” And so he is the Fountain who is also the River. He is the Fountain, for he remains in himself inexhaustible, and he is the River because he offers himself generously and perpetually so that the saints might receive of [his] abundance. Where he is called fountain, he is also called a rushing stream. When the psalm says, “You shall give them drink from the river of your delights,” it then continues, “for with you is the fountain of life, and in your light shall we see light.” Moreover, [it says that it flows] through the middle of the street for it is a good that is common to all the saints and that is not denied to any who are worthy, nor is it granted to any who are unworthy.… Indeed, it is in their midst as an undivided patrimony to all who see God. For that reason we read, “Jerusalem, a city whose fellowship is complete within itself.” If the fruit is understood to be the reward of a blissful immortality, then we rightly understand the leaves to be the song of perpetual praise, because for those who sing they fall in the well-being of a happy fate. For there exists the true healing of the nations, there is full redemption, there is eternal happiness.
