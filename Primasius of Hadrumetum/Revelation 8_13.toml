He speaks of an eagle that moves through the heavens in swift flight out of contempt for the earth. He speaks of the church flying in mid-heaven, for she is going to possess the whole world, and she says, “Our abode is in the heavens.” And he rightly says that she was “in the middle,” for “all who are around him offer gifts,” and God works his way in the midst and “works salvation in the midst of the earth,” and “the Lord is round about his people.”
