It is certain that all these benefits belong to the future life and not to this life. Indeed, in this life the more one is holy and the more full a person is of holy desires, the more abundant will be his weeping in prayer. For this reason we read, “My tears have been my food day and night,” and again, “Every night I flood my bed with tears.”
