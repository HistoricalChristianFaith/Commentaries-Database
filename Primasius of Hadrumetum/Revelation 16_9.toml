It is the habit of blasphemers that they prefer to blame God for wickedness and iniquity rather than themselves, and therefore [they] do not seek penance after plagues but, even though tormented, continue to throw insults. For just as a bronze vase, when subjected to a great fire, brings up bubbles from the inside that boil up on the outside and exceed its own capacity, so also those who belong to the beast, resisting the Unconquered, see the church of Christ struggle with a tireless constancy, and inflamed by the flames of an intolerable envy, exhale a fire conceived in the heart through the blasphemies of an impure mouth.
