He had already said that the city was of pure gold, transparent as glass, and that its foundations were from every precious jewel. I think that this refers to those who have authority in the church. But now he speaks in addition of the streets and says that also they are from pure gold that is as clear as glass. It is as though in the earlier passage the streets were not included in the description of the city. It is my opinion that in this passage the little children [of God] are symbolized, of whom in the present time it is said, “Your eyes beheld my unformed substance and in your book all of them were written.” And again, “His conversation is with the simple,” for they by this reward will certainly not be deceived and by this mutual conversation they will come to behold their own understandings. For as the streets are placed in a lesser position, so [the simple] seem to be reserved for a humble position. Although in the streets the breadth of love is to be discerned, he signifies the perfect through a variety of words. However, at that time no one will there [be regarded] as unworthy, no one will be found to be small or weak, although some may stand out with a greater clarity than others because of the difference of rewards. “For as star differs from star in glory,” the apostle says, “so is it with the resurrection of the dead.”
