In view of the various passions in all of the vexations and vices they cause, evil spirits are said to possess a diversity of characteristics. And so, rightly did [Jesus] say somewhere in the Gospel, “deaf and dumb spirit,” and elsewhere, “unclean spirit,” and elsewhere the prophet said, “a spirit of harlotry had led them astray,” for no other reason than that those under its control perform the uncleanliness of its own vice. Here, however, he includes all three unclean spirits, because he indicates that the one body of the devil is made up of its habitual differences, mentioning those [spirits] that possess the greater power, starting with the devil as the dragon; then the beast, which is the antichrist with his followers; and the false prophet, who represents the leaders and teachers of noxious doctrines. Therefore, he sees one spirit but mentions three for the number of the parts of the one body, so that every one of the lost is shown to be led by one malign spirit. Perhaps for this reason he adds the horrible filthiness of frogs as a comparison with their impudence. For like frogs living in the sewers at night, these false prophets make a great noise through the damnable ranting of their error. Just as frogs are loathsome in the places they inhabit, in their appearance and in their annoying croaking, so the devil with his followers is recognized to be abominable to the truth and is deservedly and justly damned to eternal fire. The blessed apostle says something similar when he says, “Do not be mismated with unbelievers. For what partnership have righteousness and iniquity? Or what fellowship has light with darkness? What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what has a believer in common with an unbeliever? What agreement has the temple of God with idols?” And so here, when it says that from their mouths came forth unclean spirits similar to frogs, it is as though it said, why do you compare filth to heaven when it is fitting as a habitation of frogs even as it is of the horrible blasphemies of the false prophets? He is claiming that the teachers of the truth are as far removed [from such persons] as frogs are from holy persons, so that those who are not able to recognize that their frauds must be refuted by the power of discretion, may at least, when confronted by the ugliness of frogs, attempt to avoid such persons who, like frogs, are a hindrance to the ignorant lest they receive the truth in the quiet practice of devotion.
