Wishing to relieve us altogether from the changeability characteristic of the luminaries of the day and the night, and to call us to that immutable Light, it says, “[The city] had no need of the sun,” nor is that city illumined by that [natural] order. Rather, it is illumined by a much superior and ineffable Light, namely, the Sun of righteousness. Speaking of him, the prophet says, “Healing is in its wings.” “For he is himself the true Son and eternal life and the true light who enlightens every one coming into this world.”
