With these months there is completed the three years and six months, which above were understood to refer to the quality of the present age. However, here the severity of the final persecution is especially foretold. For were one to consider the four familiar directions of the earth and multiply four times the ten sayings of the law, which is the symbol of perfection, one would have forty. Were the performance of the two commandments of love added to this, the number forty-two would be completed. That which is commanded in words achieves no favor if it is not perfected by works. And the church is said to be protected by these [commandments] as though by the wings of an eagle, and she flees from the treachery of the dragon into the wilderness to be nourished there for 1, days, which is equal to the forty-two months, so that the calculation of the same number may not render a useless meaning.… [The beast blasphemed] against God and the church, which dwells in heaven, because “our citizenship is in heaven,” and “now you are not in the flesh.” I think that here the temple might also signify the glorified trophy of the body of Christ against whom the antichrist is said then to blaspheme, when he has dared assign to himself that honor which is especially due to [Christ]. Concerning this the Lord said in the Gospel, “That they might lead astray, if possible, even the elect,” and just earlier, “But for the elect those days will be shortened.”
