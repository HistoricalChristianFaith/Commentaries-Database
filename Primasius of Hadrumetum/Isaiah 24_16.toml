“The Spirit of the Lord filled the world.” But that will be done with the broken horns of sinners. The horns of the righteous one are said to be exalted, concerning which Isaiah prophesied: “From the ends of the earth we heard praises announcing the glory of the righteous one.” The church is understood to have seven horns, as does every world in which the sevenfold grace of the Spirit rules on account of his remarkable sevenfold operation. And eyes are mentioned here because of illumination. It is in relation to this, I believe, that Zechariah said, “These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which run through all the earth.”
