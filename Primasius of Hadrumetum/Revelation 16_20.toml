It is my view that by the terms islands and also mountains the church is signified on account of the greatness of its stability. Isaiah spoke about these: “In [your] teachings give glory to the Lord; in the islands of the sea [give glory] to the name of the Lord, the God of Israel,” and again: “And in the latter days that mountain of the house of the Lord will be established upon the tops of the mountains.” This flight will occur when the society of evil persons is at last avoided to such an extent that there will be no confusion or mixture of the church with the wicked. Therefore, the prophet said, “Flee from the midst of Babylon, let every one save his life.” Babylon will fall at that time when at the end it has received the power to persecute the saints. For this reason [Scripture] says, “The heart is proud before destruction, and the spirit is humbled before glory.”
