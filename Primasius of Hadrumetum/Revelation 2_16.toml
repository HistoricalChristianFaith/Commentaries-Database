“You also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans. Repent then. If not, I will come to you soon and war against you with the sword of my mouth.” He speaks of a sword. … The sword is the commandments of both Testaments by which the contemptuous are spiritually overcome. “For those who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.”
