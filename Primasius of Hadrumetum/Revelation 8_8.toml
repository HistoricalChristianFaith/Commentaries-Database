The burning mountain cast into the sea is the devil, who was sent against the peoples. A third part of the sea became blood. By “blood” he means the wisdom of the flesh, which is hostile to God. For this reason it is said that through such wisdom the human soul is destroyed. And so the apostle said, “To be wise according to the flesh is death, for flesh and blood shall not inherit the kingdom of God.”
