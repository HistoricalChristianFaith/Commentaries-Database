“And I will give him a white stone,” that is, the adoption of the sons of God. This stone is a precious gem and may be understood as similar to that pearl that the merchant found and valued as equal to all his possessions which he sold. Another translation renders this as “pearl.” “And upon the stone is a new name,” that is, the name of Christian, for which reason we read, “And you shall be called by a new name which the mouth of the Lord will give.” And besides baptism I mention also martyrdom, “which no one knows except him who receives it.” Although hypocrites seem to bear the name superficially, they are unable to enter the power of its meaning, “having the form of religion but denying the power of it.” Therefore, the same John says, “He who says that he knows him but disobeys his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him.”
