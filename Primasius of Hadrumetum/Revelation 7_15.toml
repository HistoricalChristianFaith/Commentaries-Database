Before the throne of God is the church, in whose “heart he has placed ways to go up in the valley of tears to a place which he has established.” They serve him day and night, that is, in times of prosperity and in times of adversity. They are regarded as a “temple” who are said to serve in the temple, just as [they are regarded as] a throne. Therefore, it continues, “And he who sits upon the throne will dwell among them.” The soul of the righteous is the seat of wisdom. However, wisdom is Christ, and Christ is truly God.
