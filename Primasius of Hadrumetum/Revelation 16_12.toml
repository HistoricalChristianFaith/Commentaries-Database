[The waters dried up to prepare the way for the coming king from the east], that is, for Christ, concerning whom we read, “Behold a man, whose name is East,” for him who is coming a way is prepared so that he might judge. Moreover, in the name of the river, Euphrates, as in the sea, the rivers, the springs of water, the sun and the throne of the beast, over all of which the angels are said to have poured out their bowls, those peoples who are impure are indicated. And its waters were made dry, it says. This means that these peoples will possess nothing which is green or living within themselves, for what they have will be fit for the fire of the approaching judgment. Just as it said above that the crop was withered6 in its ripeness and that the vintage was harvested, so in this passage it says metaphorically that the water of the river had become dry so that nothing at all living remained in it, but rather that everything was to be destroyed by the fire of divine judgment, by which either the wicked are consumed as straw or the saints are made approved as gold.
