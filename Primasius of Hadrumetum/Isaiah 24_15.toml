“And God remembered Babylon the great, who came into his sight.” This designates the confused multitude of all the lost. “That he might give it to drink from the wine of his wrath.” The retribution of due punishment to be returned to the wicked is here recorded. “And all the islands fled, and no mountains could be found.” I believe that these islands and mountains are literary figures for the church on account of the prominence of its stability, concerning which it is also said through Isaiah: “Glorify the Lord in doctrine, the name of the Lord God of Israel in the islands of the sea.”
