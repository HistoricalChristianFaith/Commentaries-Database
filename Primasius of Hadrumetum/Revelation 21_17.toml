Clearly in many passages an angel symbolizes the church. Since the church is gathered together from people and is lifted high by the promises of Christ, she hopes for equality with the angels and her every intent longs for their company, and for this reason it says, “the measure of a man,” that is, of an angel’s. Or this verse indicates that that city that will reign more fully consists partly of angels who already live there in perpetual happiness and partly of those who are on the way, that is, of people.
