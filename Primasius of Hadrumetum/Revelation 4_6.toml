The sea of glass refers to baptism, where “it is believed with the heart unto justification, and there is confession with the mouth unto salvation.” And it is likened to glass because of faith. For in glass there is nothing to be seen on the outside than what is true on the inside. Nor is it without reason that baptism is said to be in the presence of the throne, lest heretics believe that they possess this or can bestow this outside [the church]. As so it says that [baptism is] in the presence of the throne, just as we read what was said to Moses, “The place is near me,” or as God himself exhorted in Deuteronomy, “In the place which the Lord your God chooses, to make his name present there.” We know that by all these passages the indivisible unity of the church is declared, where the Trinity may be received by baptism unto salvation, while the one who receives [baptism] outside [the church] is born to destruction. The gift of baptism is not evil but becomes evil when one to whom it is given makes evil use of it, just as was the morsel which was extended to Judas by the hand of the Lord.
