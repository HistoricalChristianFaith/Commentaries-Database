As we have said frequently, in each member of a species the whole genus is indicated. Hence when we indicate what the whole beast is, there are the seven heads, and again the heads are called seven mountains and seven kings. That is to say, they are the entire reality of wicked people, which consists in the leaders as well as in kings and their subjects. It is called by the various names on account of the different actions by which it either exercises force or deceives by fraud. For whenever it creeps with smooth movements, it seizes people by the delights of sensual things. As we read in the Scripture, “Death has entered through our windows.” And I think that this can rightly be understood to refer to our fivefold senses: sight, hearing, smell, touch and taste. And for that reason, the Lord said to the Samaritan woman, “You have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband.” What there is called “husbands,” understand here as the “kings,” by whose governance, as we know, the basic realities of human life are guided and administered. And the beasts appear to have these things in common with us. And what is said there, “And he whom you now have is not your husband,” namely, that she was not living with a legitimate husband, that is, [she was living with] error, here is expressed in this way, “Five have fallen, one remains.” And when it says, “Another has not yet come,” he means that there remains outstanding another part of that same evil body that will succeed the generation that is passing away, and … it will similarly possess the same malignant spirit that we have noted consists in a sevenfold form. For it says that five have fallen, and that one still is, and that another is yet to come, and that makes seven in all.
