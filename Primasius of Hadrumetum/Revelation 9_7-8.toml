By the locusts prepared as horses for war he means those who originate evil teachings. For just as locusts which destroy by their mouth, so also these persons tear asunder by their preaching. It is as we read, “fierce wolves not sparing the flock.” Moreover, they are like horses running around aimlessly and so destroy in such a war many whom they lead astray.… And if false doctrine is indicated by the mouth, by the hair of women he aptly describes their effeminate morals and their souls that are open to seduction. And so the apostle says, “These are those who make their way into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and swayed by various impulses.” By these images he suggests both leaders and those whom they have led astray, so that he shows them to be not only deceitful in their faith but also hateful in their morals. The historical record shows that some of both sexes exhibit [these characteristics]. For women gave their support to many heretics, such as Priscilla and Maximilla to Montanus and Lucilla to Donatus.… It is natural for the teeth of lions not only to mangle but also to give off a natural stench. And since [the heretics] run around like horses to acquire for themselves fleeting fame as preachers, their opinion is rightly regarded as a stench. For in a good sense the apostle said, “We are the good aroma of Christ.” This bad odor, therefore, is derived from their evil doctrine and is by comparison like the odor of a lion’s mouth.
