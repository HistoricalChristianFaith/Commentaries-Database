The hidden secrets of the testimonies foretold concerning Christ and the church are now revealed. [The seven angels with the seven plagues] are the church against which a hostile portion rebelled through unending treacheries. Therefore it says that plagues come out, either for the defense of the saints in whom the Lord Christ earlier had suffered abuse, as he said to Paul, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” or, as James noted, the time of judgment begins with the household of God. To be sure, persons will be scourged in a twofold manner, so that the just God might punish their sins, as in the case of Pharaoh, or that he might test their virtues by a greater trial, as in the case of Job. And therefore we read concerning him, “The Lord has tested me, as gold that passes through fire; I have kept his ways, and I have not departed from the commandments of his lips.” The number of the angels and the plagues prefigures the universal extent of the consummation, as it says often in Leviticus, “I will smite you with seven plagues.” “They are clothed in pure white linen.” Mortification is often indicated by a linen garment. If, then, the blameless judgments of God are recognized in that which is white, the sense is aptly applied also to these pure linen garments, so that those who are mortified are made snow-white by this whiteness, when they behold the glory of God at the revelation of his judgments. “They were girded with golden girdles.” Scripture teaches that gold signifies wisdom, as it says, “Receive wisdom as gold.” And it is rightly around the breast, where according to the law the priest is often commanded to wear the logium, that is, what is intellectual, so that his mind is well aware of divine things and does not despise them but rather praises the divine judgments and by the brightness of the gold on him also urges others to praise them unhesitatingly.
