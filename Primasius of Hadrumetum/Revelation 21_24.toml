With these words it is to be understood that the Lamb himself who then will be the life of the citizens [of the heavenly city] is the way for those who are underway [toward the heavenly city]. For it is necessary that whatever dignity they will have received is attributed through praise to the honor of him who was the giver. Here [the passage] is speaking of spiritual kings of whom we read, “He is powerful and gives strength to our kings and has exalted the horn of his Christ.”
