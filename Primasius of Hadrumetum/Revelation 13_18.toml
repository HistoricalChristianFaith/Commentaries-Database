This calls for wisdom. Whoever has understanding, let him reckon the number of the beast, for the number of the beast, it says, is that of a man. Let us reckon the number that is to be received, so that in the number we might also learn the name and the mark. And the number, it says, is 666, which we will reckon according to the Greek, especially since he was writing to Asia and said according to the manner of their own language, “I am the alpha and the omega.” Having already described as much as he could the fraudulence of the adversarial party by which the devil attempts to usurp for himself the honor of deity that he does not merit, so that he might exhibit the antichrist who is the opposite to divine honor, he instructs us to investigate the character of the beast, whether by the mark or by the number of his name, that is, of the will and the work of that most wicked beast. The name is ΑΝΤΕΜΟΣ, which, if you compute the numbers that correspond to these Greek letters, fulfills the number 666 (I + L + CCC + V + XL + LXX + CC). This name is interpreted as “contrary to honor,” and so he is said to be contrary to that honor that belongs to God alone, and for this reason he is said to be inept, insolent and inconstant, for no honor pertains to him, but only anathema. And so through the number a name is found and from the name a number is computed, and from the interpretation of this name the character of his works is learned. There is another name that gives the sum of the same number and that might rightfully be advanced, and that is ΑΡΝΟΥΜΕ, which also renders 666 (I + C + L + LXX + CCCC + XL + V). The interpretation of this is “I deny.” And it is not surprising that the antichrist is worthy of this name, that is, of denial, since the name of belief is proper to Christ, as he himself indicated, saying, “This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent,” and also, “You believe in God, believe also in me.” And so, whether one would speak of ΑΝΤΕΜΟΣ, that is, “contrary to honor,” or ΑΡΝΟΥΜΕ, that is, “I deny,” either can aptly refer to the antichrist, so that as through two parts of speech, that of the name and that of the word itself, both the character of his person and the severity of his work is suggested.
