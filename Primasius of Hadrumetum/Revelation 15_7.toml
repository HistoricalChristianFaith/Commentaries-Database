Previously [the seer] mentioned seven angels with the same number of bowls containing the prayers of the saints. Now he says that they are full of the wrath of God. The very same bowls are said to hold both the sweetness of supplication and the wrath of destruction, for [prayers] are poured out from the saints for the coming of the kingdom of God, at which time the judgments of God will no longer be hidden as in an abyss but will be open as in bowls. Moreover, they will bring salvation to the righteous but will inflict ruin upon the impious, as the apostle says, “For we are the good aroma of Christ among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to some a fragrance of death to death.” For if it was said of our Lord, “Behold, this [child] is set for the ruin and resurrection of many,” why would it be surprising were the bowls to bring sweetness to the righteous but inflict the vengeance of the plagues upon the impious.
