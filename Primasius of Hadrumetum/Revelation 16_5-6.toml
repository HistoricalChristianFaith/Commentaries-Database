The angels of the waters are the messengers of the peoples who by an affection of the heart raise up together loud praises to God.… To be sure, both the Jews and the nations have in a bodily manner shed the blood of the saints, which the Lord says must be exacted “from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zachariah.” However, this plague might also be interpreted as a plague of that blindness so that they might even recognize that they have shed the blood of the prophets. For while they were abusing them [the prophets], they turned their minds to other things. It is as though he said, whoever understood the spiritual law in a fleshly way, they are justly handed over to the corruptions of the flesh and of blood when both the sins and the punishment for sins is recognized. Therefore, the apostle said, “For they did not receive the love of truth so that they might be saved; therefore, God shall send upon them a work of error to make them believe what is false, so that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had consented to iniquity.”
