“He who conquers shall not be hurt by the second death.” Having eaten of the forbidden tree, [Adam] procured this [death] for posterity. However, watering the tree of the cross by the water and blood which flowed from the holy place of his side, Christ caused the firstfruits of salvation to sprout up where he knew the original evil had arisen, saying, “Rejoice, I have overcome the world.” Thus, if anyone conquers, he will conquer in him.
