In the song of Tobit we read, “All your walls will be precious stones,” and also in Isaiah, “Behold, I will set your stones in order and lay your foundations with sapphires, and I will place jasper for your buttresses, and I will put your gates in formed stones, and all your borders will be in precious stones.” And as though explaining what he had said, lest you think materially of an earthly edifice, he added, “All your sons will be taught by the Lord, and there shall be great peace for your children.” The blessed Paul also concurs with these thoughts: “Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure is joined together and grows into a holy temple in the Lord.” … Having said that the foundation was from every precious stone, he now names them in turn.… By the images of all these stones the beauty and support of the virtues are signified by which each one of the saints is spiritually decorated. Moreover, the entire city itself is described as adorned with these same stones, both in their strength and in the elegance of their variety.
