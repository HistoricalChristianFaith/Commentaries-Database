The hail represents the wrath of [God’s] revenge, of which we read, “The wrath of the Lord descends as hail.” The Lord desires to protect his followers from this, for he says through the apostle, “[Jesus] delivers us from the wrath to come.” Nor is it without reason that he mentions the weight of a talent. For [the punishment] inflicted on each person by the equity of the divine judgment is due to a diversity of sins. Among the Greeks the talent is regarded as a certain weight and among the Romans as a certain different weight. Indeed, some things are sins, while other things are the punishments, and yet other things are both sins and punishments.… In this passage the blaspheming of God for the hail is recognized to be both sin and the punishment of sin by which the impious are so blinded that they do not come to their senses even when corrected, and so by these punishments [they] become even worse and more demented.
