We understand the angel coming down from heaven to be our Lord, Jesus Christ, who is called the angel of great counsel. He visited the region of those who are mortal, for as one who is stronger he wished to bind the strong one, so that he might make vessels of mercy out of those who had earlier been vessels of wrath. And he accomplished this through that work that he had promised before when he said, “No one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his wares, unless he first binds the strong man,” that is, the devil. The key of the bottomless pit is the depth of the divine judgments, for “the judgments of God are a great deep.” Indeed, to him alone is it known who from the mass of sinners are to be called out into the full number of the elect.
