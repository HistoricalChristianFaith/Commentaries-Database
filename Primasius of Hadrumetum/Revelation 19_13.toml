If no one is allowed to know his name, why is he now openly called the “Word of God”? When we read, “No one has ascended into heaven, but he who has descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven,” we are to understand that whoever of his members will ascend is allowed to ascend in the Head himself and through him. By promising this to his members, he has granted them hope, and by fulfilling this, he will give to them the possibility [to receive this]. So here, the Son alone is said to know what is allowed to his bride to know in him, through whom and in whom the church is instructed. In speaking of the robe sprinkled with blood, it is indicating the tokens of his passion, whether this be in the Head himself or in his body, which is the church. For this reason, the apostle teaches the Hebrews that from the beginning in the animal sacrifices demanded by the law there was no remission of sins with the shedding of blood. Concerning the church he says, “that in my flesh I might complete what is lacking in Christ’s sufferings,” remembering the words which he heard, “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?” For whatever the church suffers, Christ also truly suffers, and of him Paul says, “he suffered once to take away the sins of many,” however, he suffers frequently in his members. Isaiah spoke of the appearance of this robe in this way, “Who is this that comes from Edom, in crimsoned garments from Bozrah? He is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength. It is I who speaks righteousness and who am a fighter for salvation. Why then is your garment red, and your apparel as though freshly trodden in a winepress? I alone have trodden the winepress, and from the peoples no one was with me.”
