As above, in angels the church is recognized to be “heaven,” and it is proper to both to rejoice harmoniously in the Lord, for people are said to be the associates of angels and in Christ the angels serve the human nature. But there follows, “Woe to you, O earth and sea.” Just as there was exultation for those who are redeemed, there is lamentation for those who are perishing. Therefore, Ezekiel said that he saw a book having written within a lament, a song and a woe. In the lament he refers to the wailing of the penitent; in the song he refers to the joyfulness of the saints; in the woe he properly manifests the condemnation of the wicked. It is to these last that here [John] alludes when he says, “Woe to you, earth and sea and the rest, for he knows that there is little time left to him.” And so, moved by an unconquered power he confesses to the Lord and says, “Have you come to destroy us before the time.”
