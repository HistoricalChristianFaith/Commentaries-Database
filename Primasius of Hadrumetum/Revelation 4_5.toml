In the voices and thunder the proclamation of the gospel is indicated, while the lightning signifies the miraculous signs, as we read in the Gospel, “They went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs which followed.” And again: “The voice of your thunder was in the whirlwind, and your lightning illumined the whole world.” For, as though from the clouds, the world, trembling by the thunderous commandments and astonishing miracles, was brought to fear and made to believe.

These seven lamps are the seven spirits of God. Even if he had not explained it, we would have properly understood these seven lamps to represent the Holy Spirit. For we know that at the beginning he had illuminated the apostles in the form of fiery tongues, and [we are aware] of his sevenfold operation. How much more clear is it, when now he himself adds, “which are the seven spirits of God.” But where is the Holy Spirit more properly said to be present than at the time of baptism, when we believe that each one of the faithful have properly received him.
