They will not hunger because they will feed upon living bread, for he said, “I am the living bread which came down from heaven.” Neither will they thirst, because they will drink from a cup so splendid as to enact in them the truth he spoke: “Whoever believes in me will never thirst”; and again: “Whoever drinks from the water I give him will receive in himself a fountain of water springing up to eternal life.” Neither will the sun strike them, nor will they be burned by the deadly fire of its heat. God made a similar promise to his church through Isaiah, saying that he would be “a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat.” Here he declares the purity of his sacraments to thrive in his own and that none of them will be oppressed by the heat of temptation. “For the Lamb in the midst of the throne governs them.” Previously it had said that the Lamb seated on the throne received the scroll, but now it says that the Lamb in the midst of the throne governs them. It does so to teach that there is one throne for the Father and for the Son, since the Father is in the Son and the Son is in the Father, that is, in the midst of the church, which the one, whole, triune God inhabits through faith. - "Commentary on the Apocalypse 2.7"
