The voice from heaven is the command of God, who breathes into the heart of the church and orders her to receive from the open book that which the church is to preach before the future peace. For it seems to us that to accept the open book from the hand of the angel is to understand the truth of the law and the prophets, which has been made manifest in Christ. And for that reason it says that [the church] should take the open book, which is no longer, as above, the sealed [book]. “For Christ is the end of the law unto righteousness for everyone who believes.” Christ, who is the truth, wished then to be born from the earth, that is, from Mary, when “Righteousness looked down from heaven.” That is why I think that it is said, “I heard a voice from heaven speaking with me,” just as [Christ] himself said, “I am the Beginning who is also speaking to you.”
