[He saw] the water of baptism made holy by the fire of the Holy Spirit. Or, in view of the character of fire, this water has been made red through martyrdom. For this reason we read, “The kiln tests the clay vessels, and the trial of tribulation the righteous.” “And I saw those standing upon [the sea] who had conquered the beast and his image.” The term standing upon10 indicates that they are immoveable in the faith. The psalm describes them in virtually the same way. For after it says, “who made by understanding the heavens,” indicating no doubt those who are spiritual and fully enjoy the clear understanding of the heavenly truth, it adds, “who founded the earth upon the waters,” namely, those who are immoveable upon their baptism. And although they seem to be nourished by milk, nonetheless they are not carried about “by every wind of doctrine.” And so here they are said to conquer the beast and his image. [The harps] refer to their hearts, which are devoted to the praise [of God] and which are in full harmony through the harmonious truth of the two Testaments. Or this image speaks of the flesh of the passion, which is extended upon the wood, where not only the sound of the voice but also the effect of a good work is signified. For this reason he includes also mention of that great man, Moses, to whom God bears witness, saying, “My servant, Moses, who is faithful in all my house.”
