It is possible to interpret the “earth” here to refer to the church, as in the psalm, “He who set the earth on its foundations, so that it should never be shaken.” That is, he [set the earth] on the saints whose prayers and teachings and the working of salvation [which they have received] dispels the uncovered intrigues of the enemy. However, it would be better to interpret the “earth” to be the human nature in Christ, for it is itself the “truth” that “has sprung up from the earth,” and that always appears before the face of God and so, as the apostle says, “intercedes for us.” When it swallowed death, which it took to itself, this earth is said to have opened its mouth when it gulped down the author of death by the abundance of its own life. And no less was he swallowed when Christ taught sitting upon the mountain and opening his mouth gave greater precepts to his disciples, “abolishing the law with its commandments and ordinances.”
