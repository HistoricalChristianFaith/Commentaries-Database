“The city was from pure gold, similar to pure glass.” He uses this strange analogy so that in all metaphors he might confer a unique dignity upon the one true stone, which is Christ, and so teach that all things serve him. For who does not know that gold is much different from glass and differs from it also in color? And although it is common that the church is symbolized by gold since it is often depicted by golden lampstands and bowls on account of its worship of Wisdom, nonetheless that pure gold is compared to pure glass is somewhat puzzling. I think the significance of this is given in what the apostle said, “Do not pronounce judgment before the time until the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of [our] hearts.” For with glass nothing is seen on the outside that does not exist on the inside. And so, this book in announcing that time when the thoughts of each one will be openly declared to each other, boldly compares gold with glass. Whatever at that time will be in the thoughts of the saints shall shine with the adornment of the virtue of Wisdom.… But now, however much one might excel in virtue, “no one knows the thoughts of man except the spirit of the man which is in him.”
