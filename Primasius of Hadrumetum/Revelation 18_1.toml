This angel possesses great power. For it is speaking of the destruction of the world’s wisdom, which is also signified by the destruction of Jericho, and of the ruin of the earthly kingdom. By indicating that a stronger one has come against the strong one in order to expel the false appearance of truth and by covering over the faintness of the world’s wisdom, it gives witness that now the true light of wisdom has come. Moreover, to the wise of this world and to the kings of the earth who rely upon their own strength it further demonstrates that [this light] is unconquered in both power and wisdom.… I think that this signifies the coming of our Lord, Jesus Christ, who in Isaiah is called the angel of great counsel. In his first advent, he said, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand,” and brought to naught the work of worldly power. And the earth was made bright by his splendor, for he is himself “the true Light that enlightens everyone coming into this world.”
