They were confessing with a “loud voice,” that is, with a deep devotion and unceasing praise. “Upon the throne,” that is, the Father and the Son reign in the Church, with the Holy Spirit ruling equally with them. There is here such an order to the words, “To our God and to the Lamb who sits upon the throne belongs salvation.” We find a similar manner of speaking in the Gospel, “That they might know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent.” This is as though he said, “That they might know you and Jesus Christ whom you have sent, the one true God.” In the one throne is indicated the power of one nature. However, in the name of the Lamb the personal character of the Father and the Son is designated, just as when the Holy Spirit is alone named, the Father and the Son are there also to be understood. For we read in the Acts of the Apostles, “Take heed to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers,” and it immediately adds, “to rule the church of God which he obtained by his own blood.” Now, we know that no one has poured out their blood for us except the person of Christ. And so it is sufficiently clear that whenever one alone is named, the entire Trinity is to be understood.

Whatever this multitude might be, by expressing these names he indicates the universal church.… Through the naming of these seven virtues, we are exhorted to inquire after the reason why he named those things here in which God desires his church to participate. It is for this reason, that when these [virtues] are given to God in praise, they might confess that they have received each of them from him. For we ought not consider that God alone is capable of the [virtues] named here, but that he has found them worthy also to give to the faithful. We rejoice that the church of Christ is allowed to participate in all of these good things: blessing, glory, wisdom, thanksgiving, honor, power and might. It does not mention omnipotence or majesty or eternity, for God alone always rightly possesses these things. But in these seven we recognize all those virtues that could be granted to the faithful from him who gave them power to become sons of God. And so, if we have acquired any of these good things, we shall know with certainly that we have them by the generosity of God.
