He is speaking again of every kingdom of the world, which just above he indicated in the kings and their subjects. “The kings receive power with the beast for one hour.” Here the hour is to be interpreted as referring to the time from the passion of the Lord, as the apostolic voice says, “It is the last hour.” Therefore, until all the future is fulfilled, it says that they have not yet received the kingdom. For although they indeed now rule over many, yet the insane power of that arrogance will be more intense when it also deceives many by signs.
