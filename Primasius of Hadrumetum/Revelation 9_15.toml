“The four angels were released” indicates the beginning of the persecution.… He indicates by an apt expression the four times during which the persecution will be continuing, that is, [he indicates] three years and six months. He said “for the hour, the day, the month, and the year,” since a day is gradually filled with hours, and months with days, and finally years with months. It says that they were “prepared” in order to indicate the character of the devil and his angels. For they entangle themselves in ongoing hostilities against the church and constantly desire to do it harm. However, divine power restrains them, lest they wreak havoc as much as they want. Rightly did he previously say that the locusts were similar to horses arrayed for battle, for now when he says that the angels were loosed, he says that he saw horses.
