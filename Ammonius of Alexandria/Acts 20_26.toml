“I am clean of the blood of all.” … The false teacher is guilty of the souls that receive his teaching, as if he had poured out their blood, which is our life. By saying “I am clean,” he means, “I give witness that my teaching has deprived none of life everlasting but that it sets forth a heavenly kingdom. Anyone, therefore, not persuaded by me should consider himself as his own murderer, for I am innocent of the blood of all who hear me and do not believe.”
