Sometimes our Savior said “amen” once, at other times twice, when he wished to confirm what he was saying. This is a Hebrew manner of speaking, revealing that which was taking place, such as that “you have been found trustworthy” so as to see “the heavens opened,” and so on. He says that it is possible to see the heavens opened not in a manner open to the senses but only by a mind observing the angels coming to serve Jesus. The word amen is used instead of “really and truthfully” and is more fitting here.
