In the writers of ancient stories you can find that Jove, even though he was a man, made himself a god and said that he was a god, just as many Roman and Macedonian kings styled themselves gods. There one ought to believe in what was said long ago about this, namely, that some were misled and called certain persons gods. Consequently these too were misled in regard to Barnabas and Paul.… Barnabas’s followers, in order to close their mouths and to instruct them gently, kept saying, “No one has ever seen God.” We are what we look like, not gods but human. In Jesus alone it happened that he was God and man at the same time for the principle of union. But in this case, these were only men who performed miracles through the Holy Spirit.
