After they realized that their bad will had caused them to fall into dangers, they began to believe Paul by thinking that the appropriate words of the righteous were more effective for their salvation than the fate in danger, which has no name. In fact, if they had believed in fate, like the Gentiles, after despising the words of that pious man, they would have allowed the sailors to escape by saying, “Let them go. This has nothing to do with our salvation.” But they did not speak nor act so foolishly, neither were they deceived or enticed by ignorance. Therefore, based on these facts, many must reject their opinion about fate and fortune.
