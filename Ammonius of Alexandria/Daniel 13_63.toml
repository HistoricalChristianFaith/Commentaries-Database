This is the text of the story, but an allegory can also be drawn from the letter. Hilkiah in fact means “alteration of God” or “praise of God.” Susanna means “their praise” or “apostolic lily.” Joakim, “disposition of the Lord” or “praise of the Lord.” Daniel, “judgment of God” and “God is judge.” When, therefore, the joy of the souls of the church, who are pleasing to God—that is, the apostolic lily, the sweet-smelling flower, the spiritual aroma, the daughter of Hilkiah who learned from her parents to act according to the tradition of the prophets (who are the food and the inheritance of Israel)—unites with Christ, the spiritual spouse, who is Joakim, the spiritual spouse of the church—the one who prepares for the faithful the goods of the world to come, announcing the kingdom of heaven and making them participants of the Holy Spirit (who is worthy of praise forever, amen)—then the godless judges of the people will suddenly arise. If, however, they cannot corrupt her soul with forbidden dogma, killing it (this is in fact the death of the soul), then they give the body over to the senseless, unreasoning mob to be sacrificed. And if God permits the suffering of the spouse, he places the crown of martyrdom on her. And if instead he frees her from the hands of her enemies, then also he honors her, keeping her near himself. Those who plot against her are in any case condemned to Gehenna by God’s just judgment, pronounced over them by Daniel, whose name is translated “judgment of God.” The old men have no name, like the rich man spoken of by Luke, who did not pity Lazarus’s sores.
