As if in a court of law, it is said to the devil, “Granted, you have killed everyone else in the human race because they were sinners. But why did you kill the Lord?” The time of sojourning on earth is the “judgment of the world,” since Christ is about to justify humanity and to remove the arrogance of the devil. The judgment he speaks of here then is not the condemnation of the human race. Rather, Christ’s death justifies all humanity against the devil, who is the one who is under judgment because he had wronged the world.
