Since Satan saw Judas wishing to betray the Lord and hastening to do this, then “he entered him.” It is one thing for the devil to assail someone and quite another for the devil to enter him, just as it is one thing to strike someone outwardly and quite a different matter to hit someone’s vital organ or thrust a sword into him.
