“He took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all, he broke it and began to eat.” Since Paul saw that they had believed out of necessity and that the time was not opportune to announce Christ to them, as they were broken in spirit and uncertain, he teaches them some piety, namely, not to break bread before giving thanks to the one God, and then to eat. And he teaches us the same, and the way of celebrating Eucharist appears to be this: “We give thanks to you, God, because you deigned to allow us to live until now, without eating bread. Therefore giving glory to you, we break bread for sustenance.”
