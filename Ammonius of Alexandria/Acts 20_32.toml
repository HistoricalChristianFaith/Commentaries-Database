He demonstrates obscurely and secretly that the Father, who is God, and his Son Jesus, the God-Word, are one. He does not speak in the plural “to those capable,” but with a unifying name he indicates the singular being of both by saying “to the one capable.” Thus we know, from what Paul says in preparing the churches of Asia, that there is one being of both Father and Son and that they are and subsist as two, not according to mere names but in truth.
