“He, however, shook off the creature into the fire.” The faithful are superior to any scheme, either if it is planned by people or beasts, and they are similar to gods, as Scripture says: “I say, ‘You are gods; nevertheless, you shall die,’ because of infidelity, ‘like mortals.’ ” So the barbarians, seeing that [Paul] did not die but escaped from certain death, considered him to be a god, as they used to consider anyone that performed miracles to be a god. And in this manner they named their ancient gods, either because of the excellence of their strength, which they saw to be superior to theirs, as in the case of Hercules, son of Semele, or because of their magical arts, which raised the admiration of the spectators, as in the case of Simon in Samaria.
