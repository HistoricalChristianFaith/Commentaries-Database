Peter drags the dragnet with the others, bringing the catch to Christ. The hundred can be understood to mean the fullness of the Gentiles. The fifty refers to the elect of Israel who have been saved. And the three set oneâ€™s mind on the revelation of the holy Trinity, to whose glory the life of the believers who were caught in the dragnet is naturally connected.
