“Like the Son of man.” He foresees the incarnation of the Only Begotten and calls him the Son of man, the one who was to be born of holy Mary and made human. “And my insides churned.” Since life is compared with a wheel, the one who lives among the saints, that is, the soul being directed in this life, ought to leave behind the evils here below and ought to bring up good things, that is, good deeds, from the earthly realm to the sublime and heavenly.
