The Jews call the faith in Christ a heresy, because “everywhere it is spoken against.” You see, the Jews themselves testify that Christ is preached everywhere, even though not all receive this preaching, as the text says, but some of the Jews or the Gentiles speak against it, while the heretics, in a different way, do not conform to the true faith. In fact, it was necessary that there be heresies, so that the elected might appear, and all might fulfill what had been predicted by the prophet Simeon about Christ: “This child is destined for the falling and the rising of many in Israel, and to be a sign that will be opposed.”
