He has struck his adversaries, he has broken the teeth of sinners; indeed, so that he may heal them again: “I will strike [he said], and again I will heal.” He has broken the teeth of sinners, or, in other words, the wicked words and carnal actions, because he desires to destroy them in the inmost parts. Perhaps he has called those same ones adversaries and sinners: since he has broken the teeth of all sinners who turned against Christ, but especially the Jews on account of unfaithfulness; those teeth about which in another psalm he says, “Those who devour my people as bread, and they do not call on the Lord.” He broke these teeth … when he arose from the dead.
