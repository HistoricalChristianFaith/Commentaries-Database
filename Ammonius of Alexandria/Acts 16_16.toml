It should be noted that Christ was announced through demons, in which the Gentiles were believing. It was also these that gave witness and said that the apostles were servants of God, that their preaching was saving and that Jesus was God and not a mere man. That was the proclamation of the ones concerning Paul and Silas.â€¦ After the demon had repeatedly testified that the message of the apostles was saving, Paul ordered him to come out in order to demonstrate to those who believed him, that every believer was stronger than the demon, and to show that each had power both to allow the demon to stay as one subject to the believer and to release him. See how powerful the words of the servants of Christ were: as soon as they gave a command, the demons came out.
