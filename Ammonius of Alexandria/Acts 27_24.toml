“God has granted safety to all,” so that what Homer says appears to be false:
“I say that no one can avoid his fate, neither good man nor bad, even though he be noble.” And this means that it is impossible to escape the death that Fate establishes at the moment of birth. Therefore, without Paul, all would have died, if God had not granted life to them out of respect for the righteous. So if it had been sanctioned that all would have died, as it surely appears, he would have died, he that had not eaten for fourteen days and then had been shipwrecked: indeed those false words say, “neither good man nor bad,” so that it was necessary that both the good and the bad died together, being liable together to the evident danger of death. On the contrary, however, Scripture says that the righteous was saved from the evident danger, even though anyone else would have died in that circumstance. God thought it opportune that he go to Rome; God could have placed him in Rome, after taking him from Jerusalem through an angel, as he had put Habakkuk, after he took him from Judea, in Babylon, by the den of lions where Daniel was.9 But he did not do so, and, nevertheless, showed a miraculous event by saving Paul and his companions. He granted their souls to him, so that he might have benevolence for his brothers, but not the ship and its cargo, because the pious has no consideration for earthly things, nor is grieved by their loss. Here the impious live thanks to the pious; but sometimes the opposite happens, so that the impious dies before his time because of his iniquity, according to the command of God, as Ecclesiastes says, “Be not wicked, and be not stubborn, lest you die before your time.” I think that, thanks to God, these things happen in this way. Everything is possible for the one who believes,11 but he did not obtain salvation for his companions through faith or prayers but because he believed that what had been said to him would be.
