It must be noted that the prophets do not know everything but only what the Holy Spirit reveals to them. So see how Paul, like a prophet, foretells “that chains and afflictions await me,” and that the Ephesians will never see him again and that there will arise among them heretics and some of bad faith, and yet about the first of these he confesses not to know what exactly their end shall be. So although the Lord revealed to him everything else, this one thing he hid from him, namely, what would happen to him after the chains and afflictions, lest, being puffed up and knowing that everything would arrive at such a point, [Paul] fail out of negligence. Instead, so that he, dreading the weakness of the flesh, would beg God to deliver him from trials, the Spirit left this end unclear for him.
