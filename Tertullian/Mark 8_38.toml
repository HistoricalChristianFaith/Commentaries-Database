The faithful are not ashamed that the Son of God was crucified. Hence they are shameless in a good sense through their contempt of shame, and foolish in a happy sense. The crucifixion was indeed a shameful event, viewed humanly. Yes, the Son of God died! This is to be believed precisely amid its being an offense to humanity. The Son was buried!24 He rose from the dead! This fact is made all the more poignant by seeming all the more absurd. But how could any of this be true if he himself was not truly the One he made himself known to be?

If I avoid suffering, I am ashamed to confess: “Blessed are they who suffer persecution for my name’s sake.” Unhappy, therefore, are they who, by running away, refuse to suffer as God at times requires. “He who shall endure to the end shall be saved.” How then, when you ask me to flee, would I be enduring to the end?

But "whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed," says He, "in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens."

I am safe, if I am not ashamed of my Lord. "Whosoever," says He, "shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed." Other matters for shame find I none which can prove me to be shameless in a good sense, and foolish in a happy one, by my own contempt of shame.

How will he confess, fleeing? How flee, confessing? "Of him who shall be ashamed of Me, will I also be ashamed before My Father." If I avoid suffering, I am ashamed to confess.
