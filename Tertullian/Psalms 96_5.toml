True, Scripture says, “Make no mention of the name other gods, neither let it be heard out of your mouth.” What it stipulates is that we should not call them gods. For in the first part of the law it says, “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain,” that is, apply it to an idol. So anyone who honors an idol with the name of God falls into idolatry. If I am compelled to mention gods, I must add something to show that I do not call them gods. Scripture uses the name “gods” but adds “their” or “of the pagans,” as when David, having used the name “gods,” says “but the gods of the pagans are demons.”
