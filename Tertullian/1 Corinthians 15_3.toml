That is, in the secret inner recess which is hidden in the earth, and enclosed by the earth, and superimposed on the abysmal depths which lie still lower down. Now although Christ is God, yet, being also man, "He died according to the Scriptures".
Testifies that "He died according to the Scriptures".
For even the apostle, to his declaration-which he makes not without feeling the weight of it-that "Christ died "immediately adds, "according to the Scriptures".
For the Son, therefore, to die, amounted to His being forsaken by the Father. The Son, then, both dies and rises again, according to the Scriptures.
