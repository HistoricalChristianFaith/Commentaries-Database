To begin with, that speech, wont to be cast in our teeth, "I have nothing else whereby to live," may be more severely retorted, "You have, then, whereby to live? If by your own laws, what have you to do with God? " Then, as to the argument they have the hardihood to bring even from the Scriptures, "that the apostle has said, `As each has been found, so let him persevere.'" We may all, therefore, persevere in sins, as the result of that interpretation! for there is not any one of us who has not been found asa sinner, since no other cause was the source of Christ's descent than that of setting sinners free.
