Thus, in the present instance, we have the Spirit giving life to the flesh, which has been subdued by death. For “the hour,” he says, “is coming, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.” Now, what is “the dead” but the flesh? And what is “the voice of God” but the Word? And what is the Word but the Spirit, who shall justly raise the flesh that he had once himself become and that too from death, which he himself suffered, and from the grave, which he himself once entered?
