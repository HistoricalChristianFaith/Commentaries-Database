Now, if none other but the Creator shall be found to execute judgment, it follows that only He, who has determined on the cessation of the law, shall be able to condemn the defenders of the law; and what, if he also affirms the law in that portion of it where it ought (to be permanent)? "For "says he, "all the law is fulfilled in you by this: `Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.' ".
