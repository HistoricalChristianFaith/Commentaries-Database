Baptism is not rashly to be administered.… Similarly, this precept is rather to be looked at carefully.… “Lay not hands easily on any; share not other men’s sins.”

On the contrary, this precept is rather to be looked at carefully: "Give not the holy thing to the dogs, nor cast your pearls before swine; " and, "Lay not hands easily on any; share not other men's sins." If Philip so "easily" baptized the chamberlain, let us reflect that a manifest and conspicuous evidence that the Lord deemed him worthy had been interposed.

Again to Timotheus: "Lay hands on no one hastily, nor communicate with others' sins." Again to the Ephesians: "Be not, then, partners with them: for ye were at one time darkness.
