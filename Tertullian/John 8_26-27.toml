By reason of the inseparability of the two it was impossible for one of them to be either acknowledged or unknown without the other. “He who sent me,” says Jesus, “is true; and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.” And the Scripture narrative goes on to explain in a simple way that “they did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father,” although they certainly ought to have known that the Father’s words were uttered in the Son, because they read in Jeremiah, “And the Lord said to me, see, I have put my words in your mouth.”
