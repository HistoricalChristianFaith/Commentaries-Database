Paul found in existence, to which he yielded his belief, and with which he so earnestly wished his own to agree, that he actually on that account went up to Jerusalem to know and consult the apostles, "lest he should run, or had been running in vain; ".
when even the apostle himself had some suspicion that he might have run, and be still running, in vain.
