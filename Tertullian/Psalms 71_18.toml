Hear now also the Son’s statements about the Father: “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor.” He speaks of himself likewise to the Father in the psalm: “Forsake me not, until I have declared the might of your arm to all the generations that are to come.” Also with the same substance in another psalm: “O Lord, how many are they that trouble me!” But almost all the psalms that prophesy of the person of Christ, represent the Son as conversing with the Father—that is, represent Christ [as speaking] to God. Observe also the Spirit speaking of the Father and the Son, in the character of a third person: “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.” Likewise in the words of Isaiah: “Thus says the Lord to the Lord my anointed.”
