But if ye shall have forgiven any, so (do) I; for I, too, if I have forgiven ought, have forgiven in the person of Christ, lest we be overreached by Satan, since we are not ignorant of his injections." What (reference) is understood here to the fornicator? what to the contaminator of his father's bed? what to the Christian who had overstepped the shamelessness of heathens?-since, of course, he would have absolved by a special pardon one whom he had condemned by a special anger.
