Do you hesitate about your business and professions for the sake of your children and parents? It has been demonstrated to us in Scripture that any too dear relations, crafts and trades are to be quite left behind for the Lord’s sake. For James and John, called by the Lord, immediately leave quite behind both father and ship. Matthew is roused from the tollbooth. Even burying a father was too tardy a business for faith! None of those whom the Lord chose to him said, “I have no means to live.”
