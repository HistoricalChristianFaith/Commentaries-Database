For a certain woman had exclaimed, "Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked!".
"A (certain) mother of the company exclaims, `Blessed is the womb that bare Thee, and the paps which Thou hast sucked; 'but the Lord said, `Yea, rather, blessed are they that hear the word of God, and keep it.'".
It was in just the same sense, indeed, that He also replied to that exclamation (of a certain woman), not denying His mother's "womb and paps "but designating those as more "blessed who hear the word of God."
