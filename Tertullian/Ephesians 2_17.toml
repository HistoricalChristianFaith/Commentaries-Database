Therefore the Spirit and the Gospel will be found in the Christ, who was fore trusted, because foretold. Again, "the Father of glory".
"When, therefore, He came and preached peace to them that were near and to them which were afar off "we both obtained "access to the Father "being "now no more strangers and foreigners, but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God "(even of Him from whom, as we have shown above, we were aliens, and placed far off), "built upon the foundation of the apostles"
