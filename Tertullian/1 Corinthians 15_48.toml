"As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly." Such (does he mean), in substance; or first of all in training, and afterwards in the dignity and worth which that training aimed at acquiring? Not in substance, however, by any means will the earthy and the heavenly be separated, designated as they have been by the apostle once for all, as men.
