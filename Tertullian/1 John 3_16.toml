John, in fact, exhorts us to lay down our lives even for our brethren. Too, that we may be able to quench the darts of the devil, when doubtless we resist him, and sustain his assaults in their utmost force. Accordingly John also teaches that we must lay down our lives for the brethren.

John tells us that we must be ready to lay down our lives for our friends. If that is true, how much more should we be ready to lay them down for Christ?
