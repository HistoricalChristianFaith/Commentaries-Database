Again, when He indicates to us that the devil is "the thief," whose hour at the very beginning of the world, if man had known, he would never have been broken in upon by him, He warns us "to be ready," for this reason, because "we know not the hour when the Son of man shall come" -not as if He were Himself the thief, but rather as being the judge of those who prepared not themselves, and used no precaution against the thief.
