Therefore as we have shown above that the coming cessation of the old law and of the carnal circumcision was declared, so, too, the observance of the new law and the spiritual circumcision has shone out into the voluntary obediences of peace. For “a people,” he says, “whom I did not know has served me; in obedience of the ear it has obeyed me.” Prophets made the announcement. But what is the people which was ignorant of God, but ours, who in days bygone did not know God? And who, in the hearing of the ear, paid attention to him, but we, who, forsaking idols, have been converted to God?
