Since, therefore, shall then be accomplished the word which was written by the Creator, "O death, where is thy victory"-or thy struggle? "O death, where is thy sting? " -written, I say, by the Creator, for He wrote them by His prophet -to Him will belong the gift, that is, the kingdom, who proclaimed the word which is to be accomplished in the kingdom.

Now, if the dominion of death operates only in the dissolution of the flesh, in like manner death's contrary, life, ought to produce the contrary effect, even the restoration of the flesh; so that, just as death had swallowed it up in its strength, it also, after this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear the challenge pronounced against it: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? " For in this way "grace shall there much more abound, where sin once abounded.
