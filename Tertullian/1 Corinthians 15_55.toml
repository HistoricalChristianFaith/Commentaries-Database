"O death, where is thy sting? ".
And to none other God does he tell us that "thanks "are due, for having enabled us to achieve "the victory "even over death, than to Him from whom he received the very expression.
Now, if the dominion of death operates only in the dissolution of the flesh, in like manner death's contrary, life, ought to produce the contrary effect, even the restoration of the flesh; so that, just as death had swallowed it up in its strength, it also, after this mortal was swallowed up of immortality, may hear the challenge pronounced against it: "O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? "
