The Lord himself comes to a trial with “the elders and rulers of the people,” as Isaiah predicted. And then he fulfilled all that had been written of his passion. At that time “the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things; the kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers gathered themselves together against the Lord and against his Christ.” The heathen were Pilate and the Romans; the people were the tribes of Israel; the kings were represented in Herod and the rulers in the chief priests. When, indeed, he was sent to Herod gratuitously by Pilate, the words of Hosea were accomplished, for he had prophesied of Christ, “And they shall carry him bound as a present to the king.”
