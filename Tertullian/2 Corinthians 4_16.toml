Does he here speak? Of that which we are now living? Then how is it, that in the words which follow he exhorts us not to the things which are seen and are temporal, but to those which are not seen and are eternal.
He says, too, that "our outward man perishes".
not meaning by an eternal perdition after death, but by labours and sufferings, in reference to which he previously said, "For which cause we will not faint.".
It is yet designated by the same apostle as "the outward man".
Well, then, heresies finding that the apostle had mentioned two "men"-"the inner man "that is, the soul, and "the outward man "that is, the flesh-awarded salvation to the soul or inward man, and destruction to the flesh or outward man, because it is written (in the Epistle) to the Corinthians: "Though our outward man decayeth, yet the inward man is renewed day by day."
