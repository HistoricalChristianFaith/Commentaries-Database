He means the works of the flesh and blood, which, in his Epistle to the Galatians, deprive men of the kingdom of God.
It is not indeed the flesh which he bids us to put off, but the works which he in another passage shows to be "works of the flesh.".
"What are these? Among the first he has set "fornication, impurity, lasciviousness: " "(concerning) which I foretell you, as I have foretold, that whoever do such acts are not to attain by inheritance the kingdom of God.".
for the other (works) of the flesh even an apostle would have named.
