Long ago did Isaiah declare that “out of Zion should go forth the law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem,” some other law, that is, and another word. In short, he says, “He shall judge among the nations and shall rebuke many people,” meaning not those of the Jewish people only, but also of the nations which are judged by the new law of the gospel and the new word of the apostles, and are among themselves rebuked of their old error as soon as they have believed. And as the result of this, “They beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears (which are a kind of hunting instrument) into pruning hooks.” That is to say, minds that once were fierce and cruel are changed by the gospel and the word of the apostles into good dispositions productive of good fruit.

The gospel will be this “way” of the new law and the new word in Christ, no longer in Moses. “And he shall judge among the nations,” even concerning their error. “And these shall rebuke a large nation,” that of the Jews themselves and their proselytes. “And they shall beat their swords into plowshares”; in other words, they shall change into pursuits of moderation and peace the dispositions of injurious minds, hostile tongues and all kinds of evil and blasphemy.… You learn here that Christ is promised not as powerful in war but pursuing peace.
