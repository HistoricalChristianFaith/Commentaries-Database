He says, “He will take of mine,” as I myself have taken of the Father’s. So the close series of the Father in the Son and the Son in the Paraclete makes three who cohere, the one attached to the other.

“All things that the Father has,” he says, “are mine”—and why not also the names? When therefore you read of God Almighty, and the Most High, and the God of hosts, and the King of Israel and “I am,” beware lest by these the Son also is shown to be of his own right God Almighty, as being the Word of God Almighty, and as having received power over all.

But the Paraclete, having many things to teach fully which the Lord deferred till He came, (according to the pre-definition,) will begin by bearing emphatic witness to Christ, (as being) such as we believe (Him to be), together with the whole order of God the Creator, and will glorify Him, and will "bring to remembrance" concerning Him.
