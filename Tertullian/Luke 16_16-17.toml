The Creator promised that old things would pass away because he said that new things were to arise. Christ marked the date of that passing, saying, “The law and the prophets were until John.” He set up John as a boundary stone between the one order and the other, of old things thereafter coming to an end, and new things beginning. The apostle necessarily, in Christ revealed after John, also invalidates the old things while validating the new. His concern is for the faith of no other god than the Creator under whose authority it was even prophesied that the old things were to pass away.
