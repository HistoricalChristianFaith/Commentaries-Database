When God made statements such as “You shall not murder; you shall not commit adultery; you shall not steal; you shall not bear false witness,” he was teaching me to refrain from doing to others what I would be unwilling to do to myself. Therefore the precept offered in the Gospel belongs only to the one who first drew it up in ancient times, arranging it according to his own teaching in a formula that could easily be understood. This was predicted in another passage in which the Lord, that is, Christ, was “to make a concise word on the earth.”
