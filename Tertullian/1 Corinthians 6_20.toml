What has the heretic to say? That these members of Christ will not rise again, for they are no longer our own? "For "he says, "ye are bought with a price.".
since Christ was a phantom, nor had He any corporeal substance which He could pay for our bodies! But, in truth, Christ had wherewithal to redeem us; and since He has redeemed, at a great price, these bodies of ours, against which fornication must not be committed (because they are now members of Christ, and not our own), surely He will secure, on His own account, the safety of those whom He made His own at so much cost! Now, how shall we glorify, how shall we exalt, God in our body.
Glorify and exalt God in your body".
And was "redeemed with a great price"-"the blood "to wit, "of the Lord and Lamb"
