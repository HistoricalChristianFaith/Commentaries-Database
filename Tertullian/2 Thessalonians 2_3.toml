Well, but who is the man of sin, the son of perdition "who must first be revealed before the Lord comes; "who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; who is to sit in the temple of God, and boast himself as being God? "

According to our view, he is the Antichrist; as it is taught to us in both the ancient and the new prophecies, and especially by the Apostle John (1Jn 4:1-3), who says that “already many false prophets are gone out into the world,” the fore-runners of Antichrist, who deny that Christ is come in the flesh, and do not acknowledge Jesus (to be the Christ), meaning in God the Creator. (Against Marcion 2 Thess)
