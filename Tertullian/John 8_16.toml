When … [Jesus] declares that he is not alone and uses these words, “but I and the Father who sent me,” does he not show that there are two—two and yet inseparable? Indeed, this was the sum and substance of what he was teaching them, that they [i.e., Father and Son] were inseparably two. [This must be the case] since, after citing the law when it affirms the truth of two men’s testimony, he adds at once: “I testify on my own behalf, and the Father who sent me testifies on my behalf.” Now, if he were one—being at once both the Son and the Father—he certainly would not have quoted the sanction of the law, which requires not the testimony of one but of two.
