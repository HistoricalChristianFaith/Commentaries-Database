And "I and my Father are one.".
and never separate from the Father, or other than the Father, since "I and the Father are one.".
so in the Gospel they simply keep in view the Lord's answer to Philip, "I and my Father are one; ".
-even in the same in which it was said in a previous passage, "I and my Father are one.".
as it is said, "I and my Father are One".
"That appellation is one both of filial duty and of power. Again, in the Father the Son is invoked; "for I "saith He, "and the Father are One."

“[W]e are one thing,” not “one person.” For if he had said “one person,” he might have rendered some assistance to their opinion. Unus, no doubt, indicates the singular number; but [here we have a case where] “two” are still the subject in the masculine gender. He accordingly says unum, a neuter term, which does not imply singularity of number but unity of essence, likeness, conjunction, affection on the Father’s part, who loves the Son, and submission on the Son’s part, who obeys the Father’s will.
