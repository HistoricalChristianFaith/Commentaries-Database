Divine Wisdom arranged the order of this prayer with exquisite choice. After the matters that pertain to heaven—that is, after the name of God, the will of God and the kingdom of God—it should make a place for a petition for our earthly needs too! Our Lord taught us, “Seek first the kingdom, and then these things shall be given you besides.” We should rather understand “give us this day our daily bread” in a spiritual sense. For Christ is “our bread,” because Christ is life, and the life is bread. “I am,” he said, “the bread of life.” Shortly before this he said, “The bread is the word of the living God who has come down from heaven.” Then, because his body is considered to be in the bread, he said, “This is my body.” When we ask for our daily bread, we are asking to live forever in Christ and to be inseparably united with his body.

To complete the prayer which was so well arranged, Christ added that we should pray not only that our sins be forgiven but also that we should completely shun them. “Lead us not into temptation,” that is, do not allow us to be led by the tempter. God forbid that our Lord should seem to be the tempter, as if he were not aware of one’s faith or were eager to upset it! That weakness and spitefulness belongs to the devil. Even in the case of Abraham, God ordered the sacrifice of his son not to tempt his faith but to prove it. He did this to set an example for his commandment that he was later to teach that no one should hold his loved ones dearer than God. Christ himself was tempted by the devil and pointed out the subtle director of the temptation. He confirms this passage by his words to his apostles later when he says, “Pray that you may not enter into temptation.” They were tempted to desert their Lord because they had indulged in sleep instead of prayer. The phrase that balances and interprets “lead us not into temptation” is “but deliver us from evil.”
