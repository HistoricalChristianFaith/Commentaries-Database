Again, in the Pslams, David says: "Bring to God, ye countries of the nations"-undoubtedly because "unto every land "the preaching of the apostles had to "go out".
For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ's, His Son?-whom all nations have heard, that is, whom all nations have believed,-whose preachers, withal, the apostles, are pointed to in the Psalms of David: "Into the universal earth "says he, "is gone out their sound, and unto the ends of the earth their words."
