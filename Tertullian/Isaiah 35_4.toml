The actions of Christ must be seen alongside the rule of the Scriptures. Unless I am mistaken, we see that Christ’s work consisted of two actions: preaching and power. Let us look at each of these in the order we have just listed them. First, Christ was announced as a preacher. Isaiah said, “Cry out loud, and do not hold back. Lift up your voice as a trumpet, and declare to my people their crimes and to the house of Jacob their sins. Then seek me day by day and desire to learn my ways, as a nation that has done righteousness and has not forsaken the judgment of God,” and so forth. Second, it was announced that Christ would do acts of power from the Father. Isaiah said, “Behold, our God will come with judgment; he will come and save us. Then the sick will be healed, the eyes of the blind will see, the ears of the deaf will hear, the mute will speak, and the lame will leap as a deer.”
