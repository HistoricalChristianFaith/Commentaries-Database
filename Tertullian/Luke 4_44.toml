“He departed, and went into a desert place.” This was, indeed, the Creator’s customary region. It was proper that the Word should there appear in body, where before he had appeared in a cloud. To the gospel also was suitable that condition of place which had once been prophesied for the law. “Let the wilderness and the solitary place, therefore, be glad and rejoice”; so had Isaiah promised.
