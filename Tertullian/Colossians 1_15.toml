It is fortunate that in another passage [the apostle] calls Christ “the image of the invisible God.” For does it not follow with equal force from that passage that Christ is not truly God, because the apostle describes him as the image of God? This is true, if (as Marcion contends) he is not truly man because he has taken on the form or image of a man. For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or “fashion”) and likeness and form are descriptions of a phantom. But since he is truly God as the Son of the Father, in his fashion and image, he has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, “found in the fashion” and image “of a man.”

It is well for us that in another passage (the apostle) calls Christ "the image of the invisible God."[913]

Thus does He make Him equal to Him: for by proceeding from Himself He became His first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things;[64]
