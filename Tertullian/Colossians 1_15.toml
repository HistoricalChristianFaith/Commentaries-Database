For in both cases the true substance will have to be excluded, if image (or “fashion”) and likeness and form are descriptions of a phantom. But since he is truly God as the Son of the Father, in his fashion and image, he has been already by the force of this conclusion determined to be truly man, as the Son of man, “found in the fashion” and image “of a man.”
