“Thus says the Lord God to my Christ [the] Lord, whose right hand I have held, that the nations may hear him, ‘the powers of kings will I burst asunder; I will open before him the gates, and the cities shall not be closed to him.’ ” This very thing we see now fulfilled. For whose right hand does God the Father hold but Christ’s, his Son? All nations have heard of him, that is, people of all nations have believed. Their preachers, the apostles, are pointed to in the psalms of David: “Into the entire earth,” he says, “is gone out their sound, and to the ends of the earth their words.” For on whom else have nations the world over believed but on the Christ who has now already come?… In all these places the name of the Christ has already come to reign. He is the one before whom the gates of all cities have been opened and to whom none are closed, before whom iron bars have been crumbled and brazen gates opened. There is a spiritual sense affixed to these expressions. The hearts of individuals, having been blockaded in various ways by the devil, are now unbarred by the faith of Christ. This promise has already been evidently fulfilled, inasmuch as in all these places there are people who live believing in the name of Christ.
