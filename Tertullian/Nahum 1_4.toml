If it is [Marcion’s] Christ that is meant, he will not be stronger than the servants of the Creator. I would have been content with the examples I have shown you without adding anything further. But here a prediction of [Christ] walking on the water precedes his advent as well. The words of the psalm are, in fact, accomplished by Christ’s crossing over the lake. “The Lord,” says the psalmist, “is upon many waters.” When he scatters its waves, Habakkuk’s words are fulfilled where he says, “scattering the waters as he walks.” When at his rebuke the sea is calmed, Nahum is also verified: “He rebukes the sea and makes it dry,” referring to the winds that had disturbed the sea.
