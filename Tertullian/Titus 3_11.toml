It is the same Paul who, in his epistle to the Galatians, counts “heresies” among “the sins of the flesh,” who also intimates to Titus that “a man who is a heretic” must be “rejected after the first admonition.” This is on the ground that “he that is perverted and commits sin as a self-condemned man.” Indeed, in almost every epistle, when enjoining on us [the duty] of avoiding false doctrines, he sharply condemns heresies. Of these the practical effects are false doctrines, called in Greek heresis, a word used in the sense of that choice which a man makes when he either teaches them [to others] or takes up with them [for himself]. For this reason it is that he calls the heretic self-condemned, because he has himself chosen that in which he is condemned.
