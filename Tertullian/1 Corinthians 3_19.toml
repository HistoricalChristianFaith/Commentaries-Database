Wherefore? "Because the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God.".
an excellent testimony turns up in what (the apostle) here adjoins: "For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; and again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.".
According to the estimate of God, and that the very "Wisdom of the world is foolishness "(as the inspired word) pronounces it to be.
