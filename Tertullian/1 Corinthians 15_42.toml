A resurrection of the flesh or body, which he illustrates by fleshly and corporeal samples? Does he not also guarantee that the resurrection shall be accomplished by that God from whom proceed all the (creatures which have served him for) examples? "So also "says he, "is the resurrection of the dead.".
This sowing of the body he called the dissolving thereof in the ground, "because it is sown in corruption "(but "is raised) to honour and power.".
Else let them show that the soul was sown after death; in a word, that it underwent death,-that is, was demolished, dismembered, dissolved in the ground, nothing of which was ever decreed against it by God: let them display to our view its corruptibility and dishonour (as well as) its weakness, that it may also accrue to it to rise again in in corruption, and in glory, and in power.
