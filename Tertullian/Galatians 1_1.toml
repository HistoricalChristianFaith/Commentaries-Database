He professes himself to be "an apostle"-to use his own, words-"not of men, nor by man, but by Jesus Christ.".
at all events, have handed down to me this career of Paul, which you must not refuse to accept. Thence I demonstrate that from a persecutor he became "an apostle, not of men, neither by man; ".
To the Galatians he declares himself to be "an apostle not of men, neither by man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father."
