Isaiah even so early, with the clearness of an apostle, foreseeing the thoughts of heretical hearts, asked, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? For who hath been His counsellor? With whom took He counsel? . or who taught Him knowledge, and showed to Him the way of understanding? ".
This is the purport of what Isaiah said, and of (the apostle's own) subsequent quotation of the self-same passage, of the prophet: "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? ".
So also He will be first, because all things are after Him; and all things are after Him, because all things are by Him; and all things are by Him, because they are of nothing: so that reason coincides with the Scripture, which says: "Who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been His counsellor? or with whom took He counsel? or who hath shown to Him the way of wisdom and knowledge? Who hath first given to Him, and it shall be recompensed to him again? ".
evidences of Himself. "For who hath known the mind of the Lord".
-even though the apostle asks, "Who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been His counsellor? ".
"has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been His counsellor, to teach Him? or who has pointed out to Him the way of understanding? "
