For this corruptible"-and as he spake, the apostle seemingly pointed to his own flesh-"must put on in corruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.".
because of these it was that he said: "This corruptible must put on in corruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.".
But inasmuch as "this corruptible (that is, the flesh) must put on in corruption, and this mortal (that is, the blood) must put on immortality".
into the sense of the actual destruction of the flesh; as if we might not speak of ourselves as swallowing bile, or swallowing grief, meaning that we conceal and hide it, and keep it within ourselves. The truth is, when it is written, "This mortal must put on immortality".
Death is incapable of immortality, but not so mortality. Besides, as it is written that "this mortal must put on immortality".
But how so, unless they become entire, who have wasted away either in the loss of their health, or in the long decrepitude of the grave? For when he propounds the two clauses, that "this corruptible must put on in corruption, and this mortal must put on immortality, ".
iple that the dispensation of the future state ought not to be compared with that of the present world, and that in the interval between them a change will take place; and we now add the remark, that these functions of our bodily limbs will continue to supply the needs of this life up to the moment when life itself shall pass away from time to eternity, as the natural body gives place to the spiritual, until "this mortal puts on immorality, and this corruptible puts on in corruption: ".
Here is a veritable eternity, in the (perennial) youth of your head! Here we have an "incorruptibility "to "put on".
And as a testimony of (our) faith; as a commendation of this flesh of ours, which is to be sustained for the "garment of immortality"
