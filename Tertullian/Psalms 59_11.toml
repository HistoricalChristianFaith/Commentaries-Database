So likewise that conditional threat of the sword, “If you refuse and do not listen to me, the sword shall devour you,” has proved that the sword was Christ, for rebellion against whom they have perished. In the fifty-ninth psalm he demands of the Father their dispersion: “Scatter them in your power.” By Isaiah he also says, as he finishes a prophecy of their consumption by fire: “Because of me this has happened to you; you shall lie down in sorrow.” But all this would be meaningless enough, if they suffered this retribution not on account of him who had in prophecy assigned their suffering to his own cause but for the sake of the Christ of the other god. Well, then, although you affirm that it is the Christ of the other god38 who was driven to the cross by the powers and authorities of the Creator, as it were by hostile beings, still I have to say, see how manifestly he was defended by the Creator: there were given to him both “the wicked for his burial,” even those who had strenuously maintained that his corpse had been stolen, “and the rich for his death,” even those who had redeemed him from the treachery of Judas, as well as from the lying report of the soldiers that his body had been taken away.
