When the apostle says: “Flee from the worship of idols,” he means idolatry whole and entire. Look closely at a thicket and see how many thorns lie hidden beneath the leaves!

Thus the crown also is made out to be an offering to idols; for with this ceremony, and dress, and pomp, it is presented in sacrifice to idols, its originators, to whom its use is specially given over, and chiefly on this account, that what has no place among the things of God may not be admitted into use with us as with others. Wherefore the apostle exclaims, "Flee idolatry: " certainly idolatry whole and entire he means.
