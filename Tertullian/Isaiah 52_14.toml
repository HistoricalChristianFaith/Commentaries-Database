Similarly the Father addressed the Son, “Even as many will be astounded at you, so your appearance will be without glory from people.” For though, as David has it, he is timely in beauty even above the children of human beings, yet this is in that allegorical state of spiritual grace, when he girds himself with the sword of the Word, which is in truth his very own form and comeliness and glory.
