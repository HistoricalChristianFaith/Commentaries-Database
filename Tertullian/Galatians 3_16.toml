Although we have God Himself as an adequate engager and faithful promiser, in that He promised to Abraham that "in his seed should be blest all nations of the earth; ".
"To Abraham were the promises made, and to his seed. He said not `to seeds, 'as of many; but as of one, `to thy seed, 'which is Christ.".
"So faith, illumined by patience, when it was becoming propagated among the nations through "Abraham's seed, which is Christ"
