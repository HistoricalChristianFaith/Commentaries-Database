Of no man, I am quite sure, were they [the apostles] afraid, â€” neither of Jews nor of Gentiles in their violence; with all the greater freedom, then, would they certainly preach in the church, who held not their tongue in synagogues and public places. Indeed they would have found it impossible either to convert Jews or to bring in Gentiles, unless they "set forth in order" [Luke 1:1] that which they would have them believe.
