Is a grace of God, and you have received it, "why do you boast "saith he, "as if you have not received it? ".
And if it is by God that the virtue of continence is conferred, "why gloriest thou, as if thou have not received? ".
To differ? What, moreover, hast thou which thou hast not received? Why gloriest thou as if thou have not received? "
