Of this epistle, how that certain persons interposed, and said that men ought to be circumcised, and that the law of Moses was to be observed; and how the apostles, when consulted, determined, by the authority of the Holy Spirit, that "a yoke should not be put upon men's necks which their fathers even had not been able to bear."
