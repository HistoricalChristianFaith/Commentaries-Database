For this reason, in order to root out the materials of idolatry, God’s law proclaims, “You shall not make an idol”; and by adding, “Nor the likeness of any thing that is in heaven or in the earth or in the sea,” it utterly forbade such crafts to the servants of God. Enoch had anticipated this law when he prophesied that the demons and the spirits of the rebellious angels would turn to idolatry every element and property of the universe, everything which heaven and sea and earth contain, to be consecrated as a god against God. So it is that human error worships everything but the very Creator of everything. Their images are idols; the consecration of images is idolatry. Whatever sin idolatry commits must be put down to all the makers of all the idols.
