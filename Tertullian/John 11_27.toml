Martha confesses him to be the Son of God, being no more astray than Peter and Nathanael, though even if she had been astray she should at once have learned [the truth]. For the Lord, for the raising up of her brother from the dead, looked up to heaven and to the Father and said, “Father”—evidently a son [speaks]—“I thank you that you hear me always: for the sake of these multitudes that stand by, I said it that they may believe that you have sent me.”
