Christ Jesus our Lord clearly declared himself as to who he was while he lived on earth.… Who then of sound mind can possibly suppose that those whom the Lord ordained to be leaders and teachers were ignorant of anything essential to salvation? Who could suppose that he who kept them, as he did, so close to himself in their daily attentiveness, in their discipline, in their companionship, to whom, when they were alone, he used to expound all things which were obscure, telling them that “to them it was given to know those mysteries,” which it was not permitted the people to understand—now would he leave them ignorant?
