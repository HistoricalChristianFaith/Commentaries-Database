Now, when He commands that a debt be remitted to a man who shall be unable to pay it (for it is a still stronger argument when He forbids its being asked for from a man who is even able to repay it), what else does He teach than that we should lend to those of whom we cannot receive again, inasmuch as He has imposed so great a loss on lending? "And ye shall be the children of God.".
"Because "says He, "He is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil.".
It; and remedies will be more effective on their first application than when outworn. No doubt the Lord is "kind "to "the unthankful"
