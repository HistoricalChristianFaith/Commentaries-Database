“But God,”[adulterers and fornicators say,] “is good and most kind.” He is “merciful, compassionate and rich in mercy,” which “he prefers to every sacrifice.” “He desires not so much the death as the repentance of the sinner.” He is “the Savior of all people, and especially of the faithful.” Therefore the children of God must also be “merciful” and “peacemakers,” “forgiving each other as Christ also forgave us,” “not judging, lest we be judged.” For to “his master a man stands or falls; who are you to judge the servant of another?” “Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” Yet many such things as these are only said, not done, merely bandied about, unmanning rather than strengthening discipline, flattering God and pandering to themselves.
