He [God] says the following about the Gentiles, those he was about to call together from the ends of the earth: “Behold, they shall come swiftly with speed.” He says “swiftly” because of the hastening toward end times. He says “with speed” because they will not be weighed down by the weights of the ancient law. He says “they shall be filled” because it is a promise made only to those who hunger and thirst.
