And therefore this question must at once be determined, whether the discipline of patience is enjoined by the Creator? When by Zechariah he commanded, “Let none of you imagine evil against his brother,” he did not expressly include his “neighbor;” but then in another passage he says, “Let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his neighbor.” He who counseled that an injury should be forgotten was still more likely to counsel the patient endurance of it.
