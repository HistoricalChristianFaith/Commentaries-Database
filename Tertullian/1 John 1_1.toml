Read the testimony of John: "That which we have seen, which we have heard, which we have looked upon with our eyes, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life."
But the very same apostles testify that they had both seen and "handled "Christ.
"That "says John, "which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the Word of life."
But what is that which, in a certain way, has been grasped by hand.
To God their beauty, to God their youth (is dedicated). With Him they live; with Him they converse; Him they "handle"
