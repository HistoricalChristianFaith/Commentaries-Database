Through this arises the question for us, what sabbath God willed us to keep? For the Scriptures point to an eternal sabbath and a temporal sabbath. For Isaiah the prophet says, “My soul hates your sabbaths,” and in another place he says, “My sabbath you have profaned.” From which we discern that the temporal sabbath is human and the eternal sabbath is accounted divine.

God has here expressed an aversion to certain sabbaths. By calling them “your sabbaths” he means that the sabbaths he rejects are humanity’s, and not his. He rejects them because they were celebrated without the fear of God by a people full of sins who love God “with the lip, not the heart.”
