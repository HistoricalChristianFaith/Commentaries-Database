Christ must be understood to be an exterminator of spiritual foes, who wields spiritual arms and fights in spiritual strife.… It is of such a war as this that the psalm may evidently have spoken: “The Lord is strong, the Lord is mighty in battle.” For with the last enemy death did he fight, and through the trophy of the cross he triumphed.
