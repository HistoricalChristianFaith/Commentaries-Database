Of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father.
Thus does the apostle also teach respecting His two substances, saying, "who was made of the seed of David; ".
Adually descending to the birth of Christ, what else have we here described than the very flesh of Abraham and of David conveying itself down, step after step, to the very virgin, and at last introducing Christ,-nay, producing Christ Himself of the virgin? Then, again, there is Paul, who was at once both a disciple, and a master, and a witness of the selfsame Gospel; as an apostle of the same Christ, also, he affirms that Christ "was made of the seed of David, according to the flesh"
