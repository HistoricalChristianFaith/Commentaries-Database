The rich man followed his own counsel, having rejected the precept of dividing his resources with the needy. He was abandoned by the Lord to his own opinion. There is no justification for applying the term “harshness” on this account to describe Christ. For each individual free will is able to choose to defile itself. “Behold, I have set before you good and evil.” Choose that which is good. If you cannot because you will not (for he has shown that you can if you will, because he has proposed each to your free will) you ought to depart from him whose will you elect not to do.
