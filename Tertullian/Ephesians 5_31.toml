For, inasmuch as Adam straightway predicted that "great mystery of Christ and the church".
And to the Ephesians giving an intimation that, when it was declared in the beginning that a man should leave his father and mother and become one flesh with his wife, he applied this to Christ and the church.
and of Christ, of the woman and of the Church, of the flesh and the spirit, by the apostle's help who applies the Creator's injunction, and adds even a comment on it: "For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother, (and shall be joined unto his wife), and they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery.".

If, however, (it take place) a second time, or oftener, immediately (the flesh) ceases to be "one "and there will not be "two (joined) into one flesh "but plainly one rib (divided) into more. But when the apostle interprets, "The two shall be (joined) into one flesh"
