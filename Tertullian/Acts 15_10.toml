Sometimes catch at such parts of the law as they choose; plainly do we too assert that the law has deceased in this sense, that its burdens-according to the sentence of the apostles-which not even the fathers were able to sustain.
For it is the "burdens "of the law which were "until John "not the remedial virtues. It is the "yokes "of "works "that have been rejected, not those of disciplines.
