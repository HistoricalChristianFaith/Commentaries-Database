Ten other &#166;ons after them spring, and then the twelve others arise with their wonderful names, to complete the mere story of the thirty &#166;ons. The same apostle, when disapproving of those who are "in bondage to elements".
Now, from whom comes this grace, but from Him who proclaimed the promise thereof? Who is (our) Father, but He who is also our Maker? Therefore, after such affluence (of grace), they should not have returned "to weak and beggarly elements."
