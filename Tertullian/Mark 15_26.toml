quote='''
He was not hailed as the king of glory by the angels until he had been censured on the cross as “King of the Jews.” … You owe your life to him as a debt for these favors. So try as best you can to be accountable to him in the same way that he became accountable for you. Or, be not crowned with flowers at all if you cannot bear the thorns, because with flowers you cannot be crowned.
