Therefore, since the Jews still contend that the Christ is not yet come, whom we have in so many ways approved.
Also Peter, in the Acts of the Apostles, speaks of Him as verily human (when he says), "Jesus Christ was a man approved of God among you.".
Then why not His names also? When, therefore, you read of Almighty God, and the Most High, and the God of hosts, and the King of Israel the "One that is "consider whether the Son also be not indicated by these designations, who in His own right is God Almighty, in that He is the Word of Almighty God, and has received power over all; is the Most High, in that He is "exalted at the right hand of God "as Peter declares in the Acts;.
(key): "Men of Israel, let what I say sink into your ears: Jesus the Nazarene, a man destined by God for you "and so forth.
