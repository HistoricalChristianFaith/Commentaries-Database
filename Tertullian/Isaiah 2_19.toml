The Creator ought to be known even by the light of nature, for he may be understood from his works and may thereby become the object of a more widely spread knowledge. To him, therefore, does it appertain to punish such as do not know God, for none ought to be ignorant of him. In the apostle’s phrase, “From the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power,” he uses the words of Isaiah, who for that same reason attests the very same Lord as arising “to shake terribly the earth.” - "Against Marcion 5.16"
