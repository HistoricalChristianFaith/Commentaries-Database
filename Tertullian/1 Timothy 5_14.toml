"But again, writing to Timotheus, he 'wills the very young (women) to marry, bear children, act the housewife.'" He is (here) directing (his speech) to such as he denotes above-"very young widows," who, after being, "apprehended" in widowhood, and (subsequently) wooed for some length of time, after they have had Christ in their affections, "wish to marry, having judgment, because they have rescinded the first faith,"-that (faith), to wit, by which they were "found" in widowhood, and, after professing it, do not persevere.
