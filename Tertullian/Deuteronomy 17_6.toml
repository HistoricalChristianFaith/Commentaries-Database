“Two angels, however, appeared there.” For just so many honorary companions were required by the Word of God, which usually prescribes “two witnesses.” Moreover, the women, returning from the sepulcher and from this vision of the angels were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, “Come, you women, who return from the vision”;2 that is, “come” to report the resurrection of the Lord.
