Writing also to the Galatians, he inveighs against such men as observed and defend circumcision and the (Mosaic) law.
Even if, for certain, the apostle had granted pardon of fornication to that Corinthian, it would be another instance of his once for all contravening his own practice to meet the requirement of the time. He circumcised Timotheus alone, and yet did away with circumcision.
