Of our heretic. Now, that the very Lord Himself of all might, the Word and Spirit of the Father.
He says, it is true, that "the flesh profiteth nothing; ".
for the kingdom of God; "the flesh profiteth nothing."

If he says that “the flesh profits nothing,” then the meaning must take direction from the context of that remark. For seeing that they regarded his speech as hard and unbearable, as though he had really prescribed his flesh for them to eat, since his purpose was to assign the establishment of salvation to the Spirit, he first said, “It is the spirit that gives life,” and only then added, “the flesh profits nothing”—toward the giving of life, of course. He also proceeds to state how he wishes “the Spirit” to be understood. “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.” … And so, when establishing his teaching as the Life-giver (because the Word is spirit and life), he also said that it is his flesh, because the Word also was made flesh. We ought therefore to desire him in order that we may have life. We ought to devour him with the ear, and to ruminate on him with the mind and to digest him by faith.
