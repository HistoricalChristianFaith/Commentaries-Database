When, however, the prescript is laid down that "without baptism, salvation is attainable by none "(chiefly on the ground of that declaration of the Lord, who says, "Unless one be born of water, he hath not life"

For the law of baptizing has been imposed and the formula prescribed: “Go,” he says, “teach the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” The comparison with this law of that definition, “Unless one has been reborn of water and Spirit, he shall not enter into the kingdom of the heavens,” has tied faith to the necessity of baptism. Accordingly, all thereafter who became believers used to be baptized.
