To none, forsooth, except these, nor prior to these, was revealed the truth of the Divine Nature; and they obtained this especial honour and fuller favour from the devil, we cannot doubt, because he wished even in this respect to rival God, that he might succeed, by the poison of his doctrines, in doing himself what the Lord said could not be done-making "the disciples above their Master." Let the entire mass of heresies choose, therefore, for themselves the times when they should appear, provided that the when be an unimportant point; allowing, too, that they be not of the truth, and (as a matter of course ) that such as had no existence in the time of the apostles could not possibly have had any connection with the apostles.

Some persons believe Marcion. But "the disciple is not above his master." Apelles ought to have remembered this-a corrector of Marcion, although his disciple.
