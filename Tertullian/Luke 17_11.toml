Marcion's labour, however, is to object to us the strictness of the law, with the view of maintaining that here also Christ is its enemy-forestalling its enactments even in His cure of the ten lepers. These He simply commanded to show themselves to the priest; "and as they went, He cleansed them" -without a touch, and without a word, by His silent power and simple will.
