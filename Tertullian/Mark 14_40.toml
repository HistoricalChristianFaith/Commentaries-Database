Susceptibilities to weakness and sloth are footprints of the devil. When God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his only son, it was not for the purpose of seducing him toward evil, but of proving his faith. Through Abraham God sought to offer a pattern of one who followed the precept that he should hold no pledge of affection dearer than God. Later when the Lord asked his disciples to “pray that you may not enter into temptation,” the same pledge was required. Yet they were tempted. They deserted their Lord by giving way to sleep rather than persevering in prayer.
