Does not permit "the members of Christ to be joined to a harlot.".
In the body will He raise us, because the body is for the Lord, and the Lord for the body. And suitably does he add the question: "Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? ".
He makes our bodies "the members of Christ; ".
Less commingles "the members of Christ "with the members of an adulteress.
"Taking away the members of Christ, shall I make (them) members of an harlot? Know ye not, that whoever is agglutinated to an harlot is made one body? (for the two shall be (made) into one flesh): but whoever is agglutinated to the Lord is one spirit? Flee fornication."
