Besides the generally known fact that the riches of the East, that is to say, its strength and resources, usually consist of gold and spices, it is certainly true of the Creator that he makes gold the riches of the other nations also. Thus he says by Zechariah, “And Judah shall also fight at Jerusalem and shall gather together all the wealth of the nations round about, gold and silver.” Moreover, respecting that gift of gold, David also says, “And there shall be given to him of the gold of Arabia”; and again, “The kings of Arabia and Saba shall offer to him gifts.” For the East generally regarded the magi as kings; and Damascus was anciently deemed to belong to Arabia, before it was transferred to Syrophoenicia on the division of the Syrias [by Rome]. Its riches Christ then received, when he received the tokens thereof in the gold and spices; while the spoils of Samaria were the magi themselves. The magi discovered him and honored him with their gifts. On bended knee they adored him as their God and King. Through the witness of the star that led them on their way and guided them, they became the spoils of Samaria, that is to say, of idolatry, because, as it is easy enough to see, they believed in Christ. He designated idolatry under the name of Samaria, as that city was shameful for its idolatry, through which it had then revolted from God from the days of King Jeroboam. Nor is this an unusual manner for the Creator [in his Scriptures] figuratively to employ names of places as a metaphor derived from the analogy of their sins. Thus he calls the chief people of the Jews “rulers of Sodom,” and the nation itself “people of Gomorrah.”
