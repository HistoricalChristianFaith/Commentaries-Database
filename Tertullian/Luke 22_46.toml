In all other respects the Father did not forsake the Son, for it was into His Father's hands that the Son commended His. spirit. Indeed, after so commending it, He instantly died; and as the Spirit remained with the flesh, the flesh cannot undergo the full extent of death, i.e., in corruption and decay.
