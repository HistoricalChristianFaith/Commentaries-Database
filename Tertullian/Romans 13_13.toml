Whether, moreover, the apostle had any acquaintance with xerophagies-(the apostle) who had repeatedly practised greater rigours, "hunger, and thirst, and fists many "who had forbidden "drunkennesses and revellings".
Which alliance the apostle withal was aware of; and hence, after premising, "Not in drunkenness and revels "he adjoined, "nor in couches and lusts."
