For what are this next words? "Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God.".
there is to be no flesh, how then shall it put on in corruption and immortality? Having then become something else by its change, it will obtain the kingdom of God, no longer the (old) flesh and blood, but the body which God shall have given it. Rightly then does the apostle declare, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; ".
(since this substance enters not the kingdom of Gods.
-he shows that when he wrote the words, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God".
But "flesh and blood "you say, "cannot inherit the kingdom of God.".
"connects what follows with the preceding words) "that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God".
they will rise again for the judgment, because they rise not for the kingdom. Again, I will say, "Flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; ".
Otherwise, if they say that you are not in Christ, let them also say that Christ is not in heaven, since they have denied you heaven. Likewise "neither shall corruption "says he, "inherit in corruption.
Also present themselves to the rising bodies, and will recognise their several places. But nothing can rise except flesh and spirit sole and pure.
