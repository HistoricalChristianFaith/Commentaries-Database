However, I will show [Marcion] the death and burial and resurrection of Christ all indicated in a single sentence of Isaiah, who says, “His sepulchre was removed from the midst of them.” Now there could have been no sepulchre without death and no removal of sepulchre except by resurrection.… “He shall divide the spoil of many, because he poured out his soul to death.” For here is set forth the cause of this favor to him, even that it was to recompense him for his death.
