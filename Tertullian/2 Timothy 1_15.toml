That certain men, like Phygellus, and Hermogenes, and Philetus, and Hymenaeus, deserted His apostle:.
And has also failed in cleaving to the rule of faith as much as the apostle's own Hermogenes.
They will have to be excluded while they are with premature haste seizing that which is promised after this life; erring concerning the truth, no less than Phygellus and Hermogenes.
For the apostle likewise delivered Phygellus and Hermogenes over to Satan that by chastening they might be taught not to blaspheme.
