How often has He already displayed Himself as a Judge, and in the Judge the Creator? How often, indeed, has He repelled, and in the repulse condemned? In the present passage, for instance, He says, "When once the master of the house is risen up; ".
"And hath shut to the door "thereby shutting out the wicked, of course; and when these knock, He will answer, "I know you not whence ye are; "and when they recount how "they have eaten and drunk in His presence "He will further say to them, "Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
