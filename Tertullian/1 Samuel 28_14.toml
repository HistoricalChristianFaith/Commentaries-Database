Why, even now the followers of Simon [Magus] are so confident of their art that they undertake to bring back the souls of the prophets from hell. And this, I believe, because their power lies in their ability to deceive. This power was actually granted to the witch of Endor, who brought back the soul of Samuel after Saul had consulted God in vain. Apart from that case, God forbid we should believe that any soul, much less a prophet, could be called forth by a demon. We are told that “Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light”—and more easily into a man of light—and that at the end he will work marvelous signs and show himself as God, so much so that, “if possible, he will deceive even the elect.” He hardly hesitated to declare to Saul that he was the prophet [Samuel] in whom the devil was then dwelling.
So, you must not think that the spirit which created the apparition was different from the one who made Saul believe in it; but, the same spirit was in the witch of Endor and in the apostate [Saul], and so it was easy for him to suggest the lie that he had already made Saul believe. Saul’s treasure, indeed, was then where his heart was, where God most certainly was not. Thus, he saw only the devil, through whom he believed he would see Samuel, for he believed in the spirit who showed him the apparition. - "On the Soul 57.7–9"
