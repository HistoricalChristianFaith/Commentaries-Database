And inasmuch as this Son is undivided and inseparable from the Father, so is he to be reckoned as being in the Father, even when he is not named. The fact is, if he had named him expressly, he would have separated him, saying in so many words, “Beside me there is none else, except my Son.” In short, he would have made his Son actually another, after excepting him from others.
