Therefore "one star differeth from another star in glory.".
"For one star differeth from another star in glory: so there are bodies terrestrial as well as celestial "(Jews, that is, as well as Christians).
Ntest's sake, but for its own benefit, ought it not to have had some store of hope, for the increase of which it might restrain desire of its own, and check its wish in order that it might strive to mount up, seeing they also who discharge earthly functions are eager for promotion? Or how will there be many mansions in our Father's house, if not to accord with a diversity of deserts? How will one star also differ from another star in glory, unless in virtue of disparity in their rays?
