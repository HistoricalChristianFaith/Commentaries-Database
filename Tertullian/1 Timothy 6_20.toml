The same madness, in their allowing indeed that the apostles were ignorant of nothing, and preached not any (doctrines) which contradicted one another, but at the same time insisting that they did not reveal all to all men, for that they proclaimed some openly and to all the world, whilst they disclosed others (only) in secret and to a few, because Paul addressed even this expression to Timothy: "O Timothy, guard that which is entrusted to thee; "

Nothing that was proclaimed before many witnesses could be kept secret. Nor can they [the Gnostic heretics] interpret as evidence of some hidden gospel Paul’s desire that Timothy should entrust “these things to faithful men, fit to teach others.” “These things” meant the things of which he was then writing. To refer to things hidden in their minds he would have said “those,” as of something absent, not “these.”
