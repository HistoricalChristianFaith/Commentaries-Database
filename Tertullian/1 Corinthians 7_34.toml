For even by this very fact, that he has not named "virgins" (as he does in another place where he is teaching touching marrying), he sufficiently predicates that his remark is made touching every woman, and touching the whole sex; and that there is no distinction made between a "virgin" and any other, while he does not name her at all.

Further, if we set down in order the higher and happier grades of bodily patience, (we find that)it is she who is entrusted by holiness with the care of continence of the flesh: she keeps the widow, and sets on the virgin the seal and raises the self-made eunuch to the realms of heaven.

As if I were speaking to Gentiles, addressing you with a Gentile precept, and (one which is) common to all, (I would say, ) "You are bound to please your husbands only." But you will please them in proportion as you take no care to please others.

But we withal retort the self-same line of argument. For he who knew elsewhere how to make mention of each sex-of virgin I mean, and woman, that is, not-virgin-for distinction's sake; in these (passages), in which he does not name a virgin, points out (by not making the distinction) community of condition. Otherwise he could here also have marked the difference between virgin and woman, just as elsewhere he says, "Divided is the woman and the virgin." Therefore those whom, by passing them over in silence, he has not divided, he has included in the other species.
