“God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes, and there shall be no more death” and therefore no more corruption, it being chased away by incorruption, even as death is by immortality.… That the raiment and shoes of the children of Israel remained unworn and fresh for the space of forty years … that the fires of Babylon injured neither the cloaks nor the trousers of the three young men … that Jonah was swallowed by the monster of the deep, in whose belly whole ships were devoured and after three days was vomited out safe and sound—to what faith do these notable facts bear witness, if not to that which ought to inspire in us the belief that they are proofs … of our own future integrity and perfect resurrection?… They are written that we may believe both that the Lord is more powerful than all natural laws about the body, and that he shows himself the preserver of the flesh the more emphatically, in that he has preserved for the body even its very clothes and shoes.
