If we think over the rest of faults, tracing them from their generations, let us begin with covetousness, "a root of all evils".
Of that, therefore, which we have not the smallest need to seek after, because the Lord did not seek after it either, we ought to endure without heart-sickness the cutting down or taking away. "Covetousness "the Spirit of the Lord has through the apostle pronounced "a root of all evils."
