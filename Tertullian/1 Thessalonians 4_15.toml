He says that those who "remain unto the coming of Christ "along with "the dead in Christ, shall rise first "being "caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.".
For the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trump of God: and the dead in Christ shall rise first: then we too shall ourselves be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air: and so shall we ever be with the Lord."
