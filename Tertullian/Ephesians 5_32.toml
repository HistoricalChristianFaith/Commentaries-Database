What had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared "the great mystery of Christ and the church? ".
In the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. "But I am speaking "says he, "of Christ and the Church.".
However, even (Adam) himself at that time, reverting to the condition of a Psychic after the spiritual ecstasy in which he had prophetically interpreted that "great sacrament"

Small in the eyes of heretics but great in the eyes of the apostles are the Creator’s works. Of just such a great mystery the apostle speaks when he says: “But I speak of Christ and the church.” He says this to confirm the mystery, not to undermine it. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured beforehand by the One who is the author of the mystery.
