Small in the eyes of heretics but great in the eyes of the apostles are the Creator’s works. Of just such a great mystery the apostle speaks when he says: “But I speak of Christ and the church.” He says this to confirm the mystery, not to undermine it. He shows us that the mystery was prefigured beforehand by the One who is the author of the mystery.

What had he that was spiritual? Is it because he prophetically declared "the great mystery of Christ and the church? " "This is bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman.

In passing, (I would say that) it is enough for me that the works of the Creator are great mysteries in the estimation of the apostle, although they are so vilely esteemed by the heretics. "But I am speaking," says he, "of Christ and the Church." This he says in explanation of the mystery, not for its disruption.

However, even (Adam) himself at that time, reverting to the condition of a Psychic after the spiritual ecstasy in which he had prophetically interpreted that "great sacrament" with reference to Christ and the Church, and no longer being "capable of the things which were the Spirit's," yielded more readily to his belly than to God, heeded the meat rather than the mandate, and sold salvation for his gullet! He ate, in short, and perished; saved (as he would) else (have been), if he had preferred to fast from one little tree: so that, even from this early date, animal faith may recognise its own seed, deducing from thence onward its appetite for carnalities and rejection of spiritualities.
