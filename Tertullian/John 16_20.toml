Between life and death or else we rescind what is written, "The world shall rejoice, but ye shall grieve."
Now they have gladness and we are troubled. "The world "says Jesus, "shall rejoice; ye shall be sorrowful."
You have your own registers, your own calendar; you have nothing to do with the joys of the world; nay, you are called to the very opposite, for "the world shall rejoice, but ye shall mourn."
