Joseph and Daniel served as slaves, but you are the slaves of no one, insofar as you share in those who serve Christ, who has freed you from the captivity of the world. You act after the Lord’s pattern. He walked in humility and obscurity. He had no definite home. “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.” He is unadorned as to dress. He exercised no right of power even over his own followers. In short, though conscious of his own kingdom, he shrank back from being made a king.

That Lord walked in humility and obscurity, with no definite home: for "the Son of man," said He, "hath not where to lay His head; " unadorned in dress, for else He had not said, "Behold, they who are clad in soft raiment are in kings' houses: " in short, inglorious in countenance and aspect, just as Isaiah withal had fore-announced.
