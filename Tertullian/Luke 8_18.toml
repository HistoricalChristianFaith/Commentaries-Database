Has deemed God's law to be foolishness, and has therefore neglected to observe it; and as a further consequence, by his not having faith, "even that which he see meth to have hath been taken from him".
the Creator had said that they would not hear. Therefore it is that He adds by His Christ, "Take heed how ye hear".
This is proved even by the sentence which immediately follows: "Whosoever hath, to him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, from him shall be taken even that which he see meth to have.".
not only bestows honour, but also takes away what a man seems to have.
Why, a shepherd like this will be tuned off from the farm; the wages to have been given him at the time of his discharge will be kept from him as compensation; nay, even from his former savings a restoration of the master's loss will be required; for "to him who hath shall be given, but from him who hath not shall be taken away even that which he see meth to have.
