The devil also asked for power to tempt the apostles, since he did not have it except with divine permission. In the Gospel, the Lord said to Peter, “Behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you, that your faith may not fail.” That is to say, the devil could not have so much power as to be able to endanger the faith of Peter. We thus see that the threat to our faith as well as its protection are in the power of God.
