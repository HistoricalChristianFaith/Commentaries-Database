Thus it happens that the rich man in hell has a tongue and poor (Lazarus) a finger and Abraham a bosom.
"is said to separate those regions, and to hinder a passage from one to the other. Besides, the rich man could not have "lifted up his eyes"

In hell the soul of a certain man is in torment, punished in flames, suffering excruciating thirst, and imploring from the finger of a happier soul, for his tongue, the solace of a drop of water. [Luke 16:23-24] Do you suppose that this end of the blessed poor man and the miserable rich man is only imaginary? Then why the name of Lazarus in this narrative, if the circumstance is not in (the category of) a real occurrence? But even if it is to be regarded as imaginary, it will still be a testimony to truth and reality.
