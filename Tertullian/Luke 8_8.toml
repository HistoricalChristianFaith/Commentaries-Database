But there is that direct mode of His speaking to the people"Ye shall hear with the ear, but ye shall not understand" -which now claims notice as having furnished to Christ that frequent form of His earnest instruction: "He that hath ears to hear, let him hear." Not as if Christ, actuated with a diverse spirit, permitted a hearing which the Creator had refused; but because the exhortation followed the threatening.
