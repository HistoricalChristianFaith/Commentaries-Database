This he did in the best possible way, by receiving the Lord, and entertaining Him in his house. "When thou seest the naked cover him." This he promised to do, in an equally satisfactory way, when he offered the half of his goods for all works of mercy. So also "he loosened the bands of wickedness. undid the heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, and broke every yoke," when he said, "If I have taken anything from any man by false accusation, I restore him fourfold." Therefore the Lord said, "This day is salvation come to this house." Thus did He give His testimony, that the precepts of the Creator spoken by the prophet tended to salvation.
