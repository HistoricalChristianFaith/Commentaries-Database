Enemies can ever be reduced to peace. "Moreover "says he, "the law entered, that the offence might abound.".
And wherefore this? "In order "he says, "that (where sin abounded), grace might much more abound.".
Hy it were of God to bring only a moiety of man to salvation-and almost less than that; whereas the munificence of princes of this world always claims for itself the merit of a plenary grace! Then must the devil be understood to be stronger for injuring man, ruining him wholly? and must God have the character of comparative weakness, since He does not relieve and help man in his entire state? The apostle, however, suggests that "where sin abounded, there has grace much more abounded.".
For in this way "grace shall there much more abound, where sin once abounded."
