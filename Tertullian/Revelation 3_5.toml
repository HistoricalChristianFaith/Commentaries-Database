We have also in the Scriptures robes mentioned as allegorizing the hope of the flesh. Thus in the Revelation of John it is said, “These are they who have not defiled their clothes with women”—indicating, of course, virgins, and such as have become “eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven’s sake.” Therefore they shall be “clothed in white raiment,” that is, in the bright beauty of the unwedded flesh. In the Gospel even, “the wedding garment” may be regarded as the sanctity of the flesh. And so, when Isaiah tells us what sort of “fast the Lord has chosen,” he adds a statement about the reward of good works. He says, “Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your garments shall speedily arise,” where he has not thought of cloaks or clothing, but means the rising of flesh, of which he declared the resurrection, after its fall in death.
