You hold to the Scriptures in which the flesh is disparaged; receive also those in which it is ennobled. You read whatever passage abases it. Now direct your eyes also to that which elevates it. “All flesh is grass.” Well, but Isaiah was not content to say only this; he also declared, “All flesh shall see the salvation of God.” Then notice what God says in Genesis: “My spirit shall not remain among these men, because they are flesh”; but then he is also heard saying by Joel, “I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh.” Even the apostle ought not to be known for any one statement in which he is inclined to reproach the flesh. Admittedly he says that “in his flesh dwells no good thing” and “they who are in the flesh cannot please God,” because “the flesh lusts against the Spirit.” Yet in these and similar assertions that he makes, it is not the substance of the flesh, but its actions, which are censured. Moreover, we shall elsewhere take occasion to remark that no reproaches can fairly be cast upon the flesh without tending also to the castigation of the soul, which compels the flesh to do its bidding. However, let me meanwhile add that in the same passage Paul “carries about in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus.” He also forbids our body to be profaned, since it is “the temple of God.” He makes our bodies “the members of Christ.” And he exhorts us to exalt and “glorify God in our body.” If, therefore, the humiliations of the flesh do not prevent its resurrection, why wouldn’t its high prerogatives avail to bringing it about? It better suits the character of God to restore to salvation what for a while he rejected, than to surrender to perditions what he once approved.

We declare, then, that dreams are inflicted on us mainly by demons, although they sometimes turn out true and favorable to us. When, however, with the deliberate aim after evil, of which we have just spoken, they assume a flattering and captivating style, they show themselves proportionately vain, and deceitful, and obscure, and wanton, and impure. And no wonder that the images partake of the character of the realities. But from God—who has promised, indeed, “to pour out the grace of the Holy Spirit upon all flesh, and has ordained that his servants and his handmaids should see visions as well as utter prophecies”—must all those visions be regarded as emanating. [Those visions] may be compared with the actual grace of God, as being honest, holy, prophetic, inspired, instructive, inviting to virtue, the bountiful nature of which causes them to overflow even to the profane, since God, with grand impartiality, “sends his showers and sunshine on the just and on the unjust.”
