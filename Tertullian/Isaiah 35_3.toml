The sick of the palsy is healed, and that in public, in the sight of the people. For, says Isaiah, “they shall see the glory of the Lord and the excellence of our God.” What glory, and what excellence? “Be strong, you weak hands and feeble knees” refers to the palsy. “Be strong; fear not.” “Be strong” is not vainly repeated, nor is “fear not” vainly added; because with the renewal of the limbs there was to be, according to the promise, a restoration also of bodily energies: “Arise, and take up your couch”; and likewise moral courage not to be afraid of those who should say, “Who can forgive sins, but God alone?”
