God has promised that Christ will be a light and has declared that he himself is a lantern, searching the hearts and seats of affections.

The Pharisees, by justifying themselves before people, were placing in people their hope of reward. His rebuke to them had the same bearing as that of the prophet Jeremiah, “Cursed is the one who trusts in humankind.” He says next, “But God knows your hearts.” This was a reference to the power of that God who declared himself a shining light, “searching the hearts and the seats of emotions.” If he turns with hostility toward their pride, “what is exalted among people is an abomination in the sight of God,” he sets Isaiah in front of their eyes, “For the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and high.”
