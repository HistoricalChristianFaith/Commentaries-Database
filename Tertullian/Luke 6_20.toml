"because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.".
"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.".
To a Christian believer it is irksome to wed a believer inferior to herself in estate, destined as she will be to have her wealth augmented in the person of a poor husband! For if it is "the pour "not the rich, "whose are the kingdoms of the heavens"
