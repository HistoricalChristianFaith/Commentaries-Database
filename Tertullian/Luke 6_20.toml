But even now you have the Lord's sayings, as examples taking away from you all excuse. For what is it you say? "I shall be in need. "But the Lord calls the needy "happy.".
"because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.".
"Blessed are the needy, because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.".
To a Christian believer it is irksome to wed a believer inferior to herself in estate, destined as she will be to have her wealth augmented in the person of a poor husband! For if it is "the pour "not the rich, "whose are the kingdoms of the heavens"
