Where three people are gathered together, there is a church, even if all three are laypersons. For each individual lives by his own faith.

But where three are, a church is, albeit they be laics. For each individual lives by his own faith, nor is there exception of persons with God; since it is not hearers of the law who are justified by the Lord, but doers, according to what the apostle withal says.
