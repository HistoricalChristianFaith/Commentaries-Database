The next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But "some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come? '".
For useless must that conflict be deemed (which is sustained in a body) for which no resurrection is in prospect. "But some man will say, How are the dead to be raised? And with what body will they come? "
