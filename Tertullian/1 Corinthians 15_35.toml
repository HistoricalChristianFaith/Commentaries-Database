What, then, shall they do who are baptized for the body, if the body rises not again? We stand, then, on firm ground (when we say) that the next question which the apostle has discussed equally relates to the body. But "some man will say, `How are the dead raised up? With what body do they come?

And with what body will they come? " Now here he discusses the qualities of bodies, whether it be the very same, or different ones, which men are to resume.
