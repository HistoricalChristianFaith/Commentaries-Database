If, again, Christ in His advent from heaven "shall change the body of our humiliation, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body".
It was as full of this splendid example that Paul said: "Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto His glorious body."

If Christ coming from heaven will “transform the body of our humiliation into conformity with the body of his glory,” then this body of ours, which is humbled by sufferings and cast down into the earth by the very law of death, is the very body that will rise. For how will it be transformed if there is nothing?
