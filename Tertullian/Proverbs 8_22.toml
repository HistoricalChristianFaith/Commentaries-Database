This power and disposition of the divine intelligence is set forth also in the Scriptures under the name of sophia, “wisdom,” for what can be better entitled to the name of wisdom than the reason or the Word of God? Listen therefore to wisdom herself, constituted in the character of a Second Person: “At the first the Lord created me as the beginning of his ways, with a view to his own works, before he made the earth, before the mountains were settled; moreover, before all the hills he begat me”—that is to say, he created and generated me in his own intelligence.… By proceeding from himself he became his first-begotten Son, because begotten before all things; and his only-begotten also, because alone begotten of God, in a way peculiar to himself, from the womb of his own heart.

Since all things were made by the wisdom of God, it follows that when God made both the heaven and the earth in principio, that is to say “in the beginning,” he made them in his wisdom. If, indeed, beginning had a material signification, the Scripture would not have informed us that God made so and so in principio, at the beginning, but rather ex principio, of the beginning, for he would not have created “in,” but “of,” matter. When wisdom, however, was referred to, it was quite right to say, “in the beginning.”
