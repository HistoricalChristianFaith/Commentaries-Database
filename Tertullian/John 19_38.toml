Surely Joseph knew that what he handled with full respect was a body. This is that Joseph who had not consented with the Jews in their crime, the blessed man who did not enter the counsel of the ungodly or stand in the way of sinners, nor did he sit in the seat of mockers. It was right for him who buried the Lord to have been a subject of prophecy and now to be deservedly blessed.
