You must "seek "until you "find "and believe when you have found; nor have you anything further to do but to keep what you have believed provided you believe this besides, that nothing else is to be believed, and therefore nothing else is to be sought, after you have found and believed what has been taught by Him who charges you to seek no other thing than that which He has taught.
(to believe a lie), that they all might be judged who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness."
