Doctrine into suspicion, I will put in a defence, as it were, for Peter, to the effect that even Paul said that he was "made all things to all men-to the Jews a Jew "to those who were not Jews as one who was not a Jew-"that he might gain all.".
Their truth may be inferred from their agreement with the apostle's own profession, how "to the Jews he became as a Jew, that he might gain the Jews, and to them that were under the law, as under the law"-and so here with respect to those who come in secretly,-"and lastly, how he became all things to all men, that he might gain all."
