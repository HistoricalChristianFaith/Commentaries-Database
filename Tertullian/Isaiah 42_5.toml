And again, “who gave breath to the people on the earth and spirit to those walking on it.” For at first the soul, that is, “breath,” was given to the people who go around on the earth, that is, to those acting in flesh in a fleshly manner; then later the Spirit was given to those who walk on the earth, that is, those who subdue the works of the flesh, as the apostle affirms, “Not that which is spiritual first, but that which is animal and then that which is spiritual.” For although Adam from the beginning prophesied that great mystery in Christ and the church, “this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh, on which account a man will leave his father and mother and cleave to his wife and they two will become one flesh,” he was subject to a falling of the spirit.
