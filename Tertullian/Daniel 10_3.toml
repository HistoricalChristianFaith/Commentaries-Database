This abstinence Daniel used in order to please God by humiliation, and not for the purpose of producing a sensibility and wisdom for his soul previous to receiving communication by dreams and visions, as if it were not rather to effect such action in an ecstatic state. This “sobriety” … will have nothing to do with exciting ecstasy but will rather serve to recommend its being wrought by God.
