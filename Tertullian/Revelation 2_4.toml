You have sinned, yet you still can be reconciled. You have someone to whom you can make satisfaction, yes, and one who wills it. If you doubt that this is true, consider what the Spirit says to the churches. He charges the Ephesians with “having abandoned charity.” He reproaches the Thyatirenes with fornication and “eating food sacrificed to idols.” He accuses the Sardians of “works that are not complete.” He censures the people of Pergamos for teaching false doctrines. He upbraids the Laodiceans for “placing their trust in riches.” And yet he warns them all to repent—even adding threats. But he would not threaten the impenitent if he failed to pardon the penitent.
