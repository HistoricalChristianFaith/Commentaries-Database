Christ did not speak deceitfully but displayed all justice and humility. He did not suffer that kind of death [crucifixion] for anything he had done but so that those things that the prophets had predicted would happen to him through you as the very Spirit of Christ already foretold in the Psalms, saying, “They repaid me evil instead of good”; “What I had not taken, I repaid”;8 “They pierced my hands and feet”; “They put gall in my drink, and they satisfied my thirst with vinegar”;10 and “They cast lots for my clothing.” The other things that you would commit against him have also been foretold. He patiently endured and suffered all those things not for anything he had done but so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled that were spoken by the prophets.
