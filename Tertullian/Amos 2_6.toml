He might also have been betrayed by any stranger, did I not find that even here too he fulfilled a psalm: “He who did eat bread with me has lifted up his heel against me.” And without a price might he have been betrayed. For what need of a traitor was there in the case of one who offered himself to the people openly and might quite as easily have been captured by force as taken by treachery? This might, no doubt, have been well enough for another Christ but would not have been suitable in one who was accomplishing prophecies. For it was written, “The righteous one did they sell for silver.” The very amount and the destination of the money, which on Judas’s remorse was recalled “from its first purpose of a fee” and appropriated to the purchase of a potter’s field, as narrated in the Gospel of Matthew, were clearly foretold by Jeremiah: “And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him who was valued, and gave them for the potter’s field.”
