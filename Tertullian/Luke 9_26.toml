But "whosoever shall be ashamed of Me in the presence of men, of him will I too be ashamed "says He, "in the presence of my Father who is in the heavens.".
It is, however, a jealous God whom He here presents to me one who returns evil for evil. "For whosoever "says He, "shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.".
I am safe, if I am not ashamed of my Lord. "Whosoever "says He, "shall be ashamed of me, of him will I also be ashamed.".
How will he confess, fleeing? How flee, confessing? "Of him who shall be ashamed of Me, will I also be ashamed before My Father."
