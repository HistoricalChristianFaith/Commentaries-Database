To ourselves even does the apostle allow the concupiscible quality. "If any man "says he, "desireth the office of a bishop, he desireth a good work.".
Thence, therefore, among us the prescript is more fully and more carefully laid down, that they who are chosen into the sacerdotal order must be men of one marriage;.
Come, now, you who think that an exceptional law of monogamy is made with reference to bishops, abandon withal your remaining disciplinary titles, which, together with monogamy, are ascribed to bishops.
