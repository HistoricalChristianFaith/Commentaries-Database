"Be not thou, therefore, ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; " for he had said before: "For God hath not given us the spirit of fear, but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." For we suffer with power from love toward God, and with a sound mind, when we suffer for our blamelessness.
