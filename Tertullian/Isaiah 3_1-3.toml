Consider whether what follows in the prophet has not received its fulfillment: “The Lord of hosts has taken away from Judah and from Jerusalem, among other things, both the prophet and the wise craftsman”; that is, his Holy Spirit, who builds the church, which is indeed the temple, and household and city of God.… And so in this manner the law and the prophets were until John, but the dews of divine grace were withdrawn from the nation.
