These evidences, then, of a stricter discipline existing among us, are an additional proof of truth, from which no man can safely turn aside, who bears in mind that future judgment, when "we must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.
In this view it is that he informs us how "we must all appear before the judgement-seat of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in his body, according as he hath done either good or bad.".
God? But by mentioning both the judgment-seat and the distinction between works good and bad, he sets before us a Judge who is to award both sentences.
"That every one "as he goes on to say, "may receive the things done in his body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.".
Still, although liberated from their offices, they will be yet preserved for judgment, "that every one may receive the things done in his body."
