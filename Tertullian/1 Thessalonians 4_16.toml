Well, then, what difference is there between heathens and Christians, if the same prison awaits them all when dead? How, indeed, shall the soul mount up to heaven, where Christ is already sitting at the Father's right hand, when as yet the archangel's trumpet has not been heard by the command of God.
But he says (elsewhere), "We shall be caught up together with them in the clouds, to meet the Lord (in the air).".
Under the arms of prayer guard we the standard of our General; await we in prayer the angel's trump.
