The women, returning from the sepulcher and from this vision of the angels, were foreseen by Isaiah, when he says, “Come, you women, who return from the vision,” that is, “come” to report the resurrection of the Lord. It was well, however, that the unbelief of the disciples was so persistent, in order that to the last we might consistently maintain that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples as none other than the Christ of the prophets.
