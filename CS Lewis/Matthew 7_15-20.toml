The bad (natural) tree cannot produce good fruit. But oddly, it can produce fruits that by all external tests are indistinguishable from the good ones: the act done from one's own separate and unredeemed, tho' 'moral' will, looks exactly like the act done by Christ in us. And oddly enough it is the tree's real duty to go on producing these imitation fruits till it recognises this futility and despairs and is made a new (spiritual) tree. The trouble in the XVIth century was that Luther - who intuited the truth - was fundamentally an uneducated man, a peasant type: and really let the whole question get immediately entangled with political and ecclesiological questions which were really quite irrelevant to it. But the whole question must now be raised again.

What most people who talk about Reunion don't realise is that continental Protestantism regards the Church of England as still theologically 'un-reformed' and the Lutheran-Anglican gap is really at present at least as wide as the Anglical-Roman. It is thus a three cornered affair.
