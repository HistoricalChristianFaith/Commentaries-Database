You must be prepared for the unpleasant things and the discomforts... When you are training soldiers in maneuvers, you practice in blank ammunition because you would like them to have practice before meeting the real enemy. So we must practice in abstaining from pleasures which are not in themselves wicked. If you don't abstain from pleasure. you won't be good when the time comes along. It is purely a matter of practice.
