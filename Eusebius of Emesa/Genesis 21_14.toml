But was the just Abraham inhumane in that he did not even supply Hagar and the boy with a donkey, with all the cattle he possessed? Some say it was a gesture of kindness, so that she would not have to look after the donkey; others say that he did this believing that God would protect the boy. But why does he throw her out in the first place? Was it not that he wished to have peace with his wife? And indeed he really did not want to send her away at all, for it is written that the thing appeared extremely harsh to Abraham. So he would not have done what he did except for the fact that God said to him, let not this matter trouble you, etc.
