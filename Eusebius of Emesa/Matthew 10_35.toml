The Lord himself proclaims peace, which is why the apostle Paul also admonishes peace and says, “For he is our peace.” This means, of course, the peace of those who believe and receive. But in what way does he not bring peace to the earth? When the daughter believed and the father remained an unbeliever, “what has a believer in common with an unbeliever?” For the proclamation of peace caused a division. With a believing son and an unbelieving father there is necessarily strife. The peace that was proclaimed itself caused a division: a good division! For it is in peace that we are saved.
