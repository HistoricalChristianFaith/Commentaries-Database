The miracle of the bread revealed the one through whom the soil, when planted with seed, multiplies. What was done invisibly, once brought to light, proclaimed who it is that always works invisibly. It was not only at that time that Jesus with five loaves does many great things. In the world he was not idle or inactive but was always at work feeding everyone and taking nothing for himself. Because he was unknown, therefore, he came feeding, eating and feeding, so that through those things that are seen, he who was unseen might appear.
