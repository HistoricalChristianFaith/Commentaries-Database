Moreover, to distinguish still more clearly between them, we have, against the fear of office, a possible help in the law of obedience, inasmuch as God in his goodness rewards our faith, and makes a perfect ruler of the one who has confidence in him, and places all his hopes in him; but against the danger of disobedience I know of nothing which can help us, and of no ground to encourage our confidence. For we should fear that we will have to hear these words concerning those who have been entrusted to us: “I will require their souls at your hands”; and, “Because you have rejected me, and [have] not been leaders and rulers of my people, I also will reject you, that I should not be king over you”; and, “As you refused to listen to my voice, and turned a stubborn back, and were disobedient, so shall it be when you call upon me, and I will not regard nor hear your prayer.”
