The light shines in darkness, in this life and in the flesh, and is chased by the darkness but is not overtaken by it. By this I mean the adverse power leaping up in its shamelessness against the visible Adam but encountering God and being defeatedâ€”in order that we, putting away the darkness, may draw near to the Light and may then become perfect Light, the children of perfect Light.
