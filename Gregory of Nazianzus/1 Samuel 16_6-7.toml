Do not say, “I do not mind a mere priest, if he is a celibate, and a religious [person], and of angelic life; for it would be a sad thing for me to be defiled even in the moment of my cleansing.” Do not ask for credentials of the preacher or the baptizer. For another is his judge and the examiner of what you can’t see. For humans look on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart.
