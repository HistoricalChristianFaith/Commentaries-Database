I shall address my words to those whose cleverness is in words.… “Strife of words” is the term given to all elaborate verbiage by Paul, who proclaims and confirms the “short and final account,” Paul, the pupil and teacher of fishermen. These people I speak of have versatile tongues and are resourceful in attacking doctrines nobler and worthier than their own. I only wish they would display comparable energy in their actions.
