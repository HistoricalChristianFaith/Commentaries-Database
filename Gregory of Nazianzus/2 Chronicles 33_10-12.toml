I know of a fifth baptism also, which is that of tears and takes much more work. It is received by one who washes his bed every night and his couch with tears;6 whose bruises sting through his wickedness; and who goes about mourning and is of a sad disposition. It is received by one who imitates the repentance of Manasseh8 and the humiliation of the Ninevites upon whom God had mercy; who utters the words of the Publican in the Temple, and is justified rather than the stiff-necked Pharisee;10 who like the Canaanite woman bends down and asks for mercy and crumbs, the food of a dog that is very hungry.
