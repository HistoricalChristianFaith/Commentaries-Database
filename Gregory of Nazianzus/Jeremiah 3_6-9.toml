It is not only bodily sin that is called fornication and adultery, but any sin you have committed, and especially transgression against that which is divine. Perhaps you ask how we can prove this. “They prostituted themselves,” it says “with things they made.” Don’t you see an impudent act of fornication? And again, “They committed adultery with pieces of wood.” Don’t you see a kind of adulterous religion? Do not then commit spiritual adultery, while keeping your bodies chaste.
