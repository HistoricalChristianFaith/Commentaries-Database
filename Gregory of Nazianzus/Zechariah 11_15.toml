Such is my defense; its reasonableness I have set forth. And may the God of peace, who made both one15 and has restored us to each other, who sets kings upon thrones and raises up the poor out of the dust and lifts up the beggar from the dunghill, who chose David his servant and took him away from the sheepfolds, though he was the least and youngest of the sons of Jesse, who gave the word19 to those who preach the gospel with great power for the perfection of the gospelâ€”may he himself hold me by my right hand. [May he] guide me with his counsel and receive me with glory, who is a Shepherd21 to shepherds and Guide to guides. [May he guide us] that we may feed his flock with knowledge, not with the instruments of a foolish shepherd, according to the blessing, and not according to the curse pronounced against the men of former days. May he give strength and power to his people23 and himself present to himself  his flock resplendent and spotless and worthy of the fold on high, in the habitation of them that rejoice, in the splendor of the saints, so that in his temple everyone, both flock and shepherds together may say, Glory27 in Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be all glory forever and ever. Amen.
