Fairer in my eyes is the beauty that we can gaze on than that which is painted in words; of more value the wealth that our hands can hold, than that which is imagined in our dreams; and more real the wisdom of which we are convinced by deeds, than that which is set forth in splendid language. For “a good understanding,” he said, “have all they who act accordingly,” not they who proclaim it. Time is the best touchstone of this wisdom, and “the gray head is a crown of glory.”
