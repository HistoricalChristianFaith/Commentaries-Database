Every time is suitable for your ablution, since any time may be your death. With Paul I shout to you with that loud voice, “Behold now is the accepted time; behold now is the day of salvation”;56 and that now does not point to any one time but is every present moment. And again “Awake, you that sleep, and Christ shall give you light,” dispelling the darkness of sin. For as Isaiah says, “In the night hope is evil,” and it is more profitable to be received in the morning.
