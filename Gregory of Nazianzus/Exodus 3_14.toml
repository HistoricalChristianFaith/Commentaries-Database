As far then as we can reach, “He who is” and “God” are the special names of his essence; and of these especially “He who is,” not only because when he spoke to Moses in the mount, and Moses asked what his name was, this was what he called himself, bidding him say to the people, “I am has sent me,” but also because we find that this name is the more strictly appropriate. For the name theos [“God”], even if, as those who are skillful in these matters say, it were derived from theein [“to run”] or from aithein [“to blaze”], from continual motion, and because he consumes evil conditions of things (from which fact he is also called a consuming fire) would still be one of the relative names and not an absolute one, as again is the case with “Lord,” which also is called a name of God. “I am the Lord your God,” he says, “that is my name;” and “The Lord is his name.” But we are inquiring into a nature whose being is absolute and not [into being] bound up with something else. But being is in its proper sense peculiar to God and belongs to him entirely, and it is not limited or cut short by any before or after, for indeed in him there is no past or future.
