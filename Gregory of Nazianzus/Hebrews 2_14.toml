He surrenders his life, yet has the power to take it again. Yes, the veil is rent, for things of heaven are being revealed, rocks are being split, and dead men have an earlier awakening. He dies but he brings to life, and by death he destroys death. He is buried, yet he rises again. He goes down to hades, yet he leads souls up, ascends to heaven, and will come to judge the quick and dead.
