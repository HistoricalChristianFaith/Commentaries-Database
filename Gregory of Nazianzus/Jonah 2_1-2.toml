Do you praise the fearlessness of Elijah in speaking to tyrants and his translation in fire and the noble heritage of Elisha, the sheepskin mantle, accompanied by the spirit of Elijah? Then praise also the life of Basil passed in the midst of the fire, I mean in the multitude of temptations, and his preservation through fire which burned but did not consume, the miracle of the bush. Praise also the fair garment of skin, which came to him from on high, his fleshlessness. I shall omit other parallels, as the young men bedewed in the flames5 and the fugitive prophet praying in the belly of the fish and coming forth from the monster as from a chamber. I shall pass over the just man in the den, restraining the ferocity of lions, and the struggle of the seven Maccabees, who with a priest and their mother was perfected by blood and all kinds of tortures. Basil emulated their endurance and achieved their glory.
