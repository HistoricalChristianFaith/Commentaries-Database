This Spirit shares with the Son in working both the creation and the resurrection, as you may be shown by this Scripture: “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens made, and all the power of them by the breath of his mouth”; and this, “The Spirit of God that made me, and the breath of the Almighty teaches me”;61 and again, “You shall send forth your Spirit, and they shall be created, and you shall renew the face of the earth.” And he is the author of spiritual regeneration.
