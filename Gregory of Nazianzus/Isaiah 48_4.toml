Perchance he will say to me, who am not reformed even by blows, “I know that you are obstinate and your neck is an iron sinew, the heedless is heedless, and the lawless person acts lawlessly, and for nothing comes correction from heaven and the scourges.” The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed, as I once reprimanded you by the mouth of Jeremiah: “The founder melted the silver in vain; your wickednesses are not melted away.” … May it not be that I should ever, among other chastisements, be thus approached by him who is good, and yet by my own contrariness continue to walk against his goodness. This causes God to walk against me in fury.
