God, who gave the word to those who preach the gospel with great power for the perfection of the gospel, may he himself hold me by my right hand, and guide me with his counsel and receive me with glory. He is a shepherd to shepherds and a guide to guides that we may feed his flock with knowledge, not with the instruments of a foolish shepherd, according to the blessing, and not according to the curse pronounced against the people of former days. May he give strength and power to his people, and himself present them to himself.
