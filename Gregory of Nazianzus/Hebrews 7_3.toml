[[commentary]]
quote='''
The old has passed away,behold all things have been made anew.
The letter withdraws, the Spirit advances.
The shadows flee, the truth breaks in.
Melchizedek is summed up; the motherless becomes fatherless.
The first without a mother,
The second without a father,
The laws of nature are abrogated
that the cosmos above be brought to perfection.
