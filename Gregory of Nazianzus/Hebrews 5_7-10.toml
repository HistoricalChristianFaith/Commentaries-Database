Connected with this general view are the facts that he “learned obedience through what he suffered,” his “loud cries and tears,” the fact that he “offered up prayers,” that he “was heard” and he was “God-fearing.” These things are marvelously constructed drama dealing with us. As Word, he was neither obedient nor disobedient—the terms apply to amenable subordinates or inferiors who deserve punishment. But as the “form of a servant” he comes down to the same level as his fellow servants; receiving an alien “form,” he bears the whole of me, along with all that is mine, in himself, so that he may consume within himself the meaner element, as fire consumes wax or the sun ground mist, and so that I may share in what is his through the intermingling.
