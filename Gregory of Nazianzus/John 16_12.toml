The Word himself intimated that there were things that could not now be borne but that should be borne and cleared up hereafter, and that John the forerunner of the Word and great voice of the truth declared even the whole world could not contain.

Our Savior had some things that, he said, could not be borne at that time by his disciples (though they were filled with many teachings) … and therefore they were hidden. And again he said that all things should be taught by the Spirit when he would come to dwell among us. Of these things, one, I take it, was the deity of the Spirit himself, made clear later on when such knowledge should be seasonable and capable of being received after our Savior’s restoration.… For what greater thing than this did either he promise, or the Spirit teach?
