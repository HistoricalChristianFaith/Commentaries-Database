Jeremiah was known before he was formed, and sanctified from the womb. … He longs for water over his head and a fountain of tears for his eyes that he may adequately weep for Israel. No less does he lament the depravity of its rulers. God speaks to him to rebuke the priests: “The priests did not say, ‘Where is the Lord?’ Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers transgressed against me.” Again he says to him, “The shepherds are stupid, and do not inquire of the LORD; therefore they have not prospered, and all their flock is scattered.” Again, “Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have trampled down my portion, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness.” He further attacks the pastors again: “ ‘Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture!’ says the LORD. Therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the shepherds who care for my people: ‘You have scattered my flock, and have driven them away, and you have not attended to them. Behold, I will attend to you for your evil doings, says the LORD.’ ” - "In Defense of His Flight to Pontus, Oration 2.67–68"
