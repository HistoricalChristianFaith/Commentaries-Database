I will remind you again about Illuminations, and that often, and will reckon them up from holy Scripture. For I myself shall be happier for remembering them (for what is sweeter than light to those who have tasted light?). I will dazzle you with my words: “There is sprung up a light for the righteous, and its partner joyful gladness.” And, “The light of the righteous is everlasting”;8 and “You are shining wondrously from the everlasting mountains” is said to God, I think of the angelic powers that aid our attempts to do good. You have heard David’s words: “The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear?” Now he asks that the Light and the Truth may be sent forth for him, now giving thanks that he has a share in it, in that the Light of God is marked on him; that is, that the signs of the illumination given are impressed on him and recognized.
