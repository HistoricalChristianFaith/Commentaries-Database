Even at this moment he is, as man, interceding for my salvation, until he makes me divine by the power of his incarnate humanity. “As man,” I say, because he still has with him the body he assumed, though he is no longer “regarded as flesh”—meaning the bodily experiences, which, sin aside, are ours and his. This is the “Advocate” we have in Jesus—not a slave who falls prostrate before the Father on our behalf. Get rid of what is really a slavish suspicion, unworthy of the Spirit. It is not in God to make that demand nor in the Son to submit to it; the thought is unjust to God. No, it is by what he suffered as man that he persuades us, as Word and Encourager, to endure. That, for me, is the beginning of his “advocacy.”
