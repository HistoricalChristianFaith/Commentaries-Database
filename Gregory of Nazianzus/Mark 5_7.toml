Yes, he is recognized by demons, drives out demons, drowns deep a legion of spirits and sees the prince of demons falling like lightning. He is stoned, yet not hit; he prays yet he hears prayer. He weeps, yet he puts an end to weeping. He asks where Lazarus is—he was man; yet he raises Lazarus—he was God. Oration , On the Son
