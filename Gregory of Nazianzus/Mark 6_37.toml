As man he was put to the test, but as God he came through victorious— yes, he bids us be of good cheer, because he has conquered the world. He hungered—yet he fed thousands. He is indeed “living, heavenly bread.” He thirsted—yet he exclaimed: “Whoever thirsts, let him come to me and drink.” Indeed he promised that believers would become fountains. Oration , On the Son
