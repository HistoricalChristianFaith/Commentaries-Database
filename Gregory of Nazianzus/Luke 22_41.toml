“Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless let not what I will but your will prevail.” It is unlikely that he did not know whether it was possible or not, or that he would oppose the Father’s will. This is the language of him who came down and assumed our nature. However, this is not the language of human nature…. The passage does not mean that the Son has a special will of his own besides that of the Father but that he does not have a special will. The meaning would be, “Not to do mine own will, for there is none of mine apart from, but that which is common to me and you. Since we have one Godhead, so we have one will.” Oration, On the Son.
