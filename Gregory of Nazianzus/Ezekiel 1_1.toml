What would you say of Isaiah or Ezekiel, who was an eyewitness of very great mysteries, and of the other prophets: for one of these saw the Lord of Sabaoth sitting on the throne of glory and encircled and praised by the six-winged seraphim, and was himself purged by the live coal and equipped for his prophetic office; and the other describes the cherubic chariot of God, and the throne on them, and the firmament over it, and him that showed himself in the firmament, and voices and forces and deeds. And whether this was an appearance by day, only visible to saints, or an unerring vision of the night, or an impression on the mind holding converse with the future as if it were the present or some other ineffable form of prophecy, I cannot say; the God of the prophets knows, and they know who are thus inspired.
