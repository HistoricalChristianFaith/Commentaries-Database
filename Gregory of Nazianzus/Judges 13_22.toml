Must you not show respect for Manoah, the Old Testament judge.… Manoah was overwhelmed by the sight of God in a vision. “Wife,” he said, “we are lost, we have seen God”—meaning by this that even a vision of God is too much for human beings, let alone God’s nature. - "Theological Orations 2 (28).19"
