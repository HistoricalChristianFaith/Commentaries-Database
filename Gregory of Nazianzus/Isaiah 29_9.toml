What are we to do now, my brothers, when crushed, cast down and drunk but not with strong drink or with wine, which excites and obfuscates but for a while, but with the blow which the Lord has inflicted upon us? He says, “And you, O heart, be stirred and shaken, and gives to the despisers the spirit of sorrow and deep sleep to drink.” To [them] he also says, “See, you despisers, behold, and wonder and perish.” How shall we bear his convictions; or what reply shall we make, when he reproaches us not only with the multitude of the benefits for which we have continued ungrateful, but also with his chastisements, and reckons up the remedies with which we have refused to be healed?
