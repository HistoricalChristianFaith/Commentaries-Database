[Where] do you get those fortresses of yours, “ingenerate” and “unoriginate,” from—or where the term “immortal”? Show us the express words, or we cross them out as unscriptural, and you will be dead as a result of your own principles, since the words, the wall of defense you trusted in, will have been destroyed. Is it not plain that these terms derived from passages that imply, without actually mentioning them? Which passages? What about “I am the first, and I am hereafter,” and “Before me there is no other God and after me there shall be none,” “for everything that exists” [God is saying] “is mine, without beginning or ending”? You have taken the truths that there is nothing before God and that he has no prior case, and you have given him the titles “unoriginate” and “ingenerate.” The fact that there is no halt to his ongoing existence means he is “immortal” and “indestructible.”
