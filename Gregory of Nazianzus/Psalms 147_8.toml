They must suppose that our ancestors went down into Egypt without bodies and invisible and that only the soul of Joseph was imprisoned by Pharaoh, because it is written, “They went down into Egypt with threescore and fifteen souls,” and “The iron entered into his soul,” a thing that could not be bound. They who argue thus do not know that such expressions are used by synecdoche, declaring the whole by the part, as when Scripture says that the young ravens call on God, to indicate the whole feathered race; or Pleiades, Hesperus and Arcturus are mentioned, instead of all the stars and his providence over them.
