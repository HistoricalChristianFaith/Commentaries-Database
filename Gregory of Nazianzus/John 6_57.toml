All things that the Father has are the Son’s. On the other hand, all that belongs to the Son is the Father’s. Nothing then is unique to either one, because all things are in common. For their being [essence] itself is common and equal, even though the Son receives it from the Father. It is in this respect … that it is said, “I live by the Father,” not as though his life and being were kept together by the Father but because he has his being from him beyond all time and beyond all cause.
