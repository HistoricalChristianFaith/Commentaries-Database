I believe that if He is given the name ‘Son’, it is because He is of the same essence as the Father and also because He comes from the Father… He is called Logos (Word) because He is, in relation to the Father, what the word is to the mind… The Son makes known the nature of the Father quickly and easily, because everything begotten is an unspoken definition of the one who got it. If, on the other hand, we wish to call Him ‘Word’ because He is in everything, we shall not be mistaken: did not the Word create all that is?… He is called ‘Life’… because He gives life to everything. Indeed, ‘in Him we live and move and have our being’ (Acts 17.28)… It is from Him that we all receive the breath of life and the Holy Spirit Whom our soul contains to the limit of its openness. - "Fourth Theological Oration, 20-21"
