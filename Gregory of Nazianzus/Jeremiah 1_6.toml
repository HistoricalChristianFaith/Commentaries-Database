I resort once again to history. When I consider the men of best repute in ancient days, who were ever preferred by grace to the office of ruler or prophet, I discover that some readily complied with the call while others deprecated the gift. I also learn that those who drew back were not blamed for their timidity, nor were those who came forward accused of being too eager. The former stood in awe of the greatness of the ministry; the latter trustfully obeyed him who called them. Aaron was eager, but Moses resisted; Isaiah readily submitted, but Jeremiah was afraid of his youth and did not venture to prophesy until he had received from God a promise and a power beyond his years. - "In Defense of His Flight to Pontus, Oration 2.114"

It is a good thing even to hold back from God for a little while—as did the great Moses in ancient times, and Jeremiah later on—and then to run readily to him when he calls. This is what Aaron and Isaiah did—as long as both are done with a respectful spirit. Do the former because you lack strength. Do the latter because of the power of God who calls you. - "On Easter and His Reluctance, Oration 1.1"
