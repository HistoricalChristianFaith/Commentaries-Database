[[commentary]]
quote='''
The Spirit came after Christ so that we would not lack a Comforter. But he is called “another” Comforter so that you might acknowledge his co-equality. For this word another defines an alter ego, a name of equal lordship, not of inequality. We do not use the word another for different kinds of things but for those that are consubstantial.
