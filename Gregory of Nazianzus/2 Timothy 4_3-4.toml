For there are certain persons who have not only their ears and their tongues but even, as I now perceive, their hands too, itching for words. They delight in profane babblings, and oppositions of science falsely so called, and strifes about words, which tend to no profit. Paul is the preacher and establisher of the “Word cut short.” The teacher of the fishermen calls to question all that is excessive or superfluous in discourse.
