This grace we receive from [Christ’s] fullness always in proportion to our progress. Therefore, the one who keeps sacred the whole meaning of the Word of God’s becoming incarnate for our sake will acquire the glory full of grace and truth of the one who for our sake glorifies and consecrates himself in us by his coming. “When he appears we shall be like him.”
