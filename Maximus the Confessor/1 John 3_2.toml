Is there any connection between what John says here and what Paul says when he writes: “God has revealed it to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God”? What then shall we be like? The answer is that here John says that he does not know what form the coming deification through the virtues of faith will take for those who are children of God here on earth now. The independently existing nature of the good things to come has not yet been revealed in detail. Here on earth we walk by faith, not by sight. Paul on the other hand says that through revelation we have received the divine promise concerning the good things which are to come but does not claim to know what these are in any detail. Thus he says quite clearly that he examines himself and pursues the higher calling as far as he understands what it is. Any contradiction between the two apostles is merely apparent, not real, because they are both inspired by the same Spirit.
