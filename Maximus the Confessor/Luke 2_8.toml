US; But if perhaps the swaddling clothes are mean in your eyes, admire the Angels singing praises together If you despises&#8221; tile manger, raise your eyes a little, and behold the new star in heaven proclaiming to the world the Lord's nativity. If you believe the mean things, believe also the mighty. If you dispute about those which betoken His lowliness, look with reverence on what is high and heavenly.
