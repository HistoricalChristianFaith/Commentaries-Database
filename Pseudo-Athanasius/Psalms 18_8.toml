In this and the following verses, he posits as a sign the smoke, which in his descent from heaven he made as darkness under his feet; it indicates the incomprehensibility of his dispensation. And in his ascension, he flew on the wings of the Spirit, as on cherubim, that is, the cloud that received him. And because in his church, which is his tabernacle, he mysteriously dwells and operates, he says, “He set darkness as his hiding place.” Again, because the remarks about him are made obscurely in the holy prophets, he writes, “Dark waters in the clouds of the airs,” which he showed to be clear and obvious when he openly came to earth.
