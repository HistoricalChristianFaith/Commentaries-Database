Even not to do good is wrong. For if one sees that one’s neighbor is in danger of starvation, does one not kill him if, while one has an abundance, one does not give him food, though one has not used up one’s own provisions? For anyone who is able to help someone close to death in whatever situation of need kills that person if he does not come to his aid.
