God commanded that all the Gentiles obey and acknowledge God. He alone knew that this would one day happen, for he alone is naturally wise just as he is naturally good. Mankind is also called good, it is true, but we have the ability to be good or wise as a result of instruction, whereas God is good and wise by nature. To him be glory and honor through Jesus Christ forever. Amen.
