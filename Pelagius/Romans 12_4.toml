Paul exhorts them to live in harmony by comparing them with the body, in case they are not roused by the fact that they have received different gifts. For as individuals they could not have had all the gifts, for then they might have become proud.… Nor could they all have the same gift, for then the likeness of the body of Christ would not be present among us.
