[[commentary]]
quote='''
Do not deny your enemy what God denies no one, even if he is a godless blasphemer. When he realizes that coals have been heaped upon him through your undeserved mercy, he may shake them off, that is, repent, and may love you whom at one time he hated. Otherwise it is not mercy but cruelty, if you show mercy so that something worse might befall him, for whom you are called to intercede to the Lord.
