You are in the Spirit because you are occupied with spiritual things. The Spirit of God dwells in those in whom his fruit is manifest, as Paul says to the Galatians: “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, etc.” The Spirit of Christ, who loved his enemies and prayed for them, is the Spirit of humility, patience and all the virtues.
