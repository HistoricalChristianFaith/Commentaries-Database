If you obeyed those you should not have obeyed, how much more should you obey us! For this is why these people came to you, because they knew that you could readily be led astray by unsuspecting obedience. I rejoice with you, because obedience is good only if it is reasonable. I want you to be wise in what is good, so that by being ignorant of evil you may bring the enemy down under the feet of innocence.
