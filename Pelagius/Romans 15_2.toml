Let us be commended not by ourselves but by our neighbors, just as Paul sets his own example before us elsewhere when he says: “Just as I try to please all men in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage but that of many, that they may be saved.” For nobody can build up another person if he has not first attracted him by his good life. But those who do their own will, because they are seeking their own advantage, are pleasing themselves. Paul indicates how and why we should please, so that we do not do it for worthless glory.
