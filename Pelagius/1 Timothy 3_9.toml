The mystery of faith is the passion of Christ, out of which comes the redeeming process by which our salvation is won. “The clear conscience” refers to the fact that the person who knows this mystery purely is not confounded by the spectacle of Christ’s humiliation, or, it means that this mystery should be preached straightforwardly, piety not requiring anything beyond the statement itself.
