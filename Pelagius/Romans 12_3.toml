Since Paul is about to disallow human wisdom that goes beyond the law, he declares that he is not speaking his own mind but by the authority of a spiritual gift. He is writing to all those who are priests or teachers, whose example the others follow.One who searches into matters of which the law does not speak is trying to be wiser. That is why Solomon says: “Do not enquire after things higher than yourself and do not search after things greater than yourself but think always on the things that God has commanded you.” Note that Paul calls the Holy Spirit God, for to the Corinthians he declares that the Holy Spirit apportions gifts to each person as he wishes. A charismatic power, which only believers receive, is to be regarded as a measure of faith.
