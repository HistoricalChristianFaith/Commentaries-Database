[[commentary]]
quote='''
Do not become slow and lazy in God’s work out of concern for the world. The Lord does not love those who are unresponsive and is nauseated by those who are lukewarm. If we are resistant to the world we then manifestly glow with the Spirit, doing all things not for the world or its vices but for the Lord.
