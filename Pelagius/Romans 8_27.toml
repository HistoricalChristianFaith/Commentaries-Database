Paul has called a gift of the Spirit “the Spirit.” … He makes us request with groans which cannot be described, just as God is said to tempt us in order to know, i.e., in order to make us know, what kind of people we are. Even in popular usage the master is said to accomplish what he orders to be done by others, as in statements like “he built a house” or “he wrote a book,” though he neither built nor wrote.
