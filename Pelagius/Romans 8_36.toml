We suffer not for any crime but for the sake of him who said: “Blessed are you when men shall persecute you, etc.” This is especially fulfilled in Christians, for we are not permitted to defend ourselves but must endure all attacks with the greatest patience, according to the example of our Lord and teacher, who was led like a sheep to the slaughter.
