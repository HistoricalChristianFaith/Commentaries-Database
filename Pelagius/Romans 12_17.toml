[[commentary]]
quote='''
It is human wisdom if you seek to repay your enemies in turn, for it is foolishness in this world if, having been struck, you offer the other cheek as well. But if you have such great patience and humility, you will be found praiseworthy not only in the Lord’s eyes but also in the eyes of all people. Take care not to act so that you seek to please not God but only other people.
