In Jerusalem there were saints who had sold all their possessions and laid them at the feet of the apostles, devoting themselves to prayer, reading and teaching. It is clear from this text that their character was such that Paul is traveling in order to attend them in person, and he hopes that his offering will be received by them … thereby showing that it is more blessed to give than to receive.
