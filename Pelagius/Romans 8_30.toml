Those whom God knew in advance would believe, he called. A call gathers together those who are willing to come, not those who are unwilling.… Paul says this because of the enemies of the faith, in order that they may not judge God’s grace to be arbitrary. They are called to believe through preaching and are justified through baptism when they believe, and are glorified with spiritual powers now or in the resurrection to come.
