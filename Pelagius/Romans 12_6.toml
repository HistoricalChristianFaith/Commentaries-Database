The gift does not depend upon us but upon the one who gives it. The glory to come is promised to all who believe, but the person who has a heart so pure that he deserves it receives the charismatic power which God has chosen for him even in this life.If we receive prophecy, it is according to faith, not the law. Or perhaps this means that faith deserves it. For each one receives as much as he believes.
