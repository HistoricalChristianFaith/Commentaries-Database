The mystery of the calling of all the Gentiles, which through Paul’s gospel, using the testimonies of the prophets, had now been plainly disclosed in Christ, had long been hidden in the law. Although the prophets had said many things about the Gentiles, none had recognized as clearly as Paul how Gentiles and Jews would become one in Christ. For they had been able to determine that some should be admitted to the faith as proselytes.
