Taxes can also mean taxes for the priests, which were set up for them by God. Or this may mean that you pay taxes to rulers because, in possessing the world, you subjected yourselves to them willingly. Paul calls them “God’s servants,” so that people might render to them what they owe, lest it seem that Christ taught his followers pride.
