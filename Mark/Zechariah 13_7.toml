And when they had sung an hymn, they went out into the mount of Olives.  And Jesus saith unto them, All ye shall be offended because of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered. [Zechariah 13:7] But after that I am risen, I will go before you into Galilee.
