And Jesus answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the scribes that Christ is the Son of David?  For David himself said by the Holy Ghost, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool. [Psalms 110:1] David therefore himself calleth him Lord; and whence is he then his son? And the common people heard him gladly.
