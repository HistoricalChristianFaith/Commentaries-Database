But he ascended to the summit, either by the cross or by the assumption of heaven, which is even more important, as is clear from what follows. But what captivity does he mean? The captivity of the devil: for he captured the devil, and death, and curse, and sin, and we, subject to the devil, are now liable. But what does 'he ascended' mean except that he also descended to the lower regions, that is, the earth? He who descended is the same one who ascended far above all the heavens, in order to fill all things. In discussing humility here, Paul presents Christ as an example, as he does in his letter to the Philippians: "Just as he did not refuse to descend, so you should not refuse to humble yourselves." For it is clear from the prophet that he who ascended also descended. When we speak of God ascending, we must first understand that he descended; this is not the case with human beings. But where did he descend? To the depths, which are commonly called the lowest parts of the earth, just as Jacob said, "You will bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave," and David said, "I am like those who go down to the pit." He descended to the lowest parts, beyond which there is nothing else, and ascended far above all, beyond which is nothing. His descent did not prevent him from ascending. Therefore, if you humble yourselves, you will be exalted. For this reason, he fills all things with his dominion and power, and does so in the flesh, since he had already filled everything with his divinity. This is what Paul is arguing against Samosata and Nestorius. For he who descended, it is clear that even though he was in the heavens, he descended through incarnation to the earth and, through death, to the depths, and he is one and the same, not different.
