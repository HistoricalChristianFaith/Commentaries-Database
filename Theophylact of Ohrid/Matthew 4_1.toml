Teaching us that it is especially after our baptism that we should expect temptations, He is led up by the Holy Spirit; for He did nothing apart from the Holy Spirit. He is led into the wilderness to show us that the devil tempts us when he sees us alone and without help from others. Therefore we must not put our trust in ourselves without any counsel from others. 

The devil is called "the slanderer" because he slandered God to Adam, saying, "God envies you." And even now among us the devil slanders virtue.
