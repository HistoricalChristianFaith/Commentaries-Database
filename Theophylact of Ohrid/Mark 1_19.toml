As the Evangelist John relates, Peter and Andrew were disciples of the Forerunner, but seeing that John had borne witness to Jesus, they joined themselves to him; afterwards, grieving that John had been cast into prison, they returned to their trade. Wherefore there follows, “casting nets into the sea, for they were fishers. "Look then upon them, living on their own labours, not on the fruits of iniquity; for such men were worthy to become the first disciples of Christ; whence it is subjoined, “And Jesus said unto them, Come yeafter Me.”Now He calls them for the second time; for this is the second calling in respect of that, of which we read in John. But itis shown to what they were called, when it is added, “I will make you become fishers of men.”.
For we must not allow anytime to lapse, but at once follow the Lord. After these again, He catches James and John, because they also, though poor, supported the old age of theirfather.Wherefore there follows, “And when He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James, the son of Zebedee”.
We must know also, that action is first called, then contemplation; for Peter is the type of the active life, for he was more ardent than the others, just as the active life is the more bustling; but John is the type of the contemplative life, for he speaks more fully of divine things.
