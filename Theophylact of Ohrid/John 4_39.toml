The Samaritans believed because of the woman's own words, wisely determining among themselves that she would not have exposed the secrets of her life in order to please another, unless the Man Whom she proclaimed were truly great and extraordinary. Therefore, showing their faith by their works, they asked Him to live with them always. For the word tarry [meinai] means "to make one's home" among them. But they did not persuade Him, and He stayed there only two days, during which time many more believed because of His teaching. The Evangelist does not need to tell us the particular words of His marvelous teaching: merely stating the end result allows us to sense their divine power. Often the Evangelists omit many of His great deeds and words, because they do not write in order to make a grandiose display of His life, but simply to declare the truth. By His mere presence among the Samaritans, the Lord is also teaching something more profound: without any sign or miracle, they believed and begged Him to live with them. But the Jews, when given ten thousand signs and miracles, drove Him away, for those in his house shall be all a man's enemies. [Micah 7:6] See how quickly the multitude outdid the woman who taught them. They do not call Him "prophet," or "Saviour of Israel," but, the Saviour of the world, using the definite article which indicates, "This is the Saviour," Who essentially and in actuality saves all mankind. There have been many who came to save—lawgivers, prophets, angels—but this One is the true Saviour.
