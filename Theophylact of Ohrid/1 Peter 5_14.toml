This is no ordinary peace, for it is the same peace that Christ left his disciples when he went to be crucified. “My peace I leave with you, not as the world gives,” for you are not meant to pursue peace by natural affection for one another but by being joined in a holy fellowship, thereby avoiding the blows of enemies.
