If this had been the time foran eclipse, some one might have said that this which happened was natural, butit was the fourteenth moon, when no eclipse can take place. There follows: “And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani.”.
Or, He speaks this as man crucified by God for me, for we men have been forsaken by the Father, but Henever has. For hear what He says; “I am not along, because the Father is with me.” that the Scriptures might be fulfilled. They however applied asponge full of vinegar to His mouth.
He who both rules over death and commands it dies with power, as its Lord. But what this voice was is declared by Luke: “Father, into Thy hands I commend My Spirit.” For Christ would have us understand by this, that from that time the souls of the saints go up into the hands of God. For at first the souls of all were held in hell, till He came, who preached the opening of the prison to the captives.
