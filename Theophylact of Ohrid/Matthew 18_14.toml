. What man had a hundred sheep? Christ. For all of the reason-endowed creation, both angels and men, are the hundred sheep, of which Christ is the shepherd, not another sheep. For He is not a creature but the Son of God. So He left the ninety and nine in the heavens, and taking on the form of a servant He came to seek the one sheep, which is the fallen human nature. And He rejoices more over it than over the steadfastness of the angels. This shows in a few words how diligently God pursues the conversion of sinners, and rejoices more over them than over those who are constant in virtue.
