"Babbling" means praying foolishly, as when someone asks for such worldly things as fame, wealth, or victory. "Babbling" is also inarticulate, childish speech. Therefore you, O reader, must not pray foolishly. 

is not necessary to make long prayers, but rather short and frequent prayers, uttering few words, but persevering in prayer.
