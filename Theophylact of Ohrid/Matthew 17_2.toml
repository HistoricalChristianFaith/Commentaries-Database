He brings them up onto a high mountain, showing that unless a man is raised up high, he does not become worthy of such divine visions. A mountain set "apart," because Christ would often perform the most wondrous of His miracles in secret, lest the multitude see Him as God and think that He was human in appearance only. When you hear "He was transfigured," do not think that He had cast off His body at that moment, for His body remained in its own form, as you hear mention of His face and His clothing. But it appeared more resplendent, the divine exhibiting in small part its effulgence as much as they were able to see. This is why He had also previously spoken of the Transfiguration as "the kingdom" of God (Mt 16:28), for it exhibited the indescribable majesty of His power, it showed that He is the true Son of the Father, and it had the aspect of the second coming on account of the ineffable radiance of Jesusâ€™ face.
