But the Lord seeks to avoid glory the more it followed Him, and therefore separating Himself from the multitude, He entered into a ship, as it is said, And he saw two ships standing near the lake: but the fishermen were gone out of them, and were washing their nets.

Behold the gentleness of Christ; He asks Peter; and the willingness of Peter, who was obedient in all things.
