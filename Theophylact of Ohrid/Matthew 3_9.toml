This was to their destruction, that they put their trust in their noble lineage. 

The "stones" mean the Gentiles, many of whom believed; but John is also saying simply that God is able to make children for Abraham out of stones. For the womb of Sarah was a stone on account of her sterility, but she gave birth nevertheless (Gen. 18:11-12; 21:1-2). When also did the Lord raise up children unto Abraham from stones? At His crucifixion, when many believed upon seeing the stones which were sundered (Mt. 27:51).
