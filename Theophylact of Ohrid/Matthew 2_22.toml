Herod left three sons: Philip, Antipas, and Archelaus. He had directed Archelaus to be king, and the other two, tetrarchs. Joseph was afraid to go into the land of Israel, that is, Judea, because Archelaus was similar to Herod, his father. Antipas was the young Herod who slew the Forerunner. 

 Galilee was not of the land of Israel, but of the Gentiles, and for this reason the Jews considered the Galileans an abomination.
