The vainglory of soldiers, ever rejoicing in disorder and in insult, here displayed what properly belonged to them. Wherefore it is said, “And the soldiers led Him away into the hall called Praetorium, and they call together the whole band,” that is, the whole company of the soldiers, “and they clothed Him with purple as a king.”.
Let us also put on the blue and royal robe, because we must walk as kings treading on serpents and scorpions, and having sin under our feet. For we are called Christians, that is, anointed ones, just as kings were then called anointed. Let us also take upon ourselves the crown of thorns, that is, let us make haste to be crowned with a strict life, with self-denials and purity.
