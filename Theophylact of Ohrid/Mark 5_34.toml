After the miracle of the demoniac, the Lord works another miracle, namely, in raising up the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue; the Evangelist, before narrating this miracle, says, “And when Jesus was passed over again by ship unto the other side, much people gathered unto Him.”.
Now this man was faithful inpart, inasmuch as he fell at the feet of Jesus, but in that he begged of Him to come, he did not show as much faith as he ought. For he ought to have said, ‘Speak the word only, and my daughter shall be healed. 'There follows, “And He went away with him, and much people followed Him, and thronged Him; and a woman, which had an issue of blood twelve years "There follows, “For she said, “If I may but touch His clothes, I shall be whole.”.
Most faithful indeed is this woman, who hoped for healing from His garments. For which reason she obtainshealth.Wherefore it goes on, “And straightway the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed.”.
For the Lord wished to declare the woman, first to give His approbation to her faith, secondly to urge the chief of the synagogue to a confident hope that He could thus cure his child, and also to free the woman from fear. For the woman feared because she had stolen health.
But He saith to her, “Go in peace,” that is, in rest, which means, go and have rest, for up to this timethou hast been in pains and torture.
