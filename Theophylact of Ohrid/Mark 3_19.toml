Luke, however, says that He went up to pray, for after the shewing forth of miracles He prays, teaching us that we should give thanks, when we obtain any thing good, and refer it to Divine grace.
Further, He gives the names of the Apostles, that the true Apostles might be known, so that men might avoid the false. And therefore it continues: “And Simon He surnamed Cephas.”.
Whom he reckons amongst the Apostles, that we may learn that God does not repel any man for wickedness, which is future, but counts him worthy on account of his present virtue.
