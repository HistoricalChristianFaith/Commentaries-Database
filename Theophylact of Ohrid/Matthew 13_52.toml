. Do you see how the parables have made them more attentive? For behold, they who before were unthinking and unlearned have understood these difficult things that were spoken. Therefore the Saviour praises them and says "every scribe." He calls them scribes, students of the law, but though they were students of the law, they did not remain within the law, but were instructed in the kingdom, that is, in the knowledge of Christ, and they are able to speak of both the old and the new. The householder, then, is Christ, the rich man. For in Him are the treasures of wisdom. He taught new things and then brought forward testimony from the old. For example, He said, "You will be called to account for every idle word" (Mt. 12:36) — this is new. Then He brought forward testimony, "By your words you will be judged and condemned" (Mt. 12:37; cf. Lk. 19:22, Job 15:6) — this is the old. In this the apostles were similar, for Paul says, "Be ye imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (I Cor. 4:16).
