Or else the Lord warns His disciples to be as light, in their life and conversation; as if He said, As acandle is put so as to give light, so all will look to your life. Therefore be diligent to lead a good life; sit not in corners, but be ye a candle. For acandle gives light, not when placed under a bed, but on a candlestick; this light indeed must be placed on a candlestick, that is, on the eminence of agodly life, that it may be able to give light to others. Not under a bushel, that is, in things pertaining to the palate, nor under a bed, that is, in idleness. For no one who seeks after the delights of his palate and loves restcan be a light shining over all.But he puts his light on a candlestick who employs his body in the ministry of the word of God; therefore under these words He typically teaches them a figure of preaching. Wherefore it goes on, “For there is nothing hidden, which shall not be revealed, nor is there any thing made secret, which shall not come abroad. "As if He said, Be not ashamed of the Gospel, but amidst the darkness of persecution raise the light of the word of God upon the candlestick of your body, keeping fixedly in your mind that day, when the Lord will throw light upon the hidden places of darkness, for then everlasting praise awaits you, and everlasting punishment your adversaries.
For each of us, whether hehave done good or evil, is brought to light in this life, much more in that which is to come. For what can be more hidden than God, nevertheless He Himself is manifested in the flesh. It continues, “If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.”.
That is, that none of those things which are said to you by me should escape you. "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you,” that is, whatsoever degree of application ye bring, in that degree ye will receive profit.
