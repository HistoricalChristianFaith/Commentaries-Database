. He was brought to Pilate accused of crimes against the state, which is why Pilate asked Him if He had fomented an insurrection or attempted to make Himself king of the Jews. But Jesus said to him, "Thou sayest," giving a most wise answer. For He neither said that He was or that He was not, but He said, somewhere between the two, "Thou sayest." For this could be interpreted either as "I am what you say," or, "I do not say it, but you do." He gave no other answer, however, for He knew that the tribunal was an unjust proceeding. Pilate marveled at the Lord because He scorned death, and because, though He was eloquent and could have said a myriad of things in His own defense, He made no answer and disregarded His accusers. May we also learn from this to say nothing when we are brought before a corrupt court lest we cause a greater stir and provoke those who refuse to hear our defense to condemn us all the more.
