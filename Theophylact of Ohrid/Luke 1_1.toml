The divine Luke, an Antiochian and a physician, had a great knowledge of natural philosophy; but he was also much practiced in Hebrew learning. He lived in Jerusalem at the time when our Lord was teaching, so that some say that he himself became one of the seventy apostles, and together with Cleopas, met the Lord after He rose from the dead. After the Lord ascended, and Paul believed, Luke became a close companion and follower of Paul. He wrote his Gospel with great accuracy, as his preface makes clear. He wrote the Gospel fifteen years after the Lordâ€™s Ascension. He writes it to a certain Theophilus, a senator and perhaps a magistrate as well, calling him most excellent. Magistrates and governors are addressed in this fashion, as when Paul said to the governor Festus, O most excellent Festus. [Acts 26:25] Everyone who loves God and exercises dominion over his passions is a Theophilus and most excellent, and it is he who is truly worthy to hear the Gospel.
