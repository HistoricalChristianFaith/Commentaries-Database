. Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven. When the Lord sees the disciples under the sway of the passion of vainglory, He restrains them, showing them the way of humility by means of an unassuming child. For we must be as children in the humility of our mind, but not be infantile in our thoughts; and we must be as children in guile-lessness, but not in foolishness. By saying, "Except ye be turned back," He showed that they had gone from humility to vainglory. You must turn back again to that place, which is humility, from which you departed.
