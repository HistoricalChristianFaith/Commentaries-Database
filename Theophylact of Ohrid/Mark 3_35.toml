Because the relations of the Lord had come to seize upon Him, as if beside Himself, His mother, urged by the sympathy of her love, came to Him. Wherefore it is said, “And there came unto Him His mother, and, standing without, sent unto Him, calling Him.”.
He does not therefore say this, as denying His mother, but as showing that He is worthy of honour, not only because she bore Christ, but on account of her possessing every other virtue.
