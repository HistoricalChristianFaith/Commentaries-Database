Jesus entered Peter’s house so that they could eat. And when He touched the woman’s hand, not only did He quench her fever but He restored her to perfect health, so that her strength returned and she was able to serve. Yet we know that it takes a considerable time for the sick to recover their strength. The other evangelists say that first they besought Him and then Jesus healed the woman (Mk. 1:29-31 and Lk. 4:38-39); but Matthew does not say this, for reasons of brevity. For I told you at the beginning that what one evangelist leaves out, the other mentions. Learn also that marriage does not impede virtue: the chief of the apostles had a mother-in-law.
