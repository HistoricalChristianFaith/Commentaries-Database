But the Scribes used to cometo women, who were left without the protection of their husbands, as though they were their protectors; and by a pretence of prayer, a reverend exterior and hypocrisy, they used to deceive widows, and thus also devour the houses of the rich. It goes on: “These shall receive a greaterdamnation,” that is, than the other Jews, who sinned.
Now there was a praiseworthy custom amongst the Jews, that those who were able and willing should put something into the treasury, for the maintenance of the priests, the poor, and the widows. Wherefore there is added, “And many that were rich cast in much. "But whilst many people were so engaged, apoor widow came up, and showed her love by offering money according to herability.Wherefore it is said, “And there came acertain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make a farthing.”.
Or else; that widow is the soul of man, which leaving Satan to which it had been joined, casts into the temple two mites, that is, the flesh and the mind, the flesh by abstinence, the mind by humility, that so it may be able to hear that it has cast away all its living, and has consecrated it, leaving nothing for the world of all that it possessed.
