. Having spoken strong words against those who are a cause of temptation, now He corrects those who have been offended. Lest you, O reader, who have been offended, should utterly fall into error, imagining that the "woe!" was spoken only to him who gave offence, He says, "I want you who have been offended, that is, harmed, to admonish those who have dealt unjustly with you and harmed you, if they are Christians." See what He is saying: "if thy brother," that is, a Christian, "shall trespass against thee." But if an unbeliever wrongs you, then concede to him even what is yours. If it is a brother, admonish him; He did not say "revile" but "admonish." "If he shall hear thee" means "if he shall acknowledge his fault." He desires that sinners first be admonished in private, lest they become even more shameless when admonished before many. But if when admonished before two or more witnesses the sinner still is not ashamed, then divulge his sin to those who preside in the Church. Since he would not listen to two or three, even though the law says that every charge is confirmed by the evidence of two or three witnesses, then let him be chastised by the Church. And if he will not hear the Church, then let him be put out of the Church lest he transmit his wickedness to others as well. Such brethren as these He likens to the publicans, for the publican was notorious for evil doing and was an outcast.

Indeed not, but hear what follows:
