Now consider how many things the Lord foretold to His disciples, that they should find a colt; wherefore it goes on, “And as soon as ye be entered into it, ye shall find a colt tied, whereon never man sat, loose him, and bring him;” and that they should be impeded in taking it, wherefore there follows, “And if any man say unto you, Why do ye this? say ye, The Lord hath need of him;” and that on saying this, they should be allowed to take him; wherefore there follows, “And straightway he will send him hither;” and as the Lord had said, so it was fulfilled. Thusit goes on: “And they went their way, and found the colt tied by the door without, in a place where two ways meet; and they loose him.”.
For the multitude, until it was corrupted, knew what was its duty, for which reason each honoured Jesus according to his own strength. Wherefore they praised Him, and took up the hymns of the Levites, saying, Hosanna, which according to some is the same as "save me,” but according to others means a hymn. I however suppose the former to be more probable, for there is in the 117th Psalm, “Save now, I beseechthee, O Lord,” which in the Hebrew is, “Hosanna” .
But they called the kingdom of Christ, that of David, both because Christ was descended from the seed of David, and because David means a man of a strong hand. For whose hand is stronger than the Lord’s, by which so many and so great miracles were wrought.
The colt, however, was not necessary to Him, but He sent for it to show that He would transfer Himself to the  Gentiles.
Or else, in a place where two roads meet, that is, in this life, but it was loosed by the disciples, through faith and baptism.
Or else, those who prevent them are the devils, who were weaker than the Apostles.
Let us also strew the way ofour life with branches which we cut from the trees, that is, imitate the saints, for these are holy trees, from which, he who imitates their virtues cuts down branches.
But both those of our deeds which go before and those which follow after must be done to the glory of God; for some in their past life make a good beginning, but their following life does not correspond with their former, neither does it end to the glory of God.
