Not only with money does one show mercy in almsgiving (The Greek word for "almsgiving," eleemosyne, has the literal meaning of "mercifulness." To show mercy and to give alms are two differing human attributes in English. In Greek they are expressed by the same verb, eleein), but also with words. And should you have nothing at all to give, show mercy with tears of compassion. "They shall obtain mercy" even here in this life from men; for if he who showed mercy yesterday should be in want today, he will obtain mercy from all. And in the next life, how much more shall he obtain mercy from God?
