Now see the wickedness of the Jews, and the moderation of Pilate, though he too was worthy of condemnation for not resisting the people. For they cried out, “Crucify”; he faintly tries to save Jesus from their determined sentence, and again puts a question to them.
He wished indeed to satisfy the people, that is, to do their will, not what was agreeable to justice and to God.
