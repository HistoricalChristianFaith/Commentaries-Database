The Jews say, “How then is it that he was not called Emmanuel but Jesus Christ?” One may answer: The prophet did not say “you shall call” but “they shall call.” That is, the events and deeds of his life will show that he is God and that he keeps company with us. For holy Scripture gives names that are derived from the events of one’s life; for example, “Call his name Plunder Swiftly.” Yet where does it record that anyone was ever called by such a name? But since error was despoiled and taken captive at the moment of the Lord’s birth, Scripture gives this as his name, which he acquires from the event.
