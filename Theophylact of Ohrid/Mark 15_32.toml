For the passers by blasphemed Christ, reproaching Him as a seducer. But the devil moved them to bid Him comedown from the Cross; for he knew that salvation was being won by the Cross, therefore he again proceeded to tempt Christ, so that if He came down from the Cross, he might be certain that He is not truly the Son of God, and so the salvation, which is by the Cross, might be done away. But He being truly the Son of God, did not come down; for if He ought to have come down, He would not have ascended there at all; but since He saw that in this way salvation must be effected, He underwent the crucifixion, and many other sufferings, unto the finishing of His work. It goes on: â€œLikewise also the Chief Priests mocking said among themselves with the Scribes, He saved others, himself he cannot save. "They said this, to do away with His miracles, as though those which He had done were but the semblance of them, forby working miracles He saved many.
Or else, both at first reviled Him, then one recognizing Him as innocent, rebukes the other for blaspheming Him.
