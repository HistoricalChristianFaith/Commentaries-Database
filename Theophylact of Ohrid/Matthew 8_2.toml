Being a man of good sense, the leper did not go up on to the mountain, so as not to interrupt Jesusâ€™ teaching. But when Jesus came down from the mountain, then the leper worshipped Him. And the leper did not say, "If you beseech God, then you will heal me." But he showed great faith, saying, "If Thou wilt." And Christ did.
