. "You will bear witness even unto martyrdom, this I know" â€” and so it happened. For James was killed by Herod, and John was condemned by Trajan for bearing witness to the Word of Truth. "But to sit is not Mine to give, but it shall be given to those for whom it is prepared." That is, if one can be found who, along with bearing witness, also possesses every other virtue, that man will receive the gift. It is prepared for him who has labored, just as wreathes are prepared for those who contest in the games. When a foot race is held, sponsored by the king, and a man who did not even compete in the race approaches the king and says, "O holder of the games, give the wreath to me, though I did not compete," the king would answer him, "It is not for me to give out the wreath freely. For it goes to him for whom it has been prepared, that is, to him who ran and won the victory." So Christ here says, "I am not able to freely grant you to sit at My right hand. For it belongs to others who have labored for it and for them it has been prepared." You might ask, then, "Are there some who will sit?" Learn, that no one will sit there in the kingdom, for that is the prerogative of the divine nature alone. For to which of the angels said He at any time, "Sit thou at My right hand?" (Heb. 1:13. See Ps. 109:1). But John and James supposed that the Lord had said this, and they asked for such a seat, not understanding that to sit on the twelve thrones means they would be glorified on account of their virtue.
