It was called "a place of a skull," because those who have learned from the tradition of the fathers say that Adam was buried there; it was necessary that all we who had died in Adam were thus made alive in Christ (1 Cor. 15:22). Do not be troubled when you hear Matthew say that vinegar with gall was offered to the Lord, Mark, wine flavored with myrrh (Mark 15:23), and John, vinegar with gall on hyssop. For many things were done by many people, as there was a disorderly crowd present, some doing one thing, others another. It is likely that one offered wine and another vinegar mixed with gall. There were many ways to be put to death, but Christ was put to death on the cross so that He might sanctify the wood of the tree by which we were cursed, and bless the whole universe: the heavens, which were signified by the upper portion of the cross; the underworld, signified by the "footstool"; and the ends of the earth, the east and the west, signified by the transverse portions of the cross. But He was also put to death on the cross so that He might stretch out His arms to embrace and gather together the children of God who had been dispersed. The soldiers divided even His clothing, as He was poor and had nothing else. That which the evangelist John calls His "title" (Jn. 19.19), Matthew calls His "accusation." For they wrote down an indictment giving the reason for His crucifixion, namely, that He was accused of claiming to be "King of the Jews" and of leading an insurrection. They indicted Him as "King" meaning to slander Him, but in truth their indictment was unimpeachable evidence admitted by his adversaries. For indeed the Lord is King, and came for this very reason, to save the Jews. But since those who were Jews in the flesh did not want Him to reign over them, He became King of the spiritual Jews, that is, of those who confess Him. For "Jew" means "he who confesses."
