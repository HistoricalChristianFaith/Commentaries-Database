For Bethsaida appears to have been infected with much infidelity, wherefore the Lord reproaches it, “Woe to the e, Bethsaida, for if the mighty works which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.” He then takes out of the town the blind man, who had been brought to Him, for the faith of those who brought him was not true faith. It goes on, “And when He had spit in his eyes, and put His hands upon him, He asked him if he saw ought. "Wherefore there follows: “And He looked up, and said, I see men as trees walking;” because he was still under the influence of unfaithfulness, he said that he saw men obscurely.
But the reason why he did not see at once perfectly, but in part, was, that he had not perfect faith; for healing is bestowed in proportion to faith.
These precepts He gave him, because they were unfaithful, as has been said, lest perchance he should receive hurt in his soul from them, and they by their unbelief should run intoa more grievous crime.
Or else, after He has healed him, He sends him to his home; for the home of every one of us is heaven, and the mansions which are there.
