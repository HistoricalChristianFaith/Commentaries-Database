For when God snatches away or strikes, no one can heal. Thus in the calamity they remembered God. These may refer to those among the Hebrews who afterward came to believe in Christ. In such a thirst and long captivity they will seek the face, namely, the Son. For he is the mark of the Fatherâ€™s hypostasis (person). Those who turn to the Son are stripped of the veil which lies on their heart.
