The Forerunner of Christ, therefore, is call an angel, on account of his angelic life and lofty reverence. Again, where he says, “Before thy face,” it is as if he said, Thymessenger is near thee: whence is shown the intimate connection of the Forerunner with Christ; for those walk next to kings who are their greatestfriends.There follows, “Who will prepare thy way before thee.”For by baptism he prepared the minds of the Jews to receive Christ.
Or, the “way” is the New Testament, and the “paths” are the Old, because it is a trodden path. For it was necessary to be prepared for the way, that is, for the New Testament; butit was right that the paths of the Old Testament should be straightened.
