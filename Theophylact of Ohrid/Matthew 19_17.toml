. The man did not come testing Christ, but desiring to learn and thirsting for eternal life. He approached Christ as if Christ were a mere man. That is why the Lord says, "Why callest thou Me good? There is none good but One, that is, God." This means, if you call Me good thinking I am one of the teachers, you speak wrongly, for no man is essentially good; both because we are changeable and easily turned away from good, and because, by comparison with Godâ€™s goodness, human goodness is counted as wickedness.

The Lord directs the enquirer to the commandments of the law, so that the Jews could not say that He despised the law. What happened then?
