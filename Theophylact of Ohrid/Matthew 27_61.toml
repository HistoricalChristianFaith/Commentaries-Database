. Joseph of Arimathea before had hidden himself, but now he dares to do a great deed, risking his life for his Teacher’s Body, and taking upon himself the enmity of all the Jews. Pilate gives him the Body as a great favor. As Christ had been put to death as a rebel, it is likely that they were going to throw His Body aside unburied. But Joseph was rich and probably gave gold to Pilate; then he took the Body and honored it by placing it in a new tomb in which no one else had ever been placed. This was by God’s providence, so that when the Lord had risen, no one could say that it was another dead man who had previously been buried there that had risen. For this reason the tomb was new. Mary Magdalene and "the other Mary," that is, the Theotokos, who above was called the mother of James and Joses, were sitting opposite the tomb and waiting for the frenzy of the Jews to subside, so that they could go and embrace the Body and anoint it with myrrh. Isaiah spoke concerning these women, "Ye women coming from the sight, come hither; for this is a people without understanding" (Is. 27:11). He is clearly saying that the Jewish people who crucified the Lord lacked understanding (Lk. 23:34). He is calling upon the women, then, to forsake the mindless people and to go to the apostles and bring them the good tidings of the Resurrection.
