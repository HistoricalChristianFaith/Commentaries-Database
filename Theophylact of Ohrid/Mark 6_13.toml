The Lord not only preached in the cities, but also in villages, that we may learn not to despise little things, nor always to seek for great cities, but to sow the word of the Lord in abandoned and lowly villages. Wherefore it is said, “And He went roundabout the villages, teaching.”
Instructing them also by this means not to be fond of receiving gifts, in order too that those, who saw them proclaim poverty, might be reconciled to it, when they saw that the Apostles themselves possessed nothing.
That is, lest they should be accused of gluttony in passing from one to another. It goes on, “And whoever shall not receive you” This the Lord commanded them, that they might hew that they had walked a long way for their sakes, and to no purpose. Or, because they received nothing from them, not even dust, which they shake off, that it might be a testimony against them, that is, by way of convicting them.
It also means, the grace of the Holy Spirit, by which we are eased from our labours, and receive light and spiritual joy.
