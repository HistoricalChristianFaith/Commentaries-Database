. In the literal account, laying down of clothing is a sign of great reverence, and the cutting of branches is a sign of festivity. But in the spiritual sense, learn that the apostles first laid down their garments, which are their virtues, and then the Lord sat upon them. For God is not conveyed by a soul that has not been adorned with apostolic virtues. Those that went before are the prophets who lived before Christâ€™s incarnation, while those who followed are the martyrs and teachers who lived after these events. They laid down their garments for Christ, that is, they subjected the flesh to the spirit, for the body is a garment and covering for the soul. They laid them down in the way, that is, in Christ Who said, "I am the Way." For unless a man lays down his garment in the way, that is, unless he humbles his flesh, abiding in the Way which is Christ, and not turning to heresy, the Lord will not be carried by him. Some say that "Hosanna" means "hymn" or "psalm"; others say, more accurately, that it means "Save now." "He that cometh" means the Lord Whose coming was long awaited by the Hebrews. Thus John the Forerunner and Baptist also says, "Thou art He that cometh," meaning "He Whose coming has been long awaited." In another sense, "He that cometh" means "He Whose second coming is awaited day by day." For each of us should always be in hopeful expectation of the end of the world and the coming of the Lord, and should be ready.
