He did not say, "O ye of no faith," but, "O ye of little faith." The disciples showed their faith when they said, "Lord, save us;" but when they said, "We are perishing," they lacked faith. They ought not to have been afraid, as Jesus was with them in the boat. See how, by chastising them for cowardice, He shows that cowardice itself is a danger. This is why He calms first the turbulence of their souls, and then the storm.
