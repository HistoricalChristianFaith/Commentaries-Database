We humans are weak and therefore we should not throw ourselves into temptations. But when we have fallen into temptation, we should pray that we not be swallowed up by it. For he who has been led into the very depth of temptation is the one who has been swallowed up and defeated by temptation. But it is different for him who merely fell into temptation, and then conquered it. 

He did not say, from evil men, for it is not they who do us harm, but the devil. 

Here He emboldens us for if our Father is King, powerful and glorious, then certainly we too will defeat the evil one and we will then be made glorious.
