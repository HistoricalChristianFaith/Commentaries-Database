The disciples are compassionate and concerned about the multitude, not wanting them to go without food. What, then, does the Saviour do? Give ye them to eat, He says, not in ignorance of the extreme poverty of the apostlesâ€”far from it. But so that when they had said, "We do not have," He might appear to proceed to work a miracle out of necessity and not from vainglory.
