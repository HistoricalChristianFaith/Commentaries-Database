After confounding the Jews, who had blamed His disciples, for pulling the ears of corn on the sabbath day, by the example of David, the Lord now further bringing them to the truth, worksa miracle on the sabbath; showing that, if it is a pious deed to work miracle son the sabbath for the health of men, it is not wrong to do on the Sabbath thing necessary for the body. He says therefore, “And He entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a withered hand. And they watched Him, whether He would heal him on the sabbath-day; that they might accuse Him. "It goes on: “And He saith unto the man which had the withered hand, Stand in the midst.”.
Or, he had his right hand withered, who does not the works which belong to the right side; for from the time that our hand is employed in forbidden deeds, from that time it is withered to the working of good. But it will be restored whenever it stands firm in virtue; wherefore Christ saith, “Arise,” that is, from sin, “and standin the midst;” that thus it may stretch itself forth neither too little nor too much.
