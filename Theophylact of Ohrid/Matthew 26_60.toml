They brought Jesus to Caiaphas who was the high priest for that year. There Caiaphas spent the night along with the others, not keeping the Pascha at that time, but waiting so that they might kill the Lord, and thus transgressing the law (Jn. 18:28). For the Lord kept the Pascha in keeping with the law, but they despised the law that they might slay the Lord.
