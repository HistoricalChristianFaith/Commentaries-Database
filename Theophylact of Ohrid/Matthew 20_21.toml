The sons of Zebedee, James and John, were thinking that if the Lord went to Jerusalem, He would rule over a temporal kingdom. For they heard Him say continually, "We go up to Jerusalem." They fell, then, to human weakness and persuaded their mother to approach Him, as they themselves were afraid to approach openly. For they too approached secretly, as Mark says (Mk. 10:35), writing that James and John came to Him, meaning that they approached Him secretly and by themselves.
