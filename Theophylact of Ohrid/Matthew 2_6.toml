Since Bethlehem was small, it was despised, but now it is greatly renowned for Christ Who came forth from it. For all people from the ends of the earth come to venerate this holy Bethlehem. 

Rightly did he say, "out of thee shall come" and not "in thee shall remain." For Christ did not remain in Bethlehem, but came out from, that is, left it after His birth, and spent most of His years in Nazareth. The Jews say that this prophecy concerns Zerubbabel, but they plainly are lying; for Zerub-babel (See Haggai and Mt. 1:12) was not born in Bethlehem, but in Babylon. Consider his name: "Zeru" means "seed" or "birth," and "babel" means "Babylon," therefore, "he that was born in Babylon." But even the prophecy refutes them where it says, "His goings forth are from the beginning, and in the days of the age" (Micah 5:2). Of whom else are the goings forth both from the beginning and in the days of this age if not of Christ, Who had two goings forth, that is, a double genesis? The first, His begetting, was from the beginning from the Father, and the second, His Nativity according to the flesh, was in the days of this age, and took its beginning from the Theotokos and occurred in time. Let the Jews say, therefore, that Zerubbabel was from the beginning; but they have no grounds on which to make this claim. 

The prophecy said, "shall shepherd," not "tyrannize" or "devour" them. For the other kings were not shepherds but wolves. But Christ is a shepherd, as He Himself says, "I am the good shepherd" (Jn. 10:11). "My people Israel" means those who believed, whether Jew or Gentile. "Israel" means "seeing God," so all those who see God are Israelites, even those who are Gentiles.
