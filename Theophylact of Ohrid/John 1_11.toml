Here the Evangelist clearly begins his account of the divine economy of the Incarnation. The whole thread of what he says is this: the true Light was already in the world without flesh, and was not recognized. Then He came in the flesh unto His own. By His own you may understand either the whole world, or the Jews, whom He had chosen as the line of His inheritance, His portion, and His own possession. And His own received Him not, neither the Jews, nor the rest of mankind, who had been created by Him. Here the Evangelist bewails manâ€™s madness, and marvels at the Masterâ€™s love for mankind. Although they are His very own, not all received Him. For the Lord draws no one to Himself by force, but by a manâ€™s own will and choice.
