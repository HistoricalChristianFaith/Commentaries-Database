. You, Peter, desire tabernacles made with hands, but the Father has formed around them another tabernacle not made with hands, the cloud, showing that just as He Himself appeared as God in a cloud to the men of old, so also does His Son now appear in a cloud. Here the cloud is bright, not dark as in the time of old, for He desires not to bring fear but to teach. Out of the cloud came the voice, to show that it was of God. "In Whom I am well pleased," that is, in Whom I rest and take pleasure. And He teaches: "Hear ye Him and if He willeth to be crucified, oppose Him not."
