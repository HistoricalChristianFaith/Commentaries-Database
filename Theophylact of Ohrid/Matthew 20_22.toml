They say unto Him, We are able. He turns away from the mother and converses with the sons in order to show that He was not unaware that they had pushed her forward. Jesus says to them, "Ye know not what ye ask," that is, you ask for something so great as to amaze even the angelic powers. Then directing them away from such thoughts, He instead exhorts them to face dangers. He asks the question, knowing full well the answer, in order to compel them to reveal their wound of pride by their answer, and so that they might undertake in earnest to fulfill their promise. For this is what He is saying: since no one can share in My kingdom if he does not also share in My sufferings, tell Me if you are able to suffer such things as these. For the cup means martyrdom and oneâ€™s own death, at the same time showing that it is an easy thing, like drinking a cup of wine, and that we too ought to embrace martyrdom as easily. He also makes clear that He Himself approaches death gladly. For just as one who drinks a cup of wine is overwhelmed by sleep, so he who drinks the cup of martyrdom is weighed down by the sleep of death. He also calls His death a baptism, as it is the cleansing of us all. They readily promised everything, not knowing what they were saying, but only to obtain what they wanted.
