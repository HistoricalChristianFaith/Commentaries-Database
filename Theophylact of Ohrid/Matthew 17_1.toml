This does not contradict what Luke says, "And it came to pass about eight days after these sayings" (Lk 9:28). For Luke counts both the first day and the last day on which they ascended the mountain. But Matthew counts only the days in between. Christ took Peter because of Peterâ€™s strong love for Him; He took John, because Christ loved him; and He took James, because James, too, was zealous. That James had zeal is evident from his promise to drink the cup that Christ would drink (Mt. 20:22) and from the fact that Herod slew him with the sword to please the Jews.
