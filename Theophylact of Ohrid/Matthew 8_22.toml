After one has given himself to God, he ought not to turn back to the things of this life. Indeed one must honor  one’s parents; but God first. That this man’s father was an unbeliever is evident from Jesus’ words, "Let the dead," that is, the unbelievers, "bury their dead." If this man was not even permitted to bury his father, woe to those who after they have begun the monastic life turn back to worldly things!
