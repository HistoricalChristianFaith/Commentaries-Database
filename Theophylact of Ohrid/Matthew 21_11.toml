The multitude, being simple and guileless, were not spiteful towards Christ, but neither did they have the proper understanding of Who He was. Therefore they call Him "prophet." Yet since they said it with the article, "the prophet," it could be understood as "the long awaited Prophet," of whom Moses said, "God will raise them up a Prophet" (Deut. 18:18). For they did not say, "This is a prophet," but "the Prophet," that is, He Who is awaited with hope.
