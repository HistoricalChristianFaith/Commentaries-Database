quote='''
The possessions of everyone baptized in Christ are the remission of sins and the mansions above, which someone procures through the way that leads to each one of these. For there are as many ways as there are different mansions. But the one who sins ceases to hold the possessions and is deprived of them, while the divine Word becomes silent in him. Yet whenever he [the Lord] touches his heart, he speaks in it and then gives him those possessions from there, that is, from the heart. For the kingdom of heaven is inside of us. Therefore, either our heart takes these goods away from us or he [the Lord] gives [them to us].
