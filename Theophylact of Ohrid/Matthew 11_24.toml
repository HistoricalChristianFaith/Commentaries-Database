Capernaum was exalted as the city of Jesus, for it was made as glorious as if it were His birthplace, yet it derived no benefit from this because it did not believe. On the contrary, it is rather because of this that it has been condemned to hades, that, while having such a citizen, it derived no benefit from Him. From the fact that the name "Capernaum" means "place of comfort and consolation," see that even though one has once been deemed worthy to become a place of the Comforter, that is, of the Holy Spirit, but then becomes haughty in mind, though he had been lifted up to heaven, he falls on account of his haughtiness. Tremble, then, O man!
