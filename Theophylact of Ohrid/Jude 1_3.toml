Here Jude reveals what the purpose of his letter is. He is concerned for the salvation of those to whom he is writing and is afraid that in their naiveté they might be seduced by false teachers. In order to combat them, Jude will go on to expose their teachings. Peter had already done the same, but now Jude would give them a fuller exposition. Both Peter and Paul had predicted that such people would appear in the church, and even Christ himself had said: “Many will come in my name and will lead many astray.”
