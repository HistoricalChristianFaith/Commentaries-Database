Peter, out of great love, did not want Christ to suffer, and so he said, "It is good to stay here and for Thee not to go down and be slain. And if anyone should come here we have both Moses and Elijah to help us. For Moses contended with the Egyptians, and Elijah called down fire out of heaven: such opponents do we have for any enemies who might come here." He spoke these things out of great fear, not knowing, as Luke says, what he was saying (Lk. 9:33). For either the extraordinary nature of the event had dumb founded him, or he truly did not know what he was saying, when he spoke of wanting Jesus to remain on the mountain and not come down and suffer for our sake. But fearing to appear presumptuous, Peter said, "If Thou wilt."
