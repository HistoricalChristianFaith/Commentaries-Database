After that the Lord had cured the sick, He retired apart. Wherefore it is said, “And rising very early in the morning, He went out and departed into a desert place.” By which He taught us not to do any thing for the sake of appearance, but if we do any good, not to publish it openly. It goes on, “and there prayed.”.
For He shows to us that weought to attribute to God whatever we do well, and to say to Him, “Every good gift cometh down from above,” from Thee.It continues: “And Simon followed Him, and they that were with Him.”.
For He passes on to them as being more in need, since it was not right to shut up doctrine in one place, but to throw out his rays every where.It goes on: “For therefore am I come.”.
He also mingled action with teaching, for whilst employed in preaching, He afterwards put to flight devils. For there follows: “And casting out devils.”For unless Christ showed forth miracles, He teaching would not be believed; so do thou also, after teaching, work, that thyword be not fruitless in thyself.
