Behold, the wantonness! The princess dances, and the better she dances, the more evil it is. For it is shameful for a princess to be skilled at doing something unbefitting. And consider this additional foolishness of Herod’s, that he promised to give whatever she asked. If she had asked for your own head, would you have given it to her? She says, "Give me here John Baptist’s head." Why did she add the word "here"? She feared that Herod might later come to his senses and change his mind, so she urges him on by saying, "Give me it here and now."
