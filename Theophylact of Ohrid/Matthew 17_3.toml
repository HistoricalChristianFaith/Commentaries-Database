What were they talking about? "The ending," says Luke, "which He should accomplish in Jerusalem" (Lk. 9:31), namely, the Cross. Why did Moses and Elijah appear? To show that He is Lord of the law and of the prophets, and of the living and of the dead. For Elijah was a prophet and still lived, while Moses was a lawgiver and had died. They also appeared so that it might be seen that He was opposed neither to the law nor to God, for Moses would not have spoken with one opposed to his own laws, nor would Elijah the zealot have endured one who was opposed to God. And they appeared for yet another reason, to prove false the opinion of those who said that He was Elijah or one of the prophets. How did the disciples know that these two were Moses and Elijah? Not of course from icons, for at that time it was considered impious to draw pictures of men. It would seem, then, that they recognized them by the words which they were speaking. For Moses perhaps was saying, "Thou art He whose Passion I prefigured when I slaughtered the lamb and performed the Pascha;" and Elijah, "Thou art He Whose Resurrection I prefigured when I raised the widowâ€™s son;" and such words as these. By showing Moses and Elijah to the disciples, Christ teaches the disciples to imitate them, to be both meek and leaders of men, as was Moses, to be zealous and, when necessary, unyielding, as was Elijah, and to be fearless, as they both were, for the truth.
