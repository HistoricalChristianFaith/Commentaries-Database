Because Christ was coming toHis Passion, He corrects a false opinion of the Jews, who said that Christ wasthe Son of David, not his Lord. Wherefore it is said, “And Jesus answered and said, while He taught in the temple.”.
But Christ shows Himself tobe the Lord, by the words of David. For it goes on: “For David himself said bythe Holy Spirit, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou on My right hand;” as if Hehad said, Ye cannot say that David said this without the grace of the Holy Spirit, but he called Him Lord in the Holy Spirit; and that He is Lord, heshews, by this that is added, “Till I make Thine enemies Thy footstool;” forthey themselves were His enemies, whom God put under the footstool of Christ.
