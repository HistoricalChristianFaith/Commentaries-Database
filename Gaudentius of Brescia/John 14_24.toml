He made known to them many things concerning the oneness of his own divinity with that of the Father. He made clear that there was no separation between them so that even the words he spoke to them were not his, he declared, but the Father’s. “And the word that you have heard is not mine but the Father’s who sent me.” In this sentence he makes it abundantly clear that all who reject the teaching of his only-begotten Son reject the teaching of the Father also, since the Son says that the words he spoke are not his but the Father’s. And from this it follows that if they are the words of the Father, they are also the words of the Son, for he declares, “All things whatever the Father has are mine.” … And this is clearly because of the oneness of the divine substance that recognizes nothing as part of it that does not belong to the divine nature.
