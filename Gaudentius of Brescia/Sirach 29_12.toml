The rapacity of the one who grasps does not reduce avarice but provokes it. Indeed, it is written, “One who loves money will not be satisfied by money.” Nor does one love God who does not pity the poor, in whom Christ asks us to recognize that he is either helped or neglected. “When you did not do this to one of these least,” he says, “you did not do it to me.” And the apostle John says in his epistle, “If someone sees his brother or sister in need and closes his heart to them, the love of God is not in him.” One falsely says that he loves Christ if he does not love the poor person, if he denies in his actions the love that he professes with his words. Let everyone therefore make an effort to give proof by their actions that they love God, because the love of God will purify them from all sin. Do you want, then, to know to what a great extent alms lighten the weight of sins? Listen to the counsel the prophet Daniel offers to the rich sinner: “Now, O king,” he said, “may my advice please you: redeem your evil actions with alms and your sins with acts of mercy to the poor.” But perhaps you are thinking of keeping for yourself and your children what you do not want to give to the poor? I do not want you to worry yourself so dangerously, since “you do not know what tomorrow will bring.” Our God is powerful enough to give to them and to you. Indeed, everything that you give to the poor as alms you have put to your account and to that of your children. Nothing can be lacking to those whom you have joined to Christ. The one who assures us that he receives through the poor knows how to repay. Give without worries. He is a trustworthy borrower, the one who promises the kingdom of heaven. The divine Scripture says, “Hide your alms in the bosom of the poor person, and he will pray to God for you.” It is as though it said, “Sell your inheritance and acquire a surety, by which you can look with an unveiled face18 on the judge who is coming, certain of having obtained pardon.” Then in the Gospel it says, “If you want to be perfect, sell what you have, give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven, and come, follow me.”
