Daniel said, “The saints of the most High shall receive the kingdom.” What shall we say concerning this? Have the children of Israel received the kingdom of the most High? God forbid. Or has that people come on the clouds of heaven? This has passed away from them. For Jeremiah said concerning them, “Call them rejected silver, for the Lord has rejected them.” Again he said, “He will not again regard them.” And Isaiah said concerning them, “Pass by! Pass by! Approach not the defiled.”
