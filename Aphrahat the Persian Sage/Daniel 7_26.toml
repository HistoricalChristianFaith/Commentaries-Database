For the judgment came on Antiochus, a judgment from heaven; and he became sick with a grievous and evil sickness, and on account of the smell of him as he rotted, no one could approach him, for worms were crawling and falling from him and eating his flesh because he oppressed the “worm Jacob.” And his flesh rotted in his lifetime, because he caused the dead bodies of the sons of Jerusalem to rot and they were not buried. And he became defiled in his own eyes, because he had defiled the sanctuary of God. And he prayed and was not heard, because he did not hearken to the groanings of the righteous whom he killed. For he wrote a letter and sent it to the Jews and called them “my friends,” but God had not mercy on him. He died in his torment.
