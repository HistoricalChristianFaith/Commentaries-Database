He is a most diligent pastor who delivered over himself on behalf of his sheep. He is an excellent leader who gave himself in behalf of his sheep.… And when David numbered the flock of his sheep, wrath came upon them, and they began to be destroyed. Then David delivered himself over on behalf of his sheep, when he prayed, saying, “O Lord God, I have sinned in that I have numbered Israel. Let your hand be on me and on my father’s house. These innocent sheep, how have they sinned?” So also [in this way] all the diligent pastors used to give themselves on behalf of their sheep.But those pastors who did not care for the sheep, those were hirelings who used to feed themselves alone.
