No one should suppose that there is another God, either before or afterwards. He said, “From age to age,” just as Isaiah said, “I am the first and I am the last.” And after God had brought forth Adam from within his thought, he fashioned him, and breathed into him of his Spirit and gave him the knowledge of discernment so that he might discern good from evil and might know that God made him.
