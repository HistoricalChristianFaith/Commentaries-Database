Hananiah and his brothers worshiped not the image of the king of Babylon; and Jesus restrained the nations from the worship of dead images. Because of Hananiah and his brothers, the nations and languages glorified the God who had delivered them from the fire; and because of Jesus, the nations and all languages shall glorify God who delivered his Son, so that he saw no corruption. On the garments of Hananiah and his brothers the fire had no power; and on the bodies of the righteous, who have believed in Jesus, the fire shall have no power in the end.
