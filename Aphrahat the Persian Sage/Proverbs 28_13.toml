I address you too, the penitents. You should not keep back from yourselves this means of healing [confession] that has been given you. For it says in the Scripture, “He who confesses his sins and abandons them, on him God has mercy.” Look at the son who squandered his wealth. And when he returned to his father, he received him in joy and slew the fatted ox for him. And his father rejoiced at his repentance and even invited his friends to rejoice with him. And his father embraced him and kept on kissing him, saying, “This my son was dead and has come to life; he was lost and has been found.” And his father did not reprove him for the wealth he had squandered.
