As Daniel said, “You are the head of gold.” And why was he called the head of gold? Was it not because the word of Jeremiah was fulfilled in him? For Jeremiah said, “Babylon is a golden cup in the hand of the Lord that makes all the earth to drink of its wine.” And also Babylon was called the head of all kingdoms, as it is written, “Babylon was the head of the kingdom of Nimrod.”

This signified a kingdom that was inferior to it; namely, Darius the Mede [king of Persia]. For he put the kingdom on the scales, and the kingdom of the house of Nimrod was weighed and found wanting. And because it was wanting, Darius received it. Because of this he [Daniel] said “another kingdom inferior to you.” And because it was inferior, the children of Media did not rule in all the earth.

This is the kingdom of the children of Javan, who are children of Japhet. For the children of Javan came against the kingdom of their brothers. For Madai and Javan are sons of Japhet. But Madai was foolish and incapable of governing the kingdom, until Javan, his brother, came, who was wise and cunning, to destroy the kingdoms. For Alexander, son of Philip, ruled in all the earth.
