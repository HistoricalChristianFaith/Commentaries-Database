[[commentary]]

For the king who was anointed with the holy oil was called a cherub. And he was overshadowing all his people.â€¦ They were sitting in the shadow of the king, while he was standing at their head. And when the crown of their head fell, they were without shade. And if anyone should say that this word is spoken concerning Christ, let him accept what I write for him without dispute, and he will be persuaded that it was said with reference to the king.
