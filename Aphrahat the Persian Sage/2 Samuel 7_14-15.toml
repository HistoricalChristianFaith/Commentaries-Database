Again, listen concerning the title Son of God, by which we have called him. They [the Jews] say that “though God has no son, you make that crucified Jesus, the firstborn son of God.” Yet he called Israel “my firstborn” when he sent to Pharaoh through Moses and said to him, “Israel is my firstborn; I have said to you, let my son go to serve me, and if you are not willing to let (him) go, lo! I will slay your son, your firstborn.” And also through the prophet he testified concerning this and reproved them and said to the people, “Out of Egypt have I called my son. As I called them, so they went and worshiped Baal and offered incense to the graven images.” And Isaiah said concerning them, “Children have I reared and brought up, and they have rebelled against me.” And again it is written, “You are the children of the Lord your God.” And about Solomon he said, “He shall be a son to me, and I will be a Father to him.” So also we call the Christ “the Son of God” because through him we have gained the knowledge of God; even as he called Israel my firstborn son and as he said concerning Solomon, “He shall be a son to me.”
