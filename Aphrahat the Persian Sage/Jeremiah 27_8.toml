By the mouth of his prophet God called the heathen king Nebuchadnezzar, king of kings. For Jeremiah said, “Every people and kingdom that shall not put his neck into the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar, king of kings, my servant, with famine and with sword and with pestilence will I visit that people.” Though he is the great King, God does not begrudge the name of kingship to mortals. Though he is the great God, yet he did not grudge the name of godhead to the children of flesh. Though all fatherhood is his, he has called men fathers too. He said to the congregation, “Instead of your fathers shall be your children.” Though authority is his, he has given people authority one over another. While worship is his for honor, he has still allowed in the world for one human being to honor another.… Behold the grace and the love of our good Maker, that he did not begrudge to people the name of godhead and the name of worship, and the name of kingship and the name of authority, because he is the Father of the created things that are over the face of the world, and he has honored and exalted and glorified human beings above all creatures. For with his holy hands he formed them, and with his Spirit he breathed into them, and he became a dwelling place for them from ancient times. He abides in them and walks among them. For he said through the prophet, I will dwell in them and walk in them.
