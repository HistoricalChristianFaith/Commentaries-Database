Whosoever loves humility shall be heir in the land of life. Whosoever wishes to make peace shall be one of the sons of God. Whosoever knows the will of his Lord, let him do that will, that he may not be beaten much. Whosoever cleanses his heart from deceits, “his eyes shall behold the King in his beauty.” Whosoever receives the Spirit of Christ, let him adorn his inner man. Whosoever is called the temple of God, let him purify his body from all uncleanness.
