Let us draw near, then, my beloved, to faith, since its powers are so many. For faith raised up [Enoch] to the heavens, and overcame the deluge. It caused the barren to bring forth. It delivered from the sword. Faith raised up from the pit. It enriched the poor. It released the captives. It delivered the persecuted. It brought down the fire. It divided the sea. Faith cleft the rock and gave to the thirsty water to drink. It satisfied the hungry. It raised the dead and brought them up from Sheol. It stilled the billows. It healed the sick.
