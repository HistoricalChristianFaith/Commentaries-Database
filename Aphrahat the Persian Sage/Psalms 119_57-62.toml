In petition one asks for mercy for one’s sins, in thanksgiving you give thanks to your Father who is in heaven, while in praise you praise him for his works. At a time when you are in trouble, offer up petition, and when you are well supplied with good things, you should give thanks to the Giver, and when your mind rejoices, offer up praise. Make all these prayers of yours with discernment to God. See how David was always saying, “I have risen to give thanks to you for your judgments, O just One.” And in another psalm he said, “Praise the Lord in heaven, praise him in the heights.” Again he says, “I will bless the Lord at all times, and at all times his praises are in my mouth.” Do not pray using only one kind of prayer, but pray them at different times.
