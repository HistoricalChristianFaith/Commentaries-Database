Jacob also prayed when he returned back from Laban, and he was rescued from the hands of his brother, Esau. He prayed as follows, confessing and saying, “With my staff have I crossed this river Jordan, and now I have become two camps.” Wondrous symbol of our Savior! When our Lord first came, the staff left the stem of Jesse, just like Jacob’s staff; and when he returns from his Father’s house at his second coming, he goes back to him with two camps, one from the people [Israel], the other from the peoples [nations]—just like Jacob who returned to his father Isaac with two camps.
