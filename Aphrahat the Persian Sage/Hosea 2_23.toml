And the holy people inherited an eternal kingdom; the holy people who were chosen instead of the people. For “he provoked them to jealousy with a people that was not a people. And with a foolish people he angered them.” For even if one has served the heathen, as soon as ever he draws near to the covenant of God, he is set free. The Gentiles are the new people chosen by God to replace the people of the old covenant as foretold by the prophet.
