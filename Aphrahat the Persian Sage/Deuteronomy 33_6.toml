Moses wished by his priestly power to absolve Reuben from his transgression and sin, in that he had lain with Bilhah, his father’s concubine, so that when his brothers should rise, he might not be cut off from their number. So he said in the beginning of his blessing, “Reuben shall live and not die and shall be in the number.”
