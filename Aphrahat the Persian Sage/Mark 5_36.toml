When the chief of the synagogue asked him about his daughter, Jesus said to him: “Only firmly believe and your daughter shall live.” He believed and so his daughter lived and arose. Similarly when Lazarus died, our Lord said to Martha, “If you believe, your brother shall rise.” Martha said to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe.” And he raised him after four days.… So let us draw near then, my beloved, to faith, since its powers are so many. For faith raised up [Enoch] to the heavens and conquered the deluge. Faith causes the barren to sprout forth. It delivers from the sword. It raises up from the pit. It enriches the poor. It releases the captives. It delivers the persecuted. It brings down the fire. It divides the sea. It cleaves the rock, and gives to the thirsty water to drink. It satisfies the hungry. It raises the dead, and brings them up from Sheol. It stills the billows. It heals the sick. It conquers hosts. It overthrows walls. It stops the mouths of lions, and quenches the flame of fire. It humiliates the proud, and brings the humble to honor. All these mighty works are wrought by faith. Now this is faith; when one believes in God the Lord of all, Who made the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that is in them. He made Adam in his image. He gave the law to Moses. He sent his Spirit upon the prophets. Moreover he sent his Christ into the world, that we should believe in the resurrection of the dead; and should also trust in the efficacy of our baptism. This is the faith of the church of God. So distance yourselves from all divinations and sorceries and Chaldean arts and magic, and superficial prayers and rites and moons and seasons, from fornication and lewd music, from vain doctrines which are instruments of the adversary, from the allure of honeyed words, from blasphemy and from adultery. Do not bear false witness or speak with a double tongue.
