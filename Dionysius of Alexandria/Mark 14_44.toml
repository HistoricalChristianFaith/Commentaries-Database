How magnificent is the endurance of evil by the Lord who even kissed his own traitor, and then spoke words even softer than a kiss! For he did not say, O you abominable one, or traitor, is this what you do in return for great kindnesses? He simply says “Judas,” using his first name. This is in the voice of one commiserating with another or who wished another to come back to him, not the voice of anger.
