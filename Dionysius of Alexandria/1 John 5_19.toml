For in the most general sense it holds good that it is apparently not possible for any man to remain altogether without experience of ill. For, as one says, "the whole world lieth in wickedness;" and again, "The most of the days of man are labour and trouble." But you will perhaps say, What difference is there between being tempted, and falling or entering into temptation? Well, if one is overcome of evil-and he will be overcome unless he struggles against it himself, and unless God protects him with His shield-that man has entered into temptation, and is in it, and is brought under it like one that is led captive. But if one withstands and endures, that man is indeed tempted; but he has not entered into temptation, or fallen into it.
