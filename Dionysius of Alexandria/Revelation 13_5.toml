And in like manner it is revealed to John; "For there was given to him," he says, "a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy; and there was given unto him authority and forty and two months." It is wonderful that both of these things occurred under Valerian; and it is the more remarkable in this case when we consider his previous conduct, for he had been mild and friendly toward the men of God, for none of the emperors before him had treated them so kindly and favorably.
