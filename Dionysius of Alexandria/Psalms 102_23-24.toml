And this is true. For no one is able to comprehend the works of God altogether. Moreover, the world is the work of God. No one, then, can find out as to this world what is its space from the beginning and to the end, that is to say, the period appointed for it and the limits before determined for it; in view of the fact that God has set the whole world as a realm of ignorance in our hearts. And thus one says, “Declare to me the shortness of my days.” In this manner, and for our profit, the end of this world [age]—that is to say, this present life—is a thing of which we are ignorant.
