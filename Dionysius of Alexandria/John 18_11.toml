Now, to drink the cup was to discharge the ministry and the whole divine plan of trial with fortitude. It meant to follow and fulfill the Father’s determination and to surmount any apprehension. And the exclamation “Why have you forsaken me?” fits in with the requests he had previously made. In other words, Why is it that death has been with me all along up until now, but I have not yet borne the cup? This I judge to have been the Savior’s meaning in this concise utterance.
