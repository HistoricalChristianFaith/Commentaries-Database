As the Son is an only-begotten offspring, so also the Spirit, being given and sent from the Son, is himself one and not many, nor one from among many, but Only Spirit. As the Son, the living Word, is one, so must the vital activity and gift by which he sanctifies and enlightens be one, perfect and complete. This [activity and gift] is said to proceed from the Father because it is from the Word, who is confessed to be from the Father, that it shines forth, is sent and is given. The Son is sent from the Father. For he says, “God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son.” The Son sends the Spirit. “If I go away,” he says, “I will send the Paraclete.” The Son glorifies the Father, saying, “Father, I have glorified you.” The Spirit glorifies the Son, for he says, “He shall glorify me.” The Son says, “The things I heard from the Father I speak unto the world.” The Spirit takes of the Son. “He shall take of mine,” he says, “and shall declare it unto you.” The Son came in the name of the Father. “The Holy Spirit,” says the Son, “whom the Father will send in my name.”
