He is here “anointed,” not that he may become God, for he was so even before, or that he may become King, for he had the kingdom eternally, existing as God’s image, as the sacred Oracle shows; but for our sake is this written.

The word therefore does not imply the reward of virtue or conduct in the Word but the reason why he came down to us. It indicates that the Spirit’s anointing took place in him for our sakes. For he does not say, “Therefore he anointed you so that you will be God or King or Son or Word,” for he was already such before and is forever …; but rather, “Since you are God and King, therefore you were anointed, since none but you could unite humanity to the Holy Spirit, you the image of the Father, in which we were made in the beginning; for even the Spirit is yours.” For the nature of things originate could give no warranty for this, angels having transgressed and people disobeyed. Therefore there was need of God; and the Word is God, that he himself might set free those who had come under a curse. If then he was of nothing, he would not have been the Christ or Anointed, being one among others and having fellowship as the rest. But, since he is God, being the Son of God, and is everlasting King and exists as radiance and expression of the Father, therefore he is rightly the expected Christ, whom the Father announces to humankind, by revelation to his holy prophets; that as through him we have come to be, so also in him all people might be redeemed from their sins and by him all things might be ruled. And this is the reason for the anointing that took place in him, and of the incarnate presence of the Word, which the psalmist foreseeing, celebrates, first his Godhead and kingdom, which is the Father’s, in these tones, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom”; then announces his descent to us thus, “Wherefore God, even your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.”
