These ignorant men are drunk, not with wine but with their own wickedness. They make a profession of priesthood and glory in their threats. Do not believe them. When we are tried, let us humble ourselves, not being made captive by them.â€¦ So we, when we are tried by these things, must not become separated from the love of God.
