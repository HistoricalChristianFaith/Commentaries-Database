God, when “becoming a God and a defense” and saying, “I will be a God to them,” does not then become God more than before, nor does he then begin to become God. Rather, what he had always been, that he then becomes to those who need him, when it pleases him. So Christ, also being by nature Lord and King everlasting, does not become Lord more than he was at the time he is sent forth, nor does he then begin to be Lord and King but what he has always been, that he then is made according to the flesh. Having redeemed all, he thereby becomes again Lord of the living and the dead. Thereafter everything serves him, and this is David’s meaning in the psalm, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit on my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.’ ” For it was fitting that the redemption should take place through none other than him who is the Lord by nature, lest, though created by the Son, we should name another Lord, and fall into the Arian and Greek folly of serving the creature beyond the all-creating God.

If then they suppose that the Savior was not Lord and King, even before he became man and endured the cross, but then began to be Lord, let them know that they are openly reviving the statements of the Samosatene. But if, as we have quoted and declared above, he is the everlasting Lord and King, seeing that Abraham worships him as Lord and Moses says, “Then the Lord rained on Sodom and on Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven”; and David in the Psalms, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit on my right hand’ ”; and “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your kingdom”; and “Your kingdom is an everlasting kingdom”;18 it is plain that even before he became man, he was King and Lord everlasting, being Image and Word of the Father. And since the Word is everlasting Lord and King, it is very clear again that Peter did not say that the essence of the Son was made but spoke of his lordship over us, which “became” when he became man, and redeeming all by the cross, became Lord of all and King.
