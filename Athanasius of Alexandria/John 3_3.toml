Once the likeness painted on a panel has been effaced by stains from outside itself, the one whose likeness it is needs to come once more to enable the portrait to be renewed on the same wood. And, for the sake of his picture, even the mere wood on which it is painted is not thrown away, but the outline is renewed upon it. In the same way, the most holy Son of the Father, being the image of the Father, came to our world to renew humankind once made in his likeness. He came to find such lost individuals by the remission of their sins. He says as much himself in the Gospels: “I came to find and to save the lost.” This is why he also said to the Jews, “Except one be born again,” not meaning, as they thought, birth from a woman, but speaking of the soul born and created anew in the likeness of God’s image.
