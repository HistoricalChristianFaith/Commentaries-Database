The word still shows [the Son’s] eternal existence in the Father as the Word. For it is proper to the Word to do the Father’s works and not to be external to him.… He is either seen to be the efficient cause of things that he himself has brought about, or he has no power to cause anything at all.… For none of the things that are brought to be is an efficient cause, but all things were made through the Word who would not have brought anything into being if he himself were numbered among the creatures.… For by the Word, the things that were not have come into existence. And if through him [i.e., the Son] the [Father] creates and makes, [the Son] is not himself of things created and made. Rather, he is the Word of the Creator God and is known, from the Father’s works which he himself works, to be “in the Father and the Father in him” … because the Son’s essence is proper to the Father, and he is in all points like his Father.
