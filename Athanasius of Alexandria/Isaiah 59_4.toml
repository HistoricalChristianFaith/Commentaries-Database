Now those who meditate evil, we say, do not [think] truth but falsehood, and not righteousness but iniquity, for their tongue learns to speak lies. They have done evil and have not ceased that they might repent. For, persevering with delight in wicked actions, they hasten thereto without turning back, even treading under foot the commandment with regard to neighbors, and instead of loving them, they devise evil against them, as the saint testifies, saying, “And those who seek my evil have spoken vanity and imagined deceit all the day.” But that the cause of such meditation is none other than the lack of instruction the divine proverb has already declared: “The son who forsakes the commandment of his father meditates evil words.” But such meditation, because it is evil, the Holy Spirit blames in these words and reproves too in other terms, saying, “Your hands are polluted with blood, your fingers with sins, your lips have spoken lawlessness, and your tongue imagines iniquity: no one speaks right things, nor is there true judgment.” But what the end is of such perverse imagining, he immediately declares, saying, “They trust in vanities and speak falsehood, for they conceive mischief and bring forth lawlessness.”
