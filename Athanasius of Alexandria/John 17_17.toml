We are made sons through Christ by adoption and grace, partaking of his Spirit. For “as many as received him,” he says, “to them he gave power to become children of God, even to them that believe on his name.” And therefore, he is also the Truth, saying, “I am the Truth,” and in his address to his Father, he said, “Sanctify them through your Truth, your Word is Truth.” We, by imitation [of this truth], become virtuous and sons. Therefore, he did not say “that they may be one as we are” so that we might become such as he is, but that as he, being the Word, is in his own Father, we too, seeing him as our example, might become one toward each other in concord and oneness of spirit, nor be at variance as the Corinthians, but be of one mind as those five thousand in the Acts of the Apostles who were as one.
