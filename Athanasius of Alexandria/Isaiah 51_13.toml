And David being taught this, and knowing that the Lord’s hand was nothing else than Wisdom, he says in the psalm, “In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creation.” Solomon also received the same from God and said, “The Lord by wisdom founded the earth.” And John, knowing that the Word was the hand and the Wisdom, preached, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God … without him was not anything made.”
