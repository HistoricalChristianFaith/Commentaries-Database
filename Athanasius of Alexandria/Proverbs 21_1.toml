A desire to learn and a yearning for heavenly things is suitable to a religious emperor; for thus you will truly have “your heart” also “in the hand of God.” Since then your piety desired to learn from us the faith of the catholic church, giving thanks for these things to the Lord, we counseled above all things to remind your piety of the faith confessed by the fathers at Nicea.
