I have heard about the death of the blessed Theodorus, and the news caused me great anxiety, knowing as I did his value to you. Now if it had not been Theodorus, I would have spoken to you at greater length, with tears, considering what follows after death. But since it is Theodorus whom you and I have known, what need I say in my letter except “Blessed is” Theodorus, “who has not walked in the counsel of the ungodly”? But if “he is blessed who fears the Lord,” we may now confidently call Theodorus blessed, having the firm assurance that he has reached as it were a haven and has a life without care. Would that the same had also befallen each one of us; would that each of us in his running might thus arrive; would that each of us, on his voyage, might anchor his own ship there in the stormless haven, so that, at rest with the fathers, he might say, “here will I dwell, for I have a delight therein.” Wherefore, brother beloved and most longed for, weep not for Theodorus, for he “is not dead but is sleeping.”
