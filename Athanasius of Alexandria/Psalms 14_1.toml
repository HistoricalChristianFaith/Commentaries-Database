This statement [about fools] is directly followed by one pointing out that their actions correspond with their thoughts: “They are corrupt, and their behavior is evil.” The unrighteous person corrupts his body in every possible way: stealing, committing adultery, cursing, getting drunk, and doing similar things.… Count on it: those who are fools in their thoughts will do wicked deeds. As the Lord said [to the Pharisees], “How can you speak good things when you are evil?” And they truly were evil, because their thoughts were wicked.
