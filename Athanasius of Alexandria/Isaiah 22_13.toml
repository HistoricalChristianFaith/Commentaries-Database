Now we say that the wicked are dead, but not in an ascetic life opposed to sin; nor do they, like the saints, bear about dying in their bodies. But it is the soul which they bury in sins and follies, drawing near to the dead and satisfying it with dead nourishment. [They are] like young eagles which, from high places, fly upon the carcasses of the dead, and which the law prohibited, commanding figuratively, “You are not to eat the eagle or any other bird that feeds on a dead carcass.” And it pronounced unclean any other animal that eats the dead, for these kill the soul with lusts and say nothing but “let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die.”
