Therefore it becomes us to watch, lest some deception be conveyed under the clothing of their phrases and they lead some away from the true faith. And if they venture to advance the opinions of Arius, when they see themselves proceeding in a prosperous course, nothing remains for us but to use great boldness of speech. For we are to remember the predictions of the apostle, which he wrote to forewarn us of such heresies and which it becomes us to repeat. For we know that, as it is written, “in the latter times some shall depart from the true faith, giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils, that turn from the truth.”
