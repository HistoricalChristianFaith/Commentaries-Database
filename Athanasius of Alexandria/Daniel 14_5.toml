“The Logos,” as John said, “was made flesh.” Scripture, in fact, has the habit of indicating people with the term “flesh,” as when it says by the mouth of the prophet Joel, “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh,” and as Daniel said to Astyages, “I do not adore idols made by the hands of people, but the living God, who has created the sky and the earth and has power over all flesh,” for he and Joel identify the flesh with the human race.
