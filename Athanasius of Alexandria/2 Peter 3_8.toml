A thousand years is the time that the temple worship lasted. For from the completion of the temple by Solomon, who built the Lordâ€™s house until it became redundant when Christ died on the cross is a thousand years. This thousand years is compared to a day, or to a watch in the night, because everything appeared to be night before the coming of the Savior. For until the sun of righteousness arose, everyone dwelt in ignorance and confusion.
