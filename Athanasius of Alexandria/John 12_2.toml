Martha herself was taking great care with the service and was ministering to Christ with all her heart. Mary herself was seated at the feet of Jesus and kissing them.… Christ beholds them both with his divine eyes and is cheered and rejoices over the purity of their mode of life and the offering to him of their undefiled service.

You have seen this great public favor, that Lazarus was one of those who were reclining with Jesus. You saw not only that he gave him life again and took him from the hand of death but also that he granted him this great honor of eating with him at his supper. O these great favors that God grants to those who love him and keep his commandments! Moreover, you have seen the favor well fulfilled. Lazarus was reclining, eating with Jesus. For Jesus relied on his holy apostles to [eat and drink] with humankind.… Lazarus, on the other hand, [Jesus says], ate and drank with my Father. Come to me, Lazarus, and I shall take away the evil odor that is in your flesh over which death ruled, and I shall give you the sweet odor. See, I shall go to Jerusalem, and everyone will see you going with me in this body in which you have slept in the grave for four days. Afterward I gave you life, for truly again you yourself have served others. For in accordance with the measure that someone measures, it will be measured to himself.
