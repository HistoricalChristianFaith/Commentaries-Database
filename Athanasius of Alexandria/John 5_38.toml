It is most appropriate that he joins the “Word” to the “form” here to show that the Word of God is himself the image and expression and form of his Father. The Jews who did not receive the one who spoke to them thus did not receive the Word, which is the form of God. This too was who the patriarch Jacob saw when he received a blessing from him and the name of Israel instead of Jacob. … And this is he who said, “He who has seen me has seen the Father,” and “I in the Father and the Father in me” and “I and the Father are one.” For in this way God is one and so is the faith in the Father and the Son. For even though the Word is God, the Lord our God is one Lord.
