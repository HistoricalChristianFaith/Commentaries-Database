When the Saviour says about us, ‘As you Father are in me and I in you, that they too may be one in us,’ He does not mean that we will be the same as He. But it is an appeal to the Father, as John has written, that the Spirit be given through Him to those who believe. Through the Spirit, we find that we have come to be in God and in this way we are joined together in Him. For since the Word is in the Father and the Spirit is given from the Word, He wants us to receive the Spirit, so that when we receive Him and thus have the Spirit of The Word who is in the Father, we may find ourselves also to have become one through The Spirit, in The Word, and through The Word, in The Father. - "Against the Arians 2"
