Perhaps you have heard of the prophecy of Christ’s death. You ask to learn [from Moses] what is set forth concerning the cross. Not even this is passed over. It is displayed by the holy men with great plainness. For first Moses predicts it, and that even with a loud voice, when he says, “You shall see your Life hanging before your eyes and shall not believe.”
