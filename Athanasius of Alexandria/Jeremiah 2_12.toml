Who that witnessed these things, or that has merely heard of them, will not be greatly appalled and cry aloud to the Lord, saying, “Will you make a full end of Israel?” Who that is acquainted with these proceedings will not with good reason cry out and say, “A wonderful and horrible thing is done in the land,” and, “The heavens are astonished at this, and the earth is even more horribly afraid.” The ancestors of the people and the teachers of the faith are taken away, and the impious are brought in to lead the churches? Who that saw when Liberius, bishop of Rome, was banished, and when the great Hosius, the father of the bishops, suffered these things, or who that saw so many bishops banished out of Spain and the other parts could fail to perceive—however little sense he might possess—that the charges against Athanasius also and the rest were false, and altogether mere calumny? This is also why others endured the suffering they did, because they saw plainly that the conspiracies laid against these men were founded in falsehood. - "History of the Arians 6.46"
