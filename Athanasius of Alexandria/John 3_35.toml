This passage does not demonstrate that the Son, at one time, did not have these prerogatives [that were given him by the Father]. For he who is the only Word and Wisdom of the Father in essence has eternally what the Father has. For doesn’t Christ elsewhere say, “All that the Father has are mine,” and whatever things are mine are the Father’s? For if the things of the Father are the Son’s and the Father always has them, it is plain that what the Son has, being the Father’s, were always in the Son. This is not because there was a time when he did not have them, but because, even though the Son has eternally what he has, he still has them from the Father.
