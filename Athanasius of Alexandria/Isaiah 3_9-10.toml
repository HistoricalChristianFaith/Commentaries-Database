Those who look upon their dispersion and the desolation of their city may not aptly say, “Woe to them, for they have imagined an evil imagination, saying against their own soul, let us bind the righteous man, because he is not pleasing to us.” It is so true, for when they erred concerning the Scriptures, they did not know that “the one who digs a pit for his neighbor falls in it; and a serpent will bite the one who destroys a hedge.”
