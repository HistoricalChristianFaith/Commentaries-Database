The prophet Nahum proclaimed the good news of what was to come, “Behold, on the mountains the feet of him who brings good tidings, who proclaims peace.” Then he went on to tell them, “Keep your feasts, O Judah; fulfill your vows. For they shall no more go to that which is old; it is finished; it is taken away. He is gone up who breathed upon the face and delivered you from affliction.”74Now who is he who went up? Notice, by the way, that the one who went up went to the Jews, so there is no way they can ignore the end of those practices that foreshadowed his coming. And the prophet did say, “It is finished.” But as I asked, who was he? It would be absurd to say that he was Moses, because when he was with Israel they had not even entered the land in which these sacrificial rites were to be carried out. Or suppose that he was Samuel or some other one of the prophets. That would not do either, because, while they were around, the sacrifices were being made and Jerusalem was still standing. Thus it was none of these men who went up.
But if you want to know the truth … look to our Savior, who went up and who “breathed on them, and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.’ ” As soon as these things were done, all the old things came to an end. The altar was broken; the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom. And although the city was not yet sacked and destroyed, its time was coming. As the prophecy foretold, the abomination of desolation was soon to rest upon the temple and the city. The consummation of the ancient ceremonies was at hand.
Thankfully, then, we have come far beyond these shadows of reality, having turned to the Lord himself. And we know that “the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” Therefore, as the ears of our hearts hear the call of the priestly trumpet, we do not look with our physical eyes and see an animal lamb slain, but we see the true Lamb, our Lord Jesus Christ. For as Isaiah said, he “was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb.”78
We are purified by his precious blood, which cleanses us from sin. His blood does not cry out for vengeance as did the blood of Abel.
