When Israel had left Egypt, God forbade the people to even touch the mountain where he was giving the Law, because they were far from being “on fire” for the Lord. He did, however, call the blessed Moses to that mountain. Moses was totally committed to him and clung to his grace, so God said, “Let Moses alone draw near.” So Moses climbed up the mountain into the cloud, and although that mountain smoked with the heat and presence of the Lord, Moses was unharmed. Rather, through “the words of the Lord, which are pure silver refined in a furnace,” he came down more pure than when he went up.
