The departure from virtue gives place for the entrance of the unclean spirit. There is, moreover, the apostolic injunction, that the grace given us should not be unprofitable. Those things that he wrote particularly to his disciple, he enforces on us through him, saying, “Do not neglect the gift that is in you. For he who tills his land shall be satisfied with bread. But the paths of the slothful are strewn with thorns.” The Spirit warns ahead of time not to fall into them, saying, “Break up your fallow ground. Do not sow among thorns.” - "Festal Letters 3.3"
