For where at all have they found in divine Scripture, or from whom have they heard, that there is another Word and another wisdom besides this Son, that they should frame to themselves such a doctrine? True, indeed, it is written, “Are not my words like fire, and like a hammer that breaks the rock in pieces?” and in the Proverbs, “I will make known my words unto you.” But these are precepts and commands, which God has spoken to the saints through his proper and only true Word, concerning which the psalmist said, “I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep your words.” Such words accordingly the Savior signifies to be distinct from himself, when he says in his own person, “The words which I have spoken unto you.” For certainly such words are not offsprings or sons, nor are there so many words that frame the world, nor so many images of the one God, nor so many who have become men for us, nor as if from many such there were one who has become flesh, as John says. He was preached by John as being the only Word of God: “the Word was made flesh,” and “all things were made by him.” Wherefore of him alone, our Lord Jesus Christ, and of his oneness with the Father, are written and set forth the testimonies, both of the Father signifying that the Son is one, and of the saints, aware of this and saying that the Word is one, and that he is Only-begotten.
