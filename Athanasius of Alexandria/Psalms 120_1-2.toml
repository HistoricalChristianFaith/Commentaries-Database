Therefore it was none other than God whom David too implored for his deliverance: “When I was in trouble, I called on the Lord, and he heard me; deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue.” To him also giving thanks he spoke the words of the song in the seventeenth psalm [LXX], in the day in which the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul, saying, “I will love you, O Lord, my strength; the Lord is my strong rock and my defense and deliverer.” And Paul, after enduring many persecutions, to none other than God gave thanks, saying, “Out of them all the Lord delivered me; and he, in whom we trust, will deliver me.”
