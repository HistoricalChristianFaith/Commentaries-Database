And by the prophet, “the enemy said, I will pursue and overtake,” and again by another, “I will grasp the whole world in my hand as a nest, and take it up as eggs that have been left.” Such, in a word, are their boasts and professions that they may deceive the godly.

And though speaking words so many and so great in his boldness, without doubt, like a dragon he was drawn with a hook by the Savior, and as a beast of burden he received the halter round his nostrils, and as a runaway his nostrils were bound with a ring, and his lips bored with an armlet. And he was bound by the Lord as a sparrow, that we should mock him. LIFE OF ST.
