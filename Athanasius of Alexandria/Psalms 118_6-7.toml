And how should Christ, who said to Abraham, “Fear not, for I am with you,” and encouraged Moses against Pharaoh and said to the son of Nun, “Be strong and of a good courage,” himself be terrified before Herod and Pilate? Furthermore, did he who helps others overcome fear (for “the Lord,” says Scripture, “is on my side, I will not fear what people shall do to me”), fear governors, who are mortals? Was he who himself encountered death terrified of death? Is it not both unseemly and irreligious to say that he was terrified of death or hades, whom the keepers of the gates of hades saw and shuddered? But if, as you would maintain, the Word was afraid, wherefore, when he spoke long before of the conspiracy of the Jews, did he not flee, no, said when actually sought, “I am he,” for he could have avoided death, as he said, “I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again”; and “No one takes it from me.”
