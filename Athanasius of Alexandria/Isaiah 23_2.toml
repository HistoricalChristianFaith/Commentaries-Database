Still, it was when humanity was in this state that the Word—the Son—came to seek and to find that which was lost. Even before he came, he tried to restrain us from such foolishness, crying out, “Don’t be like the horse and the mule which have no understanding and whose mouth must be held in with bit and bridle.” And because his own people were careless and acted as the wicked did, Isaiah, praying in the Spirit said, “You are to me like merchants of Phoenicia.”
