In another place the apostle says, “And all those who will live godly lives in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.” Then, to help prevent people from renouncing godliness when they are persecuted, he urges them to cling to the faith. “You, therefore, continue in the things you have learned and been assured of.” Just as brothers become strongly knit together when one helps another, so faith and godliness, coming from the same family, cohere together. A person who gives his attention to one of the two is strengthened by the other.
