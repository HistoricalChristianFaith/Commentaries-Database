The Lord over death set out to abolish death. Being Lord, he accomplished his aim. We therefore have passed from death to life. The concept that the Jews and those who think like them held about the Lord was wrong. Things did not turn out at all according to their expectations, because the opposite was true. In fact, “he who sits in heaven shall laugh at them: the Lord shall have them in derision.”That is the reason our Savior restrained the women from weeping when he was being led to death. He said, “Do not weep for me.” He wished to show that his death was not an event for us to mourn about but rather to be joyful about, since he who died for us is alive! He was not created from nothing, but he derives his being from the Father.
