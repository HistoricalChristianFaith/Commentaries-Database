Paul reasonably has said, “his eternal power and godhead,” thereby signifying the Son. He said this while accusing the Greeks of contemplating the harmony and order of the creation without reflecting on the framing Word within it (for the creatures witness to their own Framer) so as through the creation to apprehend the true God and abandon their worship of it. And where the sacred writers say, “who exists before the ages,” and, “by whom he made the ages,” they thereby as clearly preach the eternal and everlasting being of the Son, even while they are designating God. Thus, if Isaiah says, “The everlasting God, the creator of the ends of the earth,” and Susanna said, “O everlasting God,” and Baruch wrote, “I will cry unto the Everlasting in my days,” and shortly after, “My hope is in the Everlasting, that he will save you, and joy is come to me from the Holy One,” yet as the apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, “who being the radiance of his glory and the expression of his person,” and David too in the psalm, “And the brightness of the Lord be on us,” and, “In your light shall we see light,” who has so little sense as to doubt of the eternity of the Son?
