For so shall we remain partakers of Christ if we hold fast to the end the Spirit given at the beginning. For he said, “do not quench,” not because the Spirit is placed in the power of people and is able to suffer anything from them, but because bad and unthankful people manifestly wish to quench it, since they, like the impure, persecute the Spirit with unholy deeds.… Now they, being without understanding, and deceitful and lovers of sin, walk still as in darkness, not having that “light that lights every one who comes in the world.” Now a fire such as this laid hold of Jeremiah the prophet, when the word was in him as a fire and he said, “I leave every place and am not able to endure it.” And our Lord Jesus Christ, being good and a lover of humankind, came that he might cast this on earth, and he said, “And would that it were already kindled!”
