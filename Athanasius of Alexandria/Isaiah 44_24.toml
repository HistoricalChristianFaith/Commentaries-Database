And when the prophet says concerning the creation, “That stretches forth the heavens alone,” and when God says, “I only stretch out the heavens,” it is made plain to everyone that in the “Only” is signified also the Word of the Only, in whom “all things were made” and without whom “was made not one thing.” Therefore, if they were made through the Word, and yet he says, “Only,” and together with that Only is understood the Son, through whom the heavens were made, so also then, if it is said, “One God,” and “I Only,” and “I the First,” in that “One” and “Only” and “First” is understood the Word co-existing, as in the Light the Radiance. And this can be understood of no other than the Word alone. For all other things subsisted out of nothing through the Son and are greatly different in nature, but the Son himself is natural and true offspring from the Father. And thus the very passage that these insensate have thought fit to adduce, “I the First,” in defense of their heresy, does rather expose their perverse spirit. For God says, “I the first, and I the last”; if then, as though ranked with the things after him, he is said to be first of them, so that they come next to him, then certainly you will have shown that he himself precedes the works in time only; which, to go no further, is extreme irreligion. But if it is in order to prove that he is not from any, nor any before him, but that he is Origin and Cause of all things and to destroy the Gentile fables that he has said, “I the first,” it is plain also that when the Son is called firstborn, this is done not for the sake of ranking him with the creation but to prove the framing and adoption of all things through the Son. For as the Father is first, so also is [the Son] both first, as image of the First, and because the First is in him, and also offspring from the Father, in whom the whole creation is created and adopted into sonship.
