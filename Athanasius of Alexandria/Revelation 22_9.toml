The Father shows [the Son] to be his own proper and only Son, saying, “You are my Son,” and “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.” Accordingly the angels ministered to him, as being one beyond themselves; and they worship him, not as being greater in glory but as being some one beyond all the creatures, and beyond themselves, and alone the Father’s proper Son according to essence. For if he was worshiped as excelling them in glory, each of the things subservient ought to worship what excels itself. But this is not the case; for creature does not worship creature, but servant [worships the] Lord, and creature God. Thus Peter the apostle hinders Cornelius, who would worship him, saying, “I myself also am a man.” And an angel, when John would worship him in the Apocalypse, hinders him, saying, “See that you do not do it; … worship God.” Therefore, to God alone appertains worship, and this the very angels know, that though they excel other beings in glory, yet they are all creatures and not to be worshiped but worship the Lord.
