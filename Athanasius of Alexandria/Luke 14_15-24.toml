Oh, brothers and sisters, what a banquet that is! How great is the harmony and joy of those who eat at this heavenly table! They enjoy food that produces everlasting life, not that ordinary food which passes right on through the body. Who will be considered worthy to be in that group? Who is so blessed as to be called to and counted worthy of that divine feast? “Blessed is he who will eat bread in your kingdom.” Although he has been washed, even a person who has been judged worthy of this heavenly calling and has been sanctified by it can become unclean. How can he become unclean? “Counting as unclean the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified and despising the Spirit of grace,” he hears the Lord say, “Friend, how did you get in here without wedding garments?”
