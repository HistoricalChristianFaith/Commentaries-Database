“[Jesus] breathed on the disciples and said to them, ‘Receive the Holy Spirit.’ ” As soon as these things were done, everything was finished. The altar was broken, and the veil of the temple was torn from top to bottom. And although the city was not yet sacked and destroyed, the abomination of desolation was soon to rest on the temple and the city. The consummation of the ancient ceremonies was at hand.
