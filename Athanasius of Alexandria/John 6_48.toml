God by his living Word enlivens everyone and gives his Word as food and life to the saints, as the Lord declares, “I am the bread of life.” … But sin, too, has its own special bread—of death, calling to those who are lovers of pleasure and lack understanding. [Sin] says, “Touch with delight secret bread and sweet waters that are stolen.” For one who merely touches them has no idea that what is born from the earth perishes with [sin]. For even when the sinner thinks he is going to find pleasure, the end result of that food is anything but pleasant, as the Wisdom of God again reminds us: “Bread of deceit is pleasant to a person; but afterwards his mouth shall be filled with gravel.” … The end result is, he eats and rejoices for a little while, but afterwards he spurns it the further his soul has moved away [from God]. For the fool does not know that those who depart far from God shall perish. … “Leave foolishness behind so that you may live, seek understanding so that you may remain.” For the bread of Wisdom is living fruit, as the Lord said, “I am the living bread that came down from heaven: if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever.” For when Israel ate of the manna, which was indeed pleasant and wonderful, they still died, and whoever ate it did not live forever as a consequence of eating it; rather, the whole multitude died in the wilderness.…Now wicked people hunger for bread like this, for weak souls will hunger. But the righteous alone, being prepared, shall be satisfied, saying, “I shall behold your face in righteousness; I shall be satisfied when your glory is seen by me.” For he who partakes of divine bread always hungers with desire. And he who hungers in this way has a never-failing gift, as Wisdom promises, saying, “The Lord will not slay the righteous soul with famine.” He promises too in the Psalms, “I will abundantly bless her provision; I will satisfy her poor with bread.” We may also hear our Savior saying, “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” It is much more satisfying then for the saints and those who love the life that is in Christ when they elevate themselves to a longing after this food.
