The Godhead of the Son is the Father’s. It is indivisible. Thus there is one God and none other but he. So, since they are one, and the Godhead itself one, the same things are said of the Son, which are said of the Father, except his being said to be Father. For instance, it is said that he is God: “And the Word was God.” It is said that he is Almighty, “Thus says he who was and is and is to come, the Almighty.” It is said that he is Lord, “one Lord Jesus Christ.” It is said that he is Light, “I am the Light,” that he wipes out sins, “that you may know,” he says, “that the Son of man has power upon earth to forgive sins,” and so with other attributes. For “all things,” says the Son himself, “whatsoever the Father has, are mine”; and again, “And mine are yours.”
