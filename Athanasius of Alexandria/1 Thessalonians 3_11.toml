For one and the same grace is from the Father in the Son, as the light of the sun and the sun’s radiance is one, and as the sun’s illumination is effected through the radiance. So too when Paul prays for the Thessalonians, in saying, “Now God himself our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ, may he direct our way to you,” he has guarded the unity of the Father and of the Son. For he has not said, “May they direct,” as if a double grace were given from two sources … but “May he direct,” to show that the Father gives grace through the Son—at which these irreligious ones will not blush, though they well might. .
