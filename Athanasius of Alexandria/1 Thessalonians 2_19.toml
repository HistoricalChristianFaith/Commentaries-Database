For we ought to walk by the standard of the saints and the fathers, and imitate them, and to be sure that if we depart from them we put ourselves also out of their fellowship. Whom then do they wish you to imitate? The one who hesitated, and while wishing to follow, delayed the decision and took counsel because of his family? Or blessed Paul, who, the moment the stewardship was entrusted to him, “did not immediately consult with flesh and blood”? For although he said, “I am not worthy to be called an apostle,” yet, knowing what he had received and fully aware of the giver, he wrote, “For woe is me if I do not preach the gospel.” But, as it was “woe to me” if he did not preach, so, in teaching and preaching the gospel, he had his converts as his joy and crown. This explains why the saint was zealous to preach as far as Illyricum and did not shrink from proceeding to Rome24 or even going as far as the Spains, in order that the more he labored, he might receive so much the greater reward for his labor. He boasted then that he had fought the good fight and was confident that he should receive the great crown.
