What advancement, then, was it to the Immortal to have assumed the mortal? Or what promotion is it to the Everlasting to have put on the temporal? What reward can be great to the everlasting God and King in the bosom of the Father? Do you not see that this too was done and written because of us and for us, that the Lord, having become a human being, might make immortal us who are mortal and temporal and bring us into the everlasting kingdom of heaven? Do you Arians not blush, speaking lies against the divine oracles? For when our Lord Jesus Christ was among us, we indeed were promoted, as rescued from sin; but he is the same, nor did he change when he became man, but, as has been written, “the Word of God abides forever.” Surely as, before he became human, he, the Word, dispensed to the saints the Spirit as his own, so also when made human, he sanctifies all by the Spirit and says to his disciples, “Receive the Holy Spirit.”
