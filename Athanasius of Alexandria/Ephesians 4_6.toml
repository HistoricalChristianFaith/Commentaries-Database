The Father makes all things by the Word in the Spirit. So it is that the Unity of the Trinity is safeguarded. So it is that in the Church is proclaimed the one God who is ‘above all and through all and in all (Eph 4.6)’. He is ‘above all’ as Father, as author and source; ‘through all’ by the Word; ‘in all’ in the Holy Spirit.”
