Paul wrote to the Corinthians, “You, therefore, follow me.” Let us follow him then, because that commandment has been passed down to us. The admonition originally given to the church at Corinth reaches to all Christians of all time in every place. For the apostle Paul was “a teacher of all nations in faith and truth.”2As a matter of fact, we get the same sort of teaching from all the saints of old. Solomon, for example, used proverbs, saying, “Hear, my children, the instruction of a father and pay attention to get understanding, for I give you a good gift. Do not forsake my word, for I was an obedient son to my father, and beloved in the sight of my mother.”
