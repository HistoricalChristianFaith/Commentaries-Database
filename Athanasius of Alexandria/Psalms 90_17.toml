Thus, if Isaiah says, “The everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth”; and Susanna said, “O everlasting God”;42 and Baruch wrote, “I will cry to the Everlasting in my days,” and shortly after, “My hope is in the Everlasting, that he will have you, and joy is come to me from the holy One”; yet forasmuch as the apostle, writing to the Hebrews, says, “Who being the radiance of his glory and the expression of his person”;44 and David too in the ninetieth psalm, “And the brightness of the Lord be on us,” and, “In your light shall we see light,” who has so little sense as to doubt the eternity of the Son? For when did humankind see light without the brightness of its radiance, that he may say of the Son, “There was once, when he was not,” or “Before his generation he was not.”
