For this is the divine promise: “The Lord shall fight for you.” Henceforth, although afflictions and trials from without overtake them, yet, being fashioned after the apostolic words and “being steadfast in tribulations and persevering in prayers” and in meditation on the law, they stand against those things that befall them, are well-pleasing to God and give utterance to the words that are written, “Afflictions and distresses are come on me, but your commandments are my meditation.”
