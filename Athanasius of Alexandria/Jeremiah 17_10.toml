For such things as these serve for exercise and trial, so that, having proved ourselves zealous and chosen servants of Christ,we may be fellow heirs with the saints. For thus Job: “The whole world is a place of trial to people on the earth.” Nevertheless, they are proved in this world by afflictions, labors and sorrows, to the end that each one may receive of God such reward as is appropriate for him, as he said by the prophet, “I am the LORD who tries the hearts and searches the reins, to give to everyone according to his ways.” - "Festal Letters 13.1"
