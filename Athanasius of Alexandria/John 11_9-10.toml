Consider what I have said, that the Light is Christ. Everyone who will walk in his commandments will not be laid hold of by evil. These twelve hours that are in the day are the twelve apostles. The devil â€¦ is compared with the night. He who walks in the will of the devil will stumble because he does not have the light of Christ.
