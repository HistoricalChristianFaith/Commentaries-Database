What sprinklings shall we now employ while we celebrate the feast? Who will be our guide as we haste to this festival? None can do this, my beloved, but him whom you will name with me, even our Lord Jesus Christ, who said, “I am the Way.” For it is he who, according to the blessed John, “takes away the sin of the world.” He purifies our souls, as Jeremiah the prophet says in a certain place, “Stand in the ways and see, enquire, and look which is the good path, and you shall find in it cleansing for your souls.”
