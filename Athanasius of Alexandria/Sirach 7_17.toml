Sin possesses the very bread of his death, to which it invites those who love pleasures and the fools, saying, “Touch with pleasure the secret bread and the sweet stolen waters.” He who merely touches it “does not know that the children of the earth perish because of it.” When one thinks about tasting pleasure, the result that comes from this nourishment will not be sweet for him in the end, as again the Wisdom of God affirms: “Bread of deceit is pleasant to a person, but afterwards his mouth shall be full of sand,” and, “Honey drips from the lips of a prostitute, which for a certain time is sweet to your palate. Afterwards you will find it more bitter than wormwood, sharper than a two-edged sword.” Thus, eating it and enjoying it a little, afterwards he is devoured by worms, while he renders his soul far away, because the fool does not know that “they that are far from God perish.”
