And as he is Firstborn among brothers and rose from the dead “the firstfruits of them that slept”; so, since it became him “in all things to have the preeminence,” therefore he is created “a beginning of ways,” that we, walking along it and entering through him who says, “I am the Way” and “the Door” and partaking of the knowledge of the Father, may also hear the words, “Blessed are the undefiled in the Way,” and “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”
