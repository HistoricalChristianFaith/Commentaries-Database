See then what human beings considered the foolishness of God because of the cross, how this has become above anything else the most honored. For our resurrection is stored up in it. No longer Israel alone, but from this time forward all the nations, as the prophet has foretold, abandon their idols and acknowledge the true God, the Father of Christ. The illusion of demons has come to nothing, and he alone who is truly God is worshiped in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
