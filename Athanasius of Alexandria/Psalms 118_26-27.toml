But if the Gentiles are honoring the same God who gave the law to Moses and made the promise to Abraham and whose word the Jews dishonored—why are they [the Jews] ignorant of, or rather why do they choose to ignore, that what the Lord foretold in the Scriptures has been revealed in the world and appeared to it in bodily form, as the Scripture said: “The Lord God has shined on us”; and again: “He sent his Word and healed them”; and again: “Not a messenger, not an angel but the Lord himself saved them”? Their state may be compared to that of one out of his right mind, who sees the earth illumined by the sun but denies the sun that illumines it.
