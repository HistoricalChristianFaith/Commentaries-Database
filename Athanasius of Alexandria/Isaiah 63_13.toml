There can be no doubt that in refusing the accompaniment of an angel Moses was inviting God to lead them himself. God was making this promise, “This word that you have just spoken I shall accomplish, since you have found favor with me and I know you in preference to all the others.” It is also said in Isaiah, “the one who made the shepherd of the sheep to ascend the earth? Where is he who put the Holy Spirit in their midst, who led Moses by his right hand?” … At that time God promised to lead the people himself, and now he promises to send, no longer an angel but the Spirit who is above the angels. It is he who becomes the guide of the people. He thereby shows that the Spirit is neither from among the creatures nor even an angel, but he is superior to creation, united to the divinity of the Father.
