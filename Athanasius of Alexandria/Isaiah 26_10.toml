When, by such faith and knowledge, the Lord’s people have embraced this true life, they surely receive the joy of heaven. The wicked, on the other hand, since they don’t care about the Lord’s life, are rightly deprived of its blessings. For, “let the wicked be taken away so that he shall not see the glory of the Lord.” In the end they, like everyone else, shall hear the universal proclamation of the promise, “Awake, sleeper, and rise up from the dead.” They shall rise and knock on the doors of heaven, saying, “Open to us.” The Lord, however, will rebuke them for rejecting knowledge of him and will tell them, “I do not know you.”
