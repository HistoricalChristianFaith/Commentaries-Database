This enables us to see that the Council of Nicaea breathes the spirit of Scripture. God says in Exodus, “I am that I am,” and through Jeremiah, “Who is in his substance and has seen his word?” and just below, “if they had stood in my subsistence and heard my words.” Now subsistence is essence and means nothing else but very being, which Jeremiah calls existence, in the words “and they heard not the voice of existence.” - "Letter to the Bishops of Africa 4"
