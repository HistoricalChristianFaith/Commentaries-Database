Therefore to God alone appertains worship, and this the very angels know, that though they excel other beings in glory, yet they are all creatures and not to be worshiped, but worship the Lord. Thus Manoah, the father of Samson, wishing to offer sacrifice to the angel, was thereupon hindered by him, saying, “Offer not to me, but to God.” On the other hand, the Lord is worshiped even by the angels; for it is written: “Let all the angels of God worship him.”
