Concerning Jeremiah, God says, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.” … If such terms are used in Scripture of things created, but the term ever is used of the Word, then it follows, O enemies of God, that the Son did not come out of nothing, nor is he to be numbered at all among created things, but he is the Father’s image and eternal word, never having not existed, but never existing as the eternal radiance.
