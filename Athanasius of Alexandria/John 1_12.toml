But this is God's kindness to man, that of whom He is Maker, of them according to grace He afterwards becomes Father also; becomes, that is, when men, His creatures, receive into their hearts, as the Apostle says, "the Spirit of His Son, crying, Abba, Father." And these are they who, having received the Word, gained power from Him to become sons of God; for they could not become sons, being by nature creatures, otherwise than by receiving the Spirit of the natural and true Son. Wherefore, that this might be, "The Word became flesh," that He might make man capable of Godhead. This same meaning may be gained also from the Prophet Malachi, who says, "Hath not One God created us? Have we not all one Father?" for first he puts "created," next "Father," to shew, as the other writers, that from the beginning we were creatures by nature, and God is our Creator through the Word; but afterwards we were made sons, and thenceforward God the Creator becomes our Father also. Therefore "Father" is proper to the Son; and not "creature," but "Son" is proper to the Father. Accordingly this passage also proves, that we are not sons by nature, but the Son who is in us; and again, that God is not our Father by nature, but of that Word in us, in whom and because of whom we "cry, Abba, Father." And so in like manner, the Father calls them sons in whomsoever He sees His own Son, and says, "I begat;" since begetting is significant of a Son, and making is indicative of the works. And thus it is that we are not begotten first, but made; for it is written, "Let Us make man;" but afterwards, on receiving the grace of the Spirit, we are said thenceforth to be begotten also.
