The ancients indeed, the learned Origen and the great Theognostus, describe this to be the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, when they who have been counted worthy of the gift of the Holy Spirit in Baptism, fall back into sin. For they say that for this reason they cannot obtain pardon; as Paul says, It is impossible for those who have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit to renew them again.
