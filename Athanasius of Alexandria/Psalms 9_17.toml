When, by faith and knowledge, the Lord’s people have embraced true life, they surely receive the joy of heaven. The wicked, however, since they do not care about the Lord’s life, are rightly deprived of its blessings. For “let the wicked be taken away so that he shall not see the glory of the Lord.” In the end they, like everyone else, shall hear the universal proclamation of the promise, “Awake, sleeper, and rise up from the dead.” They shall rise and knock on the doors of heaven, saying, “Open to us.” The Lord, however, will rebuke them for rejecting knowledge of him and will tell them, “I do not know you.” And the Holy Spirit speaks against them, “The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all nations that forget God.”
