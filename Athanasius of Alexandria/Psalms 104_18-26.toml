But their doctrine is false. Truth witnesses that God is the eternal fountain of his proper wisdom; and, if the Fountain is eternal, the Wisdom also has to be eternal. For in it were all things made, as David says in the psalm, “In wisdom you have made them all”; and Solomon says, “The Lord by wisdom has formed the earth, by understanding he has established the heavens.” And this Wisdom is the Word, and by him, as John says, “all things were made,” and “without him not one thing was made.”

Doubtless the things that came to be through the Word, these are “founded in wisdom” and what are “founded in wisdom,” these are all made by the Hand and came to be through the Son. And we have proof of this, not from external sources, but from the Scriptures; for God says by Isaiah the prophet, “My hand also has laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand has spanned the heavens.” And again, “And I will cover you in the shadow of my hand, by which I planted the heaven, and laid the foundations of the earth.” And David, who was taught this and knew that the Lord’s hand was nothing else than wisdom, says in the psalm, “In wisdom you have made them all; the earth is full of your creation.”

Let us, therefore, in the faith of the disciples, converse frequently with our Master. For the world is like the sea to us, my brothers, of which it is written, “This is the great and wide sea, there go the ships; the Leviathan, which you have created to play therein.” We float on this sea, as with the wind, through our own free will, for everyone directs his course according to his will, and either, under the pilotage of the Word, he enters into rest, or, laid hold on by pleasure, he suffers shipwreck and is in peril by storm. For as in the ocean there are storms and waves, so in the world there are many afflictions and trials.
