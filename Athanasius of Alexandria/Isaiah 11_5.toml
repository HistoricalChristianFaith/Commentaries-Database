At all times let us stand firm, but especially now, although many afflictions overtake us and many heretics are furious against us. Let us then, my beloved brothers, celebrate with thanksgiving the holy feast that now draws near to us, “girding up the loins of our minds,” like our Savior Jesus Christ, of whom it is written, “Righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and faithfulness the girdle of his reins.”
