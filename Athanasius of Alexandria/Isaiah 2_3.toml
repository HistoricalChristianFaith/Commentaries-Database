Let us sing a victorious song of praise to the Lord!Who will lead us to such a company of angels? Who, longing for the heavenly feast and the angels’ holiday, will say like the prophet, “I will lead them to the house of God: a multitude joyfully praising God and keeping festival”? The saints of old encourage us to be like that, saying, “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob.”
