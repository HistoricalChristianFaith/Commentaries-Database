The Word blamed the children of Israel on account of such a fast as this, exhorting them by Isaiah the prophet and saying, “This is not the fast or the day that I have chosen, that a person should humble his soul.” That we may be able to show what kind of persons we should be when we fast, and of what character the fast should be, listen again to God commanding Moses.… In the tenth day of this seventh month, there shall be a day of atonement; a convocation, and a holy day shall it be to you; and you shall humble your souls, and offer whole burnt offerings to the Lord. And afterwards, that the law might be defined on this point, he proceeds to say, “Every soul that shall not humble itself shall be cut off from the people.”
