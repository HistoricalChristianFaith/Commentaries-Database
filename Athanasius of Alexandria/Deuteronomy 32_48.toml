The great Moses, who previously had hidden himself from Pharaoh and had withdrawn into Midian for fear of him when he received the commandment “Return into Egypt,” did not fear to do so. And again, when he was bidden to go up into the mountain Abarim and die, he delayed not through cowardice but even joyfully proceeded there.
