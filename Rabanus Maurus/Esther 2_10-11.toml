Indeed the church of the nations, being instructed with the precepts of the holy teachers, did not want to disclose the place of its homeland and people, because, after being purified through baptism from any corruption of sin or defilement of idolatry, it is no longer able to bear the shame of its former impiety. And the Lord taught [the church] through the prophet by saying, “Hear, O daughter, consider and incline your ear; forget your people and your father’s house, because the king desired your beauty, as he is also the Lord your God.”
