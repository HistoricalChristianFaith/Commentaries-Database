Declare blessed one who is prudent in his words and tries not to say what he might regret. In fact, “one who guards his mouth and tongue keeps himself from trouble.” This also agrees with the words of James, “If one does not err in speech, he is a perfect person.” But you might ask us, how can he say that one who does not offend in speech is perfect, since the apostle had just said, “We all fall short in many respects”? And Solomon says, “There is no one on earth so just that he does only good and never sins.” And the psalmist, “I said with dismay, ‘Everyone is false.’ ” And John the Evangelist, “If we say that we are without sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” To which it can be replied that there are different kinds of falling short, since the elect fall short in a different way than reprobates, according to Solomon’s testimony: “Because if the just person falls seven times, he gets up, but the impious succumb to disaster.” Indeed, if the just individual falls short through the weakness of the flesh or through ignorance, he does not cease to be just, since, as this type of failure is daily and inevitable, so also is the remedy of prayer and good works always at hand. This immediately raises up the just individual who sins, so that he does not end up staining or ruining the wedding garment8 of charity and faith with the dirt of vice.
