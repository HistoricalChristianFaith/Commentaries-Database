How he is a seal in the right hand of Israel is what the prophet Haggai shows at the end of his book: "In that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant, says the Lord of hosts, and I will place you like a seal, because I have chosen you, says the Lord of hosts." In the end, he is commanded to speak only to Zerubbabel, since he preceded Christ as his image, having assumed the flesh of the line of David. He is told, therefore, what will happen at the end, that this world will pass away and that he will destroy every principality, power and might, pull down the thrones of kings and destroy the power of kingdoms and nations, and the chariots, the horses and the riders. "In that day, says the Lord of hosts, I will take you, Zerubbabel, son of Shealtiel, my servant." He calls him "servant" because of the human body, since "then he also, the Son, will be subjected to the one who subjected all things to him," and with all things subjected it will be seen that he also is subjected. But when all of this is fulfilled, God will put a seal in his hands. God the Father marks him, and he is the image of the invisible God, his imprint and his substance, and whoever will believe in God will be sealed as with a ring. - "On Ecclesiasticus 10.25"
