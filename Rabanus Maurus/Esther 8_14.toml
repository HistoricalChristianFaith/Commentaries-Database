Moreover, what follows next—“And the king’s edict was published in Shushan”— means that the domain of the heavenly king rules over and governs the entire world: “everything has been placed under his jurisdiction, and there is no one who can resist his will” (Esther 13); and our mundane ambitions are laid low by his power. So it makes sense that according to the text the king’s edict was also published in Shushan, since “Shushan” means riding or conveying. In the end, the arrogance of the world is bested by the power of God; which is why the Savior says to his disciples in the Gospel: “in the world, you will face repression; but take heart, for I have conquered the world” (John 16).

The fact that this earthly king sends his couriers to gather the Jews in each place and to assemble them in a single location so that they may fight for their lives and destroy all their enemies with their children and women and houses signifies that through his preachers our king, the absolute ruler of heaven and earth, orders the true Jews and his confessors among all the Gentiles, after they have gathered in the unity of society and peace, to fight for the salvation of their souls and to condemn their enemies both visible and invisible, namely the false Jews, who belong to the synagogue of Satan, and the unredeemed pagan and heretics, and the unclean spirits with all their impieties. - "Explanation on the Book of Esther 11"
