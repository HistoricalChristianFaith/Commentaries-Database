Now, what can “prepare a greatly magnificent feast for all his officials and slaves in honor of his marriage with Esther” mean, if not that everyone throughout the world, from the greatest to the least, celebrates with the greatest joy the spiritual union of Christ and the Church? After all, at this feast it is not meals of the flesh that the celebrants have the honor to consume, but the spiritual dishes of wisdom and virtue. It is there that all of the faithful receive—for the sake of restoring their salvation—the sanctified mysteries of the body and blood of the Lord; and there that the fodder of eternal life is stored. Our king gives a respite to all the provinces, and bestows gifts of many kinds, when he frees those who believe in him from the burden of sin, and repays them with spiritual gifts. That is why he himself says in the Gospel: “Come to me all of you who labor and are burdened, and I will restore you. Take my yoke upon yourselves, and learn from me because I am mild and humble of heart, and you will find rest in your souls” (Matthew 11). The prophet as well says about this: “When he went up on high he led captivity away captive; he gave gifts to men” (Psalms 68). That is why the apostle adds to this: “And he made some of them apostles, others prophets, still others evangelists, and others pastors and teachers for finishing the training of the saints for the work of ministry, for building the body of Christ until we all arrive at the unity of faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, at the complete man, at the measure of the age at which Christ reaches his fullness” (Ephesians 4).
