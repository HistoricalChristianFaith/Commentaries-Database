But let us see what moral signification these names contain. After Jeconias,which means ‘the preparation of the Lord,’ follows Sala Thiel, i.e. ‘God is my petition,’ for he who is rightly prepared, prays not but of God. Again, he becomes Zorobabel, ‘the master of Babylon,’ that is, of the men of the earth, whom he makes to know concerning God, that He is their Father, which is signified in Abiud.Then that people rise again from their vices, whence follows Eliacim, ‘the resurrection;’ and thence rise to good works, which is Azor, and becomes Sadoch, i.e. ‘righteous;’ and then they are taught the love of their neighbour. He is my brother, which is signified inAchim; and through love to God he says of Him, ‘My God,’ which Eliud signifies.
