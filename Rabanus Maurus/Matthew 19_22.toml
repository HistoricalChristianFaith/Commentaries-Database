E Bed. in Luc., Matt 18:3: This man had, it may be, heard of the Lord that only they who were like to little children were worthy to enter into the heavenly kingdom; but desiring to know more certainly, he asks to have it declared to him not in parables, but expressly, by what merits he might attain eternallife.Therefore it is said; “And behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?”
