The death of the flesh, which is the end of bodily life, is bitter for one who trusts in the prosperity of this world and the pursuit of riches, since he has not learned to love the joys of the future life. But since "the world and its disordered desires are passing away," all those who love it will weep when it is no more. - "On Ecclesiasticus 9.2"
