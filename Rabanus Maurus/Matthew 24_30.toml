But nothing hinders our supposing that the sun and moon with the other stars shall for a time lose their light, as we know did the sun at the time of the Lord's passion; as Joel also says, “The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord come.” that is, lacking their proper light.
