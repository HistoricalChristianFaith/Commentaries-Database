After all, the preachers of the sacred Gospel and the leaders of the Church, who glisten with their practice of all the virtues and the beauty of wisdom and—because they are the limbs of the supreme king—are nobly honored with the diadem of royal rank, are ordered to mount the king’s horse, i.e. to take charge of and govern the people of the faithful in whose hearts the king of Heaven himself presides continuously. The Lord himself is told about these horses by the prophet Habakkuk: “Going up you shall mount your horses, and your horsemanship is salvation” (Habakkuk 3).

It is to Mordecai that Haman, the spiritual enemy of the people of God, offers—if unwillingly—the appropriate obeisance, since the persecutors of the holy Church are often forced with the assent of Heaven to preach with accurate testimony the praises of the Church, even though they do so in a spirit of disdain; because once the truth has been revealed, the guilty cannot conceal what is obvious by hiding it away.
