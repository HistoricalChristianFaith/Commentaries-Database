“Command therefore that the sepulchre be made sure until the third day.” For Christ's disciples were spiritually thieves; stealing from the unthankful Jews the writings of the New and Old Testament, they bestowed them to be used by the Church; and while they slept, that is, while the Jews were sunk in the lethargy of unbelief, they carried off the promised Saviour, and gave Him to be believed on by the Gentiles.
When they say, “And the last error will be worse than the first,” they utter atruth unwittingly, for their contempt of penitence was worse for the Jews than was their error of ignorance.
Pilate’s answer to their request is as much as to say, Be it enough for you that ye have conspired the death of an innocent man, henceforth let your error remain with you.
