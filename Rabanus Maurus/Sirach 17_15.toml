The ways of human beings are their desires and their actions, which in any case do not escape God’s knowledge, since “everything is naked and exposed before his eyes.” This is why the psalmist says, “The Lord knows a person’s thoughts: they are but a breath.” But he has especially known the way of those whom he approves. Conversely, it is said that he does not know the ways of those whose actions he condemns. Thus it is written, “The Lord watches over the way of the just, but the way of the wicked ends in ruin.”
