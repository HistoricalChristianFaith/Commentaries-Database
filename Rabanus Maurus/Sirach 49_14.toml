What was set forth at first and again recapitulated concerning Enoch, if not that his being taken away prefigured the ascension into heaven of our Lord Jesus Christ, who became incarnate in the last days of the world and was testified to by all the patriarchs and prophets? It is rightly said of him that “no one was created on earth equal to Enoch,” which means consecration, as one who has consecrated his church, consecrating it with his blood. He came into the world without sin and was received into heaven in glory. Of him the psalmist says, “You are the most beautiful among the sons of men,” and, “Ascending on high, he took prisoners with him; he gave gifts to human beings.”
