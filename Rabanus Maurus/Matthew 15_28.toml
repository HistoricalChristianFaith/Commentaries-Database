But the whelps eat not the crust only, but the crumbs of the childrenâ€™s bread, because the despised among the Gentiles on turning to the faith, seek out in Scripture not the outside of the letter, but the spiritual sense, by which they may be able to profit in good acts.
Great indeed was her faith; for the Gentiles, neither trained in the Law, nor educated by the words of the Prophets, straightway on the preaching of the Apostles obeyed with the hearing of the ear, and therefore deserved to obtain salvation.
Also whosoever has his conscience polluted with the defilement of any sin, has a daughter sorely vexed by adaemon. Also whosoever has defiled any good that he has done by the plague of sin, has a daughter tossed bythe furies of an unclean spirit, and has need to fly to prayers and tears, and to seek the intercessions and aids of the saints.
