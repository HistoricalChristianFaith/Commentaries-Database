“And the decree was immediately issued in Shushan; and the king and Haman were attending the feast while all the Jews in the city were crying.” This is what the Savior preached to his disciples in the Gospel: “Amen, amen I say to you that you will cry and weep, while the world rejoices; and though you will be sad, your sadness will turn to joy” (John 16).
