It is certain that his faith and his meekness made holy and acceptable to God the one who was chosen by the divine providence to govern all. While the sons of Israel listened, the Lord gave him the law on Mount Sinai and established the precepts of life, speaking with him in the cloud so that he would teach his people and instruct them in how to live justly. And though he would symbolize many things at different times, by the fact that he brought the people of God out of Egypt through the waters of the Red Sea and led them through the desert, while the cloud guided and indicated the way, he is the image of the Law. Under the guidance of Christ, the Law freed the faithful from the spiritual Egypt and from the power of the true pharaoh by the waters of baptism, so that in the desert of this world, instructed and taught by the divine precepts, they would reach the promised land, the heavenly homeland, where they will have every good thing in abundance and will enjoy eternal life.
