Joshua son of Nun showed himself by his name and his actions to be a figure of the Savior, to whom God the Father “has given the name that is above every other name, so that at the name of Jesus every knee would bend in the heavens, on the earth and under the earth.” And since this name is above every other name, for generations it was not borne by anyone. Moses wrote the book of Genesis, in which we read of Abraham and of those born to him, of whom many are righteous but none of whom merited to be called Jesus. Not even Abel was called Jesus, nor he who began to invoke the name of the Lord God nor he who pleased God and was taken away and did not know death. Nor Noah, who was the only just person of his generation before God. And not Abraham, who received the promises of the covenant, nor Isaac, born of him, nor Jacob the deceiver nor any of his sons. Moses was faithful in all his house, but not even he was called Jesus. Rather, I find the name of Jesus for the first time in the book of Exodus. I want to reiterate when the name of Joshua-Jesus is first mentioned, “Amalek came to fight against Israel, and Moses said to Joshua at Rephidim.” This is the first mention of the name Joshua-Jesus: “Choose some brave men from among the sons of Israel to fight against Amalek tomorrow.” He is the one who was given command after the death of Moses, who led the army and fought against Amalek and, as is symbolized by the hands stretched out on the mountain, nailed the principalities and powers to his victorious cross.
