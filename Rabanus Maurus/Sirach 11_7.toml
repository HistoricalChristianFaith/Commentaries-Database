Avoid reckless judgments. This is why the Lord commands that the innocent, or the one against whom there is only one witness, should not be punished. Instead, “everything must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.” Likewise, the apostle orders Timothy to “not receive accusations against an elder without the deposition of two or three witnesses.”
