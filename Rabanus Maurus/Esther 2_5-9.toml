Now, what can Esther—whose name means hidden, and who was also called Hadassah, i.e. mercy—signify if not the Church of the nations, which pleases God in the recesses of its heart because its faith is pure, and it finds before the eyes of God more mercy and grace than the Synagogue of the Jews which the prophet Hosea rightly calls “No-mercy” on account of its wickedness. So the spiritual Mordecai adopts her as his daughter, because she had lost both her parents; and what can Mordecai signify if not the teachers of the nations, and especially the blessed apostle Paul who was also, we are told, from the line of Jemin, i.e. from the tribe of Benjamin? He too was entrusted with the Church of the nations after the call of God transformed him from a persecutor into an apostle; and after the deaths of her father and her mother—that is, the errors and superstitions of the gentiles—he made her in a sense his own when, through the grace of baptism and the word of the Gospels, he sired anew a daughter for the all-powerful Father for eternal salvation. Hence he said to them: “Though you might have many masters, you do not have many fathers; for I sired you in Christ through the Gospel” (1 Corinthians 4). She was, therefore, been taken into captivity at one time by Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, when—because of the Devil—she was taken from natural law and the worship of one God to the confusion of idolatry. Yet God’s righteousness never abandoned her, and in fact called her back to the path of truth by means of his preachers, who looked after her with great care and brought her up in complete righteousness, justice and truth. For her, Hegai the eunuch—i.e. the chaste order of pastors—prepared the cosmetics of women, that is, healthful doctrine and examples of good works; and he gave her his own share of food, which was actually the knowledge of Scripture and an upright character. He also arranged for her seven beautiful girls as attendants, in that he adopted—for the sake of giving her a very beneficial apprenticeship—more of the faithful who were reborn through the grace of the sevenfold Holy Spirit and likewise took up good works. In other words, she would therefore be found suitable in every way for the couch of the eternal king, adorned as she was with a flourishing faith and the glow from every kind of virtue.

It is evident that Esther signifies the gentile church. Her name is interpreted as “hiding place,” and she also had the other name of Hadassah, that is, “mercy.” The church is pleasing to God in the hiding place of his heart because of the chastity of her faith and before the eyes of God it finds a greater mercy and grace than the synagogue of the Jews which with good reason the prophet Hosea calls merciless because of its impiety. Therefore the spiritual Mordecai adopted [Esther] as his own daughter because she had lost both her parents. And what is signified by Mordecai but the future teachers of the Gentiles? This is especially true of the blessed apostle Paul who also descended from the stock of Jemin, that is, he testified to be from the tribe of Benjamin. After Paul was transformed from persecutor into apostle, the gentile church was entrusted to him. And he himself, after her mother and father had died—namely, the errors and superstitions of the Gentiles—made her his own daughter when he regenerated her through the grace of baptism and the word of the gospel, making her also a daughter of the almighty Father, saved for all eternity. Therefore Paul said to them, “For though you might have ten thousand guardians in Christ, you do not have many fathers. Indeed, in Christ Jesus I became your father through the gospel.”
