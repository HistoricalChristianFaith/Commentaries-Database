“Vashti the queen also held a feast for the women in the palace where King Ahasuerus liked to stay.” Queen Vashti must symbolize the Jewish people, which at the time seemed to have ruled like a queen since it was found to stand apart from all the other nations in its worship of a single God. So she held a feast for the women where the king would liked to stay; that is, in Jerusalem itself—the site of the Temple of God and the Holy of Holies—it demonstrated its observance of the Law in worship or rather by meditating on the Holy Scriptures, through which it supplied to its members the refreshment of spiritual knowledge by granting them the awareness of their power from Heaven.
