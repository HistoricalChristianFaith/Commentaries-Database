According to the allegory, Josiah is a figure of the saving Lord, he who is called the salvation and strength of the Lord, since Scripture says of him, “The mighty Lord, the Lord strong in battle.” And elsewhere, “He will save his people from their sins.” In fact, out of zeal for God, he who said through the prophet, “Zeal for your house consumes me,” purifies the land of Judah and Jerusalem from all filth and abomination. Of him John says, “His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor.”
