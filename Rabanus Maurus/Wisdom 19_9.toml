It is fitting that we, too, give thanks at all times to our Creator for our liberation, saying with the prophet, “Bless the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me bless his holy name. Bless the Lord, my soul, and do not forget all his benefits.” And we see that the apostle also teaches us, “Pray constantly, in all things give thanks. This is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus.”
