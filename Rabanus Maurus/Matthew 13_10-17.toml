[[commentary]]
quote='''
The heart of the Jews is made gross with the grossness of wickedness, and through the abundance of their sins they hear hardly the Lord's words, because they have received them ungratefully.

Also Isaiah and Micah, and many other Prophets, saw the glory of the Lord; and were thence called 'seers.'
