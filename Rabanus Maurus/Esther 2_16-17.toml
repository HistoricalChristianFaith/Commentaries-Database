Hence we should also bear in mind the crucial moment when Esther was brought to the king’s bedchamber:

“So she was brought to the bedchamber of King Ahasuerus in the tenth month, which is called Tevet, in the seventh year of his reign; and the king loved her more than all the women, and placed the diadem of kingship on her head, and had her rule in place of Vashti.” For Tevet is that month in the Hebrew calendar which corresponds to the Greek Eudymos and the Latin Januarius, when the Lord incarnate was circumcised on the eighth day and was adored even as a tiny infant by the Magi, who were brought there by a star that led the way, and honored as God, man and king with the gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh that were offered to him. This was also the month when he was heralded and baptized by John. So in the seventh year of Ahasuerus, Esther went up to the king’s bed; and the Church was brought to and joined with the king Christ, in whom she remains without change by the grace of the sevenfold Spirit. “Whom he loved more than all the women;” and she had before him grace and mercy above all women, that is, above all the nations of the world. “He placed on her head the diadem of kingship,” when he summoned her as his consort in kingship; “and he had her rule in place of Vashti,” i.e. the Synagogue of the Jews which lost its place of honor when it spurned and crucified our king. That is, the prophet is looking at the excellence of this queen when he says to Christ the king: “The queen stood at your right hand in golden robes, cloaked in colorful clothing” (Psalms 45). And right after that, he speaks to her as follows: “Listen daughter, and see, and lend your ear, and forget your people and your father’s home, because the king has desired your beauty. He is the Lord your God, and the daughters of Tyre will adore him; with gifts all the wealthy among the people will seek your face” (ibid.).
