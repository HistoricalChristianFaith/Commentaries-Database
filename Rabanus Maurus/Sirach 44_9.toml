The godless and sinners were not worthy of memory, because if the Scripture says something of them, it does so not to praise them but to blame. In the psalm it is written of them, “The fortresses of the enemy have been pulled down forever, the memory of the city you destroyed has disappeared. Their memory has disappeared with a roar.” At the end of the world, in fact, to the devil’s joy, those who it has been determined belong to his city will fall, and their memory will perish with a fantastic din when they go to eternal punishment.
