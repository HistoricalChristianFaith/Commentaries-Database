People and herds crossed the depths of the Red Sea dry-shod, and frogs from the river filled the houses of the Egyptians. Fire rained from heaven mixed with hail, and neither the fire opposed itself to the water nor the water to the fire, but falling together they struck the land of the Egyptians. Where the children of Israel were, they hurt no one, to show that all the elements of the world are subject not only to their proper condition but also to the service of the will of the Creator. - "On Ecclesiasticus 3.18"
