After Joshua son of Nun, the people of God were ruled by judges, who governed them and defended them from enemies. In the same way, after the passion, resurrection and ascension into heaven of our Savior, the church of God had the apostles and the apostolic leaders who instructed it with holy admonitions, fortifying it, with good merits and with holy prayers, against spiritual iniquity and against all enemies. For this reason it is right to say that “their hearts were not corrupted, and they did not turn away from the Lord,” since they persevered to the end of their lives in right faith and in the true religion, to such an extent that their memory has been honored by a perennial blessing2 and the power of their good works was rewarded with an eternal prize. Thus the memory of their name will be handed down to their posterity with glory. Indeed, all peoples will recount their wisdom, and the entire assembly of the saints sings their praises.
