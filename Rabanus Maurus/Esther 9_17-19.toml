Now, the Scripture tells us that some of the Jews carried out the killing of their enemies on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and stopped their slaughter on the fourteenth day when they held this festival; but that others carried out the killing of their enemies for two days, i.e. the thirteenth and the fourteenth of the aforementioned month, and finally held a formal rest on the fifteenth when they left off the slaughter. And this can only mean that some of the saints, having completed the labors which they carried out in the service of God by performing it according to the proper doctrine and living it properly, now have in their hands—even before the time of universal judgment—the Sabbath rest of eternal peace; while others endure in the flesh until the final day of resurrection, so that once all their enemies have been bested they will be suddenly changed through God’s power, and will attain eternal rest and blessed immortality for both their souls and their bodies. This we know from the statement that the apostle makes when he writes to the Corinthians: “Behold the mystery I am telling you: we will all, it is true, rise again, but we will not all be changed. In a moment, in the blink of an eye, at the final trumpet, the dead will rise up uncorrupted, and we will be changed” (1 Corinthians 15). And to the Thessalonians: “For this we say to you in the word of the Lord: we will not precede those who are sleeping, since the Lord himself—in his command, and in the voice of the archangel, and in the trumpet of God—will come down from Heaven. And the dead who are in Christ will rise up first, and then those of us who are still alive, we who still remain, will be taken up together with those in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we will be with the Lord always” (1 Thessalonians 4).

After all, the number fourteen, which contains twice seven, symbolizes the rest of souls from labor and worry of every kind; and fifteen, which combines the numbers seven and eight, prefigures the coming rest and the immortality of both souls and bodies; and so, once the mass of the chosen have completed the labors of the present life and victory over every enemy has been achieved, they will rejoice in the kingdom of Heaven in their eternal exultation and their love for one another. And there will be no end to this joy, because there will no longer be any further labors to cause us unhappiness.
