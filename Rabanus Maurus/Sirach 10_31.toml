This means that the one who places all of his trust in the abundance of earthly things must fear future poverty, always remembering that evangelical parable of the rich man dressed in purple and the poor Lazarus. The one clothed with temporary glory is thrown into eternal torments while the other clothed in the misery of the present life rises to eternal joy. And James also says this: "Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted and the rich in that he is made low." For whoever humbly undergoes adversities for the Lord shall receive the highest rewards of the kingdom from him. In other words, the rich should boast in their humiliation"in an ironic twist"otherwise, they will see the "glory" that is due them for the pride they placed in their riches while disregarding the poor or even oppressing them"their end will be perpetual punishment. - "On Ecclesiasticus 3.3"
