If we consider what a good peace is, it is easy to understand the evil of discord. If, in fact, “blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God,” there is no doubt that the contentious are evil and children of the devil, since, giving birth to enmities, they sow discord among those who are at peace. Principal among these are the heretics and schismatics who, defending their pernicious sects, are not afraid to provoke arguments and scandals. For this reason the apostle Paul exhorted Timothy with these words: “Avoid vain discussions, which are good for nothing but the destruction of those who listen.” And, “Avoid foolish and ignorant debates, knowing that they breed quarrels. A servant of the Lord must not be quarrelsome but meek toward all, apt to teach, patient, gentle in reproof of those who oppose the truth.”
