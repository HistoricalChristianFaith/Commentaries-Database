What does the text mean when it says that King Ahasuerus made all lands and all islands of the sea subject to his tributes? Since the historical king of the Persians and Medes did not have all lands under his rule, nor was he able to make all the islands of the sea subject to his tributes since the fame of his name could not even reach some of those islands or parts of the world, this sentence more truly applies to our king and Lord Christ whose power is in heaven, on earth, over the sea and every abyss. And he called himself “door,” because through him we have access to eternal life, according to the testimony of the psalmist, “And the kings of the entire universe adore him. And all the kings of the earth serve him, the kings of Tharsis and the islands offer gifts, the kings of Arabia and Sheba bring gifts.” Therefore not only the voices and the writings of the Jewish people alone, but also those of all the nations testify how the power of this king, his authority, dignity and preeminence advanced the true Mordecai, that is, the assembly of the holy teachers and masters of the church who lead the Christian people. Those whom he made his elect at the beginning through the gift of grace, those whom he made glorious and honorable before all the nations are the ones who look out for the good of his people and speak the words which concern the peace of his seed, according to the prediction of Isaiah: “Listen! Your sentinels lift up their voices; together they sing your praises.” - "Explanation on the Book of Esther 14"
