The fact that King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, clearly signifies that the true king who is our Lord transferred to the holy church all the dignity and honor which the people previously possessed because of their knowledge of the law and the prophets and because of their holy and religious worship. This happened because they despised the advent in flesh of the Mediator between God and humanity and because they had no desire to receive his gospel. And so the church was able to possess all the spiritual riches and become the sincere guardian of all virtue. Therefore it is written in the book of Proverbs, “The sinner’s wealth is laid up for the righteous.” And the Lord says to the Jews themselves in the gospel, “The kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people that produces the fruits of the kingdom.” And again it is said through Solomon, “The good obtain favor from the Lord.”
