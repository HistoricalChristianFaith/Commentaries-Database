For those who always faithfully perform pious labors, and good works, and who generously give charity, are fighting for this so that they will be worthy to win entry to eternal life in faith, hope and charity, in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels and the apostles; and so that by comforting both themselves—and those who obey them—in the midst of the troubles of this world, they will gain strength. So by rejoicing in hope they are patient in times of tribulation, they pray without respite, they give thanks for everything, and with pious prayers they place their suffering in the hands of the faithful Lord so that they may be repaid, through his help, with eternal happiness.
