This passage opposes Pelagius, who puts free will before grace, even though the elect are freed from every stain only by the grace of Christ. Thus the apostle says, "By grace we have been saved." And, "Who will free me from this body given over to death? The grace of God through Christ our Lord." And again, "By the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace in me has not been in vain." - "On Ecclesiasticus 7.2"
