The children of sinners are detestable in the eyes of the Lord, not because they are born of sinful parents (since many righteous people had wicked fathers, like Hezekiah son of Ahaz and Josiah son of Amon), but because they imitated the wicked actions of their fathers. For this reason he added, “One who stays in the dwelling of the ungodly,” speaking of those who imitated the crimes of their reprobate parents, whose conduct was wicked and who consequently will miss the inheritance of the heavenly homeland, forever ashamed.
