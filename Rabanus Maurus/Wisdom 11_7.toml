It indicates in a mysterious way that the people of God and the sheep of his pasture, whom the great Shepherd9 rescued with the price of his blood, will have their thirst quenched with the fountain of living water11 and that their persecutors, falling into eternal destitution, will be given over to everlasting death. Similar to this passage is the one pronounced by the Lord through Isaiah against his adversaries: “See, my servants will eat, and you will be hungry. See, my servants will drink and you will be thirsty. See, my servants will rejoice and you will be downcast. See, my servants will shout for joy of heart, but you will cry out for sorrow of heart and howl for anguish of spirit.” One must therefore receive that drink that rises from the springs of Israel, and the one who drinks it will have in himself a “spring of water that wells up for eternal life,” that drink that the Savior promises he will drink together with the apostles in the kingdom of the Father. It gladdens the hearts of human beings, so that those who drink it can say, “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness.” And, full of the Holy Spirit, the mother of the Lord prophesied, “He has filled the hungry with good things,” those who previously did not have the food of the Lord, and “he has sent the rich away empty,” those who did everything they could to do away with him, rejecting the one whom they recognized to be a prophet. Of them, that is, of the Jewish people, the psalmist elsewhere sings, “The rich grow poor and are hungry.” “But those who seek the Lord,” that is, the multitude of the peoples, “lack nothing.”
