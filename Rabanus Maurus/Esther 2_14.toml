What then follows—“She would enter in the evening and leave in the morning, and was then brought to the second building”—and so on, proves in an allegorical way that after our vices have subsided, the glow of our virtues (which will not shine properly anywhere but in the unity of the holy Church) ought to rise. And yet one who has sequestered himself from it because he has some foul odor of error or vice is quite rightly kept from being brought to the second building where the king’s concubines were waiting, because a decline in robust faith deserves not a advance in but a restoration of respect; and he will no longer have such an authorization to return to our king until he has been visited once again by celestial grace, and restored through his calling to his original dignity.
