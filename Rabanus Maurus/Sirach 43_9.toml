The beauty of the saints adorns the church. Those whom the most high Lord has ordained to enlighten the whole world with the preaching of the gospel and with the marks of the virtues await the judgment of God in holy words, that is, they attend with constancy to the doctrine of the true faith and are not broken by the adversities of this world. Nor do they let themselves be overcome by anger but endure all things with patience, continually caring for the flock entrusted to them, always diligently remembering in their hearts those words of the Lord, “Be ready, with your loins girded and your lamps lit. Be like those who await the master’s return from the wedding.” “Be ready, because in an hour you do not expect, the Son of man will come.” “By your perseverance you will save your souls.”
