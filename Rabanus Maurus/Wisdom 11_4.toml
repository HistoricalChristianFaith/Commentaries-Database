What that rock from which the Israelites drank was to signify is attested to by Paul with these words, “They drank from a spiritual rock that accompanied them, and that rock was the Christ.” This rock, struck by the wood of the cross and announced by the spirits (that is, by the writings) of the prophets, poured forth the living water that fills all of the elect, restoring and satisfying them for all eternity. For this reason the Truth says, “Whoever thirsts, let him come to me and drink, and rivers of living water will flow from his heart.” And elsewhere, “Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him, the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water, welling up for eternal life.” This rock is also called most high, because in it is contained the immense grace of the Spirit. And also hard rock, since it is firm and stable, and whoever is wise builds his house on it in such a way that no storm can shake it.
