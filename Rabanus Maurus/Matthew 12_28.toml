Or, because the Apostles well knew within their own conscience that they had learnt no evil art from Him. Desiring then to show that the things which were said against Him were only jealous suspicions, He brings forward the Apostles. And also He leads them to a knowledge of Himself, showing how they stood in the way of their own good, and resisted their own salvation; whereas they ought to be joyful because He had come to bestow great goods upon them; "If I by the Spirit of God cast out daemons, then is the kingdom of God come upon you.” This also shows that it is a matter of great power to cast out daemons, and not an ordinary grace. And thus it is He reasons, “Therefore is the kingdom of God come upon you,” as much as to say, If this indeed be so, thenis the Son of God come upon you. But this He hints darkly, that it may not seem hard to them. Also to draw their attention, He said not merely, “The kingdom hath come,” but, “upon you;” that is to say, These good things are coming for you; why do you oppose your own salvation; for this is the very sign given by the Prophets of the presence of the Son of God, that such works as these should be wrought by Divine power.
