The story of Esther is found not only in the holy books but also in the Antiquities of Josephus, though their accounts of these events differ in certain respects. But the latter also raises the question of just who was this Ahasuerus who ruled from India to Ethiopia, over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces; for when Josephus mentions him, he reports that Cyrus was the son of King Xerxes who ruled in Persia after his uncle Darius. He says, therefore, that Cyrus was the one the Greeks called Artaxerxes—surnamed “Longhand”—who held the kingdom for forty years; but I don’t believe that Esther lived in that era because Ezra would never have kept silent about her, given that he writes that it was at that time that Ezra and Menna returned from Babylon, and then narrates their subsequent actions. Eusebius, accordingly, suggests in his Chronicle that this Ahasuerus was called Artaxerxes, and that he reigned for forty years after his uncle Darius, who was surnamed “Bastard.”
