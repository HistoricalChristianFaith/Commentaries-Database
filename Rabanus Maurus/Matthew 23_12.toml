It should be noted, that He does not forbid those to whom this belongs by right of rank to be saluted in the forum, or to sit or recline in the highest room; but those who unduly desire these things, whether they obtain them or not, these He enjoins the believers to shun as wicked.
And herein they are not without fault, that the same men should be concerned in the litigations of the forum, who in the synagogue in Mosesâ€™ seat, seek to becalled Rabbi by men.
