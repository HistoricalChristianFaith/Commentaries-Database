Not only those who fabricate idols are criminals and traitors, but also those who love and worship them, putting their hope in them, since not only those who do evil deserve death but also those who agree with them. The psalmist shows the condition of those who put their hope in idols, “The idols of the nations are of silver and gold, the work of human hands. They have mouths and do not speak, eyes and do not see, ears and do not hear, noses and do not smell. They have hands and do not feel, feet and do not walk. No sounds issue from their throats. Those who make them and trust in them will be like them.” Indeed, with wicked hands a mortal shapes something dead, and a fool worships what is beyond foolish. Speaking allegorically, this treats first of heretics, who devise and give shape to perverse opinions, while those who love and worship them are their followers and disciples. And all of them are condemned and destined to be lost. In fact, “they will all be amazed and confused together.” “The Lord will disperse the one who has acted thusly, the master and his disciple.” “Woe to the godless! He will be repaid according to the misdeeds of his hands.”
