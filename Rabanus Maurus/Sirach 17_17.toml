We may interpret that the rulers placed by God over every people are the angels to whom he entrusted the care of each people, according to that word of Deuteronomy, “He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the angels of God.” And one reads in the book of Daniel that there is a head of the Greeks and a head of the Persians, besides Michael, who is the head of the people of God. It also deals with the holy doctors, whom divine election established as those who would preach his word throughout the earth. Thus John was commanded in the Apocalypse to write to the angel of Ephesus and to the angel of Smyrna, and also to the angel of Pergamum and to the angels of the other churches.
