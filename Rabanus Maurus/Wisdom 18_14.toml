It says that at midnight, almighty God made his word descend from heaven, from the royal throne, like a ruthless champion in the middle of the land of slaughter, to powerfully carry out the judgment of death on the godless. What is the word of the Lord if not the Son of God, of whom John says, “In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” through whom everything was made? Elsewhere he is called the arm of God, as Isaiah says, “To whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” He is also called the right hand of the Lord, in that he is the power that brings into effect the divine power. It must be understood, then, that this word, in virtue of the evangelical ministry, carried out at that time the judgment on the firstborn of the Egyptians and then consecrated the firstborn of the Israelites to himself. He now saves the multitude of believers through the waters of baptism, at the same time destroying the huge army of spiritual enemies.
