Susa is the capital of Persia, which according to the chroniclers was founded by the brother of Memnon; and it is called Susa because it borders on the river Susa, which is the location of the royal palace of Cyrus. This was known for its bright and colorful stone, along with its gold columns, its ponds, and its gems; and it also contained a likeness of the heavens inlaid with shining stars, and other things that the human mind finds difficult to comprehend. And it was there, we are told, that the king in question would stage for his subject peoples a grand feast that featured impressive accouterments and a wealth of riches.

Susa is the metropolis of Persia which the historians say was founded by the brother of Memnon. It is called Susa because it lies along the river Susis where the royal palace of Cyrus was constructed with glittering white stone as well as other varieties. It is conspicuous for its golden columns and roofs and for its precious stones. It also contains the sculpture of a sky full of shining stars and other incredible things to the human mind. This is the place where it is said that the king gave a lavish banquet and displayed his great wealth to his subjects.
