Hereby He showed that He will meet with His help all those who begin the ways of virtue, and enable them to attain to everlasting salvation.

It was told above how He rose when the sepulchre was closed, to show that that body which had been shut up therein dead, was now become immortal. He now offers His feet to be held by the women, to show that He had real flesh, which can be touched by mortal creatures.
