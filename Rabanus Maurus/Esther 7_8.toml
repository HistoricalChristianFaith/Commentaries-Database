That is, Haman’s attempt to beseech Queen Esther was regarded by King Ahasuerus as a ruse, because when the day of judgment arrives the petitions of the wicked are seen not as prayer but as provocation. Hence it is written in the Psalm: “When he is judged let him leave condemned, and let his prayer become sin” (Psalms 109). For it is then that the oppression with which they were crushing the humble is thrown back in their faces, because the time of recompense is at hand; for then those who have been condemned for their sins are covered in shame, as it is written: “The confusion of their faces will cover them,” when they are dragged off to the depths of Hell to be given a reward that suits their actions.
