Esaias saw before the hypocrisy of the Jews, that they would craftily oppose the Gospel, and therefore he said in the person of the Lord, “This peoplehonoureth me with their lips”.
Also, they honoured Him with their lips when they said, “Master, we know thatthou art true,” but their heart was far from Him when they sent spies to entangle Him in His talk.
Therefore they shall not have their reward with the true worshippers, because they teach doctrines and commandments of men to the contempt of the law of God.
