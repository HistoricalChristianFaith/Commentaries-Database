Then it adds: “And it was investigated, and discovered, and both men were hung on a gibbet; and the king commanded that it be written in the record book that he should be repaid somehow for saving his life; and it was set down in the accounts, and recorded in the chronicles before the king.” The “record books” are, then, the volumes of the two Testaments which set down the rewards that await the righteous in return for their good deeds, and the punishments that await the wicked for their sins. Hence it is written in the Gospel: “The son of man is going to come in the glory of his Father, and will then repay each one according to his works” (Matthew 16). And likewise, “The wicked will come to eternal punishment, while the just come to eternal reward” (Matthew 25). Hence Paul as well writes to the Romans as follows: “For the wrath of God is unleashed upon all the wickedness and injustice of men, who repress in their injustice the truth of God who repays each according to his works; and those who seek glory, honor, and purity by patiently doing good deeds will receive eternal life, while those who trust in wickedness, because they are contentious and will not acquiesce to the truth, will receive wrath and indignation. There will be trouble and distress for every soul of an evildoer” (Romans 1 and 2). Ezekiel as well speaks about this: “The justice of the just man will be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked man will be upon him. When a soul has sinned, it will die” (Ezekiel 18). The Psalmist also refers to this in the same terms: “The eyes of the Lord are upon the just, and his ears attend to their prayers; the face of the Lord is upon those who do evil, that he may wipe their memory from the earth” (Psalms 33).
