So the days of lots—on which God gives his true followers victory over their enemies—will never fall into oblivion, but will be celebrated throughout the world in every generation since each of the faithful must declare, with firm hope, the coming rest of souls and the resurrection of bodies on the day of judgment; nor should any of the Churches of Christ throughout the world be bereft of this faith, but should be always mindful of this most salutary rite and be prepared at every moment, and should make themselves fit to receive the coming good so that what they celebrate here in this world they may possess there forever in faith and hope, in the truth of the thing itself and in eternal happiness. And for the present, while we are journeying through this life the ingenuity of the teachers, and the Church’s adherence to the precedent of Esther and Mordecai, ought to accomplish this along with us through teaching and exhortation, so that we are always devoted to the celebration and the cultivation of this faith.
