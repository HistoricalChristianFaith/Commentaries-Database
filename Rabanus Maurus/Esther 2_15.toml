It says “in the course of time,” i.e. once the five ages of the world—during which the posterity of the Fathers was gaining ground, and the institution of the Law was flourishing among the Jews—had come to an end, and a sixth age was at hand when, with the arrival of the Redeemer, a multitude from among the nations would be brought together through the Gospel. For it was then that Esther in the allegorical sense, i.e. the Church, was being brought from among the nations to Christ the king through the apostles’ preaching, and by means of the belief of robust faith and the sacrament of baptism; she was shapely, and in the incredible beauty of her virtues she appeared gracious and lovely to all who saw her. The apostle Paul mentions this period when he writes to the Galatians, as follows: “After the fullness of time had come, God sent his own Son born from a woman, made under the Law so that he might redeem those who were under the Law, so that we might receive the adoption given to children” (Galatians 4). And to the Ephesians: “God, who is rich in mercy, revived us together with Christ by whose grace you were saved, because of the great charity with which he loved us even though we were dead through our sins; and he revived us with him, and had us sit with him in the heavens in Christ Jesus to show in the ages to come the abundant riches of his grace in his goodness toward us in Christ Jesus” (Ephesians 2).
