Having first discussed the differences between counselors, here he adds how human wisdom is surpassed by the knowledge of the holy person, infused in him by the gift of the Holy Spirit. The seven counselors are the philosophers that teach the liberal arts (which they have divided into seven parts). It is clear, however, that in every way the modest doctrine of a person having right faith, which is found in the divine books, is more true than the manifold intelligence of the philosophers in discussion and argumentation. In the one, the truth shines without blemish by means of a few pure words. In the other, in babbling on about abstruse questions, erroneous opinions emerge, or even obvious falsehoods.
