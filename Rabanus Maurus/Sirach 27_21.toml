Treachery is the worst evil, and of difficult remedy. This was shown by the example of Judas the traitor, of whom it was said through the prophet in the psalm, “Even the friend in whom I trusted, even he, who ate my bread, raises his heel against me.” One who despairs in horror at the consciousness of his own sin thinks more of the noose2 than of the salutary medicine of repentance. This is why it is written about him, “He loved cursing: may it fall on him! He did not want blessing: may it be far from him!”
