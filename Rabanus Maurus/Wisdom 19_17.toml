It rightly says that they were stricken with blindness, like those who were blinded by the darkness and wandered before the door of the righteous one—that is, of Lot—looking for the door’s opening without finding it. In fact, whoever suffers interiorly because of the darkness of error is surrounded on all sides by extremely grave dangers, since he does not know the way to life. And nor can one who errs find that door who says in the Gospel, “I am the door. If someone enters through me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.”
