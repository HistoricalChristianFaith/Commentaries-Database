“Alabaster” is a kind of marble, white but marked with veins of different colours, which was in use for vessels to hold ointment, because it was said top reserve it from corruption.
From the Greek, &#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#953;&#962;,faith, whence ‘pisticus,’ faithful. For this ointment was pure, unadulterated.
That is, To whatsoever place throughout the whole world the Church shall be propagated, there this also that she hath done shall be told. That also that is added signifies, that as Judas by his reproof of her has earned evil character of treachery, so has she also earned the glory of pious devotedness.
