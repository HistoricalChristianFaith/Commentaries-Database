What can it mean that on the third day Esther dressed in royal garments, if not that in the third age of the world—i.e. after the incarnation, passion and resurrection of Christ—the Church of the nations dressed herself in faith, hope and charity, and in the beauty of all the virtues, to receive the sacraments of baptism through the confession of the holy Trinity so that she would then be worthy of the king’s company, since she was burning incessantly with a special love for him? She stands in the courtyard of the king’s house which was inside, opposite the king’s basilica, i.e. in the righteous works of this life which looks toward future compensation in Heaven, where the king himself sits on his celestial throne and assents to the prayers of those who piously cry out to him. He extends to this queen the staff he holds in his hand when he shows her the power of his rule, or rather the cross of his passion through which he has acquired for himself power in Heaven, on earth, and below the earth; so that “in his name every creature—celestial, terrestrial and infernal—shall bend his knee.” In fact, she kisses this staff lovingly, that is, she reveres it with total devotion. And the king himself pledges that he will agree to her request, just as he says in the Gospel: “Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you” (Matthew 7). And likewise: “Seek and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete.” For complete joy is given to the holy Church solely in the sense that it partakes in the kingdom of Heaven, where the fortunate queen will rule forever with Christ the king. And yet once she is allowed to choose her request, she invites him to the feast she has prepared for him; though this can best be understood as that complete and perfect devotion to her faith upon which the observer and arbiter of all the ages nourishes himself within. Of course, the Church invites to this refreshment, i.e. to this communion of vigorous faith, not only her friends but even her enemies and persecutors, namely pagans, Jews and heretics, so that—leaving behind the isolation of complete error—they may rejoice in the common good in the single home of catholic belief.
