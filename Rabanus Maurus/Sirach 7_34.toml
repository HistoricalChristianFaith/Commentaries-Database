It shows that the offering that one offers to God with a humble mind and pure love purifies him from many shortcomings and omissions, even if they are small. Concerning these matters it is written, “Love covers a multitude of sins.” And the psalmist writes, “A broken spirit is a sacrifice to God, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” And it is for this same reason that the Lord did not despise the two small coins from the poor widow but accepted them with joy.
