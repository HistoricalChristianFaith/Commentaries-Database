Nor is it merely a straightforward fact that it was the twelfth month of the year, which is called Adar, that was set aside by lot for the murder of Israel; it signifies rather that the grace of Christ, which has been entrusted to the faithful in the fullness of time, is going to experience a harsh persecution in this world in the last days, carried out upon the faithful. This is what the teacher of the nations is also writing about when he says to Timothy: “And let it be known that in the last days we will face dangerous times; and men will be lovers of themselves, greedy, arrogant, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, wicked, emotionless, implacable, slanderers, unrestrained, harsh, without kindness, treacherous, reckless, bombastic, loving their pleasures more than they do God; and though they will have the appearance of righteousness, they will deny its power.” Hence the Lord also says in the Gospel: “This evangel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will arrive” (Matthew 24). And a bit after that: “Then there will be great tribulation, of a sort there has not been since the beginning of the world till now; but it will not happen unless those days have been cut short” (ibid.).
