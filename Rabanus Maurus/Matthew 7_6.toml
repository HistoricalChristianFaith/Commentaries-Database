Or; The dogs are returned to their vomit; the swine not yet returned, but wallowing in the mire of vices. "Give not therefore that which is holy to the dogs,‚Äù for that baptism and the other sacraments are not to be given but to the m that have the faith. In like manner the mysteries of the truth, that is, the pearls, are not to be given but to such as desire the truth and live with human reason. If then you cast them to the swine, that is, to such as are grovelling in impurity of life, they do not understand their preciousness, but value them like to other worldly fables, and tread them under foot with their carnal life.
