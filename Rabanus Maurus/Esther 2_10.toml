That is, the Church of the nations, which was instructed in the precepts of the sacred teachers, does not want to betray the place of her country and people because now that she has been cleansed through baptism of all the pollution born of sin and the filth of idolatry, she can no longer endure in any form the shame of her original impiety. Moreover, the Lord is also commanding her through his prophet, when he says: “Listen daughter, and see, and lend your ear, and forget your people and your father’s home, because the king has desired your beauty, because he is the Lord your God” (Psalms 45).
