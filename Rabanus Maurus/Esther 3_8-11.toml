So Haman promised ten thousand talents of silver to the king, and asked for the death of the Jews; and so too the Jewish people, who were dedicated to the fleshly observance of the rites of the Law in the belief that they were pleasing God in this way, planned the death of the true witnesses to Christ who were performing their spiritual service to God in accordance with the teachings of the Gospels. And just as Haman, when he sent his letters, took care to enforce them with the king’s seal because this would make it easier for him to carry out his wishes, the faithlessness of the Jews wrongly exploited—as evidence for their heresy—the books of divine law in which the seal of the supreme king is impressed, that is, the grace of the Holy Spirit is made manifest. This they did in their effort to denounce the conversion of the nations to a fellowship of faith, and to condemn the Gospel of Christ as something contrary to God’s precepts.
