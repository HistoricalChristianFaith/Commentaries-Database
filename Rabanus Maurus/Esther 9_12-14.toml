This contention of Queen Esther, in which she fights to have her enemies aggressively attacked and wiped out, expresses the zeal and ingenuity of the true queen, that is, of the holy Church which harasses her enemies without respite and struggles to scatter them completely and subject them to itself. It is in her voice that the Psalmist speaks: “I will harass my enemies, and I will encompass them, and I will not turn away until they are ruined; I will afflict them, and they cannot stand” (Psalms 18). In Shushan she killed first five hundred men, then three hundred, since she shows that not only those who refuse to repent their sins, but also those who fail to adorn their faith in the holy Trinity with good works, are worthy of perpetual death. So it happens that just as the Jews killed, in the course of two days, seventy-five thousand of their enemies, so too the faithful strive and attempt to truly defeat and scatter, in the light of the two Testaments, all those enemies who—because they are devoted to the five senses of the body, and experience the Law of God in the flesh—refuse to know it in spirit, complete and perfected by spiritual dogma through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit. And yet no one wants to touch any of their property, because the chosen believers would never consent to sully themselves with the wickedness of the damned; rather, they make themselves in every way foreign to and separate from the false dogmas, and the evil deeds, of such people.
