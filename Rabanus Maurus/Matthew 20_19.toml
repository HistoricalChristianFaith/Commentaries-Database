For Judas delivered the Lord to the Jesus, and they delivered Him to the Gentiles, that is to Pilate, and the Roman power. To this end the Lord refused to be prosperous in this world, but rather chose to suffer affliction, that Hemight show us, who have yielded to delights, through how great bitterness we must needs return; whence it follows, “To mock, and to scourge, and to crucify.”
