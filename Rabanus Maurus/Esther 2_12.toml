Now, why is it that the girls who were to be brought into the king’s bedchamber were prepared for twelve months with oil and scent, i.e. for six months they were anointed with oil of myrrh (which is known to have a pleasant odor) and for another six they used various pigments and scents? It must be that all the souls who are invited to receive the gift of holy baptism and to enter the bed of the true Groom, i.e. Christ the king, are thoroughly imbued by oil of myrrh—i.e. by the light of faith and the salve of love—with the scents of the virtues, so that they will deserve to be worthy of his company. For what are the holy preachers doing when they instruct their catechumens in the truth of the faith, if not teaching them to adorn that faith with good works so that with fasting, prayer and charity, and with other works of virtue, they may quickly wash away the original filth of the old man and clothe themselves in the elegance of the new one. We read, after all, in the Acts of the Apostles that the centurion Cornelius had first pleased God with prayer and charity, and then when Peter arrived he received the purification of baptism and the sanctification of the Holy Spirit.
