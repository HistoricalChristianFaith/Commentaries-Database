But Jericho, which is interpreted ‘the moon,’ denotes the infirmity of ourchangefulness.The two blind men we may call Judah and Israel, who before the coming of Christ were blind, not seeing the true word which was in the Law and the Prophets, yet sitting by the wayside of the Lawand the Prophets, and understanding Him only as after the flesh, they cried to Him who was made of the seed of David according to the flesh.
But recognizing the rumour of Christ, they desired to be made partakers of Him. Many spake against them; first the Jews, as we read in the Acts; then the Gentiles harassed them by persecution; but yet they might not deprive those who were preordained to life of salvation.
