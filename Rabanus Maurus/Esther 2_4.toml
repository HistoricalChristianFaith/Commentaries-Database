After Judea had been expelled from the royal marriage, different peoples and different individuals from each nation from different parts of the world were led to the royal congregation by the holy preachers who were ministers of the evangelical word. They were given into the custody of Hegai, whose name is interpreted as “celebration” or “solemnity.” He was the superintendent of the royal women. In other words, they were given to the care of the pastors and leaders of the church to whom the custody of the souls of the faithful was entrusted. - "Explanation on the Book of Esther 3"
