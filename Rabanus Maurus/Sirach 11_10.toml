Divine wisdom teaches its children not to overly struggle to obtain earthly profits, for otherwise you will not avoid such adversity as greed, envy and similar pains. Therefore it is written in the book of Proverbs, “The one with a covetous eye is impatient to enrich himself and does not consider that misery will fall on him.” And again, “He who is greedy of dishonest gain troubles his own house,” and, “Better is little with the fear of the Lord than a great treasure with trouble,” and, in Qoheleth, “He who loves silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loves abundance with profit.”
