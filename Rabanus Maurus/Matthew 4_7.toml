Jerusalem was called the Holy City, for in it was the Temple of God, the Holy of holies, and the worship of the one God according to the law of Moses.
It should be noted, that though our Saviour suffered Himself to be placed bythe Devil on a pinnacle of the temple, yet refused to come down also at his command, giving us an example, that whosoever bids us ascend the strait way of truth we should obey. But if he would again cast us down from the height of truth and virtue to the depth of error we should not hearken to him.
Otherwise, it was a suggestion to Him, as man, that He should seek by requiring some miracle to know the greatness of Godâ€™s power.
