The apostle Peter recommends, “In your hearts reverence Christ as Lord. Always be prepared to make a defense to anyone who calls you to account for the hope that is in you.” It is good for a servant of God to learn from his masters with diligence and commitment what afterwards he must teach to others with prudence and for their benefit. Because if he does not and instead is lazy and indolent in applying himself, he will turn out to be useless in teaching others later.
