Let us not allow what is according to the flesh to persecute what is according to the spirit; neither let us, using the body as a pretext, quench the lamp that has been lit in us. We must therefore not contradict to the point of thinking or of speaking contrary to the faith in the holy Scriptures. But “those whom he loves, God chastises”; he afflicts and puts them to the test in everything to see “whether they will keep his commandments or not.” Yet, what God is looking for in us are “the fruits of the Holy Spirit”; we must not be negligent concerning them, for it is about them that we shall be questioned.
