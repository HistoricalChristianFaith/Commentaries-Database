“Theodore to the beloved brothers in Mount Nitria: priests, deacons and monks, greetings in the Lord. I want you to know that “the pride of” the Arians “has gone up” to God and that “God has visited his people and seeing the afflictions” that they endure he has had mercy on them. He has promised to have mercy on his church and to deliver it from these afflictions. The time has come, therefore, when the church will be delivered from these persecutions. Indeed, God said of the Arians, “I will punish Babylon and will take from its mouth what its has swallowed.” And of the church, “Who is there among you that saw this house in its former glory?” “For the last glory of this house is going to surpass the first.” Therefore, brothers, “since we have these promises,” comfort those who are suffering from the Arians in those parts, that no one’s faith may be turned aside, for “the sins of the” Arians “have not yet ended.”
