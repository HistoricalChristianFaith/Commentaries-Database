“Each one looking not to his own interests but to those of others,” “that one may not glory in his prudence,” for the virtue of the humble is not to boast of their knowledge, since it is common to all. In repressing the mind’s audacity, it is helpful not to despise others or to assume a special knowledge or holiness ourselves.
