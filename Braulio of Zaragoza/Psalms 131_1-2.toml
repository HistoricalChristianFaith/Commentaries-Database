Nor can I think otherwise against the authority of so great a man, but I can only follow his steps and, in Christian humility, not deviate from the paths of our ancestors; as David says, “Neither have I walked with great things or with things too sublime for me.” He is raised up above himself who departs from the traces of his elders and tries to have vision in things that are beyond his powers. Hence, it follows, “If I was not humbly minded, but exalted my soul: as a child that is weaned is towards his mother, so will you reward my soul.” And so it is useful for us to think humble thoughts, in the words of the apostle: “Not setting your mind on high things but condescending to the lowly”;23 and to receive weaning with Isaac, that we may share stronger food rather than with Ishmael, son of the slave girl, to carry a bottle with water instead of wine and to be driven from the eternal inheritance.
