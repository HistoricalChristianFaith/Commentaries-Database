Oh, rich glory of the apostlesâ€™ speech, never to permit people to feel a famine of virtues! A distributed sum of money desires increase. The coin of language entrusted [to them] was displeasing when it remained alone. That passage shows that food for the mind is better for an uncultivated people than victuals spread through their limbs and that the richness of the heavenly word nourishes a broadly skilled mind. For of what advantage are the foods of bodily nourishment when the soul is hungry?
