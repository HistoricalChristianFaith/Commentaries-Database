Let us examine by what formula the memorable mysteries of the godly figure have significance: the multitude was ordered to be fed from the flesh of a lamb at that time when the lights of the first month shone forth, on the day proceeding from this number [fourteen]; when the protection of this [flesh] had been tasted, the free [multitude] deserved to avoid the darkness of the Nile. Paul at a similar interval persuades those whom he wishes to take out of the sea of the world to feast with him and to taste sacred food. He is following the esteemed footsteps of Moses. The actions of Moses and Paul, if looked at intently, are different in their locations but alike in their causes, and the repeated deliverance is raised out of one font: in it Christ is the Lamb, [and] Christ too is considered the Bread from heaven, which he himself also teaches. One who will have consumed Jesus in his body is free from the Enemy, nor do Pharaoh and Egypt now keep their powers. Immediately all the weapons of the demon are sunk in these waters, from which he who had been a captive is reborn as a child. The surge of the salty depths is also left behind, and the marshes of the foul serpent are overcome. Christ lavishes pastures upon his rescued flock, in their own names, as true Shepherd to one who now eats.
