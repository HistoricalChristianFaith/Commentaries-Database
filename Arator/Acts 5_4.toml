But inasmuch as a changed intention bears the crime of deceit, and when there is, moreover, confirmation of a promise, it is proper to stand firm and not wish to violate what was first [promised] by what follows; it is more just to preserve a permanent right than to withdraw it. The punishment of the two established a warning for all, lest anyone should call [back] gifts which a solemn promise requires him to owe. Reflect, you of true faith, and consider the words of Peter, which are bright with blessed teaching, “Whoever persuaded you to be deceitful?” And he concluded by judging, “You do not deceive people by saying such things; you lie to God.” The teaching that condemns the wicked strengthens the holy.
