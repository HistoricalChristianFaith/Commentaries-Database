[Peter] does not permit [Cornelius] to throw himself at his feet with bent knee; accustomed to giving gifts freely, he prevents a gesture of respect. Hence you, a new world, raise your head, you who had been struck down by the tooth of your ancient parent, and the font gives back a birthday to you; born again, do not press down your necks with your own sins, now that they are free from another’s.
