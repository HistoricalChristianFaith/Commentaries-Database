Enjoying his office, the celestial keeper of the keys sees heaven opened. From there an image of a vessel is let down, so that there might be a vision on earth that all things can be taken by the body of Peter, who makes into food for the church whatever he takes to be eaten. The vision is brought before him, let down by its four sides: it is one image of the church, which rises from the four parts of the world and spreads the eloquence of the same number of heralds [evangelists], keeping together every kind of bird and domestic beast, of wild animal and reptile: these [animals] are connected to humans on account of their merits and vices. It is therefore clear that the Creator bids the Gentiles to be poured into the bowels of the church, as he instructs [Peter], “Kill and eat, take away what they are and make them like yourself.” He who is turned about is considered changed. Saul perished at length because Paul began to live.
