Cornelius, born of Gentile stock, was highly respected in the city of Caesarea; his life, given over to godly works, sanctified him for the waters, and he, who did whatever faith was inclined to perform in those washed by baptism, … began to believe through his actions. For an angel, sent from the stars, drawing near to [Cornelius] said, “The wealth that you distribute, the words that you pray, stand [pleasing] in the sight of the highest Lord. Rewards for your virtue will not be lacking. Accept the certain Way when Peter comes here.” Thus the glistening messenger implanted with his word the commands for eternal washings.
