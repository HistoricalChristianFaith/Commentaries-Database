The power of the apostles’ words, which made those created from earth have faith, altered and set in motion the ground; but as to the fact that the one place leaped and was shaken more [than others], Scripture announced that beautiful [are the] feet that bring peace; therefore the joyful earth was moved under the tread of them [the apostles] to whom peace was given by the word of the holy Master. Transported through them, it has gone out into all lands with its swift favor.
