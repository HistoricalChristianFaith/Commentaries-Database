But because [Paul] said, “Night and day for three years I gave these teachings for your salvation,” an allegory is revealed by this reckoning [of his]: he who utters three doctrines of the church rather often brings forth the historical and allegorical Book, proclaiming [also] a moral [sense]. For thus the six pots reddened with the new liquid out of the old law took three measures apiece. The ancient form of the perfect sacrifice commanded that one offer three loaves from the basket;24 to these [mysteries] is added what Christ said to his disciples, that three loaves ought to be given to one asking when it was already night; that night surely is the world, so that, if anyone here desires the food of the word, you should produce a banquet, you who are asked, and teach the willing one that the Father and the Son [and] the Holy Spirit are one God and that a single Substance trebles the number.
