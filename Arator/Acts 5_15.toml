We dwell in the church on earth, which, no one may doubt, signifies a heavenly [church]; but that is more truly [the church] which, at rest above the stars, is called celestial and high. This [earthly church], which is seen in the brief career of an uncertain world, is appointed as the way of life and in this [present] time directs to the eternal [church] those whom it gathers, and to those found acceptable it is the road for going from here to heavenly things. Peter rules both armies, and for their lot he gives the stars to those squadrons led from here, as has been revealed by the words of God, “What you have loosed,” he said, “and what you bind on earth thus remain bound or loosed in heaven.” This [church] that we see cultivated on soil, therefore, will be a type; what the clouds carry is firm. Peter, ruling both, designs there the body and here the shadow, in order that those sick people whom he freed from vices and offenses might be led unharmed to it [the church above], which endures in heaven [and] will receive the holy throngs cleansed by this [earthly church].
