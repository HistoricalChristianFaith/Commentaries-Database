If we are rightly inspired, the renewed day of her soul is clearly suitable for allegory, [a soul,] turned back to the voice of Peter, which the darkness of exceedingly ancient peril had pressed down: the life burdened previously in the bosom of the dark law, rising just like a second [soul], stands up in the churchâ€™s presence, and the light of works, the companion of faith, drives away the shadows, a salvation that had not been promised by the voice of the law, because grace undertakes to give gifts of eternal life to those reborn in the font.
