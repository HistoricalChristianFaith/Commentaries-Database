No trifling occasion of hidden allegory shines in the image of [the eunuch’s] country: the Almighty gave full approval for Moses to unite the Ethiopian woman to himself in the bond of marriage; Scriptures reveal that he later spoke with the Lord face to face. What is there astonishing if love for the law began to grow at that time when [the law] had been joined [in marriage] to the church? Rather, the Song of Songs does not conceal the fact that the everlasting bride comes from that region: it calls her black and beautiful. She comes from the south, which burns the Ethiopian soil, to praise her Peacemaker in the mouth of Solomon, by which name [Pacificus] what Christ possesses has long been signified. She sends [the eunuch] ahead as guardian of [the church’s] riches, by whose protection she might begin to bring forth her wealth. What better treasure is in her than the glory of the font? What richer gold than a wealthy faith in the heart? Finally, how rightly is her herald a eunuch! As [faith] proceeds, lust is driven off, and the chaste capture the heavenly kingdoms.
