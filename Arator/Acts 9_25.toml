Since he had risen above the wicked, he deserves to escape their ambush while the gates are closed. A basket, which is customarily woven with bulrushes and palms in turn, gives covering to Saul, in glory retaining an allegory of the church, for there is always contained in it the bulrush, by the waters [of baptism], and the palm, by the crowns [of martyrdom]. The wave of baptism and the blood of martyrdom promote the church. Not long since, the food produced beneath the tooth began to swell the insides of seven baskets while the multitude was feeding; Scripture truly proclaims that number of churches in the world, inasmuch as the Spirit is the working force thus present in them and virtue marks their names, although we, however, sing the praises of one church in them all. Therefore the visible form [the basket] protects the man; he himself serves it as a soldier [and] as a vessel [of election] remaining in the Vessel [Christ], and with him as General he escapes safely from the enemy, a commander who conquers for him in all battles.
