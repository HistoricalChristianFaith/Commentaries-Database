The law was given not for one, but for all. So, too, Christ came not for one or to one but to all and for all. He desired to bring all things together into a unity that alone is good and pleasant. The prophet, aware of the future, assures us, “Behold, how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity.” For not singularity but unity is acceptable to God. The Holy Spirit descended on the apostles with all his welling fountain when they were assembled together. This occurred after the apostles had been instructed by the Lord’s own commandment to wait in a group for the Spirit’s coming.
