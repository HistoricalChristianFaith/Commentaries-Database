Hence it is that through the influence of these three things Moses is made a god: for the sake of his military triumphs he brings all the elements under his control. He bids the sea to withdraw, its waves to solidify, its bottom to become dry and the sky to drop its rain. He supplies food, compels the winds to scatter meats, illumines the night with the splendor of the sun, tempers the sun by the veil of the cloud. He strikes the rock to make it yield from its fresh wound cool streams of water for those who thirst. He first gives to the earth heavenâ€™s law, writes down the norms of living, sets the terms of disciplinary control.
