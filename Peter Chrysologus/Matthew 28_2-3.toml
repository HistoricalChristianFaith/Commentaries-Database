“His appearance,” says the Evangelist, “was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.” The brightness of his countenance is distinguished from the brilliance of his clothing. His face is compared with lightning from heaven and his garment to snow falling upon the earth. Listen to the prophet as he says, “Praise the Lord from the earth, you fire, hail and snow!” In the angel’s face, then, heaven’s brilliance adapts to nature. His clothing symbolizes the grace of human fellowship, and the appearance of this angel as he speaks is so tempered that physical eyes can withstand the peaceful brilliance of his raiment. As they look upon the lightning of his appearance, they tremble and revere the messenger of their Maker.
