“And he summoned the twelve,” the text says. After the long centuries of dreadful night, the eternal day, our Christ, shone forth. The world had long awaited the splendor of his dawning. In the case of his twelve apostles he desired to signify the twelve hours of this day. The blessed psalmist saw this day in spirit when he sang, “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us be glad and rejoice in it.” Consequently, the apostle, too, calls the believers children of light and of faith: “You are children of the light and children of the day.”
