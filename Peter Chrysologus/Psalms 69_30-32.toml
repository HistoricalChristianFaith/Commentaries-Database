“And he killed for him the fattened calf.” About that David sang, “And it shall please God better than a young calf that has horns and hoofs.” The calf was slain at this command of the Father, because the Christ, God as the Son of God, could not be slain without the command of his Father. Listen to the apostle: “He who has not spared even his own son but has delivered him for us all.” He is the calf who is daily and continually immolated for our food.
