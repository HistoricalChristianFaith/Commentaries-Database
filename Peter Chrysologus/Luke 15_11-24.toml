“He had two sons,” that is, two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles. Prudent knowledge of the law made the Jewish people his older son, and the folly of paganism made the Gentile world his younger son. Just as surely as wisdom brings distinguished gray hairs, so does foolishness take away the traits of an adult. Morals and not age made the Gentiles the younger son. Not years but understanding of the law made the Jews the older son.

“He divided his means between them.” The son is as impatient as the father was kind. He is weary of his father’s own life. Since he cannot shorten his father’s life, he works to get possession of his property. He was not content to possess his father’s wealth in company with his father, and he deserved to lose the privileges of a son.Let us make some inquiries. What reason brought the son to such actions? What bold prospect raised his spirits to make so startling a request? What reason did he have? Clearly the Father in heaven cannot be bounded by any limit, or shut in by any time, or destroyed by any power of death. The son could not await his father’s death to get his wealth, so he conceived the desire to get his pleasure from the generosity of his father while he was still alive. The father’s bounty proved that the insult lay in his request.

“He went and joined one of the citizens of that country, who sent him to his farm to feed swine.” This is the experience that comes to one who refuses to trust himself to his father but delivers himself to a stranger. He flees from a most generous provider and endures a severe judge. A deserter from affection, a refugee from fatherly love, he is assigned to the swine, sentenced to them, and given over to their service. He wallows in their muddy fodder. The rush of the restless herd bruises and soils him so he perceives how wretched and bitter it is to have lost the happiness of peaceful life in his father’s house.

He now comes back to his Father and cries, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.” Every day in its prayer, the church testifies that the younger son has returned to his Father’s house and is calling God his Father. [The church] prays, “Our Father, who art in heaven,” “I have sinned against heaven and before you.”

“He fell on his neck and kissed him.” This is how the father judges and corrects his wayward son and gives him not beatings but kisses. The power of love overlooked the transgressions. The father redeemed the sins of his son by his kiss, and covered them by his embrace, in order not to expose the crimes or humiliate the son. The father so healed the son’s wounds as not to leave a scar or blemish upon him. “Blessed are they,” says Scripture “whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.”

The father runs out from far away. “When we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” The Father runs out. He runs out in his Son, when through him he descends from heaven and comes down on earth. “With me,” the Son says, “is he who sent me, the Father.”37He “fell upon his neck.” He fell, when through Christ the whole divinity came down as ours and rested in human nature. When did he kiss him? When “mercy and truth have met each other, justice and peace have kissed.” “He gave the best robe,” that which Adam lost, the everlasting glory of immortality. “He put a ring upon his finger.” That is the ring of honor, the title of liberty, the outstanding pledge of the spirit, the seal of the faith, and the dowry of the heavenly marriage. Hear the apostle: “I engaged you to one spouse, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.” “And sandals on his feet, etc.” This is so that his feet might be in shoes when he preached the gospel, for “how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace.”

“Give him a ring for his finger.” The father’s devotion is not content to restore only his innocence. It also brings back his former honor. “And give him sandals for his feet.” He was rich when he departed, but how poor he has returned! Of all his substance, he does not even bring back shoes on his feet! “Give him sandals for his feet” that nakedness may not disgrace even a foot and that he may have shoes when he returns to his former course of life.

“And he killed for him the fattened calf.” About that David sang: “And it shall please God better than a young calf, that brings forth horns and hoofs.” The calf was slain at this command of the Father, because the Christ, God as the Son of God, could not be slain without the command of his Father. Listen to the apostle: “He who has not spared even his own son but has delivered him for us all.” He is the calf who is daily and continually immolated for our food.
