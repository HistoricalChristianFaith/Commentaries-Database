“Send Lazarus.” As I see the matter, the rich man’s actions spring not from new pain but from ancient envy. This hell does not kindle his jealousy as much as Lazarus’s possession of heaven. People find it a serious evil and unbearable fire to see in happiness those whom they once held in contempt. The rich man’s ill will does not leave him, although he already endures its punishment. He does not ask to be led to Lazarus but wants Lazarus to be led to him. O rich man, loving Abraham cannot send to the bed of your tortures Lazarus whom you did not condescend to admit to your table. Your respective fortunes have now been reversed. You look at the glory of him whose misery you once spurned. He who wondered at you in your glory sees your tortures.
