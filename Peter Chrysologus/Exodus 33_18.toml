This is why love which longs to see God, even if it lacks judgment, does have the spirit of devotion. This is why Moses dares to say, “If I have found favor in your sight, show me your face.” This is why another man says, “Show us your face.” Finally, this is why the Gentiles fashioned idols. In their errors they wanted to see with their eyes what they were worshiping.
