(ubi sup.) Not content to have put the Master to death, they plot how they may destroy the disciples, and make the Master's power matter of charge against His disciples. The soldiers indeed lost Him, the Jews missed Him, but the disciples crimed Him away, not by theft, but by faith; by virtue, and not by fraud; by holiness, and not by wickedness; alive, and not dead.

(ubi sup.) Among the Jews, not among the Christians; what in Jud√¶a the Jew concealed by his gold, is by faith blazed abroad throughout the world.
