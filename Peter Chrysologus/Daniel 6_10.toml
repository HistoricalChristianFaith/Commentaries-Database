The psalmist instructs us to allot three periods a day to God when he says, “At evening, at morning and at midday I shall speak what I have to say, and you will hearken to my voice.” For those three periods while Daniel diligently beseeched God, not only did they obtain foreknowledge of the future, but he also merited the freedom of his people held captive for so long.
