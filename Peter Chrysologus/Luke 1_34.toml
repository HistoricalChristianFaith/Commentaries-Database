“Who was born from the Holy Spirit.” Precisely thus is Christ born for you, in such a way that he may change your own manner of birth…. Formerly, death awaited you as the setting sun of your life; he wants you to have a new birth of life. “Who was born from the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary.” Where the Spirit is begetting, and a virgin giving birth, everything carried on is divine; nothing of it is merely human.
