“Who was born from the Holy Spirit.” Precisely thus is Christ born for you, in such a way that he may change your own manner of birth as a man. Formerly, death awaited you as the setting sun of your life; he wants you to have a new birth of life. 

“Who was born from the Holy Spirit of the Virgin Mary.” Where the Spirit is begetting, and a virgin giving birth, everything carried on is divine; nothing of it is merely human. Neither is there any place for weakness where power is united to power. Adam was put into a deep sleep that a virgin might be taken from the virile half of the race; now, the Virgin was amazed that mankind was to be renewed from a virgin. What will nature be able to claim as her own from such a great birth in which, while she sees her order being renewed and all ehr rights being changed, she perceives with wonder that her Creator has come into His own offspring?
