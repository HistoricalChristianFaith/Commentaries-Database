This woman does not believe, but she is trying to believe, while her unbelief is disturbing her belief. “Whatever you ask of God.…” God gives of his own accord; he does not ask of himself. Why, woman, do you delay in making your request when the one to grant it stands before you? Woman, he is the Judge himself whom you desire merely as an advocate. In him there is the power to give, not the need to make any request. “I know,” she says, “that whatever you ask of God, he will give you.” Woman, to believe this means that you do not believe. To know this means that you do not know. The apostle has indicated this, that the moment when a person thinks that he knows something, he does not know it.
