The older brother, the older son coming from the field, the people of the law, hears the music and dancing in the Father’s house, yet he does not want to enter. “The harvest indeed is abundant, but the laborers are few.” Every day we see this same thing happen with our own eyes. The Jewish people comes to its Father’s house, the church. It stands outside because of its jealousy. It hears the harp of David echoing, and the music from the singing of the psalms, and the dancing carried on by so many assembled races. It does not wish to enter. Through jealousy, it remains outside. In horror, it judges its Gentile brother by its own ancient customs, and meanwhile, it is depriving itself of its Father’s goods and excluding itself from his joys.

The Father steps outside and says to his son, “Son, you are always with me.” How is he with his son? In the person of Abel, Enoch, Shem, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, and all the holy men from which stems Christ’s Jewish lineage read in the Gospel when it says, “Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob,” and so on.

“All that is mine is yours.” How is this? The law, prophecy, temple, priesthood, sacrifices, kingdom, and the gifts are for you. This is the greatest gift of all: Christ was born. Since you through your jealousy wish to destroy your brother, you are no longer worthy to possess your Father’s banquets and joys.
