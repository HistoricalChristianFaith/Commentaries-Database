Futile is the act of the father and mother, unless the Creator’s work and will also touch the offspring. “Your hands have made me and formed me.” And elsewhere it is written, “You have formed me and have laid your hand on me.” Therefore, we do not owe our birth and life to ourselves, but we owe them entirely to our Creator.
