Slaves ask for suitable indignities: “Send us into the swine.” Foulness begs to be sent from the tombs into the swine, so that it does not think of getting rid of its bad odors but of changing odors. “Send us into the swine.” Plunging from the sky, they seek filth. After living in the upper world, they look for the sloughs of pigs. “Send us into the herd.” A herd is sent into the herd, so that a gang of demons is brought forth, and it seems that two men have caused what a great number of pigs could not endure.
