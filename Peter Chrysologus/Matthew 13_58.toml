Christ indeed came to his own country, because it was written, “He came among his own, and his own did not receive him.” In plain fact, when he says, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country,” he is teaching that it is a painful situation to have influence among his own. To stand out among the local denizens is similar to an inflammation. A near relation’s glory burns the near relations. If neighbors have to pay homage to a neighbor, they consider it servitude. “And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief.” Power has no effect where unbelief does not deserve it. And while Christ does not demand a reward when he heals, he becomes indignant when injustice is shown to him instead of honor.
