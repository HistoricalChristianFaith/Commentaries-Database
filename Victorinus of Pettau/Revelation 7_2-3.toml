“I [saw] an angel descending from the rising of the sun.” He is speaking of Elijah the prophet, who was to come before the time of antichrist to restore and to strengthen the churches from the intolerable persecution. We read of these things in the opening of the book both of the Old Testament and of the new preaching. For through Malachi the Lord said, “Behold, I send to you Elijah, the Thesbite, to turn the hearts of the fathers to their children and the heart of man to his neighbor,” that is, to Christ through penitence. “To turn the hearts of the fathers to their children,“that is, at the time of the calling to recall the Jews to the faith of that people which follows them. And therefore he shows the number of those from the Jews who will believe and the great multitude of those from the Gentiles.
