Significantly, there was a “throne set” [in heaven], which is the seat of judgment and of the king, and over this throne he says that he saw something similar to jasper and carnelian. Since jasper has the color of water and carnelian that of fire, it was manifested that these two Testaments have been placed over the tribunal of God until the consummation of the world. And of these judgments one has already been accomplished through water, while the other will be accomplished through fire.
