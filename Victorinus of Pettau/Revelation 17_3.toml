But to sit upon the scarlet beast, the author of murders, is the image of the devil. Where also is treated of his captivity, concerning which we have fully considered. I remember, indeed, that this is called Babylon also in the Apocalypse, on account of confusion; and in Isaiah also; and Ezekiel called it Sodom. In fine, if you compare what is said against Sodom, and what Isaiah says against Babylon, and what the Apocalypse says, you will find that they are all one.

[The woman is] she who is responsible for murders, and she has the image of the devil.… Because of the dispersion of the peoples, in the Apocalypse she is called “Babylon,” as does Isaiah. However, Ezekiel calls her “Sor.” And if one would compare what is said of Sor and what the Apocalypse and Isaiah say about Babylon, one would discover that they are the same.
