“The seven thunders uttered their voices.” The Spirit of sevenfold power announced through the prophets all things that were to come and by his voice has given witness in the world. But since he said that he was going to write whatsoever the thunders had said, that is, whatever had been obscurely foretold in the Old Testament, he was forbidden to write but told to keep it [sealed]. For he was an apostle, and it was not good that the grace of the second rank should be given to the person in the first rank, “for the time is already near.” For the apostles overcame unbelief by powers and signs and wonders and mighty deeds. And after them the comfort of having the prophetic Scriptures interpreted was given to the churches which were confirmed in the faith. These interpreters [the apostle] calls prophets, for he says, “He has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers” and following. In another place he says, “Let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said.” And he says, “Any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head.” When he said, “Let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said,” he is not speaking of some unheard of and unknown orthodox prophecy but of that prophecy which is already spoken. They weigh what is said to ensure that the interpretation conforms with the witness of the sayings of the prophets. It is clear that John, armed with a superior power, had no need of this, while the church, which is the body of Christ, is adorned by her own members and ought to respond from her own rank.
