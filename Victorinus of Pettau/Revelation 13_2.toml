And his mouth as the mouth of a lion. That is, his mouth armed for blood is his bidding, and a tongue which will proceed to nothing else than to the shedding of blood.

A strong and most unclean beast, the feet are to be understood as his leaders.

“And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, like a leopard.” This passage indicates that the kingdom of that time, the kingdom of the antichrist, will be commingled with a variety of nations and peoples. “Its feet were like the feet of a bear,” that is, they were of a strong and utterly filthy beast. He speaks of the leaders [of this kingdom] as his “feet.” And “its mouth was like the mouths of lions.” This means that the beast is armed by teeth intended for blood. For the “mouth” is his command and his tongue which proceed only for the purpose of the shedding of blood.
