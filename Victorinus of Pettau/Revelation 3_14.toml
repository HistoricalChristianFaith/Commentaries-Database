Moreover, the seventh association of the Church declares that they are rich men placed in positions of dignity, but believing that they are rich, among whom indeed the Scriptures are discussed in their bedchamber, while the faithful are outside; and they are understood by none, although they boast themselves, and say that they know all things—endowed with the confidence of learning, but ceasing from its labour.

This group, the seventh class, speaks of those wealthy persons who are believers placed in positions of dignity and who believe in the manner of wealthy men. Among them the Scriptures are interpreted in their bedchamber, while the faithful are outside and no one understands [the Scriptures]. That is, they boast and say that they know all things and they possess a confidence in the learning of letters, yet they are empty when it comes to works. And so, the Lord says to them that they are neither cold nor hot, that is, that they are neither unbelieving nor believing, for they are all things to all men. And since he who is neither cold nor hot must of necessity be lukewarm, he produces nausea. And the Lord says, “I will vomit him from my mouth.” For nausea is hateful and is hidden to no one, and it is the same way with such persons when they are thrown out. But because there is time for repentance, he says, “I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire.” That is, if in some way you should be able to suffer something for the name of the Lord. And the Lord says, “Anoint your eyes with eye salve.” That is, what you freely know through the Scriptures, it is necessary that you desire to do this. And since such persons would be of great benefit not only to themselves but also to many were they in some way to return away from great destruction to a great repentance, he promises to them no small reward, namely, to sit upon the throne of judgment.
