And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He is speaking of the great and false prophet who is to do signs, and portents, and falsehoods before him in the presence of men.

And he had two horns like a lamb— that is, the appearance within of a man— and he spoke like a dragon. But the devil speaks full of malice; for he shall do these things in the presence of men, so that even the dead appear to rise again.

“Another great beast rose out of the earth.” This is the false prophet who will do signs and portents and false prodigies before him in the presence of people. It says that he has “horns like a lamb” because he has the form of a righteous man and that he “speaks like a dragon” because he is full of the malice of the devil.
