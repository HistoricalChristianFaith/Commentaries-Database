His feet, as we have said above, are the apostles. For that both things in sea and land are trodden under foot by Him, signifies that all things are placed under His feet. Moreover, he calls Him an angel, that is, a messenger, to wit, of the Father; for He is called the Messenger of great counsel. He says also that He cried with a loud voice. The great voice is to tell the words of the Omnipotent God of heaven to men, and to bear witness that after penitence is closed there will be no hope subsequently.

Upon his head was a rainbow. He points to the judgment which is executed by Him, or shall be.

An open book. A revelation of works in the future judgment, or the Apocalypse which John received.

His face was as it were the sun. That is, with respect to the resurrection.

The “open book” is the Revelation that John received. As we explained earlier, “his feet” are the inspired apostles. That he stands upon both the sea and the land signifies that all things have been placed under his feet. He speaks of him here as an “angel,” for he is the messenger of the almighty Father and is called the “messenger of great counsel.”
