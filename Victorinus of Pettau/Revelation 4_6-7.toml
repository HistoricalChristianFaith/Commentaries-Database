The four animals are the four Gospels. “The first,” he says, “was similar to a lion, the second similar to a calf, the third similar to a man and the fourth similar to an eagle in flight. And they had six wings all around and eyes within and without, and they did not cease to say, ‘Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty.’ ” … And that these animals were different in appearance has this explanation. The animal similar to the lion is the Gospel according to John. For while all the Evangelists proclaim that Christ was made man, he proclaims that he was God before he came down and assumed the flesh, saying, “The Word was God,” and since he cried out, roaring like a lion, his preaching took on the appearance of a lion. The likeness of a man refers to Matthew, who strives to tell us the genealogy of Mary, from whom Christ took his flesh. And, therefore, since he numbers [the family of Mary] from Abraham to David and from David to Joseph, he speaks as though of a man, and for this reason his Gospel receives the image of a man. And Luke narrates the sacerdotal service of Zechariah, who offered a sacrifice for the people, and of the angel who appeared to him, and on account of the sacerdotal service and the sacrifice, this narrative bears the image of a calf. As the interpreter of Peter, Mark remembered what he had taught publicly and wrote, although not in order, and began with the word of prophecy proclaimed by Isaiah. And therefore, the Gospels begin in the following ways. John says, “In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God”—these are the face of a lion. Matthew says, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, son of David, son of Abraham”58—this is the face of a man. Luke says, “There was a priest by the name of Zechariah, of the order of Abia, and his wife was from the daughters of Aaron”—this is the image of the calf. Mark begins, “The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, as was written in Isaiah,” and so he begins with the Spirit in flight and so possesses the image of a flying eagle. However, it is not only the prophetic Spirit but also the very Word of God the Father Almighty, who is his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who bore the same images during the time of his coming to us. Indeed, he had been proclaimed as a lion and as a lion’s whelp. For the salvation of humankind he was made man for the defeat of death and for the liberation of all. Because he offered himself as a sacrifice to God the Father for us, he is called a calf. And because, when death was conquered, he ascended into the heavens and held out his wings to cover his people, he is called an eagle in flight. And although there are four Evangelists yet there is really but one proclamation, because it proceeds from one mouth, just as the river in paradise was from one source yet was separated into four streams.
