This is the beginning of the coming of the antichrist. However, beforehand Elijah must preach and there must be peaceful times. And when the three years and six months of the preaching of Elijah is ended, the [dragon] along with all the apostate angels is to be thrown out from heaven, where he had the power of ascent until that time. And that the antichrist is to be aroused from hell, also Paul the apostle says, “Unless the man of sin shall come first, the son of perdition, the adversary, who will exalt himself over everything which is called and is worshipped as God.”
