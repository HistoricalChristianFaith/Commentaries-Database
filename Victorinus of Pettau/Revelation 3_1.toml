The fifth class, company, or association of saints, sets forth men who are careless, and who are carrying on in the world other transactions than those which they ought— Christians only in name. And therefore He exhorts them that by any means they should be turned away from negligence, and be saved.

This fifth class, group or manner of saint refers to those persons who are negligent and behave in a manner other than what they ought in the world, who are vacuous in works and who are only Christian in name. And therefore he exhorts them so that in some way they might reverse themselves from this dangerous negligence and be saved. “Strengthen,” he says, “that which is in danger of death. I have not found your work perfect before my God.” For it is not sufficient that a tree live but yet not give fruit. Neither is it sufficient that one be called a Christian, confess himself to be a Christian, and yet not do the works of a Christian.
