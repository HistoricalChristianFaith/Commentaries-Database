Because he will use another name, he will undertake another life, so that they might welcome him as if he were Christ. For Daniel says that he will not acknowledge the desire of women—because he himself is most filthy—and he will not recognize the god of his fathers. That is, he will not be able to seduce the people to circumcision, unless he is an avenger of the law. At last he will force the saints to nothing other than accepting circumcision, if he will be able to seduce them.
