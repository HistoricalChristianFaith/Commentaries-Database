The following epistle unfolds the mode of life and habit of another order which follows. He proceeds to say:-

"I know thy tribulation and thy poverty, but thou art rich." For He knows that with such men there are riches hidden with Him, and that they deny the blasphemy of the Jews, who say that they are Jews and are not; but they are the synagogue of Satan, since they are gathered together by Antichrist; and to them He says:-

"Be thou faithful unto death." That they should continue to be faithful even unto death.

"He that shall overcome, shall not be hurt by the second death." That is, he shalt not be chastised in hell.
