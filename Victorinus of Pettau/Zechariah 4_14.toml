“These are the two candlesticks standing before the Lord of the earth.” These two candlesticks and two olive trees he has to this end spoken of, admonished you that if, when you have read of them elsewhere, you have not understood, you may understand here. For in Zechariah, one of the twelve prophets, it is thus written: “These are the two olive trees and two candlesticks which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth”; that is, they are in paradise. Also, in another sense, standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth, that is, in the presence of the antichrist. Therefore they must be slain by antichrist.
