Everyone should know that the “scarlet devil” and all of his rebellious angels are shut up in the Tartarus of Gehenna at the Lord’s coming, and that after one thousand years they are released because of the nations who will have served the antichrist so that they alone might perish and therefore have merited [such a punishment]. Thereupon the universal judgment will occur. Therefore it says, “The dead [who are written in the Book of Life] came to life, and they will reign with Christ a thousand years. This is the first resurrection. Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection. Over such the second death has no power.” Concerning this resurrection he says, “And I saw the Lamb standing and with him—that is, standing with him—144,000.” Namely, these are those from among the Jews who will come to believe at the end of time through the preaching of Elijah and who, the Spirit testifies, are chaste not only in body but also in tongue. And therefore, it is mentioned above that the twenty-four elders had said, “We give thanks to you, Lord God, that you have begun to reign, and the nations have become enraged.” At the time of this first resurrection will also be that future, beautiful city that this writing has described. Also Paul spoke in this manner to the church in Macedonia concerning this first resurrection: “For this we declare to you by the word of God, that at the trumpet of God the Lord himself will descend from heaven to arouse [the dead from sleep]. And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord.” We have heard that he speaks of a trumpet. We observe that in another place the apostle mentions another trumpet. He says to the Corinthians, “At the last trumpet the dead will rise”—they become immortal—“and we shall be changed.” He says that the dead will rise immortal in order to suffer their punishments; however, it is clear that we will be changed and clothed in glory. When, therefore, we hear that there is a “last trumpet,” we must understand that there has also been a first trumpet. Now these are the two resurrections. Therefore, however many shall not rise previously in the first resurrection and reign with Christ over the world—over all the nations—they will rise at the last trumpet after the thousand years, that is, at the final resurrection among the impious, the sinners and those guilty in various ways. Rightly, then, does the passage continue by saying, “Blessed and holy is he who shares in the first resurrection; over such the second death has no power.” Now, the second death is damnation in hell.
