The many waters are understood to be many peoples, or the gift of baptism that He sent forth by the apostles, saying: Go, teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Matthew 28:19

He calls the apostles His feet, who, being wrought by suffering, preached His word in the whole world; for He rightly named those by whose means the preaching went forth, feet. Whence also the prophet anticipated this, and said: We will worship in the place where His feet have stood. Because where they first of all stood and confirmed the Church, that is, in Judea, all the saints shall assemble together, and will worship their Lord.

“His feet were like burnished bronze refined in a furnace.” He is speaking of the apostles, because refined through suffering they preached his word. For those through whom the proclamation is extended are properly called feet. And the prophet understood this beforehand in saying, “Let us worship where his feet have stood,” because where they as the first stood and established the church, namely, in Judea, there all the saints will come together and worship their God.
