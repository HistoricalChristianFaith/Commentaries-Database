In the first letter, [John] says, “I know your work and toil and your patient suffering”—I know that you work and toil, and I see that you are patient; lest you think that I will remain a long time away from you—“and that you are not able to bear evil persons and those who call themselves apostles you have found to be liars, and you have suffered patiently for the sake of my name.” All of these things are in view of praise, and no ordinary praise. And yet it is good that such persons and such a class of people and such elect persons be admonished in every way, lest they be robbed of those blessings which are their due. But he said that he had a few things against them. “You have forsaken your first love,” he said. “Remember from where you have fallen.” When someone falls, he falls from a height, and therefore he says “from where,” since even to the very end works of love must be practised, for this is the principal commandment. And, therefore, unless this be done, he threatened to “move the lampstand from its place,” that is, to scatter the people. However, they hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which he also hates, and this is deserving of praise. “Works of the Nicolaitans” refer to the fact that before that time there were factious and troublesome men who as ministers made for themselves a heresy in the name of Nicolaus, so that what had been offered to idols could be exorcised and eaten, and that anyone who had committed fornication might receive the peace on the eighth day. And, therefore, he praised those to whom he wrote and promised to such great people the tree of life, which is in the paradise of their God.
