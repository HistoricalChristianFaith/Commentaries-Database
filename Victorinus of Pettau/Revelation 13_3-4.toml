“One of its heads was mortally wounded, but its mortal wound was healed.” He is referring here to Nero. For it is a well-known fact that when the army sent by the Senate was following him, he cut his own throat. And he is the one whom, when he has been brought to life again, God will send as a king worthy of those who are worthy of him, namely, the Jews and those who persecute Christ, and he will send him as a christ such as the persecutors and the Jews deserve. And since he will bear another name, he will also undertake another life, so that they [the Jews] might receive him as the Christ. For Daniel said, “he will not know the desire of women”—he who himself is the most impure!—“and he will know no god of his fathers.” To be sure, he would not be able to seduce the people of the circumcision were he not to pose as a defender of the law. Finally, he will urge the saints, if he proves able to seduce them, to accept nothing other than circumcision. And so at last he will create a trust in himself, so that he will be called “Christ” by them. That he will come forth from hades, we have already mentioned through the words of Isaiah, “water nourished him and the deep set him on high.”
