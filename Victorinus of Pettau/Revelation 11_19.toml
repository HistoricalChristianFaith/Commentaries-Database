The temple opened is a manifestation of our Lord. For the temple of God is the Son, as He Himself says: Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. And when the Jews said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, the evangelist says, He spoke of the temple of His body.

That “the temple of God which is in heaven was opened” signifies the appearance of our Lord. For the temple of God is his Son, as he said, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.” And when the Jews said, “It was built in forty-six years,” the Evangelist said, “He was speaking of the temple of [his] body.” The “ark of the covenant” is the preaching of the gospel and mercy for sins and everything whatsoever which will have come with him. That, he says, appeared.
