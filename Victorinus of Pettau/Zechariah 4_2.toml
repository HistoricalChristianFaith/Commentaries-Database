Behold the seven horns of the lamb, the seven eyes of God2â€”the seven eyes are the seven spirits of the lamb; seven torches burning before the throne of God, seven golden candlesticks, seven young sheep, the seven women in Isaiah, the seven churches in Paul, seven deacons, seven angels, seven trumpets, seven seals to the books, seven periods of seven days with which Pentecost is completed, the seven weeks in Daniel, also the forty-three weeks in Daniel;12 with Noah, seven of all clean things in the ark; seven revenges of Cain, seven years for a debt to be acquitted, the lamp of the seven orifices, seven pillars of wisdom in the house of Solomon.
