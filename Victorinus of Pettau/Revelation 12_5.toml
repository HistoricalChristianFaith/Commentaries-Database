"And she brought forth a son, who begins to rule all nations with a rod of iron." The rod of iron is the sword of persecution.

"I saw that all men withdrew from his abodes." That is, the good will be removed, flying from persecution.

"And her son was caught up to God, and to His throne." We read also in the Acts of the Apostles that He was caught up to God's throne, just as speaking with the disciples He was caught up to heaven.
