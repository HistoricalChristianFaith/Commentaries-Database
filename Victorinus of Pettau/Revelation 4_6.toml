That is the gift of baptism which He sheds forth through His Son in time of repentance, before He executes judgment. It is therefore before the throne, that is, the judgment. And when he says a sea of glass like to crystal, he shows that it is pure water, smooth, not agitated by the wind, not flowing down as on a slope, but given to be immoveable as the house of God.

And “before the throne there was, as it were, a sea of glass similar to crystal.” This is the gift of baptism, which he poured out through his Son during the time of repentance, before he should begin the judgment. And, therefore, it is “before the throne,” that is, before the judgment. And since it says “a sea of glass similar to crystal,” it shows that it is pure water, smooth, not made rough by the wind nor like a river flowing downhill, but given as an immovable gift from God.
