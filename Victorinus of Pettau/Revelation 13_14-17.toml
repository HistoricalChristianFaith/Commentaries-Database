[The beast] will even see to it that a golden image of the antichrist is placed in the temple at Jerusalem, and the apostate angels will enter there and from there issue prophesies and oracles. And he himself will cause “both slave and free to receive a mark on their foreheads or on their right hands”—namely, the number of his name—“so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark.” Daniel had already spoken of this destruction of people and this contempt of God and this abomination, saying, “And he will place [an image] in his temple between the mountain of the sea and the two seas,” that is, at Jerusalem, and then he will place here his golden image, just as King Nebuchadnezzar had done. And the Lord recalls this to all the churches when he speaks of the last times: “When you see the contempt of turning away29 spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place, where it ought not, let the reader understand.” It is said to be “contempt” when God is provoked because idols are being worshiped. On the other hand, it is said to be a “turning away” when unstable people, seduced by false signs and wonders, are turned away from their salvation.
