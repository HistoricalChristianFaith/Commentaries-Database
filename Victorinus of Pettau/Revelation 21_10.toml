At the time of the kingdom and of the first resurrection, the holy city will appear, which, it says, will come down from heaven. It will be foursquare and decorated with jewels of different value, color and kind, and it will be like pure gold, that is, clear and transparent. It says that its street will be paved with crystal and that the river of life will flow through the middle, as do fountains of the waters of life. The tree of life will produce different fruits each month. There will be there no light from the sun, since there will be a more outstanding glory. For it says, the Lamb—that is, God—will be its light.
