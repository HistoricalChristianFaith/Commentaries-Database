“And he saw the souls of the slain under the altar,” that is, under the earth. For both the heaven and the earth are called “altar.” And so, the law, prefiguring by way of images the face of the truth, presented two altars, one that is gold within and one that is bronze without. And we understand that this altar is called “heaven,” since this testimony was given to us by our Lord. For he said, “When you offer your gift on the altar”—to be sure, our gifts are the prayers that we ought to offer—“and there should remember that your brother has anything against you, leave there your gift,” and most certainly prayers ascend to heaven. And so, heaven is understood to be that altar that was gold within—for even the priest, who had the command of Christ, entered into the temple to the golden altar once a year. The Holy Spirit was signifying that [Christ] was going to do this, that is, that he would suffer once for all. And parallel to this, the bronze altar is to be understood as the earth, under which exists hades, a region removed from pains and fire, a place for the repose of the saints, in which to be sure the just are seen and heard by the impious, but these cannot go across to those.
