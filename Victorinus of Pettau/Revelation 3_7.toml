The sixth class is the mode of life of the best election. The habit of saints is set forth; of those, to wit, who are lowly in the world, and unskilled in the Scriptures, and who hold the faith immoveably, and are not at all broken down by any chance, or withdrawn from the faith by any fear.

This sixth class represents the highest manner of life of the elect saints, namely, of those who are humble in the world and are untutored in the Scriptures but hold steadfastly to the faith and in no way withdraw from the faith out of fear. To these he says, “I have set before you an open door,” and he further says, “For you have kept the word of my patience”—with such little strength—“and I will save you from the hour of temptation.” And that they might know his glory in this manner, he does not permit them to be handed over into temptation. “He who conquers,” he says, “he will become a pillar in the temple of God.” A pillar is a decoration of a building, and so he who perseveres will obtain a nobility in the church.
