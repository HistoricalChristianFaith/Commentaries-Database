“In the hand of him who is seated on the tribunal there is a book written within, sealed by seven seals.” This signifies the Old Testament which was given into the hand of our Lord, who received the judgment from the Father. “A herald cried out,” he says, “whether there was anyone worthy to open the book and to loose its seals, and no one was found worthy, neither in heaven, nor on earth, nor under the earth.” However, to open the testament is to suffer and to conquer death for humanity. No one was found worthy to do this, neither among the angels in heaven, nor among men on the earth, nor among the souls of the saints who are at rest; only Christ, the Son of God, whom he says that he saw as though a lamb slain, having seven horns. What had been prophesied of him, whatever the law had mediated of him through oblations and sacrifices, it was necessary that he fulfill. And because he himself was the testator who had conquered death, it was just that he himself be appointed God’s heir, so that he might possess the property of the one who was dying, that is, the human race.
