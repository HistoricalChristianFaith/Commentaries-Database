When the first seal was opened, he says that “he saw a white horse and a rider who was crowned and who had a bow”—for this is what happened at first. For, after our Lord ascended into heaven, he opened all things and sent forth the Holy Spirit. Through preachers, the words of the Holy Spirit penetrate into the human heart as though they were arrows and they conquer unbelief. The crown on the head is promised to the preachers by the Holy Spirit.… And therefore, the white horse is the word of preaching when the Holy Spirit was sent into the world. For the Lord has said, “This gospel will be preached in all the world as a witness to the nations, and then the end will come.”
