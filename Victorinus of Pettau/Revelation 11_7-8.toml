“These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth,” that is, in paradise. It is necessary that after many plagues have come to the world these be killed by the antichrist, who, it says, is “the beast that ascends from the bottomless pit.” That he will ascend from the pit is attested by many witnesses. For Isaiah says, “Behold, Assyria is a cypress on Mount Lebanon.” “Assyria” is a deeply rooted “cypress,” high and full of branches, that is, [Assyria possesses] a numerous people. It is “on Mount Lebanon,” that is, a kingdom among kingdoms. It is “beautiful in its offshoots,” that is, it is strong in its armies. “Water nourishes it,” it says; that is, there are many thousands of persons who will be submitted to it. “The abyss increased him,” that is, it vomited him forth. Ezekiel often speaks in such words. Paul also gives witness that antichrist is in a kingdom among kingdoms and was among the Caesars. He writes to the Thessalonians, “If only he restrains, who is seen [to be restraining], until he be taken from the way. And then he will appear whose coming is like the activity of Satan with signs and deceptive works.” And that they might know that he who was to come was then emperor, he adds, “he is already working the mystery of wickedness.” That is, he is working in a mysterious way that wickedness which he will do. But he will not be aroused [to this work] by his own strength or by that of his father but by the command of God. And for this reason Paul said, “Therefore, since they did not receive the love of God, God sends upon them a spirit of error, that all of them might be persuaded by delusion, who were not persuaded by the truth.” Isaiah says, “Darkness arose upon them who were awaiting the light.”
