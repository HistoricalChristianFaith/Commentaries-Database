he time must be understood in which the written Apocalypse was published, since then reigned Cæsar Domitian; but before him had been Titus his brother, and Vespasian, Otho, Vitellius, and Galba. These are the five who have fallen. One remains, under whom the Apocalypse was written— Domitian, to wit. The other has not yet come, speaks of Nerva; and when he has come, he will be for a short time, for he did not complete the period of two years.

This must be understood in terms of the time when the Apocalypse was written, for Domitian was Caesar at that time. However, before him there was Titus, his brother, and Vespasian, their father, also Otho, Vitellius and Galba. These are the five who have fallen. “One is,” it says. This is Domitian, in whose reign the Apocalypse was written. “The other has not yet come.” This refers to Nerva, who “when he comes, he must remain only a little while,” for he did not complete even two years [as Caesar].
