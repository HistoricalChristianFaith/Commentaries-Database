That is, on account of the eminent glory of Christ's victory, they cast all their victories under His feet. This is what in the Gospel the Holy Spirit consummated by showing, For when about finally to suffer, our Lord had come to Jerusalem, and the people had gone forth to meet Him, some strewed the road with palm branches cut down, others threw down their garments, doubtless these were setting forth two peoples— the one of the patriarchs, the other of the prophets; that is to say, of the great men who had any kind of palms of their victories against sin, and cast them under the feet of Christ, the victor of all. And the palm and the crown signify the same things, and these are not given save to the victor.

And when these things occurred, he says, “All the elders fell down and worshiped the Lord, when the animals gave him glory and honor.” That is, when the gospel—namely, both the actions and the teaching of the Lord—had fulfilled that word previously foretold by them, [the prophets] worthily and properly exulted, knowing that they had rightly ministered the word of the Lord. And finally, because he had come who would conquer death and would alone be worthy to take the crown of immortality, as many as possessed crowns because of the glory of his most excellent deed “threw them under his feet,” that is, on account of the greatness of the victory of Christ they threw their victories under his feet.
