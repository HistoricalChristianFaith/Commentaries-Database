“He received a measuring rod like a staff, that he might measure the temple and the altar and those who worship in it.” In this passage he speaks of that authority that [John] afterward exercised in the churches after his release. For he later also wrote a Gospel. And when Valentinus and Cerinthus and Ebion and other sects of Satan had spread throughout the world, bishops from the neighboring cities gathered to him and persuaded him to write his testimony concerning the Lord. The “measure” of the faith, however, is the commandment of our Lord, namely, that we must confess the Father Almighty, as we have been taught, and his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, who was spiritually begotten from the Father before the beginning of the world, who was made man, and when he had conquered death was received with his body by the Father into heaven, holy Lord and pledge of immortality; he was foretold by the prophets, he was described by the law, and through the hand of God and the word of the Father Almighty he is also the creator of the whole world. This is the rod and measure of the faith, so that no one worships at the holy altar except him who confesses this, “the Lord and his Christ.” “The court on the inside leave outside.” The court is called an “atrium,” an open area between walls. He commands that such as these are to be thrown out of the church, for they are unnecessary. “It is given over to be trampled by the nations.” This means that such persons are to be trampled either by the nations or with the nations. He mentions then again the destruction and the slaughter of the last times and says, “and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.”
