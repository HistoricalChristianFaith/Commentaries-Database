And he is the eighth. He says only when this beast shall come, reckon it the eighth place, since in that is the completion. He added:—

And shall go into perdition. For that ten kings received royal power when he shall move from the east, he says. He shall be sent from the city of Rome with his armies. And Daniel sets forth the ten horns and the ten diadems. And that these are eradicated from the former ones—that is, that three of the principal leaders are killed by Antichrist: that the other seven give him honour and wisdom and power.

[The beast belongs to the seven], for before the reign of these kings, Nero reigned. “But it is an eighth,” since it will soon come and is reckoned to the eighth place. And since with him the consummation will occur, it adds, “and it goes to perdition.” For “ten kings have received royal power.” When [Nero] moves from the east, these will be sent by the city of Rome with their armies. He calls these “ten horns” and “ten diadems.” And Daniel also reveals this: “three of the first will be rooted up,” that is, three of these chieftains will be killed by the antichrist. And the remaining seven will give him “glory and honor and kingdom and power.” Concerning these it says, “these will hate the harlot,” speaking here of the city, “and they will devour her flesh with fire.”
