Now, that he says that this dragon was of a red colour— that is, of a purple colour— the result of his work gave him such a colour. For from the beginning (as the Lord says) he was a murderer; and he has oppressed the whole of the human race, not so much by the obligation of death, as, moreover, by the various forms of destruction and fatal mischiefs. His seven heads were the seven kings of the Romans, of whom also is Antichrist, as we have said above.

And ten horns. He says that the ten kings in the latest times are the same as these, as we shall more fully set forth there.

It says that [the dragon] was the color of red, that is, of scarlet, for the fruit of his work has given him such a color. For he was a murderer from the beginning, and everywhere he has oppressed the whole race of people, not so much by the debt of death as through all kinds of miseries. The “seven heads” are the seven Roman kings from whom the antichrist comes; … the “ten horns” are the ten kings at the end of time.
