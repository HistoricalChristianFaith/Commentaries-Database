His paps are the two testaments, and the golden girdle is the choir of saints, as gold tried in the fire. Otherwise the golden girdle bound around His breast indicates the enlightened conscience, and the pure and spiritual apprehension that is given to the churches.

It says that “in the midst of the golden lampstands there was one walking similar to a son of man.” It says “similar,” because death had been destroyed. For when he had ascended into heaven, and when his body was united to the Spirit of glory which he received from the Father, henceforth he could be called as though Son of God and no longer as though son of man.

The words “in priestly garment” most clearly indicate the flesh, which was not corrupted by death and which possesses through his death an eternal priesthood. “A golden girdle was tied to his breast.” These words suggest that a vibrant knowledge and a pure spiritual understanding have been given to the churches.
