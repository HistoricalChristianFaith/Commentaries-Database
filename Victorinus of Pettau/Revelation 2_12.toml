The third class of saints are persons who are strong in the faith and are not frightened by persecution. But since there are even among them some who are inclined toward illicit indulgences, he says, “I will fight with them by the sword of my mouth,” that is, “I will say what I will command, and I will tell you what you are to do.” For there are some “who have taught the doctrine of Balaam and have placed a stone of stumbling before the eyes of the sons of Israel, to eat what is sacrificed to idols and to commit fornication.” And this was known a long time ago. For he gave this advice to the king of the Moabites that in this way he had scandalized the people. “So,” he says, “you have some among you who hold to this teaching,” and under the pretext of mercy you corrupt others. “Whoever conquers,” he says, “I will give to him from the hidden manna.” The “hidden manna” is immortality. The “white stone” is the adoption as a son of God. The “new name” is that of Christian.
