Each of the gates are from a single pearl. There are three gates on each side, and these gates are not closed but open. The Scripture shows extensively that the kings of [every] region and nation, who are its servants, will bring their wealth into [the city]. It is speaking of the subduing of the last [nations], of which we have already spoken. However, city is not to be understood in a manner such as we know. For without a guide we are unable to conceive of anything grander and larger than what we have heard and seen. But here city refers to every region of the eastern provinces that were promised to the patriarch Abraham. He says, “Look into the heaven from the place in which you are now standing”—that is, “from the great river Euphrates to the river of Egypt”—“all the land which you see I will give to you and to your seed.” Then the Holy Spirit said, “He shall have dominion from sea to sea”—that is, from the Red Sea, which is in Arabia, to the Sea of the North, which is the Sea of Phoenicia—“and to the ends of the earth,” that is, the regions of great Syria. Therefore, it is manifest that all of these regions will be made level and cleansed at the coming of the Lord, and … when the splendor comes down from heaven as a cloud, they will be covered all around with a light from above that surpasses the splendor of the sun.
