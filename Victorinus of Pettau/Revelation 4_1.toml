The new testament is announced as an open door in heaven.

Since the door is shown to be opened, it is manifest that previously it had been closed to men. And it was sufficiently and fully laid open when Christ ascended with His body to the Father into heaven. Moreover, the first voice which he had heard when he says that it spoke with him, without contradiction condemns those who say that one spoke in the prophets, another in the Gospel; since it is rather He Himself who comes, that is the same who spoke in the prophets. For John was of the circumcision, and all that people which had heard the announcement of the Old Testament was edified with his word.

That is the Spirit, whom a little before he confesses that he had seen walking as the Son of man in the midst of the golden candlesticks. And he now gathers from Him what had been foretold in similitudes by the law, and associates with this scripture all the former prophets, and opens up the Scriptures. And because our Lord invited in His own name all believers into heaven, He immediately poured out the Holy Spirit, who should bring them to heaven.

“There was,” he says, “an open door in heaven.” John sees the preaching of the New Testament, and it is said to him, “Come up here.” When it is shown that the door was opened, it is clear that previously it had been closed to humankind. However, it was sufficiently and perfectly opened when Christ ascended in the body to the Father in heaven. When he says that the voice that he had heard was the voice that spoke with him, without any doubt this proves to the stubborn [unbelievers]4 that he who comes is the very same as he who spoke through the prophets. For John was from the circumcision, and that entire people had heard the preaching of the Old Testament and had been edified by that voice. For “that voice,” he says, “which I heard, it said to me, ‘Come up here.’ ” This is Jesus Christ whom a little before he said that he had seen as a son of man among the golden lampstands. And now he recalls that which had been fore-told in the law by means of similitudes, and through this Scripture he joins together all the previous prophets and opens the Scriptures.
