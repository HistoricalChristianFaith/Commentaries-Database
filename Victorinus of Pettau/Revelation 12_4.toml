Now, that he says that the dragon's tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, this may be taken in two ways. For many think that he may be able to seduce the third part of the men who believe. But it should more truly be understood, that of the angels that were subject to him, since he was still a prince when he descended from his estate, he seduced the third part; therefore what we said above, the Apocalypse says.

And the dragon stood before the woman who was beginning to bring forth, that, when she had brought forth, he might devour her child. The red dragon standing and desiring to devour her child when she had brought him forth, is the devil—to wit, the traitor angel, who thought that the perishing of all men would be alike by death; but He, who was not born of seed, owed nothing to death: wherefore he could not devour Him— that is, detain Him in death— for on the third day He rose again. Finally, also, and before He suffered, he approached to tempt Him as man; but when he found that He was not what he thought Him to be, he departed from Him, even till the time.

That “the tail of the dragon swept down a third of the stars” may be understood in a twofold way. Many understand this to mean that he was able to seduce a third of the believers. However, this may be more truthfully understood to mean that he [seduced] a third of the angels who were subordinated to him while he was yet prince and [fell] when he toppled from his position.

“The red dragon stood expecting to devour her son when she had delivered him.” This is the devil, namely, that fugitive angel who thought that the destruction of all people could be equally accomplished through death. However, he who was not born from seed owed no debt to death, and for this reason [the devil] was not able to devour him, that is, to subject him to death. For, indeed, [the devil] had come to him intending to tempt him as man. But when he had discovered that he was not whom he thought, “he departed from him,” it says, “until an opportune time.”
