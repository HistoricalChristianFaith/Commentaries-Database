He who sees all things willed that we know that these, that is, the souls of the slain, await the vindication of their blood, that is, of their body, from those who dwell upon the earth. However, since at the end of time the eternal reward of the saints and the condemnation of the impious will come, they are told to wait. And for a consolation of their body they received, it says, white robes, that is, the gift of the Holy Spirit.
