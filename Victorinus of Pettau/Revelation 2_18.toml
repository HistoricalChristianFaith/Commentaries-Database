The fourth class indicates the nobility of the faithful who do good works every day and who do greater works. But even among these the Lord shows that there are persons who too easily grant an unlawful peace and pay attention to new prophecies, and he urges and admonishes the others, to whom this is not pleasing, who know the iniquity of the adversary. And for these evils and deceptions he seeks to bring dangers upon the head of the faithful. And therefore he says, “I do not place upon you any further burden”—that is, “I have not given to you the observations and duties of the law,” which is another burden—“but hold fast to that which you have, until I come. And to him who conquers, I will give power over the nations”—that is “he will be established as judge among the rest of the saints”—and “I will give to him the morning star,” that is, Christ promises the first resurrection. For the morning star drives the night away and announces the light, that is, the beginning of the day.
