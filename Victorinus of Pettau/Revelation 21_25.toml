In this kingdom [Christ] promised to his servants: “Whoever shall have left father or mother or brother or sister for my name’s sake, he will receive as a reward a hundredfold now, and in the future he will possess eternal life.” In this kingdom those who have been defrauded of their goods for the name of the Lord, also the many who have been killed by every kind of crime and imprisonment—for before the coming of the Lord, the holy prophets were stoned, killed and cut in half—will receive their consolation, that is, their crowns and celestial rewards. In this kingdom the Lord promised that he would compensate for the years in which the grasshopper and locust and corruption destroyed. In this kingdom the whole of creation will be preserved and reestablished and will, by the command of God, bring forth good things within it. Here the saints will receive “gold for bronze and silver for iron and precious stones.” In this place “he will give over to them the wealth of the sea and power of the nations.” In this kingdom “they will be called priests of the Lord and ministers of God,” just as they were called impious. In this kingdom “they will drink wine and be anointed with oil and be given over to joy.” Before his passion, the Lord made mention of this kingdom when he said to the apostles, “I shall not drink again of the fruit of this vine until I shall drink it new with you in the future kingdom.” This is the “hundredfold,” which is ten thousand more or less. And when he says that there will be stones that are different in kind and color, he is speaking of people, but he is also indicating the very precious variety of faith that exists in each person. The gates made of pearl refer to the apostles. And they will not be closed, it says, for through them grace has been given that will never be closed. In this place they will see face to face, and “one has not inquired after another.” And the names of the fathers and of the apostles shall be on the walls and the gates; we have already discussed and interpreted the twenty-four elders. And of those who will have reigned in this kingdom [it is said], “They shall judge the world.”
