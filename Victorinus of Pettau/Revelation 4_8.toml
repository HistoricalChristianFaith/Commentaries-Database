These are the testimonies of the books of the Old Testament. Thus, twenty and four make as many as there are elders sitting upon the thrones. But as an animal cannot fly unless it have wings, so, too, the announcement of the New Testament gains no faith unless it have the fore-announced testimonies of the Old Testament, by which it is lifted from the earth, and flies. For in every case, what has been told before, and is afterwards found to have happened, that begets an undoubting faith. Again, also, if wings be not attached to the living creatures, they have nothing whence they may draw their life. For unless what the prophets foretold had been consummated in Christ, their preaching was vain. For the Catholic Church holds those things which were both before predicted and afterwards accomplished. And it flies, because the living animal is reasonably lifted up from the earth. But to heretics who do not avail themselves of the prophetic testimony, to them also there are present living creatures; but they do not fly, because they are of the earth. And to the Jews who do not receive the announcement of the New Testament there are present wings; but they do not fly, that is, they bring a vain prophesying to men, not adjusting facts to their words. And the books of the Old Testament that are received are twenty-four, which you will find in the epitomes of Theodore. But, moreover (as we have said), four and twenty elders, patriarchs and apostles, are to judge His people. For to the apostles, when they asked, saying, We have forsaken all that we had, and followed You: what shall we have? our Lord replied, When the Son of man shall sit upon the throne of His glory, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. Matthew 19:27-28 But of the fathers also who should judge, says the patriarch Jacob, Dan also himself shall judge his people among his brethren, even as one of the tribes in Israel. Genesis 49:16

The wings are the testimonies of the Old Testament, that is, of the twenty-four books, the same number as the elders upon the tribunals. For just as an animal cannot fly unless it has wings, neither can the preaching of the New Testament acquire faith unless its testimony is seen to correspond to those foretold in the Old Testament, through which it rises from the earth and flies. For it is always the case that when something spoken in the past is later found to have happened, that creates an undoubting faith.â€¦ If the wings do not attach to the animal, they have no source from which to draw their life. And so, unless that which the prophets foretold had been fulfilled in Christ, their preaching would be empty. And therefore the catholic church believes both that which was previously foretold and that which afterwards was fulfilled, and rightly then flies and is lifted from the earth, as though a living animal. Those heretics, however, who make no use of the prophetic testimony are as animals who do not fly, because they are of the earth. And likewise the Jews, who do not accept the preaching of the New Testament, are like wings which have no life, for they offer empty prophecies to people, not allowing the [fulfilling] deeds to correspond to the words [of prophecy].
