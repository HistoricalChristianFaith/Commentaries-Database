We read that the Holy Spirit announces in the mouth of Isaiah the number seven: “Seven women took hold of one man.” The one man is Christ, though he was not born through a man’s agency. The seven women are the seven churches, who receive his bread and are clothed with his apparel. They ask that their reproach be taken away and that they are called only by his name. The bread is the Holy Spirit who nourishes eternal life in those who have faith. The garments that they long to wear are the glory of immortality, of which the apostle Paul says, “This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.”
