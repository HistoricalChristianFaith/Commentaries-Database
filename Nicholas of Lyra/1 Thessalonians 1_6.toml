you became imitators of us and of the Lord 
Imitating, that is, in faith and morals. Or CHRYS they were imitators of the Lord because He also endured many sufferings, but rejoiced.

but with the joy of the Holy Spirit
For the Apostle may had in mind concerning those things that are said in Acts, "And indeed, they went forth from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were considered worthy to suffer insult on behalf of the name of Jesus." (5:41)
