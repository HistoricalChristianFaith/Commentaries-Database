A brother asked Antony, “What shall I do for my sins?” He replied, “He who desires to be freed from his sins will be freed from them by tears and weeping. He who wishes to be strengthened in virtues will be strengthened by weeping and tears. The very praise of the Psalms is mourning. Remember the example of Hezekiah, king of Judah, as it is written in the prophet Isaiah, who by weeping not only recovered his health but won an increase of life for fifteen years.” By the outpouring of his tears, the strength of the Lord brought to death the advancing army of the enemy, even 185,000. - "Questions and Answers of the Greek Fathers 38.1"
