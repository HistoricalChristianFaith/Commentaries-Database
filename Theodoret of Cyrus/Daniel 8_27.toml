On learning the troubles that would overtake the people in due course, I became so unwell as to fall a victim to illness. Yet despite being thus indisposed, I managed the work entrusted to me by the king, with no one aware of the cause of the sickness. He was in the habit of saying along with blessed Paul, “Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to stumble, and I am not indignant?” and “Weeping with those who weep, rejoicing with those who rejoice,” and “If one limb suffers, all the limbs suffer together.” This man felt the same way, and he had this affection for his fellow slaves; and on learning of the calamities to overtake his fellow slaves many generations later, he kept weeping and wailing. He had a precise knowledge that he personally would not experience those things but would instead be freed from the present life before long.
