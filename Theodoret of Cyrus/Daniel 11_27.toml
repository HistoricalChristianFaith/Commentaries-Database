As the historian Josephus teaches us, the Romans learned about this army of his and commanded him to depart from Egypt. Then he made a peace treaty and shared a table with Ptolemy. The angel who addressed Daniel explained the festering wound underlying the friendship when he said, “Their hearts will turn to evil, and they will speak lies at the same table and will not set it right.” That is, the peace will not be secured: “Because the end will be at the appointed time.” That is, once this time has passed, they will engage again and march out in battle array.
