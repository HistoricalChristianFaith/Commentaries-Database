It is clear, therefore, from what was said at first and what was added, that the verse “I know, Lord, that the people’s way is not their own,” neither subjects our free will to nature’s enslavement nor submits our affairs to an ordained necessity. Instead, it expressly teaches us that the Lord God keeps his hand on the tiller of the universe and wisely directs it. He provides blessings but also corrects with justice whenever he perceives that despite his extended long-suffering we persist in evildoing.

The inspired author knows the usefulness of discipline and understands that the Lord is exercising loving-kindness in applying it to human beings. This is the reason he asks to have a share in it. God exercises goodness in applying correction, and correction produces knowledge. Likewise the prophet Jeremiah begs, “Correct us, O Lord, but in just measure, not in anger, lest you make us few.” Thus, a sick person who longs for health goes in search of a cure through cutting by steel and burning.
