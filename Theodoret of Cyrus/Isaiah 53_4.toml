And next he teaches the forms of dishonor and shame, “A man being in sorrow.” He points out the nature that received the suffering, for his body was nailed to the cross, but his divinity made the passion its own. “And he was familiar with sickness.” This was said about his humanity. For to be courageous and philosophical touches not divine but human nature. “For his face was turned away. It was not valued or appreciated.” The three translators render it this way, “And like a hiding of the face from him, he was made nothing and not appreciated.” That is, he hid the divine energy and chose suffering and did not seek vengeance on others. For as he was on the cross he said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.” This teaches us the reasons for the passion: “He bore our sicknesses and suffered for us.” Symmachus translated, “Indeed, he personally has taken on our sicknesses and endured our pains.” We deserved death for those sins we had committed, and having received this penalty, he received death on our behalf.
