He says, “And his body was like Tharseis” instead of “it resembled purified gold brought from Tharseis,” for refined gold was brought to Solomon from there. “And his face was like the appearance of lightning.” He says that a radiance resembling light shone from his face. “And his eyes were like lamps of fire and his arms and legs like the sight of burnished bronze and the sound of his words like the sound of a crowd.” He says that he has eyes emitting fire and arms resembling the finest bronze. You would think that he had heard a multitude speaking.
