We have a basis of high repute in the evidence given by the God of all of his great affection for us: “God so loved the world,” Scripture says, “that he has given his only-begotten Son so that all who believe in him may not perish but have eternal life.” “O Lord my God, I shall confess to you forever”: not only in the present life but also after the resurrection I shall offer hymns to you, constantly recounting your extraordinary and ineffable gifts.
