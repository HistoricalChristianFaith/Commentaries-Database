For they have burned the temple of God, they have consecrated the sacred vessels to idols, and they have used cruelty against the prisoners. “I gave them into your hands.” You would not have carried off the victory if I had not willed it. I delivered them [to you] because I wanted to correct them, not exterminate them. “But you did not extend mercy to them; you made the yoke of the aged very heavy.” Even age did not seem to you worthy of respect. [Isaiah] has by this trait shown the extent of their hardness.
