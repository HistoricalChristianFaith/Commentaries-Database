“Well-off” refers to the priests and the teachers of the law; “poor” refers to the rest, insofar as they did not possess the wealth of divine knowledge. Yet he accuses both of lawlessness, proceeding in this way, “They all alike broke the yoke, they snapped the bonds.” It was not without purpose the prophet said this. Instead, since the Lord promised lovingkindness, provided he found someone “doing justice and seeking faith,” he explains that though he went looking, as he was commanded to do, he found they had all broken the yoke of the law.
