For nature taught them both that God is the Creator of all things and also that they should flee unrighteousness and embrace righteousness. But even when teachers were given to them, they did not live up to this. So God threatened them with future punishment.… This punishment is called the wrath of God, not because God punishes people for any emotional reason but in order to stun those who rebel against him.
