But since they did not know the divine nature, they crucified [what they saw as] the human nature. Or didn’t you hear them say, “We are not stoning you because of a good work but because of blasphemy, since you, who are a man, make yourself God.” Through these words they show that they recognized the nature that they saw but had absolutely no knowledge of the invisible nature. If they had known that nature, however, “they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.”
