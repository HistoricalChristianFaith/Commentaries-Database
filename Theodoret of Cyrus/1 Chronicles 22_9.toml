Solomon means “peaceable”; as you can find in the Chronicles: God said to David when he wanted to build the new temple, “Lo, a son is born to you; he will be a man of repose, and I shall give him peace from all his enemies round about because his name is Solomon, and I shall give peace and tranquility to Israel in his days. He will build a house for my name, and he will be a son to me, and I shall be a father to him, and I shall assure the throne of his kingdom in Israel forever.” It is well known, however, that Solomon died without living long, and that his throne came to an end. He gives the name Solomon, therefore, to our peaceable Lord, of whom blessed Paul says, “For he is our peace, who has made the two one and has broken down the dividing wall.” … Now it was not Solomon who had dominion to the ends of the world [either] but he who sprang from Solomon in his humanity, Jesus Christ, and was called Solomon on account of his peaceable and gentle nature and his being the cause of peace.
