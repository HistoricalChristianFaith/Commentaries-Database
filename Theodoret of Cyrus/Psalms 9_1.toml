It is characteristic of the perfect to dedicate their whole heart to God and to consecrate their whole mind to him. “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart,” Scripture says, “with your whole soul, with your whole strength and with your whole mind.” Those who divide their thoughts between mammon and God, between Christ and gold, between the present and the future life, cannot truthfully say, “I shall confess to you, O Lord, with all my heart.”
