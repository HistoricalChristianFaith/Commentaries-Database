His question is a matter of style meant to show the strangeness of the happening: did you not go to Egypt? he says. Why then have you come back from there? “Thus says the Lord, because my people was taken for nothing, you wonder and howl.” You are struck with amazement, he says, in deploring the captivity, because, despite the title of “my people” that you carry, you have suffered these misfortunes. Well, do not wonder, but consider how “on account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles.” The fact that you are justifiably undergoing these misfortunes is not so insupportable as the fact that I am blasphemed because of you and that the Gentiles think my weakness is the cause of the bad fortune that you have endured.
