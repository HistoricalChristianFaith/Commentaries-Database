These words indicate a fervent and unending love: although stricken with it, they search for definitions capable of celebrating the dignity of the one who is to be praised, and, since they cannot find any, they punctuate their phrases with superlatives, speaking of God in terms of him being “highly praised and praised more than any other.” And they not only say this but also add that his name is worthy of praise. And they do well to constantly assert that he is “Lord and God of our ancestors,” agreeing in this way that they are not worthy of being called by this name.
