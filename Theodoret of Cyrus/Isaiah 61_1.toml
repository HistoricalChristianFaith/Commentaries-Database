After completing these predictions, Isaiah now turns the prophecy to Christ the Master, who in the present life has given these things to the church and has promised the commonwealth to come.… We do not need many examples to explain the meaning of this prophecy. For the Master himself has made it clear to us. For, entering the synagogue he took the book, unrolled it … and he was anointed by the All-Holy Spirit, not as God but as man. For we have often made this manifest already in our other writings.…Isaiah calls “poor” those who have lost heavenly riches, “broken-hearted” those who have corrupted their reason, “blind” those who do not know God and who worship creation, “prisoner” those brought into the enemy’s camp and who have lost their original freedom.… Christ did not only give to us the forgiveness of sins and free us from the tyranny of the devil and reveal to us the divine light, but he also announced the future existence and warned of the righteous judgment. For I think that “the year of grace” means his first coming and “day of recompense” the day of judgment. To console all who mourn with the hope of the resurrection, he has tempered the despair of death.…
“Perfume of joy,” which Theodotion and Symmachus translate by “oil of gladness,” refers to the mystical anointing through which those made worthy receive the cloak of glory; for “cloak” must be understood as spiritual clothing.…
As the blessed David says, “This is the generation that seeks the Lord.” The three interpreters, instead of “the generations of justice,” have “the strong ones of justice, a plantation of the Lord for his glory.” In this way, the finest generals of godliness, as they roam the globe, remove impiety, and they plant in the desert the first plantations of the Lord.
