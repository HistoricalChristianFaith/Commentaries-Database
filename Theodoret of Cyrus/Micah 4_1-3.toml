The evangelical and divine preaching coursed to the ends of the earth, according to the Lord’s prophecy contained in the sacred Gospels: “This good news will be preached to all the nations in witness to them.” And he urged the holy apostles in the words, “Go, make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe everything I commanded you.” This evangelical law and apostolic preaching began with Jerusalem as with a fountain and traveled across the whole world, offering irrigation to those who made their approach with faith. It is also possible to see the divine houses situated in the middle of cities, villages, fields and remote areas, conspicuous for their size and beauty, so that they are illustrious and famous even on the highest mountains.
