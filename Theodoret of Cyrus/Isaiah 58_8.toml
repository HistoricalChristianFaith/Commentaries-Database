The light is desirable, but more desirable still is the dawn that appears after the night. This he has called “the morning light.” … Aquila has, “Then your light will break through like the dawn.” For just as the dawn tears away the curtain of the night, so, he says, the night of your misfortunes, your life lived under the law, will disperse, and the light of my providence will be supplied to you.… “Your righteousness will go out before you, and the glory of the Lord will surround you.” He makes it clear that the divine works follow our works. For with our righteousness in the vanguard, the glory of the Lord of the universe is given access, shining on us as we look for it.
