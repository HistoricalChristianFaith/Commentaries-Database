The text has presented, at the same time, a triple teaching: God is the creator, the master and the protector. For the term “Lord” demonstrates his sovereignty; the idea of “redemption,” God’s protection; and that of “formation,” the creation. “I am the Lord who performs all these things.” It is I who have sent you the sorrows and who will obtain the joys for you. Then God shows, by the events that have already happened, what he is able to do. “I alone stretched out the heaven and established the earth.” This again serves to refute completely the madness of Arius and Eunomius, for who is the one who alone has created the elements? Is it the Father? Then the Son is not the Creator. Or is it the Son? Then the Father is not the Creator. But if it is the Father and the Son, how should we understand the term “alone”? Surely it is evident that we must understand it of the one divinity of the Trinity.
