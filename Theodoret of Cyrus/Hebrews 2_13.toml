The phrase “he is not ashamed” suffices to bring out the difference in sonship. Speaking of masters and slaves we are accustomed to bring out the humility of masters by saying, “He is not afraid to eat and drink with his servants, to sit with them and personally to tend those of them who are ill.” So this is what he is implying here as well, that the one who for our sakes accepted suffering is not ashamed to call “brethren” those for whom he endured the suffering—and not only “brethren,” he also calls them “children.” Likewise the Lord in the sacred Gospels said to the divine apostles, “Little children, yet a little while I am with you,” and again, “Children, have you any fish?” He also shows that what is said in lowly fashion is said in reference to the incarnation: to the phrase “he is not ashamed” he linked “I shall have trust in him,” that is, he is not ashamed on account of the salvation of humankind even to use language at variance with his own dignity.
