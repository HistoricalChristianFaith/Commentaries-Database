“I have said, ‘You are gods and all sons of the most high, but as human beings you die.’ ” He says this to those who did not accept the gift of adoption22 but who dishonor the taking of flesh through the pure birth of the Word of God, deprive humanity of the ascent to God and show ingratitude to God’s Word who was made flesh for them. For this is why the Word became a human being and the Son of God became a Son of man: that the human being, by embracing the Word and receiving adoption, might become a son of God.
