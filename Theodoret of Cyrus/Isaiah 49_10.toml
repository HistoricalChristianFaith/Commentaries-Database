He has threatened Israel [with suffering] hunger for the Word and [with] a dearth of clouds: “I will send,” he says, “a famine of hearing the word of the Lord,” and elsewhere: “And I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it.” Here, on the contrary, he promises those who have believed in him that they would have an abundance of divine nourishment and that they will have sources of salvation at their disposal forever.
