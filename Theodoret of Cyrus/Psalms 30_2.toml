Human nature did not beseech God and look for reprieve from destruction; rather, it constantly fell to wailing and weeping, with death in view and no expectation of resurrection. Accordingly, the psalmist made mention of the tears and laments that occur with the sick and dying to show the ineffable lovingkindness of God â€¦ [by which,] without being invoked and seeing only the wailing, he took pity on what was happening and gave a reprieve from death.
