“Who is this coming up all covered in white, leaning on her nephew?” They do not say “white” but “all covered in white,” being black, remember. While the bride said of the bridegroom, “My nephew is white,” and did not say “covered in white,” being such by nature, she on the contrary was covered in black (the sun looked on her, remember) and is now covered in white and shares the bridegroom’s whiteness. And just as being the light he both made her light and called her so, and being holy he made her holy, and becoming resurrection he accorded her resurrection, so he also gave her a share in his own peculiar whiteness. Hence on seeing her, the young women say, “Who is this coming up all covered in white, leaning on her nephew?” Guided by him and as it were led hand in hand, she makes her ascent into heaven and her departure to her beloved through her firm belief in him.
