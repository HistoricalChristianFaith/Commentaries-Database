Their gifts are like an aroma of sacrifice, a sacrifice acceptable and well-pleasing to God. Paul prays that the givers will also be recipients of necessities for the present life. He prays that “God will supply every need of yours.” And there is nothing absurd in asking this blessing on them. For the Lord himself in the holy Gospels bids us say “give us our daily bread.”
