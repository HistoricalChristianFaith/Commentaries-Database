“One has come up blowing in your face, rescuing you from tribulation.” God is the cause of this for you by his decision as though by some kind of blowing, destroying them but freeing you from their power. Just as by blowing a breath of life into Adam he made him a living being, so he provided you with salvation by the blowing of life. This is also what Christ the Lord gave the sacred apostles after the resurrection. Since Adam lost what he had received by way of image through the divine blowing, it was right that Christ the Lord should renew the image and restore it to the sacred apostles and through them to all the believers, blowing on them and saying, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” Since former things are a type of the new, therefore, let us take the Assyrians’ kingdom that was destroyed as the devil’s tyranny brought to an end through Christ the Lord.
