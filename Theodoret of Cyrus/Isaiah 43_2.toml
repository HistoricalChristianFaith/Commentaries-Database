Even when the compassionate God disciplines, he does not abandon mercy.… For, he says, “judge, consider, take heart.” Now God strengthens those who were reduced to slavery in Babylon. And since they bore the title “the people of God,” it was appropriate that God addressed the people in this way: “I have called you by your name. You are mine.” He says, “You possess the name by which I have called you.”
