He does not simply say “prince of the Persians” but “prince of the kingdom of the Persians.” He means to say “the one entrusted to rule over the very king of the Persians.”

MOSES TEACHES US THESE THINGS MORE DISTINCTLY: “For when the Most High allotted the nations, as he scattered the sons of Adam, he appointed the boundaries of the nations according to the numbers of the angels.” And in the holy Gospels our Lord says to the apostles, “See that you do not despise one of these little ones, because their angels daily see the face of my Father in heaven.” … We learn then from these passages that each of the angels is entrusted with our care, to guard and protect us and to ward off the wicked demon’s plots, but the archangels are entrusted with authority over the nations.… And blessed Daniel agrees with them, for he also speaks of the prince of the kingdom of the Persians [and] … the prince of the Greeks, and [he] calls the prince of Israel Michael.Why then [does] the prince of the Persian kingdom seem to oppose the advocate of God’s people? After all, it is clear to everyone that the nature of the angels is better than the passions by which we are gripped, and their nature is full of holiness. The fact that they unquestionably obey the wishes of God can be learned throughout Scripture. How then does the prince of the kingdom of the Persians seem to oppose the care of the Israelites?… For the prince of the Persians and the prince of Greeks, that is, those who have been entrusted with the protection and care of these nations, inasmuch as they are fondly disposed toward those in their care and see the transgression of Israel, were displeased to see the Israelites enjoying more consideration. They did not know the mystery that had been hidden in God, who made all things. After the incarnation of our Savior, as Paul says, “The manifold wisdom of God was made known to the rulers and authorities through the church.” Therefore, since they did not know this mystery and they saw God’s great providence for Israel, those who had been entrusted with the care for the other nations were displeased to see that after the law, the prophets and such teaching and care, the Israelites behaved worse and were inflamed by more evil than the nations who were shepherded by them.

This means “I spent all these days persuading him how the Israelites were justifiably worthy of this attention. And Michael, one of the chief princes, joined in advocating with me.”
