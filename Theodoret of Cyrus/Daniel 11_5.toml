He is talking about Ptolemy Philopator, who was not satisfied with the kingdom of Egypt but who added also Phoenicia, Samaria and Judea. When he says, “one of his princes will grow strong,” he is talking about Scopas, whom also Josephus the Hebrew historian mentions. Scopas was an outstanding general and placed under Ptolemy’s power many of the nations that were outside of the kingdom of Ptolemy. He speaks of this one enigmatically: “And he will rule with much power beyond his authority,” that is, he will rule over many nations beyond the realm that had been allotted to him.
