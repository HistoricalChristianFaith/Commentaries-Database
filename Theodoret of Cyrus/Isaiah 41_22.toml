If you do not want to demonstrate your personal strength from your knowledge or prescience, then do so through a demonstration of your power. Demonstrate your power, whether it be kind or punishing. “It is I who will put to death and I who will bring to life, I who will strike down and I who will heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hands.” But because you are lacking in knowledge and in power, I will now expose your emptiness. “They have dug you from the ground as an abomination.” For whether they are wooden or from gold, silver or bronze, they all have their origin from the earth.
