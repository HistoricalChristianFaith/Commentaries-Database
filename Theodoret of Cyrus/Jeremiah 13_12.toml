And showing the unchangeable nature of his wrath, God introduced these words: “I will not yearn after them, and I will not spare them, and I will not have pity on them because of their destruction,” rather than “[I will not have pity on] their destruction.” Then he calls their punishment drunkenness since those who fall into great misfortunes resemble those who are intoxicated inasmuch as they are not able even to mourn because they are suffering so much.
