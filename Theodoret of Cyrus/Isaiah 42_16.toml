Again, God calls the people who suffer from unbelief and who are devoid of intellectual acuteness “the blind.” He promises to guide their steps on the way they do not know, for they failed to recognize the path of the truth but followed on the paths of error. “I will turn darkness into light for them.” After freeing them from their previous ignorance, I will deem them worthy of the knowledge of God, for ignorance is like darkness, whereas knowledge is analogous to the light. “And crooked things into straight.” For the difficult course of wisdom, of the governing of oneself and of justice, he has made an easy course, since he has attached the hope of future benefits to the efforts to claim virtue. “These are the words that I will fulfill for them; and I will not forsake them.” I will not cease to judge them worthy of these benefits, and I will lavish all kinds of care, even to the future.
