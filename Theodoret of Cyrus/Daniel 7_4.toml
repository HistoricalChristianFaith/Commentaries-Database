This passage Daniel places the strongest of the beasts in the first kingdom; he does not imply that the first beast possessed greater might but only that it was nobler. Nonetheless, he saw “those wings plucked out,” that is, abandoned by all the people who had been subjected to it and deprived of its earlier power. He says, “and it was removed from the earth,” that is, it ceased to reign. “And it stood on the feet of a man,” that is, it turned out to be equal to those who had been subjected to it. “And the heart of a man was given to it.” Experience teaches us to think about human matters, and it teaches us not to go beyond the boundaries of nature with the thoughts of our minds. Because they had been afflicted with the disease of haughtiness and boundless arrogance when they had held the helm of state, Isaiah said, “God will stir up the prince of the Assyrians against their great mind.” Experience rightly teaches them to think about human matters, when they see that fortunes change and that happiness is slippery and transient. They will come to learn who they are and so acquire a human heart. Thus Daniel speaks about the things that pertain to the first beast.
