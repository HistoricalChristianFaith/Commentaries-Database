Sometimes, therefore, I [Jesus] say that I am equal to the Father, and at other times I say that the Father is greater. I am not contradicting myself, but I am showing that I am God and a human beingâ€”God through the lofty words, and a human being through the humble ones. But if you want to know how the Father is greater than I, I was talking from the flesh, not from the person of the divinity.
