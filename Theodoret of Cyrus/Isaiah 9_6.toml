But the prophet who predicted the Emmanuel has written of him a little further on that “unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulders; and his name is called angel of great counsel, wonderful, counselor, mighty God, powerful, Prince of peace, Father of the age to come.” Now if the baby born of the virgin is styled “Mighty God,” then it is only with reason that the mother is called “mother of God.” For the mother shares the honor of her offspring, and the Virgin is both mother of the Lord Christ as man and again is his servant as Lord and Creator and God.
