It is not surprising that he said previously that the horn was little, but here he says that its appearance “was greater than the rest.” But one does need to pay close attention to the things that are being said. For when he saw the horn being born, he called it “little,” since it arose from a little nation, that is, the nation of the Jews, and obtained meanwhile a small kingdom. However, after it had uprooted and pulled up three greater horns, he quite deservedly calls its appearance “greater than the rest.”
