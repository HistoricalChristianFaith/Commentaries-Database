It is the holy authors who were celebrated in the Old Testament who see the bride’s spiritual youth and the immaturity and inconspicuous condition of her breasts. In their capacity as go-betweens and marriage brokers [they] say among themselves, “The king is now on the point of taking our sister as his bride, but she is small and without breasts. She is not yet fertile, nor can she provide the milk of instruction or offer developed nourishment to the needy. So we must give thought to what is to be done. Since she is about to be related to the great king and be like a wall of his house, watching and guarding what is within, and being like a door that protects the contents, let us build as if on a wall ‘silver parapets.’ ” That is,[the parapets are] arguments splendid for their reasoning, the Lord’s sayings, after all, being “pure sayings, silver tried in the fire, tested in the earth.” “So … from her position on them she may fire at the enemy and hunt down the schemers. Let us place on her as on a door tablets made of cedar that incur no decay from sin, cedar being incorruptible.”
