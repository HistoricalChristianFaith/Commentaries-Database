“And let the clouds rain righteousness.” On the occasion of making previous threats, he has said, “I will command the clouds to rain no rain on it,” and … it was the prophets who were referred to in this way. Here, therefore, the text invites the prophets to present, as a kind of rain, the discourse dealing with righteousness. In fact, those recognized as prophets after the return from exile were Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi. “And let the earth bring forth and blossom with mercy, and bring forth righteousness likewise.” For it is fitting likewise that the people who benefit from such watering offer fruits in consonance with the watering. Thus, the rain provides discourse regarding righteousness; therefore, he demands from them the fruits of righteousness and mercy. For he has called the people who inhabit the earth “the earth.” “I am the Lord who created you.” It is I who likewise from the beginning have brought you into existence.
