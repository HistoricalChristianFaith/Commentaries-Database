[Isaiah] says, look at the sun, the moon, the movement of the stars, the cycle of the year, the changing of the seasons, the regular succession of night and day. For this is what [Isaiah] has added: “He who brings forth by number the order of the cosmos.” For he calls the setting in order of creation “the cosmos.” “He shall call them by names.” He is ignorant of nothing, [Isaiah] says, but he knows all things with clarity, since it is he who has given a name equally to each and every thing. “By means of the greatness of [your] glory and by the power of [your] might nothing has escaped you.” He has power above all, he is able [to do] all, he is ignorant of nothing that exists, and he knows the very thoughts of people.

Do not think that I ignore the designs of your souls, God says through Isaiah, and do not believe that you escape my view when you hold perverse reasonings. This passage lets [us] see clearly that he has also thrown the accusation of polytheism against Israel itself.
