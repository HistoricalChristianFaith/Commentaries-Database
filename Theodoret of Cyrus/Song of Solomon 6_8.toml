Let us examine why on earth he mentioned “sixty queens” but “eighty concubines.” The number sixty contains six tens, and while the ten signifies perfection, the six represents the number of the world’s creation: in six days the God of all formed the whole creation. Accordingly, by “sixty queens” he referred to the souls in this world who were made perfect in virtue and who longed for the kingdom. The bride lives a way of life above this world, she is outside it, flies beyond it, is totally the bridegroom’s and has him constantly in mind, whereas these latter souls live in this world and practice the perfection of virtue to the extent possible while longing to attain the kingdom. But it is through fear that they obey the laws, and so they were called “eighty.” The divine Scripture, remember, speaks of the time of judgment as the eighth. In describing judgment in the Psalms, blessed David used the title “On the eighth” and began this way, “Lord, do not censure me in your anger, nor chastise me in your wrath,” and shortly after, “Because in death there is no one to remember you, in hades who will confess you?” Thus [he brings] out that at the time of judgment no place for repentance will be given to those who have sinned and have not had a change of heart.
