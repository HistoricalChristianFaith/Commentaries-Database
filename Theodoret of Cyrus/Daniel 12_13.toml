“And as for you, rest and rise at your time”—a more correct reading would be “for your inheritance,” as will become clear from the things that follow—“at the end of the days.” He says in effect, “Now you must receive the end of your days; but you will rise—and not merely rise but rise for your inheritance, that is, with the company of like-minded people.” And once he has shown this, he adds, “at the end of the days.” So the divine archangel clearly taught the resurrection through the blessed, no, thrice-blessed Daniel.

We have learned these things from the divine oracle of Daniel. The Jews mourned him as a righteous man, although they dare to place this divine prophet outside of the list of prophetic books. And yet from experience they have learned the truthfulness of this prophecy.… The Hebrew Josephus is a noteworthy witness that Jews of previous generations called blessed Daniel the greatest prophet. Josephus, to be sure, does not accept Christian teaching, but he cannot allow the truth to be hidden. In the tenth book of his Jewish Antiquities, Josephus said many other things about blessed Daniel but then adds the following: “Everything was freely given to him unexpectedly, as to one of the greatest prophets. During his lifetime he enjoyed honor and glory, both with kings and the common people. Although he died, his immortal memory lives on. The books that he composed and left behind are still read among us even now, and we have come to believe from them that Daniel consorted with God. Not only did he spend his time foretelling future events, as did the other prophets, but also he marked off the time when these things would take place.”
