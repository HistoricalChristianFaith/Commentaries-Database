Having thus proclaimed in advance the iniquity of the people, he addresses to them an exhortation to repent—for he saw in advance those among them who, after these events, would have the faith. Of this number was the divine Paul; of this number were the three thousand men and the many thousands—and he says, “If you can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived offspring.” If you acknowledge your impiety, and if you request salvation, you will obtain life eternal; for this is what he has called “long-lived.”
