For since eating is proper to them that live this present life, of necessity the Lord by means of eating and drinking proved the resurrection of the flesh to those who did not acknowledge it to be real. This same course he pursued in the case of Lazarus and of Jairus’s daughter. For when he had raised up the latter he ordered that something should be given her to eat, and he made Lazarus sit with him at the table39 and so showed the reality of the rising again.
