Whenever anything happens to the helmsman, either the officer in command at the bows or the seaman of highest rank takes his place, not because he becomes a self-appointed helmsman but because he looks out for the safety of the ship. So again in war, when the commander falls, the chief tribune assumes the command, not in the attempt to lay violent hands on the place of power but because he cares for his men. So too the thrice blessed Timothy when sent by the divine Paul took his place. It is, therefore, appropriate to you as a man of faith to accept the responsibilities of helmsman, of captain, of shepherd, gladly to run all risk for the sake of the sheep of Christ and not to leave his creatures abandoned and alone.
