Let no one think that the one who appeared to Daniel was the Lord because Daniel addressed him as “lord.” For Daniel at the end of the vision said, “He stretched out his hand to the heaven and swore by the living God,” confessing candidly thereby his servitude to the Lord. Daniel called him “lord” not as if he were God, but rather paying him the customary honor. For when we too converse with humans of more honorable rank, we typically use this salutation, just as also blessed Abraham did when he saw the angels appearing as men and conversed with them as with men: “I ask you, my lord, if I have found favor in your sight, do not pass by your servant.” And blessed Rebecca spoke to the servant of blessed Abraham, “Drink, my lord, and I will give water to your camels.” Accordingly, also this word lord does not altogether indicate God. And we will learn this more clearly from the end, as long as we hold to this train of argument.
