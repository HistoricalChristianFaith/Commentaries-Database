As for “Here I am,” this does not mean a voice but the operation through actions. For you are taught by events that the God whom you called on is with you.You will have God present, who will offer you a share of his goodness. We think by “bones” is meant the thoughts; for these receive joy. For if anyone takes God’s promise to his “bones,” he will not miss the intention of the prophecy. For the body is enriched by joy in the soul. “For a joyful heart cheers the face.”
