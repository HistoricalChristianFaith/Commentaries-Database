Here we learn accurately that the one speaking at the time was not the Lord. For as the holy apostle says, “Since the Lord could not swear by anything greater than himself, he swore by himself, saying, ‘as I live, says the Lord.’ ” And blessed Moses shows him to say, “I will lift my hand to heaven, and I will swear by my right hand and say, ‘As I live forever.’ ” The man in our text is one of those subjected and well disposed to the Lord.“When the scattering of the holy people.…” The scattering of the sanctified people will prevail for three and a half years, and all these things will be accomplished. Then they will know the holy One. He alludes here to the great Elijah; around the end of the antichrist’s reign, great Elijah will appear and proclaim the second coming of our Savior.
