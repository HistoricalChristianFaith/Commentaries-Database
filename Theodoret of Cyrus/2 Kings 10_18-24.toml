“Then Jehu assembled all the people and said to them, ‘Ahab offered Baal small service; but Jehu will offer much more.’ ” We need to examine the purpose of words and actions. And this must be done here too. In fact, since he did not want anyone to escape his revenge, Jehu used these words, so that all the priests of Baal might come confidently. In addition, in order that no priest of God might share with them the same punishment, he ordered that they be driven away as though they were not worthy of that celebration, and so he killed only [the idolatrous priests]. He also burned the statue of Baal, cut down its sacred groves and freed the whole land of Israel from other idols. However, he continued to worship the two golden calves and gave the name of Baalim to the sanctuary of Baal.
