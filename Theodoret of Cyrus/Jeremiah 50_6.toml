Then he likens them to lost sheep. He ascribes the cause for the destruction of the sheep to the shepherds. He calls “shepherds” not only their kings but also their priests. And he saw how they prepared them to wander: “They drove them to the mountains and made them wander; they have gone from mountain to hill and have forgotten their fold.” He calls the shrines of the idols “hills” and “mountains” for in them they worshiped the idols. And he calls the temple of God a “fold” because they had there the enjoyment of good things. This wandering handed them over to the enemy inasmuch as they sinned against the Lord.
