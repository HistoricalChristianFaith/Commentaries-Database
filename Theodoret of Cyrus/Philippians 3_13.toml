Some think that “paying no heed to the things behind” refers to life under the law. I think he says this of his labors as a preacher. For his custom was to be cursory and to mingle doctrinal statement with exhortation. What he says then is “I pay no heed to my previous labors, but I strive enthusiastically to press on to those ahead.”
