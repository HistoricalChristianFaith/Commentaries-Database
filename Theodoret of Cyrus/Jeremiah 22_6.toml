He calls Jerusalem “Lebanon,” and he calls the royal palace in Jerusalem “Gilead.” And there is a region in Lebanon that is called by that name, and there is also another Gilead in Israelite territory. But I think that the palace is being compared with the Gilead in Lebanon because of the impiety that they had dared to do in their midst. For this reason he threatens complete destruction on them.
