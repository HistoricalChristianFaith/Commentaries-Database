“On Mount Zion there will be salvation, and there will be holiness.” For God is saying through the prophet, “I will bring them back from their captivity, and I will rebuild the sacred temple.” And there is Obadiah, who prophesies the cause of salvation to all in Zion. From there God will disperse holiness into the entire inhabited earth through the saving cross.
