He means by these things a change of attitude. Your heart, he says, will incline to better things, no longer following your previous preference for what is worse. That “I will give” in no way damages free will, for by words and deeds and endless miracles, not only among them but in all races, so that they start to live piously; he persuades, he does not compel. And although he does not compel but persuades, he says that he has inclined their minds toward better things.
