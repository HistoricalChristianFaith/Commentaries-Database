But what excuse for despondency will we have left if we take to heart God’s own promises and the hopes of Christians: the resurrection, I mean, eternal life, continuance in the kingdom, and all that “eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of people, the things that God has prepared for them that love him”? Does not the apostle say emphatically, “I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope”? I have known many people who even without hope have got the better of their grief by the strength of reason alone, and it would indeed be extraordinary if they who are supported by such a hope should prove weaker than they who have no hope at all. Let us then, I implore you, look at the end as a long journey. When he went on a journey, we used indeed to be sorry, but we waited for his return. Now let the separation sadden us indeed in some degree, for I am not exhorting what is contrary to human nature, but do not let us wail as over a corpse; let us rather congratulate him on his setting forth and his departure hence, because he is now free from a world of uncertainties and fears no further change of soul or body or of corporeal conditions. The strife now ended, he waits for his reward. Do not grieve too much for orphans and widows. We have a greater Guardian whose law it is that all should take good care of orphans and widows and about whom the divine David says, “The Lord relieves the fatherless and widow, but the way of the wicked he turns upside down.” Only let us put the rudders of our lives in his hands, and we shall meet with an unfailing providence. His guardianship will be surer than can be that of any man, for his are the words “Can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet will I not forget you.” He is nearer to us than father and mother for he is our Maker and Creator. It is not marriage that makes fathers, but fathers are made fathers at his will.
