If we who bear the name of “your people,” he says, are unworthy of your goodwill, judge the city worthy to be spared by reason of its founder, for it has become a desert. And he makes mention of his name [David] in order to evoke mercy.… As for the passage, “the house, our sanctuary has become a curse,” the other translators have rendered this by “[it has gone] into disappearance.” However, the term “curse” offers just as well a meaning that is in accord with the misfortune suffered; for it is usual to say, “May you suffer what such a person suffered!” So the famous temple, the temple full of holiness, the temple praised by all, has been burned by the enemy’s fire, and it now only serves as a formula to curse those who mock.
