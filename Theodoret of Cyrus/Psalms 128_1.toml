“Blessed are all who fear the Lord.” The inspired word declared blessed not the one from Abraham’s stock or from Israel’s seed but the person adorned with the fear of God. Blessed Peter also says this in the book of Acts: “In truth I grasp the fact that God shows no partiality, but in every nation the person fearing him and performing righteousness is acceptable to him.” The inspired word also gave a glimpse of the character of the fear of God, adding “those walking in his ways”: 2 “Not everyone saying to me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one doing the will of my Father who is in heaven.” So it is typical of those fearing the Lord not to stray from the ways of God but to travel in them without fail.
