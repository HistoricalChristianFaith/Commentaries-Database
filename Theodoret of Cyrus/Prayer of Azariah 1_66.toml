Thus they thought themselves the least of creation and the worst among all people. The blessed Paul also thought this way when he said, “To me, the most insignificant among all the saints, this grace was granted.” And elsewhere, “Christ descended from the heavens in order to save sinners, of which I am the foremost.” He names himself the first among sinners and calls himself the least among the saints. In the same way, these blessed souls exhort themselves last to sing the praises of the Lord and exalt him forever.
