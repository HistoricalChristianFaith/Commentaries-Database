Up to the present I [Nebuchadnezzar] thought myself very great and elevated, whereas now I know clearly that all human nature is nothing compared with God. Having sought a term for insignificance and not found one suitable, he used “nothing,” which gives a sufficient clue to the instability and impermanence of nature; while calling God “Most High, Lord, living and eternal king,” he spoke of all human beings as “nothing.” In similar fashion also blessed Isaiah in comparing the divine nature with the idols focused on human nature: “If all the nations are like a drop from a bucket, and are accounted as a turn of the scale and will be accounted as spittle, while Lebanon is not sufficient for burning, and all its animals not sufficient for a burnt offering, and all the nations are nothing and were reckoned as nothing in comparison with him, to what will you compare the Lord? and with what analogy compare him?”

He says, “There is no one who will oppose his hand or say to him, ‘Why did you do that?’ ” to bring out the invincibility of God’s power. One must accept gladly what is done by him, whether it is pleasing or distressing: resisting or criticizing what is wisely ordained by him is a rash endeavor.
