He has shown how truth has departed: they did not want to consider their duty, he says, but they have distorted their intelligence so as not to understand what ought to be done and what is useful. “The truth in this has disappeared, and the person who turned away from evil has been besieged.” They have distanced themselves so far from the truth that they openly combat those who turn away from perversity and choose the good.
