“His left hand under my head, and his right hand will embrace me.” Let us be careful once more, however, not to get involved in corporeal ideas on hearing “left hand” and “right hand.” Solomon, in fact, speaks of wisdom, which is a habit and not substance: “Length of life and years of existence are in her right hand, and in her left wealth and glory.” Likewise regarding the “embrace” you can find in the Proverbs the saying, “Love her, and she will keep you safe; ring her about with a rampart, and she will exalt you; honor her, and she will embrace you.” Let us take occasion from this, then, to understand the references spiritually, believing the so-called embrace to be a communion between the divine Word and the pious soul, and the “right and left hands” should be understood in the way taken by us. So as not to leave its deeper meaning undiscerned, however, let us interpret it this way: God is in the habit of bestowing both beneficence and punishment, distributing both to those who deserve them. Let us accordingly understand beneficent grace in the case of the right hand, and punishment in the case of the left, and thus listen to the bride saying, “His left hand under my head,” that is, “I am beyond punishments, I am not subject to them, on account of my closeness to the bridegroom and my attention to his service”; and “His right hand will embrace me,” that is, “He will regale me with his beneficence and fill me with it as though enfolding and embracing me, and satisfying my desire.”
