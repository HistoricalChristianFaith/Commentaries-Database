The ineffable personality of the only-begotten God is beyond the most perceptive conception of the Evangelists and perhaps even of the angels. Therefore, I do not think anyone should be considered pious who presumes to investigate this subject, in direct contradiction to the injunction, “Do not seek what is too difficult for you or inquire into what is too high for you.” For the knowledge of numerous other things incomparably inferior is beyond the capacity of the human mind and cannot therefore be attained, as has been said by Paul: “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of people, the things that God has prepared for those who love him.” God also told Abraham that the stars could not be numbered by him and asked, “Who shall number the grains of sand by the seashore, or the drops of rain?” If all this is so, how then can anyone but a madman presume to inquire into the nature of the Word of God? It is said by the Spirit of prophecy, “Who shall declare his generation?” And, therefore, our Savior, in his kindness to those who were the pillars of the whole world—and since he wanted to relieve them of the burden of striving after this knowledge—told them that it was beyond their natural comprehension and that the Father alone could discern this most divine mystery. “No one,” he says, “knows the Son but the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son.” It was, I think, concerning this same subject that the Father said, “My secret is for me and for mine.”
