The words “Sit on my right hand” he speaks as to man, for they are not spoken to him that sits ever on the throne of glory, God the Word after his ascension from earth, but they are said to him who has now been exalted to the heavenly glory as man, as the apostles say, “for David is not ascended into the heavens, but he himself says that the Lord said to my Lord ‘Sit on my right hand.’ ” The order is human, giving a beginning to the sitting; but it is a divine dignity to sit together with God “to whom thousand thousands minister and before whom ten thousand times ten thousand stand.”
