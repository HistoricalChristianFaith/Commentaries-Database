“As beautiful as the special moon.” The experts in these matters say the moon gets its light from the sun’s rays and gets partial light when a small part of it faces the sun. When it is directly opposite and is in full view of the sun, it is completely lit up as though reflecting its face like a kind of mirror and leaving no part of its bulk unlit. The church of Christ likewise, therefore, the congregation of the souls made perfect in virtue, “with unveiled face seeing the glory of the Lord as though reflected in a mirror,” in the words of blessed Paul, “is being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, as a work of the Lord, the Spirit.” And it becomes so completely luminous as to resemble a moon, and a “special moon,” that is, full moon.

The bride, however, is not only “like a special moon,” but also she will shine in the future life “like a sun,” astounding all with its brightness. They will marvel not only at her light but also at her orderliness. There is nothing disordered about the Lord’s bride, nothing undetermined; she gives practical directions like a kind of plumb line, and regulates her own life by use of norm and rule.
