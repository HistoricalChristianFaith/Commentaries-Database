To know “the power of his resurrection” means to know through faith that he is the God and Maker of all, he assumed our nature, he effected our salvation, and he was raised again in the body that he had taken as he conceived the common salvation of all humanity. To know “the power of his resurrection” is to know the purpose of his resurrection.
