Paul says this in order to encourage the Jews. In fact, of course, God did revoke the good gifts which he gave â€¦ King Saul, for example, who received spiritual grace which later deserted him. Likewise Solomon, who received peace through the kindness of God, but after his transgression was deprived of grace. And then there are the Jews themselves, who always had their prophets to take care of them but who at the present time have been deprived of them.
