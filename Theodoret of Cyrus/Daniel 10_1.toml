To some it seems that Daniel is mistaken about the time and the one writing the book from the beginning puts “in the third year” instead of “in the first year.” And the proof of this is that the blessed Daniel says right after the beginning of the prophecy, “And Daniel continued until year one of King Cyrus.” For if the prophet had lived only up until the first year of Cyrus’ reign, the critic says, how could he have seen the revelation in the third year? Now I think that the former does not indicate the stated time nor does “the first year of Cyrus’ reign” mark the end of blessed Daniel’s life. For he does not say “until the first year of Cyrus the king” but “for year one.” As it appears to me, he intends to instruct those encountering the prophetic book that he survived until Cyrus, king of the Persians, who set free those Jewish captives.

Quite suitably he calls it “a word” and “a vision.” He saw holy angels; he also heard them conversing and from them learned accurately the things that would happen. And he says that the word was “true” so that all might receive the things about to be spoken without any doubts.
