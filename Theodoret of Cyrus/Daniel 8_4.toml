By “beasts” he refers again to the other kingdoms individually, Syria, Cilicia, Arabia, Egypt, calling them “beasts” on account of their being fearsome to those they ruled. So no kingdom, he is saying, could resist that empire charging to the north, south and west, nor could any human being liberate anyone from that power. Yet for all its appearance it met its end.
