The worthy Baruch accompanied the fleeing Jews into Egypt, as we have seen. Five years after the destruction of the city, he went to Babylon. Those who distributed the food of goodness dedicated themselves in any case to helping the weak and guiding them to truth. Once he had reached Babylon, he read the prophecy of Jeremiah to the deportees, and in particular to Jeconiah, who was taken prisoner after a brief reignâ€”and he was struck to the heart. Indeed, Baruch made them aware of the sins of the past, so they would know the reasons for their disgrace and would shed many tears and that each might offer money to send to the priests at Jerusalem to buy offerings to sacrifice to the Lord.
