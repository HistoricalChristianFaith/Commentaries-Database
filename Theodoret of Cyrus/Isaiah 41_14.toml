This shows clearly that the prophetic text applies to those who have believed in the Lord. It is a small part of Israel that believed, while the major part refused to. That is why Paul said that even at the present time there remains a remnant according to God’s gracious election.… As for the name “worm,” it fits very well. In the first place, this remnants’ appearance was contemptible. In fact, this is what the divine apostle meant when he said, “God chose the foolish of the world to shame the wise.” But Isaiah calls them worms for another reason. The worm that lodges in wood of poor quality will in a short time wear it down. Similarly, those who are athletes of the truth will, while hidden and imperceptible, destroy the error of the idols.
