He sends his news to everyone, both those who have been deemed worthy of ordination and those who are shepherded by them. By “those who are holy” he means those who have worthily received holy baptism.

He applies the term bishops to presbyters, for at that time they had both names. … And it is clear that he makes this assumption here also. For he joins the deacons to the bishops, making no mention of the presbyters. Furthermore, it was not possible for many bishops to be shepherds to one city. So it is clear that he is calling the presbyters bishops; yet in this same letter he calls the blessed Epaphroditus their apostle, … and thus he indicates plainly that he was entrusted with an episcopal function because he had the name of an apostle.
