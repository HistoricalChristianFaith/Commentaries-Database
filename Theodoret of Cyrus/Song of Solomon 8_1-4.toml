“I shall lead you into my mother’s house and into the chamber of the one who conceived me.” Now, what is the house of the all-holy Spirit (of whom the bride was born, after all) if not the divine temple, which resembles the Jerusalem on high, where they enter to speak with the bridegroom, having received the status of bride? And there, she says, “I shall give you some spiced wine to drink and some juice from my pomegranates,” by “spiced wine” referring to the teaching redolent of divine grace, as it were spiced and proving to be fragrant. By “juice of pomegranates” she refers to the benefit deriving from the fruits of love.
