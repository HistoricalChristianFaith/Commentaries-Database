Once again Paul offers them a spiritual blessing and surrounds them with the grace of God, which is like an impenetrable wall. This is how the epistle began and this is how it ends. We too may share in this grace, triumphing over temptations and, enlightened by it, following the right way free of all error. Walking in the apostle’s footsteps we may be made worthy to behold the teacher and by his intercession receive the Lord’s blessing and promises, by the grace and kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit belong glory and honor, now and forever, world without end. Amen.
