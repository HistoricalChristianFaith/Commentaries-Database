The “four heads” refer to the division of the empire that took place after Alexander. Four kings were established instead of one. The rulership of Egypt was entrusted to Ptolemy, son of Lagos; the realm of the Orient was granted to Seleucus; Antigonus acquired Asia; and Antipater Macedonia (although some historians say that Alexander’s brother, Philip, also known as Aridaeus) acquired Macedonia. The “four heads” then allude to the four kingdoms that arose after Alexander, and the “four wings” allude to the principate of Alexander itself, who conquered the four parts of the world. Moreover, Daniel said that “power was given to the beast,” because it had obtained those very things that earlier kings had not obtained. Nonetheless, also that kingdom, which was superior to all others, came to an end.
