We learned earlier that at the beginning of his [Nebuchadnezzar’s] reign, he advanced with the army to Judea in the third year of the reign of Joachim.… So most blessed Daniel, recalling the first year after the capture of the Jews, … now adds, “in the second year of his reign, Nebuchadnezzar has a dream.” He [Daniel] added this not without reason but that we should know the time with precision. This is like the divine ways of the prophets, noting the facts related to the kings, a sure reference to the number of years.
