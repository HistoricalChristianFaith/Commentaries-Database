But perhaps someone would say, “Why then did they flee, if they did not see the vision?” Most likely this fact is what filled them all the more with dread, for since they saw no one and yet heard a great voice, they likely all ran away in fright. Then he calls their astonishment not only cowardice but also the inability to see. These events resemble the things that happened to Paul on the road near Damascus. There he too saw a light that flashed around him. His companions saw nothing but only heard a voice. And then his companions likewise fled from the divine prophet when they heard only the voice, while he remained there alone.
