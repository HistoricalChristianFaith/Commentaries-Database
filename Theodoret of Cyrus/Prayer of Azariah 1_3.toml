Who would not admire the dignity of the tone of the wisdom of the introduction? It is not in prosperity and good fortune and not even in a favorable circumstance of life that it celebrates God the creator of the universe, but inside this furnace. The prolog calls him God of the ancestors, demonstrating his prudent judgment and announcing the virtue of the ancestors. It says, “We praise you, O Lord, that we have those ancestors whose God you intended to be called. You in fact have said to your servant Moses, ‘I am the Lord of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.’ ” This your name is worthy of praise and glory, not on just one occasion and a specified time but for all ages.
