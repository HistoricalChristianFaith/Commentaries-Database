He was also anointed in the all-holy Spirit, not as God but as a human being: as God he was of one being with the Spirit, whereas as a human being he receives the gifts of the Spirit like a kind of anointing. Thus he “loved righteousness and hated lawlessness”: this is a matter of intentional choice, not of natural power, whereas as God he has “a rod of equity as the rod of his kingship.”
