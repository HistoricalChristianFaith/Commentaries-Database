“If you swear, ‘The Lord lives,’ in truth, in justice and in righteousness.” In the sacred Gospels, by contrast, he made more perfect prescriptions than these: “It was said to the ancients, You shall not swear falsely: you shall discharge your oaths to the Lord. But I tell you, do not swear at all.” He bids Jews, being weak as they are, to swear by him so that through the habit of swearing they may learn to adore him alone. He also promises that if this is done, “nations will be blessed through him and through him will praise God in Jerusalem.” In other words, when they practiced true worship of God, many of the neighboring peoples would learn about godliness.
