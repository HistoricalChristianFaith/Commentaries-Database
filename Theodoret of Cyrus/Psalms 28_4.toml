Let no one think, however, that the righteous person is cursing his enemies: the words are a mark not of cursing but of a just verdict. “Grant them their due repayment,” he says, meaning, May they fall foul of their own schemes, which they hatch against one another. This is said also in the seventh psalm, “Their trouble will come back on their own head, and their wrong will come down on top of them.”
