Just as the work calls Solomon—our Lord, in other words—“peaceable,” so too it calls his bride “peacemaker” for attaining peace from him and being freed from the former conflict. The bridegroom’s attendants, then, on seeing her driven from the chariot and under attack, comfort her in the words, “Return,” peacemaker, “return, return, and we shall look upon you.” That is to say, “Do not be afraid of your pursuers but hold fast the doctrine, proclaim the message of the doctrine, have no fear of the chariot, do not be afraid of war, called peacemaker as you are. In fact, if you persist in your preaching, we shall see your kingdom.”
