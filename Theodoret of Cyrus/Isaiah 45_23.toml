“I am God, and there is no other God apart from me, the righteous one and savior. There is none beside me.” These words clearly teach us the homoousion. For if the Father is God as the Son is God, the Father savior as the Son is savior, the prophetic text applies these things univocally; it makes extremely clear that their essence is identical.… If the Father is speaking these things, the Son is excluded from these titles and is not homoousios. Or the Son is the one speaking and the Father does not have them. But if God is the Father and God is the Son and the Father is savior and the Son savior, that is why it is said in the singular that there is no other God and savior beside him.

“They will be justified in the Lord, and all the seed of the sons of Israel will be glorified in God.” It does not say all the seed of Israel but “all the seed of the sons of Israel.” The “sons of Israel” are those who are descended from Israel. Their seed is those judged worthy of salvation from among the nations. It is, indeed, thanks to those among the Jews who believed that their descendants received the seed of the teaching and harvested the fruit of salvation.
