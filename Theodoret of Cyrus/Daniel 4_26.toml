Having foretold the future in this way, [Daniel] offers exhortation and excellent advice and applies a remedy suited to the wound … “compassion for the poor.” In this he implies the insatiable cruelty with which [Nebuchadnezzar] treated his subjects. Do you wish, he asks, to receive lovingkindness? Give evidence of it to those who share the same nature as you; this is the way you will persuade the judge to cancel his threat and leave it unfulfilled.
