Do not think the second coming will be like his first: at that time he concealed his characteristic magnificence in lowliness and poverty, whereas in this case he will reveal plainly to everyone his lordship and kingship, no longer employing long-suffering but judging justly. As he said, “he will not keep silence. A fire will burn in his presence, with a severe storm around him.” Blessed Daniel had a vision of this: “A river of fire,” he says, “was flowing in front of him, his throne a fiery flame, its wheels flaming fire.”
