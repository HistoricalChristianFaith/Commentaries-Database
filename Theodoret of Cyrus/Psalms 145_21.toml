We have confessed that God the Word took not a body only but also a soul. Why then did the divine Evangelist omit in this place mention of the soul and mention the flesh only? Is it not clear that he mentioned the visible nature and intended to include the nature united to it? For the mention of the soul is understood of course in that of the flesh. For when we hear the prophet saying, “Let all flesh bless his holy name,” we do not understand the prophet to be exhorting bodies of flesh without souls but believe the whole to be summoned to give praise in the summoning of a part.
