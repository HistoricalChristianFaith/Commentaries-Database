This does not apply to Antiochus either. I mean that the disturbances did not drive him out of Egypt, but rather the decree of the Romans, which came from the west, not from the east. But as far as the antichrist is concerned, the prophecy says that once he takes Egypt, Libya and Ethiopia and subjugates them to himself, he will return, because he will be troubled by a certain rumor, and he will come in great anger “to curse and to obliterate many.” This is a hendiadys: “to obliterate” is to be stripped naked of godliness, and “to curse” is to declare that godliness is foreign to oneself.
