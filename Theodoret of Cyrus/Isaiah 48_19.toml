“I am the Lord your God. I have shown how to find my way so that you may benefit by traveling on that way.” … But since the Jews did not desire to pay attention to these commandments, by reason of their attachment to a fleshly manner of thinking, they viewed having many children as a sign of blessing.… Nevertheless, although you have despised my laws, I will consider you worthy of consideration and, once again, you will be called “my people.”
