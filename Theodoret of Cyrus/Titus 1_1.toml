The opening of every one of his letters is distinguished by the divine apostle with this address. At one time it is “Paul a servant of Jesus Christ called to be an apostle.” At another “Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ.” At another “Paul a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ.” And suiting his benediction to his salutation he deduces it from the same source and links the title of the Son with God the Father, saying “grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”
