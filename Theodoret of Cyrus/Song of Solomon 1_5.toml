The bride is saying this no longer to the young girls but to those taking pride in the law, glorying and boasting, and reproaching her not only for her foreign origins but also for her former superstition and the black color coming from it. Hence she says to them, “I am not only black but also beautiful: though once blind, I gained my sight, and though once clad in rags, I am now clothed in a vesture of gold, of a rich variety, enjoying the king’s regard. I attend on the king, displacing you for raging against the king, delivering him to death, and defiling the bridal chamber with a series of adulteries. So do not reproach me for my black color, nor bring my former vices to the fore: I am black, I admit, but beautiful and pleasing to the bridegroom.… I too am Ethiopian, then, but the bride of the great lawgiver, daughter of a Midianite priest, an idolatrous man. I forgot my people and my father’s house—hence the king desired my beauty.”“So do not gaze on me for my being black, because the sun looked at me; you will see me, black though I now am, made white, and you will cry out, ‘Who is this who emerges in her whiteness?’ I shall tell you also the reason for this blackness: I became black through worshiping creation instead of the Creator, and adoring this visible sun instead of the sun of righteousness. But I saw the difference between the one and the other, and forsook the creature to worship the Creator. So do not gaze on me for being blackened because the sun looked at me—or, as Symmachus says, fastened upon me. In fact, ‘I am black and beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem’: black as a result of the former impiety, beautiful as a result of repentance; black as a result of unbelief, beautiful as a result of belief. I was as black ‘as the tents of Kedar,’ which means darkness; I became beautiful ‘like Solomon’s curtains.’ ”

In the Song of Songs the bride cries aloud, “I am black and beautiful, O daughters of Jerusalem”—“black” in the sense of deceived, besmirched by the stench of wild beasts, and “beautiful” in the sense of awaiting for your arrival from heaven as Lord for the sake of my salvation. He suggested at the same time both the gloom of impiety and the charm given by divine grace.
