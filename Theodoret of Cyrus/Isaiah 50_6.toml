This whole recital is taught by the holy Gospels. For the servant of the high priest gave [Christ] a blow on the cheek; some struck his face, saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is the one who struck you?” Others spat in his face; as for Pilate, he had him scourged and delivered him to be crucified. So, all this he predicts in the prophecy to teach of his own patience.
