“Come down, sit on the ground, virgin daughter of Babylon.” Isaiah calls her “virgin” not because she was chaste—in fact she was corrupt and shameless—but because she was dressed in the manner of a virgin. “Sit down on the ground; it is not a throne.” You have been deprived of royalty, he says; you have changed place with a slave. “Sink down into the shades, O daughter of the Chaldeans, for you shall no more be called tender and luxurious.” You have lost your good fortune of former times; you do not revel in the misfortunes of others.… The one who has redeemed you has the name “the Lord of Hosts.” If anyone wants to understand this passage as applying equally to Babylon, one should recognize that through its punishment it has been spared from sinning more. Because Babylon no longer was in power, it no longer sinned and gained the benefit of avoiding greater sins.
