He calls the godly form of government “Zion,” that is, the church throughout the world, and “its towers” those devoted to virtue and imitating on earth the way of life of the angels, encircling and protecting it like towers. “Buildings” likewise, as we have said before, the churches divided among the cities, towns and villages: he speaks of them as one and many. So the inspired word, the grace of the all-holy Spirit, urges those to whom the saving message was entrusted to go around and move about, both to strengthen the towers with teaching and confirm its other force, and in addition to this to apportion care of the churches, as we have already remarked on the forty-fifth psalm. He urges it here, too: “take its buildings one by one,” so that one may care for this church and another for that, and be in charge of each by way of cultivating and exercising due care.
