After Ptolemy Philpator died, his son Ptolemy (surnamed Epiphanes) reigned. That is what he means, “After his years, they will make an alliance.” And he explains how they will make an alliance. By the king of the north he means Antiochus—not Antiochus Epiphanes but Antiochus the Great, who was the father of Antiochus Epiphanes. It was Antiochus the Great who was the contemporary with those Ptolemies.

But the marriage will not suffice to bring about an alliance. She will be returned to the one who had given her through those who brought her, along with the things that had been presented by her (for he says, “the one supporting her during those times”). Wealth was what had accomplished the strong and desired marriage.
