It should be noted with attention that he has not made mention here either of Israel or of Jacob but that he has given the name of “people” to those he has assembled from all parts and has deemed worthy of salvation. He has again called on creation to join in the rejoicing, since even for a single sinner who repents, according to the word of the Lord, the assembly of angels rejoices.
