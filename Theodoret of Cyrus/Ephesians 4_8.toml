"Therefore it says: 'He ascended on high and led captivity captive; he gave gifts to men.' Indeed, the psalm says, 'He received gifts among men'; but he himself gave them. Both of these things have been done. For by receiving faith, he gives grace in return. Also, the Prophet clearly stated, 'He led captivity captive.' For he did not lead us into captivity when we were free, but when we were under the power of the devil, he led us captive in the opposite direction and gave us freedom. Then he interprets the ascent."
