In saying “I know that I shall remain and continue with you all” he means: “I know that I shall escape the present danger, so as to be once again a source of profit and encouragement to you. So you will have received what you desire.” This prediction indeed came true. For he escaped the anger of Nero on the first occasion, as he shows in his letters to the blessed Timothy. … From Rome he went to Spain and took the gospel to them also, then returned and was only later beheaded.
