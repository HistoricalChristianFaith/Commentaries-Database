He is named Christ from being as man anointed with the Holy Spirit, and called our high priest, apostle, prophet and king. Long ago the divine Moses exclaimed, “The Lord your God will raise up to you a prophet, from the midst of you, of your brethren, like to me.” And the divine David cries, “The Lord has sworn and will not repent, you are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.” This prophecy is confirmed by the divine apostle. And again “seeing then that we have a great high priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to the faith we profess.”
