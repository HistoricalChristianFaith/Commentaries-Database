The holy prophets might themselves be considered as “many ways”; our Lord, however, is the truly good way. In fact, listen to his words, “I am the way, the truth and the life.” But each of the prophetic ways leads to this way, Moses the lawgiver hinting at this in his words, “The Lord our God will raise up for you from among your brothers a prophet like me.” David, king and prophet, and also Isaiah, Micah, Ezekiel and each of the prophets give a glimpse of this way. And as there is one way leading to the biggest cities that we are accustomed to call kingly and royal—whereas some paths do conduct people from both town and country to this one way—so there is one way leading to the Father, the only-begotten Son of God, while the blessed prophets lead people to this one way who choose to travel by the particular path they represent. The prophetic word, therefore, bids Jews to search out the prophetic ways and through them to discover the good way and travel in it.
