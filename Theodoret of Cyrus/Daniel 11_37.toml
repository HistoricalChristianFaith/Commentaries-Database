But we find that Antiochus filled Jerusalem and all Judea with altars dedicated to idols and sacrificed to Zeus in the temple of God and called the temple in Jerusalem after Olympian Zeus and the temple on Mount Gerizim after Zeus Xenios. How, then, could it be said that this so superstitious man, this man so entranced by idols, “will not hearken to the gods of his fathers”? Antiochus spent all his time doing the opposite of the antichrist: he revered his fathers’ gods, while he rejected the God worshiped by the Jews. These prophecies do not fit Antiochus in the least, but rather the archetype of Antiochus, of whom Antiochus was a type and a foreshadowing, who will vie to outdo all the kings before him in his ungodliness.
