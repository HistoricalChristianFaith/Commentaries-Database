From the beginning, [Isaiah] says, God has made announcements concerning righteousness. He made the covenant with Abraham in these terms: “All the nations of the earth shall be blessed in your seed,” and he [renewed] the covenant with Isaac, Jacob, Moses and David. This is what he has likewise announced through other prophets. “I, God, I AM the first, and I AM the future.” The One who gave the Old Testament, he says, is not different from the One who established the New. The divine nature is one, always the same and unchanging.
