What does Naomi suggest to her daughter-in-law? When Ruth heard her mother-in-law saying, “Our neighbor is a true man,” she was reminded of his great kindness and thought to want him [to be] married to her in law, so that she might keep up the memory of the dead. Therefore, she [Naomi] suggests to her that she sleep at Boaz’s feet, not that she might sell her body (for the words of the narrative signify the opposite); rather, she trusts the man’s temperance and judgment. Moreover, the actions corroborate the words.
