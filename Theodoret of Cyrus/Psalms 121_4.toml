Regarding the divine nature the prophet David says, “Behold, he who keeps Israel shall neither slumber nor sleep.” But the narrative of the Evangelist describes the Master Christ as sleeping in the boat. Now not sleeping and being asleep are two contrary ideas, so the prophet contradicts the Gospels if, as they argue, the Master Christ was God alone. There is no contradiction, for both prophecies and Gospels flow from one and the same spirit. The Master Christ therefore had a body, akin to all other bodies, affected by the need of sleep. So the argument for the confusion is proved a fable.Regarding the divine nature the prophet Isaiah said, “He shall neither be hungry nor weary” and so on. But the Evangelist says, “Jesus, being weary with his journey, sat thus by the well”;23 and “shall not be weary” is contrary to “being weary.” Therefore the prophecy is contrary to the narrative of the Gospels. But they are not contrary, for both are descriptive of one God. Not being weary is proper to the uncircumscribed nature that fills all things. But moving from place to place is proper to the circumscribed nature. When that which moves is constrained to travel, it is subject to the weariness of the wayfarer. Therefore what walked and was weary was a body, for the union did not confound the natures.
