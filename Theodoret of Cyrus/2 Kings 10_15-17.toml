This was also a pious man, and a relative of his. Indeed, his family constantly lived in tents and kept away from drunkenness. The prophet Jeremiah mentions them with praise, and history shows their piety. Therefore king Jehu, as soon as he saw him, blessed him, that is, greeted him. Then he asked, “Is your heart as true to mine as mine is to yours?” When he had answered, “It is,” Jehu said to him, “If it is, give me your hand.” Then, while he was taking him into his chariot, he said, “ ‘Come with me and see my zeal for the Lord.’ So he had him ride in his chariot.” From this it clearly appears that also among the ten tribes there were people endowed with piety, and thanks to them, God, who rules everything with wisdom, tolerated all the others.
