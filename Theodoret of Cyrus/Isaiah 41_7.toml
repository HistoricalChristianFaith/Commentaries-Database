Look, [Isaiah] says, what the newcomers to the truth say to those who are still held prisoner to the error of idols, to show them their impotence: idols can neither walk nor hold themselves up without being fastened with nails. As for the phrase “it is a piece well joined,” the three interpreters have rendered it, “it is a joint well made”; that is to say, the joints are well fitted. It has been put together by craftsmanship.
