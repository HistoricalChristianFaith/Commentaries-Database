“And the wise will shine.…” And the Lord says in the holy Gospels, “Then the righteous will shine like the sun.” “And from their many righteous deeds, they will shine like the stars forever and ever.” The most upright above all will be compared with the brightness of the firmament and with the light of the sun itself. Those who are less than these (that is what he means by the word “many”) will imitate the luster of the stars, sending down this light forever. So also Paul distinguished the ranks of the godly: “The glory of the sun is one kind, the glory of the moon another, and the glory of the stars yet another, for star differs from star in glory.”
