In these words the divine David has not left a testimony to his own righteousness: we hear him protesting the opposite, “because I acknowledge my lawlessness, and my sin is always before me”; and, “I said, ‘I shall declare my lawlessness against myself to the Lord,’ ” but he calls it justice in the matter before us. I committed no wrong, in fact, he is saying, against Absalom, or Ahithophel or those arrayed in battle with them against me. So I beg to be judged in the light of this righteousness and innocence and not in the light of the faults previously committed by me. I ask for judgment on these current grounds and not for a payment of penalty at this time for other sins.
