Just like grass, the people have dried up and their flower has fallen. God here foretold the salvation of the Gentiles and the sterility of the Jews. For by nature the human race is like grass, and the flowers of the grass are our pride and glory. But just as when the grass withers the flowers fall off, so when men die, their pride and glory are extinguished.
