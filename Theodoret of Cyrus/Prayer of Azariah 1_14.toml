You have not been giving false promises, O Lord. Rather, it was we who violated the agreements. Although we had become many due to the promise you made, because of our sins we were reduced to only a few. He implies this, in fact, when he asserts, “We have become fewer once more.” He does not, in fact, say, “We are few in comparison with all the other peoples,” but, “We have become fewer,” that is: We were beyond number due to your promise, but once we violated that agreement with you, from many we became only a few. Then he provides God with the details of the misfortune that had hit them. He does not, however, inform him as if he thought that the Lord was ignorant of what had happened but summons him to mercy through the enumeration of the misfortunes.
