For “it is I,” he says, who “am God the first, and I am he for the things to come.” It is he who has made us and judged us to be worthy of salvation, he who has freed us from the original deception, he who has promised us the kingdom of God, of which may we enjoy the grace of him who has saved us and to whom is due glory for ages of ages.
