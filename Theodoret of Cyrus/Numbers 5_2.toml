Why did he command these men, and lepers, and those with gonorrhea, to dwell outside the camp?He teaches us great things from small things. For if one who touches a dead body is unclean, so much the more is one who kills a man, because he incurs blood guilt. And if a leper is unclean, so much the more is one who perpetrates various forms of iniquity. And through the condemnation of one with gonorrhea, adultery is condemned. For if an involuntary act is abominable, so much the more is an act committed deliberately.
