Only let us put the rudders of our lives in his hands, and we shall encounter an unfailing providence. God’s guardianship will be surer than that of any person, for his are the words, “Can a woman forget her nursing child? Will she not have compassion on the son of her womb? Yet I will not forget you.” God is nearer to us than a father and mother, for he is our Maker and Creator.
