Blessed David promises to preach God’s righteousness, the truth of inspired composition, the admirable salvation and immeasurable mercy in a great assembly gathered by divine grace throughout the whole world. And redeemed nature itself promises to give this response to its salvation by flocking to church, moving its lips in hymn singing, proclaiming God’s righteous judgment, recounting his ineffable care and giving a glimpse of the truth of the inspired promises.
