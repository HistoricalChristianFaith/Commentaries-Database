Here he alludes to the antichrist, who arises among the ten horns, and he states that the antichrist will pluck out root and all three horns before himself. This means that he will overpower three kings of the ten who would reign at that time. And he calls it a “little” horn, as it was born from the little tribe of the Jews. However, he also calls it “eminent” since he would be noble. By its “eyes” he refers to its prudence and astuteness, by which he will deceive many. And yet he speaks of its “mouth speaking great things,” which refers to its arrogance and haughtiness.
