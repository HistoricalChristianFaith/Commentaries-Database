The great number of the Egyptians he calls the “sea.” If, however, one wishes also to see the Assyrians under this name, the explanation would hardly stray from the truth. “[Are you not the one] who made the depths of the sea a way of passage for the delivered and redeemed?” He has said that of the Red Sea: because it was parted in two, Israel enjoyed salvation. So he is recalling these events in order to invite them to have confidence relating to future events. The ensuing passage makes this quite clear.
