Who is as blind as the one who has moved away? Symmachus translates, “Who is as blind as the perfect and as blind as the servant of the Lord?” He says that although the nations are just as much in error, they do not deserve the same accusation. For they did not have the prophets guiding them toward the truth and were not deemed worthy of such attention. “The one who is far off” has the same meaning; he who has been called by God has left the service of God, preferring the worship of idols.
