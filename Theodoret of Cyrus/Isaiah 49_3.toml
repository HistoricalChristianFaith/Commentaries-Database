“You are my servant Israel, and I will glorify myself in you.” This is to be understood according to Christ’s human nature. For according to his human nature Christ is called Israel, Jacob, the son of David, the seed of Abraham, and so on. Christ is called “servant” since the servile nature God the Word assumed was the form of a slave. For “he has given him the name above every name,” that is, to be the Son. As God, Christ the master was always Son, but as man he became Son. For there is not one that is “that Son” and another that is “this Son,” but the one who is God the Son also became the Son as a human being.
