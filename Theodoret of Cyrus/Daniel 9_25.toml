Now, it gave Christ a second name as leader.… He is our leader in his humanity as “the firstborn of all creation,” that is, a new creation: “If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation”24—and as firstborn from the dead, so as to have, as Paul says, “first place in everything.” Hence holy Gabriel called him “Christ the leader.” To him from the rebuilding of Jerusalem, therefore, are “seven weeks and sixty-two weeks.”
