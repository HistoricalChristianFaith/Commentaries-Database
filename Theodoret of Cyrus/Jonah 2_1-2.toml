“I cried out,” he says, “to the Lord my God in my affliction, and he heard me. Out of the belly of hell he heard my cry.” “I,” says Jonah, “who previously thought that God appears to prophets only in Jerusalem, found him present even in the whale’s belly. And having prayed to him, I was delivered by his love of humanity.” He calls the whale’s belly “the belly of hell” because the beast is deadly. In fact, Jonah was already presumed dead. He survived only by God’s grace. Moreover, Jonah says that he was in the “belly of hell” because this is also a type of the Lord Jesus Christ, who was “three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.” It is especially surprising that the one who really tasted death said that he was three days and three nights in the belly of earth, yet the one who saw just the shadow of death called the whale’s belly “the belly of hell.” This was because the life of Jonah was beyond his control, while in the case of the Lord both his death and his resurrection were voluntary. That is why the Gospel calls the place of hell and death “the heart of earth,” while here the belly of whale is called “the belly of hell.” “He heard my voice,” says Jonah, since otherwise he would not be alive to say this.
