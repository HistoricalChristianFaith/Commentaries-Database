In all of what he said he conveyed to us the ineffable power of God: action follows his will, and by merely wishing it (the sense of “he took his position and looked down”) he moves the earth, undoes human nature, splits open the mountains and melts the hills like wax. In fact, he has not ceased doing such things for people’s benefit (by “passing” referring to his doings). Now in what is said he implies also the cross, which is the source of salvation for all people. On it Christ the Lord “took his position,” shook the earth, moved and split open the mountains, struck with fear the hordes of demons, and destroyed their shrines on mountains and hills. While it was from the beginning and before the formation of the world that he so decided, it was in the last days that he accomplished it.
