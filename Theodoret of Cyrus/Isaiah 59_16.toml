For the unjust deeds displeased the just judge so he did not call the workers of these deeds “humans,” for although being in an honored place they do not understand and are comparable to the unthinking beasts and resemble them.… In place of “mercy” the three translators have rendered “justice,” so as to say “he has exacted a just recompense on them.” It calls the operation of God his “arm,” while “mercy” teaches the usefulness of discipline. The God of all things disciplines for profit.
