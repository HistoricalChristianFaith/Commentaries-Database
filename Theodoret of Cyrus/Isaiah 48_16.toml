Since you have not believed the gloomy predictions, believe, then, at least in the prophecies of encouragement. For I do not prophesy falsely in dark, inaccessible places after the manner of the [oracles of] idols. But I know these things clearly before their occurrence since I am present to the events themselves and see each one. “And now the Lord has sent me as well as his Spirit.” It is the prophet who made this declaration. He says, “I do not speak on my own authority but because the God of the universe and the holiest Spirit has sent me.” Now [the text] demonstrates here that there is another person besides God, the person of the Spirit, so as to refute the Jews and the mad ravings of Sabellius. For [Isaiah] said, “The Lord sent me as well as his Spirit.” For Sabellius often taught the one deity of God.… He must also teach about the particular characteristics of the persons, sometimes that of the Son and that of the Father, sometimes that of the Father and that of the Holy Spirit.
