It is as a man that he calls himself “Servant,” for “although he exists in the form of God, he has assumed the form of a servant.” Likewise in the divine Gospel [Christ] says that he has received instruction as to what he should say and proclaim. “They walk in darkness, and there is no light for them.” Although the light has risen, as for them, they have clung to the darkness. “Trust in the name of the Lord, and rely on God.” [Isaiah] says, if you really put absolute and true hope in God, that will [serve to] sustain you and make you sure.
