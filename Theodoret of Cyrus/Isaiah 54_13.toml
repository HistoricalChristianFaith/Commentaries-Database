Symmachus translated, “The Lord who takes pity on you says, lowly one, who has not been comforted, I have mercy for you. For I have seen you wandering aimlessly, as if surrounded by the spirits of deceit that have restless thoughts.” … He calls godly public behavior a “city.” The marks of the saints are various. But all are equally pleasing in God’s sight. For that reason he calls them all precious stones, even if they have various characters. By coal is symbolized God’s burning love. Sapphire represents the person who hides his virtue, for the hue of sapphire is a deep one. By “jasper” … is designated, I think, the luster of miracle working.… Then Isaiah leaves the figurative way of speaking to put things more clearly: “All your sons shall be taught of the Lord.” He has called figuratively “stones,” the appearance of virtue. The peace of God is here promised. Paul refers to this construction when he says, “Like a skilled architect I laid the foundation.”
