In other words, this is the end of the end of all affairs of this life, all the empires of earth coming to a close and the eternal kingdom being given to the holy ones of the Most High, with those in charge obeying and devotedly serving him, since his kingdom is eternal and does not come to an end.â€¦ This cannot be applied to the Maccabees; instead of being entrusted with kingship, they led troops and conquered and met a rapid end.
