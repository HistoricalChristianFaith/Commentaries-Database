These things do not fit at all with Antiochus. He never gained power over Libya or Ethiopia, or even Egypt itself. He was ordered by the Romans to leave, which he did. Therefore, the three horns that the little horn uprooted must refer to these three nations. The antichrist will destroy three great nations [Egypt, Ethiopia and Libya] governed by three kings, and he will subject them to himself.
