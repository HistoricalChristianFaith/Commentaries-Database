The words I wrote a little before do not mean, as some think, that he has written another letter. For it is not with respect to himself that he says “I have written” but with respect to the mystery. For he is referring to “the mystery made known to me by revelation, as I wrote to you a little while ago,” yet it is this “about which I have just now written.” For this has been his subject from the outset right up to this passage.
