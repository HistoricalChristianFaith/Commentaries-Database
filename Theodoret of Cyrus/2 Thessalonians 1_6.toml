When Paul says “since indeed,” he means it as an affirmation without any shred of doubt. When we are in the habit of making an affirmation, we say “Since indeed this is true,” meaning “This is to be treated as true without any question.” Therefore God is said to be just, when, coming as the enforcer of the law, there is reward for us who have suffered for the faith and punishment for the godlessness of our persecutors.
