When the soldiers pierced the Savior’s side with the lance, what flowed out of it according to the Gospel writers? Blood and water. He called the Savior’s blood, therefore, the blood of a grape. For if the Lord was called a vine, and if the fruit of the vine is called wine, and if springs of blood and water poured from the Lord’s side and ran over the rest of his body to the ground, then the patriarch’s prophecy was reasonable and appropriate: “He will wash his robe in wine and his garment in blood of the grape.” For just as we call the sacramental fruit of the vine the Lord’s blood after the consecration, so he called the blood of the true vine blood of the grape.
