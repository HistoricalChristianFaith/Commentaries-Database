To the expression “your judgment draws near,” Symmachus has given the following interpretation: “Present your case, the Lord has said; bring up your solid supports, the king of Jacob has said.” Become judges, he says, between myself and the idols; produce your solid props or, according to Theodotion, “your firm supports,” that is to say, the idols. Let them reveal the future; let them inform us of [the things] that have happened from the beginning. I, for my part, have not ceased to do the one and the other. Through my servant Moses, I have even taught what took place before the creation of humanity. As for the future, I have revealed it through [Moses] and through the other prophets.
