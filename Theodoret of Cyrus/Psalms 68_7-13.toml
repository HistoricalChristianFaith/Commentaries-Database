“When you ventured forth in the midst of your people, O God, when you passed through the wilderness, earth shook and the heavens sent down drops.” Symmachus rendered it thus, “O God, when you went before your people, moving through the uninhabited land, earth shook and heaven sent down drops.” On the point of passing through that barren and uninhabited land, which had not yet felt the light’s ray, you disturbed the earth and shook it, and from heaven you sent down the shower of grace. Now, in the one case, this happened at the crucifixion. At that time the earth shook and the rocks broke open, and all the earth was disturbed on gaining the impression that the Creator of all was hung up on the cross; in the other case, after the return to heaven. At that time the grace of the Spirit came on the apostles, like drops of dew. Then, to teach Jews more clearly who was doing all this, he added, “at the presence of the God of Sinai, at the presence of the God of Israel.” The one who appeared to our forebears on Mount Sinai, he is saying, is the one who also shook the earth at the time of the passion to refute our folly and who made the gift of the Spirit.
