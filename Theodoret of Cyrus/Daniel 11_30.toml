“And those who arrive from Kittim will come to him, and they will be brought low.” He will ally himself with many Cypriots and other islanders (Kition to the present day is the main city of Cyprus); then he will set out against Egypt but return defeated and humiliated. “And he will return and become angry at the holy covenant.” He will spew forth against the holy covenant all his anger that came about because of his defeat. And he will show this anger in action, for he says, “and he will act.” At his second coming he will slaughter many, and he will make a treaty with those who had abandoned the holy covenant. He will accomplish every plan of the transgressors, that is, those who wish to deny that they are Jews and who wish instead to act as Greeks.
