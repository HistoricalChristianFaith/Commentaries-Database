Orthodox: The Lord God wishes nothing inconsistent with his nature, and is able to do all that he wishes, and what he wishes is appropriate and agreeable to his own nature.…
Eranistes: Nothing is impossible to almighty God.
Orthodox: Then according to your definition sin is possible to almighty God?
Eranistes: By no means.
Orthodox: Why?
Eranistes: Because he does not wish it.
Orthodox: Why does he not wish it?
Eranistes: Because sin is foreign to his nature.
Orthodox: Then there are many things which he cannot do, for there are many kinds of transgression.
Eranistes: Nothing of this kind can be wished or done by God.
Orthodox: Nor can those things which are contrary to the divine nature.… But not to be able in any of these respects is proof not of weakness, but of infinite power, and to be able would certainly be proof not of power but of impotence.
