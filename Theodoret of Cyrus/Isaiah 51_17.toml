He calls chastisement “the cup,” because it is stupefying like drunkenness. Of this cup, the blessed David has likewise made mention in the following terms: “For there is a cup in the hand of the Lord, full strength, full of a mixture [of aromatics]; and he has turned it from side to side”—for he chastises some, now others—“but its dregs have not been wholly poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink them.” The divine Jeremiah, in turn, has mentioned this in these terms: “Thus the Lord God said, Take the cup of this undiluted wine from my hand, and you shall cause all the nations to drink, to whom I send you. And they shall drink and vomit and become mad.” And to teach what he means by the name “cup,” he has added, “from the face of my sword, which I shall send in the middle of them.” Then he adds, “I took the cup out of the Lord’s hand and caused the nations to whom the Lord sent me to drink: Jerusalem and the cities of Judea, and the kings of Judea and their princes, to make them a desert place, a desolation and a hissing,” as is the case today and so on. Here also, God has therefore declared through the prophet: “You have drained the cup of calamity and emptied it,” that is to say, you have endured a very great chastisement, and you have had no help from the kings, the generals and the multitude of soldiers in whom you continued to put your trust.
