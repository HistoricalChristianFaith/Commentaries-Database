Behold what [Isaiah] has shown here, before indicating the road of righteousness. For it is thanks to all-holy baptism that “we are justified freely,” according to the divine apostle: “by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus.” It is this the prophetic text likewise allows [us] to understand: “And all that have no money, go and buy, and eat and drink wine and fat without money or price.” The divine Scripture often calls righteousness “money.” “The oracles of the Lord are pure oracles; as silver tried in the fire, proved in a furnace of earth.” As for those who live with iniquity, “call them rejected silver, for the Lord has rejected them.” …Here he rejected the sacrifices of the law.… The prophetic text teaches that these sacrifices gave no nourishment to the soul.
