He threatens the idols with destruction. He calls “the one who comes from the east” the righteousness that has awakened, concerning which he had earlier said, “Who has roused righteousness from the east?” And he calls the one from the north the church drawn from the nations, toward which came the one from Theman or from the “rainy country,” according to the other translators. For God came from Theman, that is, from the south. It is to this church that the Master Christ has revealed himself, finding it scattered by the deceit of the idols. He warmed [the church] with the southern rays and led it to life. Its leaders, priests and teachers have trampled the idols under their feet.
