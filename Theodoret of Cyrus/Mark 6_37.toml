[[commentary]]
quote='''
For if the incarnation was a fantasy, then our salvation is a delusion. The Christ was at the same time visible man and invisible God. He ate as man, quite like ourselves. He possessed from his humanness the same passions we have. He fed the five thousand with five loaves as God. As man he really died. As God he raised the dead on the fourth day. As human he slept in the boat. As God he walked upon the waters.
