Instead of “after a long time,” Symmachus has said, “Lend your ear, O Gentiles, [who come] from afar.” The text therefore calls [those of] the islands, the continents and even those who inhabit the extremities [of the earth] to listen to the prophecy. But the expression of the Septuagint, “after a long time,” should be understood as follows: the Lord of the universe promised to Abraham to bless all nations in his posterity. This promise he also made to Isaac and to Jacob. Jacob, in his turn, gave it to Judah as a blessing: “The scepter shall not depart from Judah, or a lawgiver from between his feet, until he comes for whom it is reserved, he who is also the expectation of nations.” Now, a very great number of years had passed from the promise made to Abraham until the call of the Gentiles. This is why the prophetic text says, “Listen, you Gentiles, after a long time.” Then he adds, “It shall stand, says the Lord,” that is, to say the word of the promise, for the promise of God is trustworthy.
