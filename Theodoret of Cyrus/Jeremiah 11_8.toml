When he was giving the law, he added this to the law, for he said, “Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things written in the book of the law, to do them,” and he also promises there and again here how he will deem worthy of all care those who keep the divine commandments. And he reminds them also of the things spoken to their ancestors and of their ancestors’ disobedience. For they turned their ear away, he says, and every one went in the direction of his own evil heart. And he says here “direction” not as meaning “uprightness” but rather the evil that arises immediately in their malice. For they have not turned from this evil but have journeyed constantly in it. “And I brought on them all the words of this covenant that I commanded them to do, and yet they did not do.” He gave them over to noteworthy punishments; sometimes they served the Ammonites, other times the Moabites and still other times other foreigners.…The phrase “a band has been found” means “they have banded themselves together and joined themselves with their ancestors and they travel down the road of their ancestors’ wickedness.” He indicates as much also through the things that are brought against them. “And behold, they go after foreign gods, in order to serve them.” They do these things in transgression of the covenant that was given to them. For this reason I will surround them with misfortunes of all kinds, and those who weep I will not deem worthy to be spared. They will not even enjoy any help from the gods who are revered by them.
