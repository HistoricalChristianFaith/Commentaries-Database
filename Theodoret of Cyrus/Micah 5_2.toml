Now this patently resembles the prologue to the Gospel, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; he was in the beginning with God.” It also resembles what was said by God through blessed David, “From the womb before the daystar I begot you.” This person, then, who was before time, who was in the beginning with God, who is God the Word, with his origins from that source from the beginning, receives his birth according to the flesh (the text says) in you [Bethlehem], making you famous and illustrious, even though unimportant among Judah’s thousands.
