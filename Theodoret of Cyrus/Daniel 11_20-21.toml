He is talking about Antiochus Epiphanes, who on his return from Rome succeeded his brother Seleucus. Seleucus (called Philopator) succeeded Antiochus the Great, since he was his son. When Seleucus died, Antiochus Epiphanes received the throne. He says about the latter, “From his root kingship will sprout, and he will put aside his readiness.” That is to say, he will imitate his father’s power and will be adequate to lay hold of the kingdom readied by his father.

He was in fact not glorious, seeming instead to be an insignificant figure, because he was kept under guard in Rome. “And he will return, and he will gain mastery over a kingdom by his cunning.” But, nonetheless, especially since he had been brought down to nothing, he will come with great advantage and a very large army, and he will overpower the kingdom with deceit as its helper, and he will use gross deceit all the more. The blessed Daniel saw this fact also in the second vision, and he heard holy Gabriel saying, “Guile is in his hand, and he will become arrogant in his heart. He will destroy many, and he will prevail as many are destroyed.” Thus, he says here words to the same effect: “He will gain mastery over a kingdom by his cunning.”
