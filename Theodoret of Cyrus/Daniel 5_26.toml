By “interpretation,” he refers to the meaning. “Mane: God has measured your kingdom and brought it to an end,” that is, he has seen you are unworthy of kingship, and he decided to leave you bereft of it. “Thekel: he was weighed in the balance and found wanting.” In this the prophet taught not only him but also us the lesson that nothing goes unweighed by God; instead, mercy and longsuffering are shown to people according to a certain measure and weight. Since, then, [Daniel] is saying, you exceeded the limit of lovingkindness, receive the divine sentence. “Phares: your kingdom has been divided and has been given to the Medes and Persians.”
