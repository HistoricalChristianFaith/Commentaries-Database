Hymn singing offered to God is of no benefit to us apart from faith in the Son. Since it was to the Hebrews he wrote, who were in the habit of honoring the Father alone, he felt he had to add “through him.”

He brought out the sacrifice of praise that is pleasing to God. To it he linked also that of doing good, which he was right to refer to as sharing.… Elsewhere the divine apostle says, “Our abundance supplies for their need so that their abundance may be for your need for a balance to be achieved.” Sharing, then, is also repayment: one person gives money, another returns a blessing, and the person in need is in the stronger position.
