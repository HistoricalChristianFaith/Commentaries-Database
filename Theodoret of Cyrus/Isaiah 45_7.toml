He calls “light” here the happy events—the cessation of slavery, the liberation and the return—and “darkness” the sad happenings—the siege, the subjection, the enslavement. It is I, he says, who am the author of these two series of events, of these and of those. It is I who made use of Nebuchadnezzar to inflict the chastisement and who have chosen Cyrus as the instrument for the liberation. And just as I am the creator of the light and of darkness, and [just as] I have produced each of them so that they are used for humankind, I have inflicted bondage on Israel in its interest, and I have made the gift of freedom by reason of my benevolence. “Who make peace and create evil.” He has clearly taught what he has meant under the name of darkness and of light: it is peace that he has called “light” and the events that seem bad “darkness.” So [God] has called them evil, not because they are evil by nature but because people considered them thus. For we have the habit of saying, “Today is a bad day for me,” not because the day itself is changed to some other nature but because in the course of that day some events happened that produced sorrow.
