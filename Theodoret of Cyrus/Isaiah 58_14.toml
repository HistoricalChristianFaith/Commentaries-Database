He teaches the manner [in which it is required] to rest: “Nor speak a word in anger out of your mouth,” he says, “and you shall trust in the Lord”; it is as though if he ordains to honor the sabbath by making an end to bad actions and clinging to the accomplishment of good actions. There you see why he imposes a double duty even on priests, for they offered double sacrifices; they were required to sacrifice the victims and to clean the meats, offer them on the altar, light the fire and bring wood to the fire to feed it. Similarly, the reading of the divine word was done in abundance, as was the chanting of hymns and the prayer. And all that shows that the law diverted them from practical realities to lead them to spiritual realities on the day of the Sabbath, for they could not act continuously in such a way, given that they lived in a too-carnal fashion and were entirely absorbed in the cares they took with the body. “And he shall bring you up to the good places of the land and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.” And [here is] the confirmation of what he has just said: “For the mouth of the Lord has spoken it.” The One who has made the promise does not lie, he says; he will undoubtedly grant you to take part in his beneficence, and you will enjoy the providence accorded to your ancestors.
