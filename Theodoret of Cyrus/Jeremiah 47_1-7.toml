Now he directs his prophecy against foreigners. He calls the inhabitants of Ashkelon, Gaza, Azotus, Gath and Ekron “foreigners.” He says that the prediction took place before Pharaoh struck Gaza, and he likens the army of the Babylonians to a flooding river swollen by rain and melted snow. Cities will be overwhelmed by this flood; their inhabitants will be destroyed and lament and be unable to bear the din of the arms and chariots.

He calls Nebuchadnezzar “the sword of the Lord,” for he does those things by God’s permission, and the impious pay the penalty for their ungodliness at one another’s hands.
