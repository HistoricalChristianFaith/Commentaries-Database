The divine Scripture designates under the name “anointed” not only those who are brought forward for unction but also those whom the God of the universe has singled out with a view toward [fulfilling] a required function. Thus, referring to the patriarchs who lived before the law, he has said, “Touch not my anointed ones.” Here, in any case, he has given to Cyrus the title “anointed,” in order to announce that it is [God] who has chosen him as king in such a way as to defeat the empire of the Babylonians, to make an end to the captivity of the Jews and to [re]construct the temple of God.
