"But what is 'ascend' except that he also first descended into the lower parts of the earth?" The ascent involves the descent. For since he had previously descended and procured our salvation, he ascended again. For the wall of the lower parts of the earth had called forth death. Thus, the Prophet also says, 'They put me in the lower pit.' And again, 'And my substance is in the lower parts of the earth.'"
