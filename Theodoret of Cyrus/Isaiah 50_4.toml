Christ our Master says this in a human way. For the rest, we find many statements of this kind in the divine Gospels: “And Jesus increased in age,” it is said, “and wisdom and grace before God and before people.” He calls youth “early”; thus, the prophet likewise taught this in a preceding passage. After having announced [Christ’s] conception by the Virgin, he had added, “Before he [the child] shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good.” The Evangelist declares something similar: “And the child grew and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was on him.” As for the phrase “the instruction the Lord gives opens my ears,” in my opinion, it is not pronounced regarding him but on the subject of the disciples who believed in [Christ], for he gives the name of “ears” to his hearers, that is, to those to whom he presents the divine words, that is, to those to whom he declared, as we learn it in reading the holy Gospels: “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”
