Instructed by this passage, the divine Stephen in his turn says to the Jews, “You stiff-necked, uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your ancestors did, so do you.” And also through the mouth of the prophet Jeremiah, the God of the universe has declared to them, “You have had the appearance of a prostitute; you refuse to be ashamed.” It is this shamelessness that [Isaiah] likewise alludes to by [the phrase] “brazen forehead.” The forehead of a brass statue does not blush. Similarly, you no longer blush when you commit evil or when you are confronted or chastised.… In this way he has described with greater clarity their spirit of disobedience. For they voluntarily refused to listen, because they did not even desire to hear the words of God.
