As God, Christ the Lord has kingship by nature, an eternal throne: “Your throne, O God, is forever,” Scripture says, remember. But as man, high priest and apostle of our confession he hears the words “Sit at my right hand”; it is to this the divine apostle referred by “throne of grace.” In my view he hints also at the lovingkindness he will employ in judging, adding the comment, “so as to receive mercy and find grace by way of timely assistance”: making our approach in the present life and giving evidence of unalloyed and sincere faith, we shall on the day of judgment attain lovingkindness.
