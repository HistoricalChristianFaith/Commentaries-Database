He foretells here the cross of the Master; for he calls the Master Christ “righteous,” he who committed no sin and in whose mouth no deceit was found.… “His grave shall be in peace.” For the righteous has been removed out of the way of injustice. He says this about Christ our Master and simultaneously lets us see the injustice of the murder and the victory that followed the death. For the death effected for us the reconciliation with God. He himself left his grave to ascend to the heavens.
