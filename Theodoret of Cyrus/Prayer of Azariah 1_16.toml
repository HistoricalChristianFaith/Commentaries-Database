Since, it says, your law does not allow the customary sacrifices to be offered in every place, we offer a contrite and humble heart in place of the rams, the bulls, the countless sheep, and we ask that this sacrifice be more pleasing to you than any other, since you are accustomed to freeing from all dishonor those who trust in you. This holy man does not pronounce these words about himself but was schooled by David the prophet, who in the psalm asserts, “If you had wanted sacrifice, we would have given it to you; you will not be pleased with burnt offerings: a contrite spirit is the appropriate sacrifice to the Lord. God will not refuse a contrite and humble heart.” And again, from the mouth of God, “Surely I do not eat the meat of bulls, nor do I drink the blood of goats. Sacrifice to God an offering with praises, and pay your vows to the most High, and call to me in the day of your trouble, and I will have mercy on you, and you will praise me.” And a little later, “You will honor me with a sacrifice of praise, and here is the path in which I will show him my salvation.” This divine man, following the instruction of such words, begged God to accept the contrite heart in place of every other offering.
