We shared in death with Christ the Lord through all-holy baptism, and after being buried with him we prefigured the resurrection, provided of course we kept faith firm. He referred to this by the phrase “first confidence.” Through it we were renewed, we were joined to Christ the Lord, and we shared the grace of the all-holy Spirit.
