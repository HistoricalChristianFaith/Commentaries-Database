“If my people listened to me, if Israel traveled in my ways, I would have reduced their foes to nothing and laid my hand on those afflicting them.” If they had adhered to my advice and followed my commandments, I would easily have destroyed their foes. “To nothing” suggests the facility—in other words, easily and without trouble I would have been able to bring about their ruin in an instant. “The Lord’s foes were false to him.” Aquila … put it this way: “in their hatred they will deny the Lord.” By denying Christ the Lord, they brought hatred on themselves, and by being false to him and to the existing covenants they made themselves enemies of the Lord. After the giving of the law, [Scripture] says that the people replied, “All that the Lord God has said we will do and listen to.” While their promises were of this kind, their words were the direct opposite—they crucified their own Lord when he appeared and received a penalty for their impiety, namely, eternal ruin. This was true not only of them but also of Arius, Eunomius, Nestorius and the devotees of their teachings.
