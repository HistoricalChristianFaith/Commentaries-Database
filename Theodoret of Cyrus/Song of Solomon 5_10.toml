The bride instructs the young women who had enquired as to the features of the bridegroom, saying, “My nephew is white and ruddy,” mentioning “white” first and “ruddy” second. He was always God, but he became man as well, not by abandoning what he was or being turned into a man but by putting on a human nature. So he is “white” as God: what could be whiter than light? Now, he is the true light, according to the Gospel saying, “He was the true light, which enlightens every person coming into the world.”He is not only “white,” however, but also “ruddy.” After all, he is not only God but also man. Now, the term ruddy suggests earthly; hence also in Isaiah the divine powers, on seeing him ascending from earth to heaven, pose the question, “Who is this coming from Edom, the red of his garments from Bozrah? He is charming in his vesture, overpowering in his strength.”
