It is clear that those who were seen are invisible powers, “sent for service,” according to the divine apostle, “for the sake of those who are due to inherit salvation.” Their natures are not seen, however, being incorporeal: he who is Lord of them and of everyone else renders them discernible according to need in each case. The divine Scripture clearly teaches us this, giving a glimpse of their different forms: Daniel saw them in one fashion, Ezekiel in another fashion, and Isaiah and Micah in different forms. Not that they have many forms, being naturally incorporeal and spiritual: the Lord of all when need arises gives them a form for discernment. This he did also in the case of Zechariah: he reveals to him the angel who is a leader of the people; St. Michael was this angel.
