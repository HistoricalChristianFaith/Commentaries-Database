He will lead again an army greater than the earlier one and will set out against Egypt, and he will do this near the end of his own reign. That is what is meant by the sentence “at the end of the seasons he will make his entrance with great power and with much wealth.” This doubling is a Hebraism; he wished to say that he would make a great entrance. This is the idiom of both the Hebrews and the Arameans, for they are accustomed to say, “entering he entered” and “departing he departed” and “eating he eats,” and so forth. The translators were rather accurate and followed Hebrew usage.
