When St. Barnabas and St. Paul took on the task of preaching to the Gentiles, they made an agreement with Peter, James and John, promising them that they would encourage Gentile believers to come to the aid of believers in Judea. Paul mentions this in his epistle to the Galatians: “When they perceived the grace which was given to me, James and Cephas and John, who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised; only they would have us remember the poor, which very thing I was eager to do.”
