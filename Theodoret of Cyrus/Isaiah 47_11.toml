Suddenly, [Isaiah] says, you will receive destruction and undergo the misfortunes that you do not expect. “[There shall be] a pit, and you shall fall into it; and grief shall come on you, and you cannot be cleared.” Symmachus and Aquila have rendered the translation of this passage as follows: “And a misfortune will befall you that you will not be able to avert,” that is to say, I will precipitate you into unavoidable misfortunes, and you will not obtain a pardon, for you have sinned beyond [the point] of being pardoned.” “And destruction shall come suddenly on you, and you shall not know.” For Babylon had not been expecting a change [of fortune] and had had no dread of seeing the situation reversed.
