This prophecy has three subjects. One subject, presented as in a sketch, is the rebuilding of Jerusalem that took place at the time of Cyrus and Darius. Another is like an icon “written” or drawn with many colors as it shows more precisely the lines of truth—the shining brightness of the holy church. The third is the archetype of the icon, that is, the life to come and our citizenship in heaven. The divine Paul taught this distinction: “The law contained the shadow of things to come and not the image of the realities.” And he calls the things to come the immortal and pain-free existence, the life unsullied by worry; whereas the image of the realities6 is the ecclesiastical commonwealth and its existence, which is like a model of the things to come.… For the painters have the reality that they copy to make their picture, drawing a sketch first before filling in the shadow with colors … the prophetic words apply to the church of God, which has received the light of the knowledge of God and is encircled by the glory of the Savior.
