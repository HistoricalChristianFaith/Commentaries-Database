Good fortune often causes the general run of people to forget their benefactors, whereas it is necessity that recalls to mind those who have treated us well; and while the person in good health does not keep in mind the physician’s competence, on falling ill he or she remembers having that complaint before and returning to good health thanks to such and such a physician. So too Nebuchadnezzar: when he consigned those holy people to the fire, he did not remember Daniel’s favor; but when he later had a dream and felt alarm in his soul, he remembered Daniel’s wisdom and his recall and interpretation of the previous dream. Hence he said he had God’s Spirit and was capable of interpreting every mystery, and he requested him to make clear to him this dream as well, obscure as it was.
