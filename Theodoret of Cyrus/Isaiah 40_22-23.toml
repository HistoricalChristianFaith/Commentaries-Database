It is he, [Isaiah] says, who has caused the earth to appear; it is he who holds it in his hand and who directs it. As for human beings, they are no different from grasshoppers if one compares them with divine power. Then [Isaiah] teaches that God is not only the Maker of the earth but also the Creator of the heavens: “He that set up the heaven as a chamber and stretched it out as a tent to dwell in.” For since the earth is like the ground floor of a house and the sky simulates a roof in the form of an arch and dome, [Isaiah] has aptly compared it with a tent. And after having shown us the God of the universe as Creator, the prophetic text indicates to us his ineffable providence.

It is thus he has brought down Sennacherib, Nebuchadnezzar and thousands of others. “And has made the earth as nothing.” For the power of the Creator does not even have the object of his creation as a measure, but only his will: “Our God has done in heaven and on earth whatsoever he has pleased,” not all that he has the power [to do] but all he pleases: for he would be capable [of accomplishing] works many times greater, but God has accomplished what he judges to be best.
