“The Lord is longsuffering, great is his power, and he will certainly not clear the guilty.” He does not suddenly and all at once inflict punishment, but only after exercising extreme longsuffering. You Ninevites are witnesses to this, practicing repentance and finding salvation, and then guilty of extreme wickedness and for a time not paying the penalty for it. But after putting up with people’s wickedness for a long time, he is accustomed to inflict punishment on the unrepentant (the meaning of “he will certainly not clear the guilty,” that is, he will not exempt from retribution the person whose sins deserve punishment).
