Having made these promises to foreigners and eunuchs, he predicts to the Jews the last siege that would be made by the Romans.… The Roman army was gathered from diverse nations, because they were at that time the masters of all Europe and had conquered the larger part of Asia. This is why the prophetic text says, “Come to devour, all you beasts of the forest.” Some, however, have related these words to Gog and Magog, without observing the fact that the latter were consumed in the mountains of Judea under the effect of punishment coming from God, whereas those who are now summoned are being urged to devour other people.
