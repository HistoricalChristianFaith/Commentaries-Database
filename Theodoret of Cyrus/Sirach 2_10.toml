“And God conceded to Daniel to find compassion and mercy in the presence of the chief eunuch.” Divine providence is, in fact, a consequence of our free will. Thus, as soon as I choose the divine will, I will enjoy divine help. The same thing also happened in the life of Joseph, as it is said, “But the Lord was with Joseph. He was a successful man, and the Lord poured mercy on him, and he found favor in the eyes of the jailer.” And thus it is also taught in this case that God never abandons or neglects even one of those who confide in him. For this reason also another prophet cries out: “Consider the past generations, and reflect: who ever trusted in the Lord and was put to shame?”
