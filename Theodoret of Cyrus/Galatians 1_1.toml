So that no one might suppose the Son to be a mere ancillary to the Father, finding the word through in this passage, he immediately adds “but through God the Father, who raised him from the dead.” For he has applied the word through to both persons, teaching that this usage does not imply any difference of nature. And the phrase “the one who raised him from the dead” does not hint at any defect in the Son’s divinity, for the suffering did not happen to the Godhead but illustrates the concord of the gospel, because it was not the Son alone who bestowed the mystery of the divine incarnation, but the Father himself is a sharer in this dispensation.
