If some had sinned while others had been diligent keepers of your laws, they would not have awaited this misfortune. But since their transgression was common to all and had been undertaken by all, Daniel quite reasonably says, “The curse has fallen on.…” By “oath” he refers to the one made in Deuteronomy: “I will raise my hand to heaven and I will swear by my right hand and I will say, ‘As I live forever, I will sharpen my sword like lightning, and my hand of judgment will be stretched out, and I will avenge.…’ ” And a little before this he says, “I said, ‘I will scatter them and make the memory of them to cease from among humankind.’ ” He is describing the curse that was uttered by the six tribes that were on Mount Ebal. So he is saying that the oath and curse that had been spoken in the law of Moses is actualized with us.
