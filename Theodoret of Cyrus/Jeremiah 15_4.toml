He forecasts what would happen after the return, what would happen to them under the Macedonians and the destruction that would be inflicted on them by the Romans. He brings out that the first fate would happen to them owing to the impiety committed by Manasseh. Yet he is not an unjust judge, nor does he require an account of them for othersâ€™ faults. He submits them to the evils prophesied as sharers in impiety and enthusiastic supporters of their wicked king.
