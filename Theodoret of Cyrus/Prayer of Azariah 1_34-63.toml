Since you are everywhere, they are saying, you fill the universe, embracing every creature. Having sung such praises, they call every created nature—not only those creatures endowed with reason but also those that are irrational and inanimate—to offer this common praise.

The divine Scriptures teach us with clarity that, with the exception of the holy Trinity, the angels and the archangels and every other incorporeal being has a created nature. In fact, David the prophet orders them to offer praise: “Praise him, all you angels, praise him all of you his hosts,” and adds explaining the reason, “Since he spoke and it was created; he commanded and it was made.” Moreover, in another psalm, “He who makes his angels spirits and his ministers a burning flame.” And the three young people rejoiced in the furnace when they composed the divine hymn, when, after having begun with that excellent and most fitting premise, “Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord,” they immediately added, “Bless the Lord, you angels of the Lord,” “Bless the Lord, all you powers of the Lord.”
