We dare to speak thus, since we have many testimonies of your goodness. In the first instance, the same name, that one for which we call you “Lord”; then, your immeasurable mercy that you employ in guiding all things; besides this, the agreement you made with our ancestors: in fact, you promised them that you would make the Hebrew people illustrious and worthy of praise. The prophet remembers therefore the names of his ancestors, recalling the good Lord to compassion by mentioning those righteous ones.
