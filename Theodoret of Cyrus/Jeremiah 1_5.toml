God’s choice of Jeremiah was not without basis: knowledge preceded it. Notice it says that God had knowledge and then he consecrated, for he knows everything before it happens. Now, he employed the word consecrated, meaning “he appointed.” Then God also mentions the task for which he selected him: “I appointed you as prophet to the nations.” Thus, he prophesies not only concerning the fortunes of the Jews but also the other nations. “I replied, O Lord and Master that you are, see, I do not know how to speak, because I am a child.” The prophet recognized the one addressing him. This is why he called him by a title having to do with lordship. When the mighty Moses was once speaking, remember, and wanted to learn the divine name, the Lord said, “I am the one who is.” He imitates Moses’ timidity by saying youth is not up to prophesying. The Lord, however, urges him not to put forward the excuse of youthfulness but to do as he is told.
