Paul does not simply say that he wants to come to Rome but adds that he wants to come in God’s will. For when the salvation of so many people was at stake, St. Paul left nothing unclear but acknowledged God’s will in his prayer, for it is only by God’s permission that we are worthy to deal with material things and to make choices. Do we not commit everything we have to the divine will on which we depend?
