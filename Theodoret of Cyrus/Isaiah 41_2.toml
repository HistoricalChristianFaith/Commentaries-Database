Of this righteousness, the blessed Paul has said in his turn: “It is from God that we have been given wisdom, righteousness, sanctification and redemption.” When this righteousness arose and pervaded the world, kings were dismayed, tyrants were conquered, all kinds of torments were suppressed; the persecuted overcame their persecutors, and, as if rejoicing in great peace, they ran the course that was set before them. However, the words “it will not come” are not to be found in the Septuagint.… They show clearly that righteousness will not come for all but [only] for believers; for the ungodly did not even desire to pay attention to divine messages.
