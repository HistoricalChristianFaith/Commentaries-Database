On the subject of the God of the universe, [Isaiah] has expressed himself in the following manner: “Lebanon is not enough to burn,” while here, to mock the feebleness of idols, he makes it obvious that the artisan has a need for wood to give form to the pretended god. Not only, [Isaiah] says, does he borrow its essence and its appearance from an outside source, but he even calls for much artfulness in order to obtain an image and to keep it from being moved.
