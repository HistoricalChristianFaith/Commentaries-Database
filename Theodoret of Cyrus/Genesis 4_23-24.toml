Some interpreters understand this not of two men or, as others fantasize, of Cain, but of one and the same young man: “a man I have killed for wounding me and a young man for bruising me.” That is, a young man approaching maturity. He escapes vengeance through confession of sin, and pronouncing judgment on himself, he prevents divine judgment.
