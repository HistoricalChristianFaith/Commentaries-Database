By “two,” he means the bravery of the adversaries and the desertion of the auxiliaries: while the former attack with courage, the others flee in a cowardly fashion. “Downfall and destruction.” He has again presented two calamities: that of falling and that of being crushed. For sometimes a person falls without being struck. “Famine and sword.” Again a double chastisement: if the first make a siege from the city of the outside, even harder to endure than the enemies was the famine that was within, annihilating them.
