The blessed Daniel openly teaches what our Lord says in the Gospels: “You will see the Son of man coming on the clouds of heaven with his angels”; and the blessed apostle, “For the Lord will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of an archangel and with the trumpet of God, and the dead shall rise immortal. And we who remain alive will be snatched in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.” Daniel foretells the second coming of the Savior. He openly calls him the “Son of man” because of that nature that he has assumed. He says that he is “coming on the clouds,” as he himself promised, so that he can show his power. He says that he “receives honor, dominion and the kingdom” from the Ancient of Days, although he is a human being. In Psalm 2 blessed David says this about the person of the Lord: “The Lord said to me, ‘You are my Son; today I have begotten you. Ask me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your possession.’ ” Blessed Daniel states the very same thing: “All peoples, tribes and languages will serve him.” And he shows that his reign will be without end: “His power will be an eternal power, which will not pass away, and his kingdom will not be destroyed.” So he adds, when he writes down this revelation.
