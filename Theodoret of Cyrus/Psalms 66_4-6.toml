Then [Symmachus] outlines what was done of old. “He turns the sea into dry land; they will cross the river on foot.” The tense has been changed here: he spoke of the past as future, whereas the others retained the tense, Symmachus saying, “He turned the sea into dry land, they crossed the river on foot.” This is the God, he is saying, who will grant us salvation as well, who of old divided sea and river, and bade our forebears cross without risk and accords the nations the crossing that they make when through the washing of regeneration they are reformed. In other words, just as at that time through the hand of the mighty Moses he divided the Red Sea at this point, … so now as well through the hand of the priests he renews the people who believe in Christ, while submerging in figure Pharaoh with his chariots—that is, the devil with his desires (the initiated know what I mean).
