Each of these phrases shows the religious spirit of the king, who complimented Daniel on his piety: first, he calls him not his own servant but God’s; next, he calls Daniel’s God “living;” then, in praise of his piety, “whom you serve with constancy,” that is, you were not prevented from worship under pressure of the law. The question “Was he able to rescue you from the lions’ mouth?” means, “Was it his will to render you impervious against the lions?” After all, he would not have referred to God as powerless after calling him “living.”
