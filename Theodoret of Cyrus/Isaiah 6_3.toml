Because the seraphim use the title Lord singularly in this song, but repeat “holy” three times (in reference to the Trinity), we know they are referring to the one essence of Deity. The praise “holy, holy, holy” properly indicates the Trinity, and the appellation “Lord of Hosts” indicates the oneness of the divine essence. Furthermore, the seraphim, in their song, praise the eternal essence for having filled both heaven and the entire earth with his glory. This happened through the incarnation of our God and Savior; because after the appearing of the Master, the nations received the illuminating ray of divine knowledge.
