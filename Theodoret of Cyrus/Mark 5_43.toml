For since eating is appropriate for those living this present life, the Lord necessarily demonstrated this by means of eating and drinking, thus proving the resurrection of the flesh to those who did not think it real. This same course he pursued in the case of Lazarus and of Jairusâ€™ daughter. For when he had raised up the latter he ordered that something should be given her to eat.
