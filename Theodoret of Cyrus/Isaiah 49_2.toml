Such is the word, the source of division that he presented to all people; likewise he declared, “I have not come to bring peace to the earth, but a sword.” And moreover, the divine apostle says, “The Word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword.” … “He has set me like a chosen arrow and hidden me in his quiver.” Similarly, Isaiah said this metaphorically; he speaks of an arrow that wounds the souls of those who love him. Each cries, “I am wounded by love.” The quiver represents the mystery of the economy of the incarnation.
