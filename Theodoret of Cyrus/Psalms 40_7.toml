The apostolic exhortation sings a similar note to this, “I urge you, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy, pleasing to God, the worship according to reason.” In place of the rites of the Law, the Lord required us to consecrate our limbs. Now, seeing your grace, he says, I offered myself to you in the words “Here I am.” This statement, of course, blessed Paul applies to Christ the Lord, and rightly so: he is our nature’s first fruits, and it is fitting for him in the first place to speak for us and in himself to prefigure in type what is appropriate in our case.
