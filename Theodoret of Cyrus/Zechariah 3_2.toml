This is also a type of our situation. Just as the avenging and wicked devil was very opposed to Joshua for being high priest and making intercession to God on behalf of the people, so in turn this same enemy was an opponent of Jesus the great high priest in the order of Melchizedek for taking away the sin of the world15 and wished to bring him down. It was, however, not Joshua the son of Jehozadak that rebuked him, but Joshua’s Lord; when he approached Jesus the Savior of the world, he was rebuked by him, as by his God and Lord, and hears, “Get behind me, Satan.”
