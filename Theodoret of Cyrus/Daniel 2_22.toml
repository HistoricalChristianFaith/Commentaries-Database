Such is the life of the devout, acknowledging that God is the source of understanding. He was the One who met Danielâ€™s needs at the right moment and assured him a safe harbor. And after being well supplied with that which was the best, Daniel did not prove forgetful of the gifts but sang praises in response to his holy benefactor.
