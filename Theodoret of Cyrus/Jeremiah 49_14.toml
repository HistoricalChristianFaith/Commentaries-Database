He used the phrase “he sent messengers to the nations” to mean “command.” It is also likely that by divine command ministering angels stirred up the enemy. Remember that the divine David also says, “He sent forth on them the wrath of his anger; anger, wrath and distress, a dispatch by means of wicked angels.” He calls them “wicked,” not as such by nature but as communicating punishment as a benefit. We, too, are in the habit of calling the calamities that befall us evil. Likewise an angel wiped out the firstborn of the Egyptians. In the same way, other calamities were sent against Israel when David took a census of the people. There are many other such examples you could find in the divine Scripture.
