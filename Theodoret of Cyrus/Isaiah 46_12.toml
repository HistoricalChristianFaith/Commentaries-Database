For though you are unworthy of salvation, since you have distanced yourself from righteousness because of your iniquity, I will procure salvation [for you] and will inflict just chastisement on the Babylonians. “I have given salvation in Zion to Israel for my glory.” For thanks to the salvation of Israel, all will learn of my power and acknowledge that I am truly God.
