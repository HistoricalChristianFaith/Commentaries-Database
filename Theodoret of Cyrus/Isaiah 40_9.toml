It is the chorus of the apostles that the prophetic text raises here. It is precisely for this reason that after expressing this exhortation in the singular the text shifts into the plural and says, “Lift up [the voice], do not fear.” In the same way, in his turn, Christ our Master said to the apostles, “Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul.” And again, after bringing them out from the prison, he bade them to proclaim quite freely the words of this life. Moreover, he calls “mountain” the summit of the knowledge of God.
