It makes sense, therefore, for the bridegroom to call the bride, mature in virtue as she is, “dove,” that is, spiritual and filled with the Holy Spirit.…The bridegroom encourages and consoles his church in its struggle with trials, “peeps through the windows and looks in through the netting,” and urges her to stand fast and to fly to him.…
He is saying, if you rest in the middle of the two Testaments and draw benefit from both, you will find there the manifold gifts of the Spirit. The bride, accordingly, by accepting the spiritual exhortation and lying between the lots, found the wings coated in silver through which she was bidden fly up to the bridegroom.
