Those who place themselves far from your care and choose to serve idols will reap the destructive fruit of defection. He calls idolatry infidelity here. God likewise says also through Jeremiah, “She went up every high hill and under every green tree and was unfaithful there. I said, after all this infidelity of hers, ‘Return unto me,’ and she did not return.” Again, “She committed adultery with tree and stone,” meaning, “Leaving me, her spouse, she served false gods.” Accordingly, here too he called the worship of idols infidelity.
