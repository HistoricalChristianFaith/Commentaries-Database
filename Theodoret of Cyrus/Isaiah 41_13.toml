When we hear the prophet say, “You, Israel, my child, Jacob whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraham, whom I have loved,” we do not think, do we, that the Jews are only flesh and not complete human beings composed of bodies and rational souls?… And [don’t we think] that the seed of Abraham is not without a soul and not without a mind but that it possesses everything that belongs to Abraham’s nature?… We confess one Son, who, according to the divine apostle, took hold of the seed of Abraham and brought about the salvation of human beings.
