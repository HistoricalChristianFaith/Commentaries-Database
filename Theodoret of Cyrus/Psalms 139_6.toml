Since water does not support horses, donkeys, mules, the tracks of wheels and the marks of wagons and chariots, which are all unmistakable guides to travelers by land, the Maker of the universe has given to the broad seas the disposition of the stars like road tracks on land.Praise the wonders of divine providence!
Oh! Ineffable love! Oh! unspeakable wisdom!
Who could marvel enough at the goodness of divine providence, at its power, its nobility in difficulties, its ease in managing awkward situations, its magnificence, its resourcefulness? Truly your knowledge was wonderful to me: “I was overwhelmed and could not reach to it.” That is my exclamation, too. If you listen to me, you too will recite these words with me, praise the Benefactor with all your might and render grateful words of thanks for his countless blessings.

And so loud is their proclamation that the whole human race hears their voice, “There are no speeches or utterances where their voices are not heard.” For every race and every tongue hears the proclamations of day and night. Tongue differs from tongue, but nature is one and derives the same lesson from day and night. Thus the same author, singing the praises of the Creator in another psalm, says, “Your knowledge was wonderful to me; I was overwhelmed, and I could not reach to it.”
