These words are a glimpse of the second coming of the Savior. It is then that he will give the laborers their reward. “He will reward each according to his works,” according to the word of the apostle. “For the Day,” he says, “will declare it, because it will be revealed by fire; and the fire will test each one’s work, of what sort it is.” This is the proclamation that the Lord has ordained to the holy apostles to make in their turn. “Go,” he has said, “to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. And as you go, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is at hand.’ ” One can therefore see that the oracles of the prophet are thus in agreement with the words of the Gospel.
