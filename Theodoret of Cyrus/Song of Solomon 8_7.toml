“If a man gives his whole life for love, they will utterly despise him.” Those bereft and devoid of love will despise the one giving his life for love; hence blessed Paul also said, “When reviled we bless, when persecuted we put up with it, when blasphemed we are encouraging, we have become the world’s refuse, as it were, everyone’s off-scouring to this day.” This happens, in fact, to people who are dizzy: though they cannot stand up straight, they think everything else is spinning around; similarly also people bereft of love blaspheme the devotees of love as stupid and foolish. Far from undermining love, however, this even rendered it more ardent. When reviled the apostles gave blessings, when blasphemed they were encouraging, and on becoming the world’s refuse, as it were, they claimed to be everyone’s off-scouring to this day.
