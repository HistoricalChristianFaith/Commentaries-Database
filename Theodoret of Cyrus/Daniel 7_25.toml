And he will think that he will be able to overturn completely their godliness, which will be flourishing at that time. Daniel alludes to this when he says, “He will change the times and the law,” that is, the way of life prevailing at the time. Then he adds, “And it will be given over to his hand.” That is, divine providence will permit these things. And he goes on to show the time of the deformity caused by those evils: “The poor will certainly not be handed over to oblivion forever, and the patience of the poor will not perish forever.”
