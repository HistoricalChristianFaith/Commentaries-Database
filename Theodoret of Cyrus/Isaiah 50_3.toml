“I will clothe the sky with shadows, and I will change its cover to be like mourning cloth.” He has done this and will do it. For he did it when he was crucified: “From the sixth hour to the ninth the shadows covered the whole earth.” And he will do it again at the time of the fulfillment, for it says, “The sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give off its light.”
