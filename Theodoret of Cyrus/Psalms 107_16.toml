Let the word weakness teach us that Jesus was not nailed to the tree as the Almighty, the uncircumscribed, the immutable and invariable, but that the nature enlivened by the power of God, according to the apostle’s teaching, died and was buried—both death and burial being proper to the nature of a servant. “He broke the gates of brass and cut the bars of iron in sunder” and destroyed the power of death and in three days raised his own temple. These are proofs of the divine nature in accordance with the Lord’s words “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.” Thus through the sufferings of the one Christ we contemplate the manhood and through the miracles we apprehend the godhead.
