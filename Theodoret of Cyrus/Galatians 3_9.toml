Paul has thus eulogized faith and shown what fruits it has from the gracious gifts of the Spirit. He also has shown that it is older than the law from the witness of the law itselfâ€”for the Old Testament describes the events concerning Abraham. Finally, he sets the law alongside faith, showing how it differs.
