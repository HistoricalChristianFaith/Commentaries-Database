“They walked about in the middle of the flames singing praises to God and praising the Lord.” These words provide an indication of the essence of their faith. For, instead of asking to be freed from the evil that had befallen them, they celebrated it, singing the praises of the one who was in control of their situation and who had allowed them to make this most honorable confession. There is a similarity here that can be observed between the old and the new. When the blessed apostles Peter and John were condemned to a similar fate by the Pharisees, they left rejoicing since they had been considered worthy to be punished for the name of Jesus. The blessed Paul with Silas, also being inflicted with the tortures of the magistrates of Philippi, remained in jail, bound in shackles. However, at midnight, the text says, “they prayed and sang to the Lord.” Thus also these blessed young people insisted on going back and forth inside the furnace offering praises to God.
