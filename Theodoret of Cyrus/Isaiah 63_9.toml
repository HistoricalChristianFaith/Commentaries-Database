For the grace of the incarnation is of mercy and good will. Aquila translates, instead of “virtues,” “hymns”; Theodotion and Symmachus render it “songs of praise.” For “make retribution,” Symmachus has “work benefits.” But the Septuagint is more accurate in putting “make retribution,” since we deserved punishment but received salvation instead of punishment.… He switches us to the opposite, giving us good things in place of bad.… He does not use justice only in judging, but he moderates justice with mercy, or rather good will wins over justice.
