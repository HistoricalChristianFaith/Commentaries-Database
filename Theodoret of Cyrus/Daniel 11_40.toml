We have often said that the ten horns that appeared on the fourth beast represent ten kings who would reign at the same time at the end of the Roman Empire. From these kings the king of the south will wage war against this one, who is called the king of the north. “For from the north he will set ablaze all troubles against the inhabitants of the land.” Antiochus, who happened to be a type of the antichrist, also was called the king of the north. When the king of the south engages him in fight, he will march out against him with a multitude and with strong forces both on land and on sea and acquire the victory. The Lord in the holy Gospels foretold these wars: “Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, plagues and earthquakes in various places. But all these things are the beginnings of the birth pangs.” Now that we have seen that the prediction of the Lord corresponds with this prophecy, we will be able to understand the verses before us.
