This, then, is what must be said whenever someone acts out of place, even when he seems to be doing something right, for no one may get out of line in this way. Surely, there was nothing unseemly in the fact that Uzziah burned incense in honor of God.… And yet the Word of God bars anyone who has taken over a task that is not for him. It teaches that everyone must remain within the order of his ministry, that only the chief priest has the right to enter the Holy of Holies, and this only once a year and in the state of hierarchical purity which Law demands. The priests cover the holy things, and the Levites “do not touch the holy things, lest they die.” That is why the Lord was angered by the boldness of Uzziah.… To sum up, The perfect justice of God rejects those who break the law. - "Letter 8"
