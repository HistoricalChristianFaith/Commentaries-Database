“I, the Lord, the first, and with the last; I am he.” There is no “God” “before” God, nor can we call “God” that which is “after” God. (For that which is after God is the creation, and that which is before God is nothing, and nothing is not God, or, one should rather say, that which is “before” God is God in his eternal blessedness, defined in contradistinction to nothing.) … For if it is the Father who speaks in this way, he bears witness to the Son that he is not “after” himself. For if the Son is God and whatever is “after” the Father is not God, it is clear that the saying bears witness to the truth that the Son is in the Father and not after the Father. If, [however,] one were to grant that this statement is of the Son, the phrase “no other has been before me” will be a clear allusion that he whom we contemplate “in the Beginning” is apprehended together with the eternity of the Beginning.
