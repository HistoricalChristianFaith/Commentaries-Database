We have learned who the Ecclesiast is, he who unites what has gone astray and has been scattered abroad, and makes it all one church and one flock, that none may be deaf to the shepherd’s kindly voice, which gives life to all. For “the words which I speak,” he says, “are spirit and are life.” This is the one who calls himself Ecclesiast, just as he calls himself “Physician,” and “Life,” and “Resurrection,” and “Light,” and “Way,” and “Door,” and “Truth,” and all the names of his love for humankind. … What does the Ecclesiast say? “I have become King over Israel in Jerusalem.” When is this? Surely when “he was set up as king by him on Mount Zion, his holy mountain, proclaiming the Lord’s commandment.” To him the Lord said, “You are my Son,” and “Today I have begotten you.” He says that today he has begotten the Maker of all, the Father of the ages, so that by applying a temporal term to the moment of his birth, the text might demonstrate not his existence before the ages but his fleshly birth in time, for the salvation of humankind.

We now learn the identity of Ecclesiastes who gathers into one what is scattered and dispersed. He makes one flock and church in order that everyone may hear the Shepherd’s lovely voice who bestows life to all. “The words that I speak are spirit and life.” [Christ] calls himself Ecclesiastes that he might be doctor, life, resurrection, light, way, gate, truth and any other benevolent name for humankind. What does he say? “I have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.” At what time? Was it not when God set up a king in holy Mount Zion to proclaim his precepts? Of him the Lord says “You are my son; today I have begotten you.” The Maker of all things, the eternal Father, said that he begot him today. Thus this temporal name does not refer to [Christ’s] eternal essence but to a birth through the flesh in time for man’s salvation.
