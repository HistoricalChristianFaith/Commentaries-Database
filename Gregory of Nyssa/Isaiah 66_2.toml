The prophet says in the person of the Father, “My hand made all these things,” meaning by “hand” in his dark saying, the power of the Only Begotten. Now the apostle says that all things are of the Father and that all things are by the Son, and the prophetic spirit in a way agrees with the apostolic teaching, which itself also is given through the Spirit.
