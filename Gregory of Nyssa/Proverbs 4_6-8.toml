If anyone is going to obey Solomon and take true wisdom as the companion and sharer of his life, concerning which he says, “Love her, and she will safeguard you,” and “Honor her, in order that she may embrace you,” he will worthily prepare himself for this longing, keeping festival in a pure garment, rejoicing with those in this marriage, in order not to be rejected because of being clothed as a married person.It is clear that the eagerness for this kind of marriage is common to men and women alike, for since, as the apostle says, “There is neither male nor female,” and Christ is all things for all human beings, the true lover of wisdom has as his goal the divine One who is true wisdom, and the soul, clinging to its incorruptible bridegroom, has a love of true wisdom which is God. Now, what spiritual marriage is and toward what goal the pure and divine love looks has been sufficiently revealed in what we have said before.
