The inscription, “for the octave,” therefore, that we not look to the present time, but that we look toward the “octave.” For whenever this transitory and fleeting time ceases, in which one thing comes to be and another is dissolved, and the necessity of coming to be has passed away, and that which is dissolved no longer exists … the hebdomad too, which measures time, will by all means halt. Then that “octave,” which is the next age, will succeed it. The whole of the latter becomes one day, as one of the prophets says when he calls the life, which is anticipated “the Great Day.” For this reason the perceptible sun does not enlighten that day, but “the true light,” the “sun of righteousness,” who is designated “rising” by the prophecy because he is never veiled by the settings.
