Once when he came to Saul, who was frenzied and out of his right mind, he healed him by soothing his passions with song, so that Saulâ€™s understanding returned to him again in accordance with nature. The goal, then, of the symbolism of the singing is clear from these words. It recommends that we achieve the subjugation of those passions which arise in us in various ways from the circumstances of life.
