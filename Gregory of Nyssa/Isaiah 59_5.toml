For in the cobweb there is the appearance of something woven but no substantiality in the appearance, for he who touches it touches nothing substantial. As the spider’s threads break with the touch of the finger, just such is the unsubstantial texture of idle phrases, “Not dividing his own essence by begetting and being at once begetter and begotten.” … Who is so distracted, who is so demented, as to make the statement against which Eunomius is doing battle? For the church believes that the true Father is truly Father of his own Son, as the apostle says, and not of a Son alien from him.
