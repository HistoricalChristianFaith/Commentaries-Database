But the one who has taken root as “a fruitful olive tree in the house of God” composes those words against the tyrant which we have heard in the psalm, saying, “Why do you glory in evil, you who are mighty in iniquity,” whose “tongue” is “like a sharp razor.” It was by means of these two things that [Samson] was led off, after [Delilah] had removed the beauty of his hair and cut off the “seven locks of curls” in which our strength lies. Now you will by all means understand the meaning of the spiritual curls from the number seven, just as Isaiah has enumerated the grace which comes from the Spirit in seven parts. If these are cut off, as happened in the case of Samson, the destruction of the “eyes” follows, and one becomes a laughing stock to foreigners when they are drunk.
