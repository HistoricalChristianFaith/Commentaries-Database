These are the things which the true Ecclesiast recounts as he teaches, so I believe, the great mystery of salvation, the reason why God was revealed in flesh. “I gave my heart,” he says, “to enquiring into and investigating by wisdom all that had come about under the heaven.” This is the reason for the Lord’s fleshly coming to dwell with humankind, to give his heart to investigating in his own wisdom what has come about under the heaven. What is above the heaven had no need of investigation, just as there is no need of a medical attendant for what is not in the grip of illness. So because the evils were on earth—for the creeping animal, the serpent which “crawls on its breast and on its belly,” makes the earth its food, eating nothing from heaven; as it crawls on trodden ground it always looks at what treads on it, “watching for the traveler’s heel” and injecting its venom into those who have lost “the power to tread upon serpents”—for this reason he gave his “heart to enquiring into and investigating all that has come about under the heaven.”

I think that the true Ecclesiastes next teaches about the great mystery of salvation when God manifested himself in the flesh. “I applied my heart to seek out and examine by wisdom all things done under heaven.” The reason for our Lord’s dwelling with men is to give his heart over in wisdom to consider his actions done under the sun. For man is not allowed to consider what lies above heaven just as healthy persons do not require doctors. Evil belongs to the earth. A snake is a reptile which crawls on its belly, eats earth instead of food from heaven, crawls on anything trampled down and is always on the prowl. It watches for man’s heel3 and injects poison in those who have lost the power to tread on serpents. For this reason Ecclesiastes gives his heart over to careful consideration of every activity done under heaven.
