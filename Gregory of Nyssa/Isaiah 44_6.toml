“I am the first, and hereafter am I, and no God was before me, and no God shall be after me.” For knowing more perfectly than all others the mystery of the religion of the gospel, this great prophet foretold even that marvelous sign concerning the virgin, and gave us the good tidings of the birth of the Child and clearly pointed out to us that name of the Son. He, in a word, by the Spirit includes in himself all the truth, in order that the characteristic of the divine nature, whereby we discern that which really is from that which came into being, might be made as plain as possible to all. [Isaiah] utters this saying in the person of God: “I am the first, and hereafter am I, and before me no God has been, and after me is none.” - "Against Eunomius 5.1"
