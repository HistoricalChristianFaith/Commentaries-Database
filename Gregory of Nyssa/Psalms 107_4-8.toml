Prophetic language affirms that the conversion of those in error is the work of God. For “they went astray in the wilderness in a thirsty land,” the psalmist says, and then he adds, “So he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to the city where they dwelled,” and “when the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion.” In like manner also the comfort of the afflicted is ascribed to God, Paul thus says, “Blessed be God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who comforts us in all our tribulation.” Again, the psalmist says, speaking in the person of God, “You called on me in trouble, and I delivered you.” And the setting upright of those who stumble is ascribed innumerable times by Scripture to the power of the Lord: “You have held me by the hand that I might fall, but the Lord was my help,” and “Though he fall, he shall not be cast away, for the Lord upholds him with his hand,” and “The Lord helps them that are fallen.” And the recovery of the distressed admittedly belongs to the loving-kindness of God, if Eunomius14 means the same thing of which we learn in prophecy, as the Scripture says, “You laid burdens on our backs; you allowed people to ride over our heads; we went through fire and water, and you brought us to a place of abundance.”
