There was the example of the patriarch Isaac, who did not marry at the peak of his youth, in order that marriage should not be a deed of passion; because of the blessing of God upon his seed. He continued in the marriage until the birth of his twin sons, and later, closing his eyes, he entered again fully the realm of the unseen. This is what the story of the patriarch seems to mean, in my opinion, when it refers to the failing of his sight.
