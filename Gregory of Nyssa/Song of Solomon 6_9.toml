“My dove, my perfect one, is one.” The Lord’s words in the gospel explain this more clearly … that in the diversity of their lives’ activities, they should not be divided in their choices of the good. Rather, they should all be one, united into a single good through the unity of the Holy Spirit.… All will look to the same goal, and every evil will be destroyed. God will be all in all, and all persons will be united together in fellowship of the Good, Christ Jesus our Lord, to whom be glory and power forever and ever.
