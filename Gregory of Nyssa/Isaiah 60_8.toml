Typically, under the leadership of the law (for Moses was a type of the law that was coming) Israel passes dry over that sea, while the Egyptian who crosses in its track is overwhelmed. Each fares according to the disposition that he carries with him; one walks lightly enough, the other is dragged into the deep water. For virtue is a light and buoyant thing, and all who live in its way “fly like clouds,” as Isaiah says, “and as doves with their young ones”; but sin is a heavy affair, “sitting,” as another of the prophets says, “on a talent of lead.” If, however, this reading of the history appears to any forced and inapplicable and the miracle at the Red Sea does not present itself to him as written for our profit, let him listen to the apostle: “Now all these things happened to them for types, and they are written for our admonition.”
