But we, even when we are told that God “only has immortality,” we understand by “immortality” the Son. For life is immortality, and the Lord is that life, who said, “I am the Life.” And if he is said to dwell “in the light that no man can approach,” again we make no difficulty in understanding that the true Light, unapproachable by falsehood, is the Onlybegotten, in whom we learn from the Truth itself that the Father is. Are we to think of the Onlybegotten in a manner worthy of the Godhead, or to call him, as heresy prescribes, perishable and temporary? Against Eunomius
