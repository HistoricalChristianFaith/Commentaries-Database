If we have learned, then, whom we should go to war with and how to carry on the fight, we must also learn the other part of the lesson, with whom the Scripture solemnly warns us to make a peaceful alliance. What is the good army, with which I am to join forces through peace? Who is the king of such an army? It is clear, from what we are taught by the inspired Scriptures, that it is the array of the angels of the host of heaven.

If you make a distinction in your mind between things thought of as virtue and vice, you will recognize the moment for the right attitude to each of them. Restraint and pleasure, selfcontrol and indulgence, humility and pride, goodwill and crookedness, and all that are regarded as opposites of one another, are plainly set out for you by the Ecclesiast, so that by adopting attitudes about them in your soul you may make profitable decisions. Thus there is a moment for loving restraint and for hating pleasure, so that you do not become pleasureloving rather than Godloving, and likewise in all the other cases, quarrelloving, gainloving, gloryloving, and all the rest, which through the use of affection for improper ends separate us from the disposition to good.

What truly exists is the one and only intrinsically Lovable, of whom also the rule of the Ten Commandments says, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.” And again the only thing to be hated in truth is the inventor of evil, the enemy of our life, about whom the law says, “You shall hate your enemy.” The love of God becomes a strength for the one who loves, but the disposition to evil brings destruction on the one who loves [what is] evil.

We must love one thing alone, that which the law of the Decalogue speaks, “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart, soul and mind.” There is one object deserving of our hated, the inventer of evil, the enemy our lives of whom the Law says, “You shall hate your enemy.” The love of God strengthens the person who loves, whereas a disposition towards evil brings destruction upon anyone who loves it.

Therefore the distinction between virtue and vice enables us to understand the opportunity which present. Ecclesiastes explains continence and pleasure, temperance and intemperance, modesty and arrogance, benevolence and maliciousness and anything else of this sort for imparting profitable advice. Thus we have a time to love continence and to hate pleasure that we may refrain from licentious behavior and be devout. Strife, gain, love of glory and so forth do not benefit love but prevent us from maintaining a pleasant disposition.

If we have gained knowledge about the enemy against whom we must fight and take up arms, we ought to learn about another part of the text, that is, when to make a treaty of peace. Who is the good commander? He enables me to win favor by peaceful means. Who is the leader of this army? The divinely inspired scriptures clearly depict the battle array of angels belonging to the heavenly army.
