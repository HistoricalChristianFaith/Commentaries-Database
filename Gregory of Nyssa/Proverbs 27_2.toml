If we did anything in those struggles for our religion that redounds to our honor in the telling, wisdom commands us to leave it to others to tell. “Let another man praise you, and not your own mouth.” And it is this very thing that our omniscient friend has not been conscious of in devoting the larger half of his book to selfglorification.
