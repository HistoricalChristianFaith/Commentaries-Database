For when the Arians say that the “only begotten” God, the Creator of all, … is the work and creation and product of God and therefore interpret the phrase “firstborn of every creature” to mean that he is the brother of every creature, taking precedence because of the rights of primogeniture, as Reuben did over his brothers, and that he is placed first not because of his nature but because of the rights of the eldest, this must be said to them first of all—it is not possible for the same person to be the only begotten and the firstborn as well.
