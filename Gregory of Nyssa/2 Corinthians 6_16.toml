The Dignity For Which We Are Made 

“Know to what extent the Creator has honoured you [the human being] above all the rest of creation. The sky is not an image of God, nor is the moon, nor the sun, nor the beauty of the stars, nor anything of what can be seen in creation. You alone have been made the image of the Reality that transcends all understanding, the likeness of imperishable beauty, the imprint of true Divinity, the recipient of beatitude, the seal of the true light. When you turn to Him you become that which He is Himself… There is nothing so great among beings that it can be compared with your greatness. God is able to measure the whole Heaven with His span. The earth and sea are enclosed in the hollow of His hand. And although He is so great and holds all creation in the palm of His hand, you are able to hold Him, He dwells in you and moves within you without constraint, for He has said, ‘I will live and move among them’ (2 Corinthians 6:16).” - "Second Homily on the Song of Songs (PG 44,765)"
