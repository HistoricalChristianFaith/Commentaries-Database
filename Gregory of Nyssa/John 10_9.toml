Where do you pasture your sheep, O good Shepherd who carries all your flock on your shoulders? For the one lamb that you took up is the entire human race, which you raised on your shoulders. Show me then the place of pasture, make known to me the waters of rest, lead me out to the good grass, call me by name that I, your sheep, may listen to your voice and may your call be the gift of eternal life.… “Show me, then,” she says, “where you feed,” so that I may find the pasture of salvation and be filled with the food of heaven which all people must eat if they would enter into life.
