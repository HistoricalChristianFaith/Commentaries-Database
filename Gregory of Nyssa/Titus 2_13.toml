In fact, the life of virginity seems to be an actual refraction of the blessedness in the world to come, showing as it does in itself so many signs of the presence of those expected blessings which are reserved for us there. That the truth of this statement may be grasped we will verify in this way: It is so, first, because a man who has thus died once for all to sin lives for the future to God. This man brings forth no more fruit unto death. Having so far as in him lies made an end of this life according to the flesh, he awaits the expected blessing of the manifestation of the great God. He refrains from putting any distance between himself and this coming of God by an intervening posterity. The second reason is that he enjoys even in this present life a certain exquisite glory of all the blessed results of our resurrection. For the Lord has announced that the life after our resurrection shall be as that of the angels.
