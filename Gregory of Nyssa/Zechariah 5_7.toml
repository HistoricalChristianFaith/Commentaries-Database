For virtue is something light and exhilarating. All who live according to it “fly along the clouds,” according to Isaiah, and “like doves” with their young, but sin is heavy, seated, as one of the prophets says, upon a “talent of lead.” If such an interpretation of Scripture appears to anyone to be forced and unfitting, because he does not think the miracle of the sea16 was written as an aid to us, let him listen to the apostle saying that he wrote symbolically, both for the people of his own time and “for our correction.”
