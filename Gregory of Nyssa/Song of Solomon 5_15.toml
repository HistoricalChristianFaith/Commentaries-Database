A pillar must rest on the foundation of truth. Truth is golden, and its bases are the bridegroom’s legs adorning his hands and head. The foundation may be interpreted as marble. We understand by the Song’s words that the body’s legs are marble pillars, that is, those persons who support and bear the body of the church by exemplary lives and sound words. Through them the base of our faith is firm, the course of virtue is completed, and the entire body is raised on high by our longing for God’s promise. Truth and stability guide the church’s body. Gold represents truth, which, according to Paul, is called the foundation of the divine edifice. … Christ is the truth upon whom are founded the legs, or pillars of the church. - "Homilies on the Song of Songs 14"
