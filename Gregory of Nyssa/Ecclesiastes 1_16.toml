What is the way back for the wanderer, and the way of escape from evil, and toward good, we learn next. For he “who has had experience like us in all things, without sin,” speaks to us from our own condition. “He took our weaknesses upon him,” and through these very weaknesses of our nature he shows us the way out of the reach of evil. Now note, please, that Wisdom speaks to us through Solomon himself after the flesh, and speaks about those things by which we may most readily be led to despise the things which are pursued by people.
