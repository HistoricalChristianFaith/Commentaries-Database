Knowing Christ as the “true light,” “inaccessible” to falsehood, we learn this, namely, that it is necessary for our lives also to be illuminated by the rays of the true light. But virtues are the rays of “the Sun of Justice,” streaming forth for our illumination, through which we “lay aside the works of darkness,” so that we “walk becomingly as in the day,” and “we renounce those things which shame conceals.” By doing all things in the light, we become the light itself, so that it “shines” before others, which is the peculiar quality of light. And if we recognize Christ as “sanctification,” in whom every action is steadfast and pure, let us prove by our life that we ourselves stand apart, being ourselves true sharers of his name, coinciding in deed and not in word with the power of his sanctification.
