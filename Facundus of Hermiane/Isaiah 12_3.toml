But after discussing this sermon of the venerable Bishop Paul, Saint Cyril addressed the people and said, “The blessed prophet Isaiah, preaching tenderly about future teachers in Christ, said, ‘Draw water from the fountains of salvation with joy.’ ” Behold, therefore, we drew water from the holy font. But I say that our prophesying teacher, having been enlightened through feasts of the Holy Spirit, was drawing our attention to the great and sacred mystery of the Savior, through which we who believe in him were saved.
