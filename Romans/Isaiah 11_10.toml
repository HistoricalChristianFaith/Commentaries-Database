Wherefore receive ye one another, as Christ also received us to the glory of God.  Now I say that Jesus Christ was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to confirm the promises made unto the fathers:  And that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy; as it is written, For this cause I will confess to thee among the Gentiles, and sing unto thy name.  And again he saith, Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people.  And again, Praise the Lord, all ye Gentiles; and laud him, all ye people.  And again, Esaias saith, There shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall rise to reign over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust. [Isaiah 11:10] Now the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, that ye may abound in hope, through the power of the Holy Ghost.
