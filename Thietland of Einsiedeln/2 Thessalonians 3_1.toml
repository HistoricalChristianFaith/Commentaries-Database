Concerning other things, brothers, pray for us 
In this act of humility he leaves us an example. 

so that the Word of God may advance 
That is, be completed and become acceptable. 

and be glorified, just as it is among you 
As if he were to say, because I cannot prevail with my eloquence and merits, pray that the word of the Lord may be glorified at least by your prayers. To such a degree the word of the Lord was glorified among them, that they might show that they understood their teaching was God's.
