Yet we must always give thanks to God for you
We should note that he had said this at the beginning of the epistle. 

brothers, beloved of God as if he should say, his unspeakable and immeasurable gifts. But not that those who he said to be about to be loved by God cannot in any way be mistaken. No one, therefore, disputed that they are of great merit; wherefore the Apostle calls them beloved in the judgment of him who can neither deceive nor be deceived.

by the sanctification of the Spirit and by faith in the truth
He added 'of the Spirit' because this sanctification is in the Spirit and is acquired in the Spirit.
