with a repose with us
Beautifully do they say 'with us'; to the extent that they who were imitators of the apostles shall have fellowship with them in the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore John says "that you may have fellowship with us," (1Jn 1:3) And because this is rest, it is conferred not here, but in the future, to the saints.
