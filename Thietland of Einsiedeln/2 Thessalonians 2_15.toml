and who has given us an everlasting consolation
For He is their Fater, He consoles them, and they cannot be his sons without consolation. And because there is consolation in prosperous lands, Paul adds "eternal" so that he might separate earthly consolation from that which is in eternal things. 

and good hope in grace 
Becase there is hope in prperous times, he added "good" so that he might separate earthly hope from that which is in heavenly things.
