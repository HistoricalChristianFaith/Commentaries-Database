If, therefore, you desire to be like these, imitate them with all your power. For the Scripture has said, "The elders who are among you, honour; and, seeing their manner of life and conduct, imitate their faith." [Hebrews 13:7] And again it says, "Imitate me, my brethren, as I imitate Christ." [1 Corinthians 11:1]
