Let us be of the flock of Christ, in all righteousness, and in all holy and unblemished conduct, behaving ourselves with uprightness and sanctity, as is right for believers, and observing those things which are praiseworthy, and pure, and holy, and honourable, and noble; and do ye promote all those things which are profitable. For you are "our joy, and our crown," and our hope, and our life, "if so be that you stand in the Lord." [Philippians 4:1] So be it!
