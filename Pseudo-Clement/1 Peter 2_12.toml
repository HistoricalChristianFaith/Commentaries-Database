For the beams of their light illumine the whole creation even now by good works, as those who are truly "the light of the world," [MatthewÂ 5:14] giving light to "those who sit in darkness," that they may arise and go forth from the darkness by the light of the good works of the fear of God, "that they may see our good works and glorify our Father who is in heaven."
