Yes, if we do the will of Christ, we shall find rest, but if not, nothing will save us from eternal punishment, if we fail to heed his commands. Furthermore, the Scripture also says in Ezekiel, “Though Noah and Jacob and Daniel should rise, they shall not save their children in captivity.” If even such upright men as these cannot save their children by their uprightness, what assurance have we that we shall enter God’s kingdom if we fail to keep our baptism pure and undefiled? Or who will plead for us if we are not found to have holy and upright deeds?
