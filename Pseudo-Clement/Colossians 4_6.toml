And, "If a man speak, let him speak in the words of God." [1 Peter 4:11] And, "If there is in you understanding, give an answer to your brother but if not, put your hand on your mouth." [Sirach 5:14] For, "at one time it is proper to keep silence, and at another you to speak." [Ecclesiastes 3:7] And again it says "When a man speaks in season, it is honourable to him." [Proverbs 25:11] And again it says: "Let your speech be seasoned with grace. For it is required of a man to know how to give an answer to every one in season." For "he that utters whatsoever comes to his mouth, that man produces strife; and he that utters a superfluity of words increases vexation; and he that is hasty with his lips falls into evil. For because of the unruliness of the tongue comes anger; but the perfect man keeps watch over his tongue, and loves his soul's life."
