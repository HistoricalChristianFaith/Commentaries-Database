For virginity of such a kind is impure, and disowned by all good works. For "every tree whatsoever is known from its fruits." "See that you understand what I say: God will give you understanding." [2 Timothy 2:7] For whosoever engages before God to preserve sanctity must be girded with all the holy power of God. And, if with true fear he crucify his body, he for the sake of the fear of God excuses himself from that word in which the Scripture has said: "Be fruitful, and multiply," [Genesis 1:28] and shuns all the display, and care, and sensuality, and fascination of this world, and its revelries and its drunkenness, and all its luxury and ease, and withdraws from the entire life of this world, and from its snares, and nets, and hindrances; and, while you walk upon the earth, be zealous that your work and your business be in heaven.
