For these are they "who by good words and fair speeches lead astray the hearts of the simple, and, while offering them blessings, lead them astray." [Romans 16:17-19] Let us, therefore, fear the judgment which awaits teachers. For a severe judgment will those teachers receive "who teach, but do not," [Matthew 23:3] and those who take upon them the name of Christ falsely, and say: We teach the truth, and yet go wandering about idly, and exalt themselves, and make their boast in the mind of the flesh. [Colossians 2:18]
