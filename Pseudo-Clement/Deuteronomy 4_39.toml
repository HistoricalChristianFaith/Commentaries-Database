See how by some ineffable virtue the Scripture, opposing the future errors of those who affirm that either in heaven or on earth there is any god besides the God of the Jews, decides thus: “The Lord your God is one God, in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and besides him there is none else.” How then have you dared to say that there is any god besides him who is God of the Jews?
