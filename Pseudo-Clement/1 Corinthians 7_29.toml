Let us expect, therefore, hour by hour, the kingdom of God in love and righteousness, since we know not the day of the appearing of God. For the Lord Himself, being asked by one when His kingdom would come, replied, "When two shall be one, that which is without as that which is within, and the male with the female, neither male nor female." Now, two are one when we speak the truth one to another, and there is unfeignedly one soul in two bodies. And "that which is without as" that which is within means this: He calls the soul "that which is within," and the body "that which is without." As, then, your body is visible to sight, so also let your soul be manifest by good works. And "the male, with the female, neither male nor female," this He says, that brother seeing sister may have no thought concerning her as female, and that she may have no thought concerning him as male. "If you do these things," says He, "the kingdom of my Father shall come." [1 Corinthians 7:29]
