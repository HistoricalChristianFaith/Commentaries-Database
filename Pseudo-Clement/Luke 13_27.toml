And it is not fitting that we should fear men, but rather God. For this reason, if we should do such [wicked] things, the Lord has said, "Even though you were gathered together to me in my very bosom, yet if you were not to keep my commandments, I would cast you off, and say unto you, Depart from me; I know you not whence you are, you workers of iniquity."
