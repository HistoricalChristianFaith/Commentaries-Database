Wherefore, brethren, by doing the will of the Father, and keeping the flesh holy, and observing the commandments of the Lord, we shall obtain eternal life. For the Lord says in the Gospel, "If you have not kept that which was small, who will commit to you the great? For I say unto you, that he that is faithful in that which is least, is faithful also in much." [LukeÂ 16:10-12] This, then, is what He means: "Keep the flesh holy and the seal undefiled, that you may receive eternal life."
