This is also comely and helpful to the servants of God, because they act according to the injunctions of our Lord, who has said: "I was sick, and you visited Me, and so on." And this is comely and right and just, that we visit our neighbours for the sake of God with all seemliness of manner and purity of behaviour; as the Apostle has said: "Who is sick, and I am not sick? Who is offended, and I am not offended?" [2 Corinthians 11:29]
