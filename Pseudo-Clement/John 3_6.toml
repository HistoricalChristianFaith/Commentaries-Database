Every man with whom are these and such like things — every such man is of the flesh. For, "he that is born of the flesh is flesh; and he that is of the earth speaks of the earth," [John 3:6, 31] and his thoughts are of the earth. And "the mind of the flesh is enmity towards God. For it does not submit itself to the law of God; for it cannot do so," [Romans 8:7] because it is in the flesh, "in which dwells no good," [Romans 7:18] because the Spirit of God is not in it.
