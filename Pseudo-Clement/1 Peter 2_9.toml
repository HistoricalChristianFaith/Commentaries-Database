For all who see you will "acknowledge that you are the seed which the Lord has blessed;" [Isaiah 61:9] in very deed a seed honourable and holy, and "a priestly kingdom, a holy people, the people of the inheritance," [1 Peter 2:9] the heirs of the promises of God; of things which do not decay, nor wither; of "that which eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and which has not come up into the heart of man; of that which God has prepared for those who love Him and keep His commandments." [1 Corinthians 2:9]
