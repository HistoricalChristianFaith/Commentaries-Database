On this account, therefore, He said, 'I have come to send fire on the earth; and how I wish that it were kindled!' [LukeÂ 12:49] There is therefore a certain fight, which is to be fought by us in this life; for the word of truth and knowledge necessarily separates men from error and ignorance, as we have often seen putrified and dead flesh in the body separated by the cutting knife from its connection with the living members.
