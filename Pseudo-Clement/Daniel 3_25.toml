Nebuchadnezzar, having ordered the three men to be cast into fire, saw a fourth when he looked into the furnace and said, “I see the fourth as the Son of God.” He was impious and yet saw apparitions, visions and dreams. Thus, we cannot infer with absolute certainty that the one who has seen visions and dreams and apparitions is truly impious. To be sure, for the devout person, the truth gushes up natural and pure in his mind, and not by way of dreams.
