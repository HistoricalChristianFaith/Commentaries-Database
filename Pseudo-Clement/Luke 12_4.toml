And Peter answered and said to Him, "What, then, if the wolves shall tear in pieces the lambs?" Jesus said to Peter, "The lambs have no cause after they are dead to fear the wolves; and in like manner, fear not them that kill you, and can do nothing more unto you; but fear Him who, after you are dead, has power over both soul and body to cast them into hell-fire."
