Hope is not in the fading flower of the field.
For just as no one is able to eat the fruit of the branch
Unless the branch remains in the vine which brings
Sap to the leaves from the root and fills the grapes with must—
So also those who are barren in virtue and without fruit
Shall be fuel for the perpetual fire: those who leave the vine
Dare to put their faith in the immoderate liberty of the leaves,
So that their fruitfulness is not dependent on the fruitfulness of Christ:
And even more, they believe they are able to excel on their own,
As if God is not the author of the virtues that please him.…
[But] why would they be ashamed, especially in this valley of tears,
If their power came from God, that they have a minimum of mortal works,
When it is nothing but sin which has destroyed
Liberty to which alone evil deeds recur?
And yet, when we focus the mind on holy acts,
When a chaste mind refuses carnal desires,
When we do not give in to temptations, and through harsh
Vexing punishments, we remain in our hearts unyielding;
Then we are acting freely; but with a freedom redeemed,
And over which God is ruler as light from the highest light, [there is]
Life, health, virtue, wisdom: It is the grace of Christ
By which freedom runs, rejoices, endures, takes care, chooses, stands,
Believes, hopes, loves, is cleansed and is justified.
For if we are right in anything we do, Lord, we do it only with your help;
You move hearts, you command prayers—those you want to grant you bestow, bestowing
Lavishly and producing merit from merits and enriching the gifts of your crown.
But this does not mean I should diminish my care and become lax in the pursuit of virtue, or
Become complacent by letting mental apathy hold sway,
Because the good works of the saints are yours,
And whatever in them is pure or strong, depends on you:
So that none of the actions of human beings is seen as occurring entirely apart from your will:
For without you what is achieved by the will except to be exiled far away from you?
The paths are always precipitous and the ways twisting
When advancing alone: When our will is exhausted, you are kind; when feeble
You lift it up, you carry it back, you keep it warm, you watch over it and provide it with dignity.
Then it will make rapid progress, its eyes actually seeing, its freedom free, its wisdom wise,
Its justice just, its virtue strong and its senses healed.
