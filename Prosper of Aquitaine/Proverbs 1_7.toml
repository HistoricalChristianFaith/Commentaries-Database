Since, therefore, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, and this virtue can be had without wisdom, to whom belongs the beginning of fear? The blessed apostle Peter says, “Grace to you and peace be accomplished in the knowledge of God, and of Christ Jesus our Lord,” who has now given “us all things of his divine power, which appertain to life and godliness.” Does he say, “Who has excited in us by his help the seeds of virtues which we had naturally implanted”? Rather, he says, “Who has now given us all things which pertain to life and godliness.” And in saying this, of what virtue has he placed the beginning in nature, which was not conferred by him who gave all things? Wherefore, St. Paul also says, “For what have you that you have not received? And if you have received, why do you glory as if you had not received?”
