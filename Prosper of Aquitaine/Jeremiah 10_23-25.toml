Unless God works in us, we cannot be partakers of any virtue. For indeed, without this Good, nothing is good. Without this Light, nothing is bright. Without this Wisdom, nothing is wise. Without this Justice, nothing is right. For the Lord says through the mouth of Isaiah, “I am, I am the Lord, and there is no one besides me who saves,” and through Jeremiah, “I know, O Lord, that the way of a person is not in him. Neither is it in a person to direct his way.”

Jeremiah, explaining that humankind receives wisdom from God, states, “I know, O Lord, that the way of a person is not his. Neither is it of a person … to direct his way.” Again the Lord proclaims through the same prophet that God effects the conversion of a heart to him and says, “I will bring them again into this land. And I will build them up again and not pull them down. And I will plant them and pluck them up. And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the Lord. And they shall be my people and I will be their God, because they shall return to me with whole heart.”
