“The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” This fear, which results from some type of frightening experience, renders one willing who began by being previously afraid, and not only willing but also wise. For thus it is written, “Happy are those to whom it has been granted to have the fear of God.” What could possibly render the soul more blessed than this fear that is the parent and master of wisdom? The will is filled with the devotion that springs from wisdom and progresses from that same fear with which it began and that provoked grace. When, therefore, this fear becomes instilled in us with the force of great terror, this does not mean that it extinguishes reason or lessens our intelligence; rather, the haze that has hovered over our mind is removed, yes, and the will that was at first depraved and taken prisoner becomes right and free. For just as the spirit does not receive virtue if it has not received the beam of the true light, so grace does not confer anything to the one on whom it calls if the eyes of the will have not been opened.
