They learn good and do evil who, it is written, confess God by words and deny him by deeds. They, as the apostle says, repose in the law and know its intent and approve of those things that are the more profitable. They have the form of knowledge and of truth in the law. They preach that they must not steal, yet they do steal. They read that they must not commit adultery, yet they commit it. They glory in the law, yet by transgression of the law they dishonor God. Therefore, for this very reason, Christians are worse because they should be better. They do not practice what they preach, and they struggle against their faith by their morals. All the more blameworthy is evil which the label of goodness accuses, and the holy name is the crime of an unholy person. Hence, the Savior also said in the Apocalypse to the lukewarm Christian: “Would that you were cold or hot. But now because you are lukewarm, I will begin to vomit you out of my mouth.”
