God spoke to sinners through his prophet, because “the Lord remembered these things and,” he says, “he ascended over his heart, and the Lord was not able to bear more because of the evil of your endeavors and the abominations that you have done; and your land is made into a desolation, a wonder and a curse.” Through these things, therefore, it has already happened that the greater part of the Roman world is become a desolation, a wonder and a curse.
