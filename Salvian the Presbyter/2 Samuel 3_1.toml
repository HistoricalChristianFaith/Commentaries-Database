There is no need for us to discuss this point further, since the judgment of God is evident. Events prove what God judges about us and about the Goths and Vandals. They increase daily; we decrease daily. They prosper; we are humbled. They flourish; we are drying up. Truly there is said about us that saying which the divine Word spoke of Saul and David: “because David was strong and always growing more robust; the house of Saul grew less daily.” As the prophet says, “For he is just, the Lord is just and his judgment is right.”
