What about this saying: “He who shall have persevered to the end, shall be saved,” or that oracle of the divine word in the sacred proverbs: “Wisdom is proclaimed at the moment of departure”? These sayings show that, though wisdom is helpful in every age, all people should be particularly wise when they are leaving this world, because the wisdom of past years will not fully deserve praise if it does not terminate in a good end. Wisdom is proclaimed at the moment of departure.
