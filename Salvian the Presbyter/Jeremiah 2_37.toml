Our soldiers were brought low by a similar disdaining pride and by the same outcome. That saying of the prophet was brought home to our army: “The Lord shall cast aside your confidence, and you shall not have prosperity.” We were confident in our own wisdom and strength, contrary to the command of God, who says, “Let not the wise person glory in his wisdom or the strong person in his strength, but let him who glories glory in this, to know and understand me, because I am the Lord.” - "The Governance of God 7.11"
