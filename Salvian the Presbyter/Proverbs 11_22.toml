What is a holy appellation without merit but an ornament set in the mud? The holy Scriptures have testified to this in writing: “A golden ring in a swine’s snout, a woman fair and foolish.” And in us the appellation Christian is like a golden ornament. If we use it unworthily, we seem to be swine with an ornament.
