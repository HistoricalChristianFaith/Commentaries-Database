Perhaps you fear the looks of your relatives sitting around and are afraid to offend them as they press and crowd around your beds. The Lord says through the prophet, “Be not afraid of them, be not dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.” You must also be unafraid and constant; do not fear their faces or be broken by their display.
