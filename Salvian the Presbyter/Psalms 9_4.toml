The same prophet showed elsewhere the difference between the present and future judgment of God. What did he say to the Lord about the verdict of the immediate trial? You have sat on the throne, you who judge justice. And what of God’s future and everlasting judgment? “He shall judge the people in justice.” By these words, he distinguished the time element between the present and the future judgments of God. To point to our present judgment, he wrote, “You judge,” and to distinguish the future from the present he later added, “He shall judge.”
