And then what? “All the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the flood gates of heaven were opened. And the rain fell upon the earth forty days and forty nights.” And a little later: “And all flesh was destroyed that moved upon the earth.” And again, “And Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark.” Here and now I wish to ask them who call God indifferent to human affairs whether they believe that at that time he either cared for earthly affairs or intervened in them.
