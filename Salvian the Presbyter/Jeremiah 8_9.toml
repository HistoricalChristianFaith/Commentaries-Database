What is a holy title without merit but an ornament set in the mud? The Holy Scriptures have testified to this in writing: “A golden ring in a swine’s snout, a woman fair and foolish.” And in us the title Christian is like a golden ornament. If we use it unworthily, we seem to be swine with an ornament.…For this reason, our God spoke elsewhere about the Hebrew people to the prophet, saying, “Call his name, Not Beloved.” And again to the Jews, “You are not my people, and I am not your God.” But he showed clearly elsewhere why he said this about them, for he said, “They have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters.” And again: “For they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them.”
