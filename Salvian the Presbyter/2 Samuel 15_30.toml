According to the word of God, misfortunes were piled up from this time on. The father suffered long from the treachery of his son.…Is the spectacle of David’s flight to be added to this account? Of such a nature was the flight that such a great king, of so great a reputation, greater and more honored than all other kings in the world, fled from his people with but a few servants. In comparison with his recent state, he was indeed poor; in comparison with his customary entourage, he was indeed alone. He fled in fear, disgrace and sorrow, “walking,” says Scripture, “with head covered and barefoot.” He was a witness of his former estate, an exile from his former self, almost one who lives after his own death. He was cast down so low that he received the scorn of his own servants, which is grave, or their pity, which is graver still. Sheba fed him, and Shimei did not fear to curse him in public. He was so changed from his former self by God’s judgment that he, whom the entire world had once feared, was insulted to his face by a single enemy.
