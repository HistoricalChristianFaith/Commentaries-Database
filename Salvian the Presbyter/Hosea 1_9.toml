For this reason, our God spoke elsewhere about the Hebrew people to the prophet, saying, “Call his name Not Beloved,” and again to the Jews, “You are not my people, and I am not your God.” But he himself showed clearly elsewhere why he said this about them, for he said, “They have forsaken the Lord, the vein of living waters,” and again, “For they have cast away the word of the Lord, and there is no wisdom in them.”
