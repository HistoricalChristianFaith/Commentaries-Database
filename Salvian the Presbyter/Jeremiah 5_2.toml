Who among us has amended his life, or what part of the Roman world, no matter how afflicted, is corrected? As we read, “For all have declined, they have become useless at same time.” Therefore, the prophet cries out to God and says, “You have struck them, and they have not sorrowed. You have consumed them, and they have refused to accept discipline. They have hardened their faces harder than a rock and were unwilling to return.” Present affairs show how truly this applies to us.
