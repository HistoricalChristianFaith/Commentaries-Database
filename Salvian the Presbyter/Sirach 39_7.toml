The holy book says that everything, day after day, is ruled by the divine will and that God governs all things unceasingly. It says, “The Lord loves wisdom and an ordered life,” and “There is no other God who cares for all.” And still, “Since you are just, you guide all things with equity, and you govern us with great respect.” So then, it speaks to you of God who guides and governs without interruption, but in this passage of Scripture not only is the government of God set forth but the dignity of human beings as well, since by saying “he governs us,” it wants to convey the power of the divine rule, and by saying “with great respect,” it allows us to understand how high is human dignity. Elsewhere in a prophet, it is written, “Do I not fill heaven and earth?” God declares the reason why he fills all things: “Because I am with you to save you.” And with these words the Lord makes us understand not only that he governs and fills the universe but also the power and fruits of his presence. The divine presence, of itself, produces this fruit: the salvation of what it fills. And this is why saint Paul says in the Acts of the Apostles, “In him we have life, movement and being.”
