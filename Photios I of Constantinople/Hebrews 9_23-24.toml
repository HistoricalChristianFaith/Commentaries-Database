The statement that “he entered into the heaven itself” must be taken by common agreement as this: “And so that he might not offer himself often, he entered into the very heaven.” For it is characteristic of those entering the “antitypes of the true things” to bear sacrifices “often” and “with blood,” but not of the one entering “into heaven itself.”
