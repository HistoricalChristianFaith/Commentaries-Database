What is the “abuse suffered for the Christ”? It is bearing the reproach of such things, while revealing the reproach that Christ endured. Or it can mean that Moses endured reproach because of Christ—for “the rock was Christ”—since it was likely that Moses was vilified when he heard, “You don’t wish to kill me in the same way that you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?” That is the “abuse suffered for the Christ,” namely, to suffer ill until one’s end and last draught of breath, just as Christ himself was reviled and heard, “If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” For both were reviled by their very own countrymen for whom they were doing good works.
