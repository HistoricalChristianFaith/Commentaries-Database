“One who has been worthy of much more glory.” He discussed in what ways Moses is equal to Christ, now he talks about Christ’s superiority. “Of much more.” Who is that? Christ, who is the Word incarnate. “More glory than Moses, just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.” Now he talks about the highest superiority of God over human beings. He says Moses was a faithful ruler over the whole household, that is, over the whole people, yet Moses himself was one of them. Therefore, the humanity of Christ is worthy of so much more honor than the honor of Moses, as the creator is superior to the creation, “just as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.” By “house” he means the people who were with Moses, yet Moses was one of them while Christ was the one who created the house.
