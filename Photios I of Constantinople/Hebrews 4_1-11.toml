He says, “Not having joined themselves to the things they heard,” that is, the things they believed. How was it possible for them to be joined to those things? “By faith,” he says, that is, through faith. For if the latter had believed as the former had, they would have been joined together into one, since their faith would have joined them together and blended them together.

Just as the first “rest” did not prevent there being a second rest, so neither does the existence of a second rest prevent the existence of a third and more perfect rest.… Then it is clear that there is a certain other rest beyond those rests which have been spoken of, and that this rest is hallowed not for any who happen to chance upon it, but rather “for the people of God.” But truly the people of God are “those who believe” in him and who keep his commandments.
