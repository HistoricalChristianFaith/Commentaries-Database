He says, “even though they have come out of the loins of Abraham.” Although the Levites are in all other respects equal in rank with the other tribes, nonetheless because the other tribes give tithes while the Levites receive them, the Levites are clearly superior. But if this is the case, then clearly also the same principle applies to Abraham and Melchizedek, the giver and recipient, respectively. Consequently, the type of Christ [Melchizedek] is greater than the patriarch Abraham. But if he is greater than Abraham, he is much greater than the priests. And if the type is greater than Abraham, what would anyone say concerning Christ himself?

He says, that because Abraham paid tithes, also Levi “who receives tithes himself was made to tithe,” that is, he gave a tithe. We must underscore the phrase “through Abraham,” so that the meaning does not suffer violence. For because Abraham was made to tithe, in a certain sense also Levi, being still “in his loins” has been made to tithe.
