“Although he died, through it he still speaks,” that is, because his very sacrifice furnished his brother with an opportunity for malice and jealousy, and his brother produced murder. Even if “he died,” “through it he speaks.” For this very reason Abel was always to be remembered and never forgotten. If someone should investigate both matters more accurately, the phrase “through it” (as is commonly understood) applies equally to “dying” and to “he speaks.”He still speaks. He is always to be remembered. He says that Abel’s deed done in faith does not allow him to fall into obscurity.
