Although you ought to be teachers, not only are you not teachers, but also you cannot even learn anything except the rather rudimentary and elementary and simple things, and even these things not absolutely but weaker than the beginning of the oracles of God. He does not say the “elements of the oracles,” but the elements of “the beginning” of the oracles. Most likely the elements of the oracles of God would be the words about the incarnation, but the elements of the “beginning” of the oracles are the things about which he goes on to say, “not laying again a foundation,” etc.The argument of the arrangement is this: “Therefore, leaving behind the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be carried to perfection, and we will do this, if God permits.”
“The Word of Christ.” What sort of word? The word of teaching that it is necessary to lay down a foundation of repentance from dead works, the word of teaching that it is necessary to believe in God, the word of teaching that one must be baptized, the word of teaching that one must be deemed worthy of the Holy Spirit, the word of teaching that there will be a resurrection and that there will be a judgment. For the word and the teaching have a common origin in every respect.

When he says to leave behind the elementary matters concerning Christ and to leave behind the word which stops any progress at the beginning and to be carried “to perfection,” he does not simply say perfection in its proper sense, but the perfection, as it were, that exists between the rudiments of the oracles of God and the heavenly perfection. For the “elements of the beginning of the oracles of God” consist of renouncing Satan and his works, believing in God, being baptized, receiving the Holy Spirit, knowing about the resurrection of the dead and believing that there is a judgment. These things are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God. But the “elements of the oracles of God”—not merely the beginning of the oracles of God—is to know that Christ suffered on our behalf, that he removed our sins, that he wrought our salvation for us, that he has become our high priest, that he offered himself on our behalf, and such other things. And “perfection” in renouncing Satan and his cohorts consists of advancement in the virtues and endurance amid tribulations, persecutions and periods of testing. And heavenly “perfection” is the exact apprehension concerning the divine teaching of Christ, insofar as is humanly possible. So first we believe and are baptized, then we know what sort of things Christ underwent for our sake and what sort of things he did in his human nature, then we are perfected in the virtues, then we are deemed worthy of the knowledge which is in accordance with divine wisdom.
