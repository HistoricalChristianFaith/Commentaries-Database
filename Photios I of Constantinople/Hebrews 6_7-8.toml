“It is cultivated” manifestly for their salvation and the enjoyment of those producing fruit. And if “the Father is the vinedresser,” just as the Lord says, and again the Son is also the sower, “the one sowing the good seed,” if the crop is suitable for them, that is, if the fruit appears—for we also ought to bear fruit for God, as he says somewhere, “but now having become slaves to God, produce your fruit for sanctification”—then if this is the case, we farm manifestly because of God, in order that we may please him with a virtuous life. Therefore we also will be deemed worthy of his blessing.
