I think that the phrase “also the first one had regulations for worship” refers to the old covenant and not the tabernacle. For he did not compare the tabernacle with the new covenant but the whole old covenant with the new one, and he showed the superiority of the latter over the whole former covenant. “For behold,” he says, “the days are coming and I will effect a new covenant on the house of Israel and on the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I established for their fathers,” and again, “When he says ‘new’ he has already made the first old.” And he adds these things and says, “Now the first one had.” … Therefore it is clear that the discussion is still concerning the covenant. For since he struck it down in comparison with the new covenant, in order that no one may say then that it was rejected as worthless, he anticipates the argument and says that even that covenant had “regulations for worship,” laws and order and fitting conformity with the service of God. And having spoken broadly of the whole law, that “it had regulations of worship,” he also proceeds part by part, beginning with the tent. It had, he says, “the earthly sanctuary.” Then after the earthly sanctuary (which was accessible to all), he had again another tabernacle placed in front of the yet more mystical and holier tabernacle. And in the more outward tabernacle there was “the lampstand and the showbread,” which tabernacle is not called “the earthly sanctuary,” as is the tabernacle in front of all the other tabernacles, but it is simply called “the Holy Place.”
