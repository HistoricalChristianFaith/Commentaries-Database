Two things are most in need of investigation here. First, how can he say, “He was heard,” and yet he himself begged not to enter into death? He did not avoid death, for he was crucified and died. Second, on the basis of what sort of “godliness” was he heard? And third, to what should the phrase “although he was a Son” be adjoined? Does it belong to the clause “he was heard because of his godliness” or to the clause that follows, so that it would read, “although he was a Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered”? For it is not a small difference between those two.

Now as regards the first matter we say that he did not make one petition but a twofold one. For the one petition asked to avoid death, the other petition asked for death. For he also says in the same prayer and petition, “However, not my will but yours be done.” And John, showing this more clearly, says that the Son prayed by saying, “Father, glorify your Son, in order that your Son may glorify you,” calling the cross and death glory, as is clear. So the excellent Paul says quite well, “He was heard.”

The phrase “on the basis of his godliness” comes closer to being understood from the things that have already been spoken. For we said that there were two petitions, the petition to be delivered from the death, and the petition of consent, which was really of much “godliness,” namely, the petition, “however, not my will, but yours, be done.” Therefore, Christ was heard not on the basis of his prayer to avoid death but on the basis of his “godliness,” that is, that petition of his came to pass, not the petition that sought to avoid death but the godly petition. Therefore, he says, “And having been made perfect,” that is, he was acknowledged as perfect and good beyond description and loving of humankind through his sufferings and cross and death. And he also hinted at this above, when he said, “petitions and supplications,” speaking rather enigmatically by doubling the petition. Then also when he said, “petitions and supplications,” he did not append the words about avoiding death but rather “to the One who was able to save him from death.” [He added this] well and very wisely, in order that whenever you think of him who was crucified and buried, you may not think that he endured this owing to the helplessness of his Father but because it was the common will (of the Father and the Son) that the Christ suffer these things for the salvation of the world. And this can be said also because of his resurrection. For the excellent Paul having uttered rather humble things in many places, says that the Father raised Christ. Therefore, having raised him, he rescued and delivered him from death. This is how these things are understood in my opinion.

Now as far as the phrase “although being a Son” is concerned, if someone should understand it as a transposition—and such a trope is uncustomary for the excellent apostle—the natural reading of the passage would be something like this: “Who in the days of his flesh, although being a Son, made petitions and supplications,” etc. That is, although having the very great advantage of being a Son, which enabled him to do all things by his own autocratic opinion without any petition or request, even as the Father does, nonetheless, since he was in the days of the flesh, he offered petitions and supplications. And according to this understanding it can also be understood how the phrase was soon joined to “and being heard because of his godliness,” inasmuch as he says that he was heard, although being a Son, and not asking to be heard, inasmuch as he made his will concurrent to his Father’s will and it was fulfilled without any petition. But if you conjoin this clause with what follows, the understanding will also be guided in the right way in the manner that I will show. But first we ought to examine the meaning of the clause “he learned obedience from the things which he suffered.” It really cannot be that he himself learned from the things he suffered to obey his Father and that by testing he acquired knowledge of how to obey him, can it? Or is it not rather that by testing he learned such was the greatness of the obedience, with which the Father hearkened to him, in that he was crucified and died and rose and exalted the human race to be at the right hand of the Father and to save our race? For these sort of things pertain to that obedience which took place when he said, “Father, glorify your Son.” Christ, being the Son and God just as much as the Father, already knew this obedience and how great it was, even before he rendered obedience to the Father, but “having been heard” he learned it through the things he suffered and through the testing he underwent. Then, however one wishes to understand it—although to me the second way of understanding seems particularly well suited—the phrase “although being a Son” presents no difficulty.
