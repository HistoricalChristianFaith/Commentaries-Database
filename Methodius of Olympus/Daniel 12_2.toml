It is the flesh that dies; the soul is immortal. So then, if the soul is immortal and the body is a corpse, those who say that there is a resurrection, but not of the flesh, deny any resurrection; because it is not that which remains standing but that which has fallen and been laid down that is to be set up, according to what was written: “Does not he who falls rise again, and he who turns aside return?” Since flesh was made to border on incorruption and corruption, being itself neither the one nor the other, and was overcome by corruption … and delivered over to death through disobedience, God did not leave it to corruption, to be triumphed over … but, after conquering death by the resurrection, he delivered it again to incorruption … “For this corruptible must put on incorruption.”

Man [humanity], though he was not made mortal and corruptible, dies, and his soul is separated from his body, in order that his transgression might be destroyed by death, being unable to live after he was dead. Thus, with sin dead and destroyed, he can rise again in immortality and sing a hymn of praise to God who saves his children from death by means of death.
