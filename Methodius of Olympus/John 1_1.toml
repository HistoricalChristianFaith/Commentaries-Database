He [Methodius] says, concerning the words “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” that one will not err who says that the “Beginning” is Wisdom. For Wisdom is said by one of the divine band to speak in this manner concerning herself: “The Lord created me the beginning of his ways for his works: of old he laid my formulation.” It was fitting and more seemly that all things that came into existence should be more recent than Wisdom, since they existed through her. Now consider whether the saying “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God”—whether these statements are not in agreement with those. For we must say that the Beginning, out of which the most upright Word came forth, is the Father and Maker of all things, in whom it was. And the words “The same was in the beginning with God” seem to indicate the position of authority of the Word, which he had with the Father before the world came into existence; “beginning” signifying his power. And so, after the peculiar unbeginning beginning, who is the Father, he is the beginning of other things, by whom all things are made.
