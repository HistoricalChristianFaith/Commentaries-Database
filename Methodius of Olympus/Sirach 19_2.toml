Now Abraham, when he first received the covenant of circumcision, seems to signify, by receiving circumcision in a member of his own body, nothing else than this: that one should no longer conceive children with one born of the same parent. In this way he shows that everyone should abstain from intercourse with his own sister, as his own flesh. And thus, from the time of Abraham, the custom of marrying with sisters has ceased. And from the times of the prophets the contracting of marriage with several wives has been done away with. For we read, “Do not go after your lusts, but refrain from satisfying your appetites,” for “wine and women will make men of understanding fall away.” And, in another place, “Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice with the wife of your youth,” which clearly forbids a plurality of wives. And Jeremiah clearly gives the name of “fed horses” to those who lust after other women. And we read, “The multiplying brood of the ungodly shall not thrive, nor will bastard plants take deep root or lay any firm foundation.”
