He willed that he who existed before the ages in heaven should be begotten on the earth—that is, that he who was before unknown should be made known. Now, certainly, Christ has never yet been born in those people who have never perceived the manifold wisdom of God—that is, has never been known, has never been manifested, has never appeared to them. But if these also should perceive the mystery of grace, then in them too, when they were converted and believed, he would be born in knowledge and understanding.
