Let us see, then, what it is that we have endeavoured to say respecting the apostle. For this saying of his, "I was alive without the law once".
"But I was alive and blameless before the law, having no commandment in accordance with which it was necessary to live; "but when the commandment came, sin revived, and I died. And the commandment, which was ordained to life, I found to be unto death."
