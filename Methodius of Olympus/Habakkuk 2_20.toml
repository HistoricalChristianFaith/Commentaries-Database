“When the time is come, you shall be shown forth.” What exposition does this require, if a person diligently direct the eye of the mind to the festival which we are now celebrating? “For then shall you be shown forth,” he says, “as upon a kingly charger, by your pure and chaste mother, in the temple, and that in the grace and beauty of the flesh assumed by you.” All these things the prophet, summing up for the sake of greater clearness, exclaims in brief: “The Lord is in his holy temple.” “Fear before him all the earth.”
