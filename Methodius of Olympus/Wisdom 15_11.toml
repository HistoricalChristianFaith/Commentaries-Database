Perhaps someone among people, having little discernment and lacking in wisdom, might be able to convince them that the garment of the soul, that is, this body of flesh generated by human beings, is formed on its own impetus, outside of God’s decision. He will certainly not be believed if he teaches that the substance of the soul is sown together with the mortal body. In fact, only the Almighty breathes into human beings what is immortal and what does not decay, since he alone is Creator of all invisible and imperishable things. It says, “He breathed on his face a spirit of life, and the man became a living being.” Moreover, the Word, accusing precisely those artists who, to people’s hurt, make statues of human features while not acknowledging the Creator, says in Wisdom, full of virtue, “Their heart is ashes, their wisdom more vain than the earth and their life more vile than mud, because they did not recognize the One who made them, who inspired in them the soul that acts and blew into them the spirit of life.” The Creator of all people is therefore God. For this reason, according to the saying of the apostle, “He wants all people to be saved and to come to a knowledge of the truth.”
