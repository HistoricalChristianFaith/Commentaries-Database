Therefore, it is becoming that we should kindle the unquenchable light of faith in the heart, and gird our loins with purity and watch and ever wait for the Lord so that, if he should will to come and take any of us away in the first period of life, or in the second or in the third, and should find us most ready and working what he appointed, he may make us to lie down in the bosom of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob. Now Jeremiah says, “It is good for a person that he bear the yoke in his youth” and “that his soul should not depart from the Lord.” It is good, indeed, from youth, to submit the neck to the divine hand and not to shake off, even to old age, the Rider who guides with pure mind, when the evil one is ever dragging down the mind to that which is worse. For who is there who does not receive through the eyes, through the ears, through the taste and smell and touch, pleasures and delights, so as to become impatient of the control of continence as a driver, who checks and vehemently restrains the horse from evil? Another who turns his thoughts to other things will think differently; but we say that he offers himself perfectly to God who strives to keep the flesh undefiled from childhood, practicing virginity; for it speedily brings great and much-desired gifts of hopes to those who strive for it, drying up the corrupting lusts and passions of the soul.
