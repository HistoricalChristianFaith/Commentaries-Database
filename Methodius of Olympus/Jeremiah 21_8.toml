It was not God’s law that became the cause of my being brought into subjection to corruption, but the devil, that he might be made manifest. He wrought evil through that which is good. The inventor of evil became and was proved to be the greatest of all sinners. “For we know that the law is spiritual.” So the law cannot injure anyone in any way. Spiritual things are far removed from irrational lust and sin. “But I am carnal, sold under sin.” This means, “I am carnal and placed between good and evil as a voluntary agent, so that I have it in my power to choose what I wish.” For “behold, I set before you life and death.” This means, “Death would result from disobedience of the spiritual law, that is, of the commandment, and from obedience to the carnal law, that is, the counsel of the serpent.” By such a choice I am sold to the devil, fallen under sin. Hence evil, as though besieging me, clings to me and dwells in me. Justice gives me up to be sold to the evil one, as a result of having violated the law. - "On the Resurrection 3.2.1"
