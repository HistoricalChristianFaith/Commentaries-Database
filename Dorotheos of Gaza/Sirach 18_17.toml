No one can say, "I am poor, I do not have any way to show mercy." If you cannot give like those who are rich who throw their offering into the treasury box, then give two mites like the poor widow and God will consider this a greater gift than the offerings of the rich. You do not have that much? But you do still have power to be merciful, and with this you can exercise mercy in the service of those who are sick. Can you not do even this? But you can console your brother with words. Therefore be merciful with him by your words, and listen to him who says, "A word is better than a gift." Suppose you cannot exercise mercy with words; still if your brother is mad at you, you can have mercy on him and support him in the midst of his turmoil, seeing that he is being mistreated by a common enemy, and instead of responding with a sharp word and getting him even more upset, keep silent and have mercy on him and his soul, stealing it from the enemy. Even if your brother turns against you, you still can have mercy on him and forgive his sin against you in order also to receive forgiveness from God. God, in fact, has said, "Forgive and you will be forgiven," and thus you will have been found providing mercy for the soul of your brother by pardoning his sins against you. - "Spiritual Instructions 14.158"
