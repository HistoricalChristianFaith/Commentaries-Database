In the beginning, when God created man, he set him in paradise (as the divine holy Scripture says) adorned with every virtue and gave him a command not to eat of the tree in the middle of paradise. Adam was provided for in paradise, in prayer and contemplation in the midst of honor and glory, healthy in his emotions and sense perceptions, and perfect in his nature as he was created. For to the likeness of God did God make man, that is, immortal, having the power to act freely and adorned with all the virtues. When he disobeyed the command and ate of the tree that God commanded him not to eat of, he was thrown out of paradise and fell from a state in accord with his nature to a state contrary to nature, a prey to sin, to ambition, to a love of the pleasures of this life and to the other passions; and he was mastered by them and became a slave to them through his transgression.
