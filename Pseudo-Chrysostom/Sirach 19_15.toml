What does it mean when it says, “I want to go down and see if in fact they have done all the evil that has been cried out against them to me. I want to know!”? That is, “A rumor has reached me.” But I want to have a more precise knowledge by means of the facts themselves, not because I do not know them but because I want to teach human beings not simply to put faith in words or to believe it if someone says something against another. Rather, one must first look into it and gain knowledge based on the facts, and only then believe. This is why another passage of Scripture says, “Do not believe every word.” Nothing upsets human life like too hastily putting faith in what is said. This is what the prophet David prophesied: “Whoever slanders his neighbor in secret I will cause to perish.” Have you noted that it was not ignorance on the Savior’s part when he said, “Where have you laid him?” or when the Father said to Adam, “Where are you?” or to Cain, “Where is Abel, your brother?” or also to Abraham, “I want to go down and see if in fact they have done all the evil that has been cried out against them to me. I want to know!”
