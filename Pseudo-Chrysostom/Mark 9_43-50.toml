(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) Then He introduces the witness of prophecy from the prophet Isaiah, saying, Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched. (Isa. 66:24) He says not this of a visible worm, but He calls conscience, a worm, gnawing the soul for not having done any good thing; for each of us shall be made his own accuser, by calling to mind what he has done in this mortal life, and so their worm remains for ever.

(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) Similar to this is that which the Apostle says, And the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is. (1 Cor. 3:13.) Afterwards he brings in a witness from Leviticus: which says, And every oblation of thy meat offering shall thou season with salt. (Lev. 2:13.)

(v. Vict. Ant. in Cat.) Or else it is meant, that every gift of our victim, which is accompanied by prayer and the assisting of our neighbour, is salted with that divine fire, of which it is said, I am come to send fire on earth. (Luke 12:49.) Concerning which it is added: Salt is good; that is, the fire of love. But if the salt have lost his saltness, that is, is deprived of itself, and that peculiar quality, by which it is called good, where with will ye season it? For there is salt, which has saltness, that is, which has the fulness of grace; and there is salt, which has no saltness, for that which is not peaceful is salt unseasoned.

(v. Vict. Ant. in Cat.) Or, according to Matthew, the disciples of Christ are the salt, which preserves the whole world, resisting the rottenness which proceeds from idolatry and sinful fornication. For it may also be meant, that each of us has salt, in as far as he contains in himself the graces of God. Wherefore also the Apostle joins together grace and salt, saying, Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt. (Col. 4:6) For salt is the Lord Jesus Christ, Who was able to preserve the whole earth, and made many to be salt in the earth: and if any of these be corrupted, (for it is possible for even the good to be changed into corruption,) they are worthy to be cast out.
