(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) He dismisses indeed the people with His blessing and with some cures. But He constrained His disciples, because they could not without pain separate themselves from Him, and that, not only on account of the very great affection which they had for Him, but also because they were at a loss how He would join them.

(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) This we must understand of Christ, in that He is man; He does it also to teach us to be constant in prayer.

(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) Holy Scripture reckons four watches in the night, making each division three hours; wherefore by the fourth watch it means that which is after the ninth hour, that is, in the tenth or some following hour. There follows, And would have passed them.

(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.) Or else, the first watch means the time up to the deluge; the second, up to Moses; the third, up to the coming of the Lord; in the fourth the Lord came and spoke to His disciples.
