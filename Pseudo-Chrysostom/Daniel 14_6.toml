Ah! What a great sign of acknowledgment—that a god eats and drinks a lot! Daniel did not say, “Master, this could never be God” (the king in fact was a weak person) but instead explained, “I speak to you about the God who created the earth and the sky, and you speak to me about such utter nonsense? Surely this would not be something that matters to God. God in fact does not have hunger, nor does he get tired.”
