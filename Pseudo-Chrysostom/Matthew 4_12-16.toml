By God without doubt, for none can effect any thing against a holy man, unless God deliver him up. He withdrew into Galilee, that is, out of Judæa; both that He might reserve His passion to the fit time, and that He might set us an example of flying from danger.

Otherwise, the Gentiles who worshipped idols, and dæmons, were they who sat in the region of the shadow of death; the Jews, who did the works of the Law, were in darkness, because the righteousness of God was not yet manifested to them.
