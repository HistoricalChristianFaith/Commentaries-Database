Otherwise; By to-day are signified such things as are needful for us in this present life; To-morrow denotes those things that are superfluous. Be not ye therefore anxious for the morrow, thus means, Seek not to have aught beyond that which is necessary for your daily life, for that which is over and above, i. e. To-morrow, shall care for itself. To-morrow shall he anxious for itself, is as much as to say, when you have heaped up superfluities, they shall care for themselves, you shall not enjoy them, but they shall find many lords who shall care for them. Why then should you be anxious about those things, the property of which you must part with? Sufficient for the day is its own evil, as much as to say, The toil you undergo for necessaries is enough, do not toil for things superfluous.
