[[commentary]]
quote='''
All good which men do not from love of the good itself is unpleasing before God. He hungers after righteousness who desires to walk according to the righteousness of God; he thirsts after righteousness who desires to get the knowledge thereof.

Such is the bounty of a rewarding God, that His gifts are greater than the desires of the saints.
