Praise is given to God alone, for he is the only one who deserves our worship. He is our Savior, because “he has saved his people from their sins.” Glory is ascribed to him because he is the victor in every battle; majesty, because the praise of the heavenly virtues is so great; dominion, because he rules over all he has made; and authority, because he has the power to destroy or to set free everything in creation. He exists from the beginning, in the present and forever.
