Christ deigned to reveal himself to James after his passion, and eventually it became proverbial to say: “He appeared also to James.” James refers to himself as a servant, but we must remember that there are two kinds of servitude, voluntary and involuntary. The involuntary servant is a slave who fears punishment, and therefore his service does not spring from love. But the voluntary servant is really no different from a son.
