It is written: “Wisdom is made known in death,” that is to say, the life of the wise man is praised at the end of his life. Wherefore we read also in another place: “Do not praise a man during his lifetime”and again, “Praise not any man before death.” Now suppose someone says: praise a man after death, for in the praise of the living there is a possible occasion of vain exultation for the object of the laudation and a note of flattery is attached to the one bestowing it. In many ways, however, it is useful to praise the dead: in the first place, because, while the one is absent who might be gratified by our praise, it is necessary that the whole glory be referred to the bestower of grace; second, because only admiration for his virtue remains when the suspicion of flattery is removed. Therefore, praise of the dead which is proclaimed in the holy congregation of the faithful is full of edification and utterly free from ostentation. Life of St. Honoratus, Preface
