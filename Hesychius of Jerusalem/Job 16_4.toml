Job has phrased this in the form of a question and not in order to look for an argument. This means “Will I really join words together against you? Or will I really shake my head at you? Not at all! It is convenient for the righteous to take upon himself the afflictions of others and not to trample underfoot or to exaggeratedly insist wickedly, as you do concerning my torments.” - "Homilies on Job 19.16.4c–d"
