Now, since the betrayer had been defeated in every battle, had failed in all his attempts, had been hindered in all his hunts, had been deprived of all his schemes, and all his traps had been broken, after destroying Job’s wealth, after the death of his numerous children, after ripping Job’s body with his blows, as a last, and in the betrayer’s opinion, most compelling resource, he leads his wife against Job. - "Homilies on Job 4.2.9"
