Job has not really forgotten God. Being still subject to the test, Job has offered blessings and praise. That is why the final condition of the righteous is not comparable to the grass dried up by heat. But he “is like a tree planted by streams of water which yields its fruit in its season, and its leaves do not wither.” Indeed, by preserving the fruit of virtue, Job has caused the abundant foliage of this world’s goods to bloom.
