A human being is called “lion” with good reason, because he is a royal animal, and even more so the righteous, because, by preserving the honor of God’s form, he is dreadful to his enemies. That is why he has been properly called so in Proverbs, “the righteous is as bold as a lion.” Yet if he stoops down to the lustful temptations presented by his enemies, he is “caught in the hunt like a lion for slaughter” and becomes an object of mockery for his hunters, like a lion, who, after being deluded by them, “has been caught in the hunt.” - "Homilies on Job 13.10.16–17a"
