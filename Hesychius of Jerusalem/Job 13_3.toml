This means, “I know the tremendous greatness of God, the endless wisdom of the Creator and his prodigious power; but even though I know that, ‘I will speak to the Lord,’ because if I know his power, I also know his justice. For he is just, he supports those who in the meantime, without rendering themselves accusers, speak to him. This teaches people that even though they are very righteous, they have to accept the judgments given to them. That is why ‘I will reason before him, if he wants to.’ For if he does not want, I will remain silent, because I know what is honorable to the servant. It is according to the command of the Lord that I will speak and will have the boldness to ‘reason before him.’ ” - "Homilies on Job 15.13.3"
