The Jews, hearing these things, did not believe, and they doubted they were able to happen. Now the word is proven. They no longer have the place of their sacrifice, since the temple has been destroyed, the altar collapsed and all their administration carried away, even the city overturned, in which it was necessary to sacrifice according to law.
