Job speaks in an admirable way. Instead of briefly saying, “You would not be able to be men,” he questions them, and what does he ask? “So are you really men, and shall wisdom die with you?” This means, “Is the honor of rational beings really intact within you? Do you know the decisions that God forms with regard to sinners and righteous people?” It is convenient, in fact, that people are aware of this. Know that God tests the righteous and shows tolerance with sinners. That is why the latter are wealthy and the former in the ordeal, because for sinners God’s long tolerance will be the reason for a return to repentance, while to the righteous the long battle will offer the occasion to be crowned. If you knew that, you would not condemn the righteous person who is in the ordeal, and you would not consider the sinner who is wealthy, as the righteous.
