Without doubt Job possesses happiness. You see that, by necessity or willingly, while Job starves and keeps away from all the tables of this world, he cries, “Sighing is my nourishment.” Yet Job does not die and confirms with force this word of God, “Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes out from the mouth of God.”
