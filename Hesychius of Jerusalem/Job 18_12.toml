These words are appropriate to the impious but not at all to Job, because “pains have not destroyed him” but have made him appear to be a powerful fighter, have made him appear doubly just. Many have come, and “the soles of their feet have been devoured”; therefore, those who have come must complain about themselves and not about the righteous, because Job, thanks to his patience, deserves crowns and happiness.
