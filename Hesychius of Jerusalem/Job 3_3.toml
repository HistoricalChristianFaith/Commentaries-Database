“Let the day perish in which I was born,” not the day in which I was formed but that “in which I was born.” … God, in fact, forms me into goodness, but Eve, who transgressed, conceives me into sadness. And David himself did not ignore that, but after learning it from the Spirit, he introduces the concept into a prophetic psalm with these terms: “For, behold, I was conceived in iniquities, and in sins did my mother conceive me.” How? To be sure, Eve began to conceive and give birth after the fall in paradise and after the transgression due to the miserable nourishment of the tree.
