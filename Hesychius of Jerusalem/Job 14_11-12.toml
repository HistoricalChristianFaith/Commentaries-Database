By calling death “sleep,” Job has clearly given us the hope for resurrection. However, he says, we will not awake “until heavens are no more.” That is obvious, because, as Isaiah said, it is necessary that “they shall be rolled together like a scroll.” It is necessary that all their powers are shaken, that the sun and the moon are obscured and that the stars, after being unsettled, fall like leaves. Then, at the sound of the trumpet, the angels will raise us from the dead, as from “sleep,” obviously under the order and the sign of God.
