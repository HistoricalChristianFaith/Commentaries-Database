It is necessary, actually, to call that time “morning,” because it is entirely light and drives the night away from this life. “You judge them for the time of rest,” that is, not for the torments but for the delights and the reward. He, who is now constantly worthy of the “visit” of God, will receive then his judgment “for the rest.” He is judged with the righteous, that is, is received [in heaven] together with the righteous, so that it may be known, in accordance with them what part is assigned to him and what is his destiny. Must he be placed with the patriarchs, or the prophets, or the apostles or the martyrs?
