“You would even attack the orphan,” that is, me, for I am deprived of any human assistance. And since God is “the Father of the orphans,” you make him angry by offending me. “And you would trample your friend underfoot” with your words. You trample him even more violently than with your feet, and you scorn the laws of friendship. But God takes these faults into account. He, who not only commands us to love our neighbor like ourselves, also wants to be called “love.”
