By “sword” he means the cross, using it just like a sword. He hangs amid two enemies, namely, the devil and death. By “thigh” he means the flesh, using the part for the whole.… He says the cross girds itself with the flesh, being powerful in appearance and beauty, so that by this (i.e., his humanity) he takes up our suffering; and by that (i.e., his divinity) he overcomes suffering, as if to have no part in it. We may be able to understand appearance and beauty as mercy. For there is nothing so fitting of God than to deliver his special creation. And “bend the bow” against the enemies, and “prosper” the faithful, and “rule” everywhere, so you may subdue the enemies; you may crown the faithful, because this is fitting of a judge and king.
