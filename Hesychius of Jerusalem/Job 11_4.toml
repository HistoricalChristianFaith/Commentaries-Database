Previously Job had already said, “If I am ungodly, why have I not died?” Did he not define himself as “blameless”? These words do not belong to Job but to God. It is God, in fact, who designated Job as blameless in his actions and as a man “who turns away from evil.” Therefore you (i.e., Zophar) refuse the testimony of God himself.
