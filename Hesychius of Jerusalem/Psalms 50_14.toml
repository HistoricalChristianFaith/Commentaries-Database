Be as companions of angels. Imitate the seraphim in glory. Tell the glory of God to the heavens; offer the burnt offering while one praises God continuously. Perhaps “sacrifice of praise” means “virtues” through which God is praised, that is, blessed and glorified, especially when he said to the apostles, “Let your light shine before all people.”
