We must conduct our festivals and rejoice with fear and trembling. A faithful Christian, the psalm says, must not sing the songs of the heathen or have anything to do with the principles and doctrines of strange assemblies. It may happen that through their songs, he might make mention of the names of idols, which God forbids the faithful to do. The Lord scolds certain people through Jeremiah and says, “Your children have forsaken me, and have sworn by those who are no gods.”
