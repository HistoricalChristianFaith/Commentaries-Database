Learn from the apostle that we are the ones who grieve the Spirit, extinguishing him in our hearts. He says, “Do not quench the Spirit, do not despise prophecy”; and again, “Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, in whom you have been sealed for the day of redemption.” We introduce these testimonies not as if to suggest that every man who has been baptized and obtained grace is henceforth immutable and no longer in need of repentance, but to say that through baptism, according to Christ’s gift, the complete grace of God is granted to us for the fulfillment of the commandments. Henceforth each one who receives baptism mystically and yet does not fully perform the commandments, is activated by sin in proportion to their failure—the sin not of Adam but of the one who is negligent.
