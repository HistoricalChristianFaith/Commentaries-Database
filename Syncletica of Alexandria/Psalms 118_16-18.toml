Rejoice because God has visited you. Keep saying the famous text: “The Lord has chastened and corrected me, but he has not given me over to death.” … A messenger from Satan is given to you to be a thorn in your flesh. Lift up your heart, for you see that you have received a gift like that of St. Paul. If you suffer from fever and cold, remember the text of Scripture, “We went through fire and water,” and then, “you brought us out to a place of rest.” … Threefold suffering like this will make you perfect. He also said, “You set me at liberty when I was in trouble.” Thus, let us test our souls by this kind of self-discipline, for we have our enemy before our eyes.

When the devil does not use the goads of poverty to tempt, he uses wealth for the purpose. When he cannot win by scorn and mockery, he tries praise and flattery. If he cannot win by providing health, he tries illness; if he cannot win by comfort, he tries to ruin the soul by vexations that lead a person to act against the monastic vow. He inflicts severe sicknesses on people whom he wants to tempt, and so makes them weak and thereby shakes the love that they feel toward God. But although the body is shattered and running high temperatures and thirsting unbearably—yet you who endure all this are a sinner, and remember the punishments of the next world, and the everlasting fire and the torments of the judgment. So you will not fail in the sufferings of this present time; indeed you should rejoice because God has visited you. Keep saying the famous text: “The Lord has chastened and corrected me, but he has not given me over to death.” Iron is cleaned of rust by fire. If you are righteous and suffer, you grow to a yet higher sanctity. Gold is tested by fire. A messenger from Satan is given to you to be a thorn in your flesh. Lift up your heart, for you see that you have received a gift like that of Paul. If you suffer from fever and cold, remember the text of Scripture, “We went through fire and water”—and then “you brought us out into a place of rest.” If you have endured the suffering, you may expect the place of rest, provided you are following what is good. Cry aloud the prophet’s words, “I am poor and destitute and in misery”—for the threefold suffering shall make you perfect.
