Perhaps he calls them saints in this psalm in the same way that he calls them just in the Gospel when he says, “I am not come to call the just but sinners,” that is, those just who boast of the holiness of their race and the letter of the Law, to whom it is said, “Do not boast of your father Abraham, for God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” This type is exemplified in the Pharisee6 who recited his good works in the temple, as if recalling them to an ignorant Lord, not praying to be heard but demanding the reward due to his good conduct. Yet, this was displeasing to God because he tore down by his pride what he had built up by his justice; he did not do this silently but at the top of his voice; and it is evident that he did not speak to divine ears, because he wished to be heard by people. Hence, he was not pleasing to God because he was pleasing to himself. “For God has scattered the bones of people pleasing to themselves; they have been confounded,” he says, “because he has despised them,” who “does not despise a contrite and humbled heart.”
