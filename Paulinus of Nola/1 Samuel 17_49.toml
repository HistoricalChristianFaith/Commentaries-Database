Having trust in Christ, consigning everything to the God of powers, regarding God alone as all that is highestâ€”this has always been efficacious in achieving every good. This is the faith that has prevailed over all weapons. This was the strength that made that slight boy great, for he grew stronger by spurning weapons and brought low the armed giant by the power of a stone.
