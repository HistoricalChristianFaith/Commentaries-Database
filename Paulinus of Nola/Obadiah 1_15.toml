Be mindful on that day of the sons of Edom, and change their role with ours, so that they may in disarray witness the day on which your people will dwell in Jerusalem’s ancient city. That nation turns its back on you and now threatens Jerusalem with cruel destruction, saying, “Level that hated city to the ground. Lay it bare by force until nothing stands and the walls are reduced to nothing.”
