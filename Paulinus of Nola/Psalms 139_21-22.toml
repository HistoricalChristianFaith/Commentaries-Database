I also ask and beg of you to expound for me what [Paul] says to the Romans, for I admit I have very poor sight for this opinion of the apostle about the Jews, where he says, “As concerning the gospel, indeed they are enemies for your sake, but as touching the election they are most dear for the sake of the ancestors.” How can these same ones be enemies for our sake, now that we former Gentiles have become believers, as if Gentiles could only believe if the Jews had refused to believe? Is not God the one Creator of all, “who will have all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth,” and was he not able to gain both without dispossessing one for the other? Second, “most dear for the sake of the ancestors”: how or why this “most dear,” if they do not believe and if they continue to be enemies of God? “O God,” he says, “have I not hated them that hated you and pined away because of your enemies? I have hated them with a perfect hatred.” Certainly, I think the Father’s voice speaks to his Son by the prophet in the same psalm where he spoke on behalf of believers: “But to me your friends, O God, are made exceedingly honorable; their dominions are exceedingly strengthened.” How can it be profitable for their salvation to be “most dear to God for the sake of the ancestors” when salvation is acquired only through the faith and grace of Christ? What good does it do them to be loved, when they are inevitably to be damned because of their unbelief, because they have fallen away from the faith of the prophets and of the patriarchs, their ancestors, and have become enemies of the gospel of Christ? If they are most dear to God, how shall they be lost? And if they do not believe, how can they fail to be lost? If they are loved for the sake of the ancestors, without any merit of their own, why will they not be saved for the sake of the ancestors, too? “And if, Noah, Daniel and Job shall be in the midst thereof, they shall not deliver the wicked children: they shall be delivered.”
