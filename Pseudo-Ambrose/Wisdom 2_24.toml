From envy comes hatred, grumbling, disparagement, joy over the difficulties of one’s neighbor and affliction over his prosperity. O perverse progeny, which, if it penetrates the soul and begins to dominate it, destroys every bud of holiness. One who envies or hates kills no one before he kills himself. One who murmurs and disparages tears out his own roots before those of others. The one who exults in his neighbor’s difficulties and is tormented by his success strikes himself first with a foreign sword. This second branch of pride was first born when the one about whom it is written, “Death entered the world through the devil’s envy,” convinced Cain to shed his brother’s blood, moved by the hatred brought about by envy. But certainly Cain, through his envy, killed his own soul before he killed the other’s flesh. Indeed, it is written, “Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life in him.”

Envy says, “In what way are you inferior to this one or that one? Why then aren’t you equal or superior to them? How many things are you capable of that they aren’t? So, they can be neither superior nor even equal to you.” Fraternal love, however, responds, “O mortal, if you think yourself better than others because of your virtues, you would be more secure in the lowest place than in the highest. The worst ruin always comes from the highest place. If, as you say, some are superior and others equal to you, what harm is it to you? How does it hurt you? As you envy the lofty position of others, be careful rather that you do not imitate him of whom it is written, ‘Death entered the world through the devil’s envy. Those who belong to his party imitate him.’ ”

Death is the sword of the devil. “Death entered the world through the devil’s envy.” This is the sword with which he killed the first man, and then the human race, until it was redeemed by Christ. When we sin, we fall under this sword. Christ, however, did not have this sword, because “he committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth.” He was not subject to original sin, because he was not born of sexual intercourse involving a man—a man who necessarily could not be without sin.

The man, who was formed by the initiative of divine action, was made lord of this earthly creation, so that in observance of the divine order he would respect only the will of him who, from nothing, had made him lord of all things. And from the beginning—not out of ignorance but corrupted by envy and wanting the creature to surpass what had been granted by God—he lost what nature had not given him, that is, grace, which had been granted him by the benevolence of the Creator. From then on, the transgressor, having received the sentence of death through the jealousy of the devil’s deception, passed this sentence on to the descendents who would originate from him in the future.
