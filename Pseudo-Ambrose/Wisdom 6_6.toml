Tell me: Where are the kings? Where are the princes? Where are the rich? Where is their gold and their splendor? “All has passed like a shadow.” Their gold, their silver and their pomp have remained in the world, while they are endlessly tormented in hell, where their worm will never die and their fire will never go out, since it is written, “The powerful will be severely tormented.” Down there they will live forever in darkness, in a dwelling without light. Down there the miserable will be with the miserable, the proud with the proud, murderers with murderers, adulterers with adulterers, the impious with the impious, liars with liars, those who commit sacrilege with others like them—all will be tormented together, forever, in hell.
