By his passion, therefore, Christ made perfect that human flesh that had been brought down to death by the first man’s sin and restored it by the power of his resurrection. Sitting on God’s right hand, he placed it in the highest heavens. In view of this, the apostle says, “Who has raised us up together and has made us sit together in the heavenly places.” It was he, you see, who was the potter mentioned by the prophet Jeremiah: “The vessel that had fallen from his hand and was broken, he again raised up with his hands and formed anew, as it seemed good in his eyes.” So it seemed good to him to raise the mortal and corruptible body he had assumed from the rocky tomb, and, rendering it immortal and incorruptible, to place it no longer in an earthly environment but in heaven at his Father’s right hand.
