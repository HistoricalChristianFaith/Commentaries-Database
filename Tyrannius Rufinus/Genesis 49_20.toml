Since Asher means “blessed,” the bread of that one whom, after being recalled from error to penitence, we lead step by step to the present state of blessedness, after his conversion, after the spiritual knowledge, after the victory over temptations, is, to be sure, called “fat.” He eats that bread “which comes down from heaven and gives life to the world,” and that bread is fat for him.
