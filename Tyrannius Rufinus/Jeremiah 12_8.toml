It is further related that when Pilate wanted to release him, the whole multitude shouted in uproar: “Crucify him, crucify him.” This was foretold by the prophet Jeremiah, speaking in the person of the Lord: “My inheritance,” he says, “has become to me as lion in the wood. It has cried out against me. Therefore have I hated it.” And therefore, he adds, “I have forsaken my house.” In yet another passage Isaiah says: “Upon whom have you opened your mouth wide, and against whom have you let loose your tongues?” - "Commentary on the Apostles’ Creed 22"
