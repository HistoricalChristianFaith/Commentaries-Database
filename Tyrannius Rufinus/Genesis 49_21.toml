With regard to the third explanation, the interpretation of the name Naphtali is that indicated by his father when he blesses him, that is, “leafy tree” or “vine.” There was that man of ours, who a bit earlier fed on fat bread and offered food to princes (that bread that comforts the heart of people8). Now, as a second phase, Christ, the true vine, has shown for him a splendid fruit through which he may now cheer with wine the heart that he had comforted before with bread. In both cases it seems to me that he has reached such a stage of progress that he may even obtain the sacraments of priesthood. But if we prefer to interpret Nephthalim as “tree,” which shows its beauty in its fruits, instead of “leafy vine,” what will ever be the tree showing its beauty in the fruits but the Wisdom of God? About her Solomon says, “She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.”
