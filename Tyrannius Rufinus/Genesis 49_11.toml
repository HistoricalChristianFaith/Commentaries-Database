This is appropriately and exclusively said about Christ. He that said, “I am the true vine” bound his foal to the vine. Therefore he binds his foal and his ass’s foal to this vine. His foal is the people of the nations, onto whom certainly the burden of the law had never been imposed and among whom no one but he had ever held the first position. His ass’s foal are those, who coming from the first people symbolized here by the she-ass, were elected for salvation and about whom the prophet says, “If the sons of Israel are like the sand of the sea, the rest shall be saved.” After rejecting the she-ass who preferred to wear the yoke of the law in its infidelity, the foal born from it is elected, that is, a new people coming from the old one through faith is adopted and associated to the people of the nations. Therefore Christ is called “vine” because he has received the human nature, to which the Word of God binds his foal, that is, unites his people and associates it with that way of life that he followed in the flesh, so that the foal that has been bound may become with him son of God and coheir of Christ.

“Binding his foal to the vine.” Here we understand “foal” as the sense itself (intelligence, reason) on account of the renewal of life: that same sense which elsewhere the Lord calls “child,” when he says, “Truly I tell you, unless you change and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.” When one unites with the Lord and becomes a single spirit with him, he binds his foal to the vine by saying, “It is good for me to cleave close to God.” “And his ass’s foal to its branch.” That branch or rather that tendril, as we have interpreted it above, can be understood as the subtle and flexible intelligence of knowledge. When the ass’s foal, that is, the senses of the soul, are bound to it, they prevent the soul itself from falling.

“He shall wash his robe in wine and his garment in the blood of grapes.” These words, on the basis of the historical account, will appear to signify a fertile land full of vineyards or, in a hyperbolic manner, the abundance of wine. But the mystical explanation will give them a nobler sense. Christ’s robe washed in wine is interpreted with good reason as the church, which he himself has purified in his blood and is spotless and faultless. “You were not redeemed through silver and gold,” the apostle says, “but through the precious blood of the only-begotten Son of God.” And therefore in the wine of that blood, that is, in the bath of regeneration Christ washes the church. And we are buried with him through baptism in his death and in his blood.… But let us see how he will wash his garment in the blood of grapes. The garment appears to be a more intimate cloth, which is closer to the body than the robe. Those who, after they had been washed with the bath and had become his robe, reached the sacrament of the blood of grapes, that is, a more intimate and more secret mystery; they in a sense participate in his garment. In fact, the soul is washed in the blood of grapes, when it has begun to grasp the meaning of that sacrament. After perceiving and comprehending the virtue of the blood of the Word of God, the soul will become more receptive as it is purer. Each day it is washed in order to improve in its knowledge.
