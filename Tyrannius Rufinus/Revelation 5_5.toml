behold the lion. the death of Christ marked the defeat and the triumph over the demons. In fact, our Lion had captured all the prey that the hostile lion had conquered after destroying and crushing the man. Then, by coming back from the underworld and ascending on high, he made slavery his captive. Therefore in his sleep the Lion won and defeated every evil and destroyed the one who had the power of death. (Blessing of the Patriarchs 1.6)
