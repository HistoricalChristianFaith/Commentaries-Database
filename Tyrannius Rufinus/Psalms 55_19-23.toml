If it does not make you weary, let me point out, as briefly as possible, specific references to prophecy in the Gospels, so that those who are being instructed in the basic elements of the faith may have these testimonies written on their hearts, lest they should be surprised by any doubt they may entertain concerning the things that they believe. We are told in the Gospel that Judas, one of Christ’s friends and associates at their last meal together, betrayed him. Let me show you how this is foretold in the Psalms: “He who has eaten my bread has lifted up his heel against me”; and in another place, “My friends and my neighbors drew near and set themselves against me”;20 and again, “His words were smoother than oil, and yet they are real darts.” What then is meant when it says that his words were smooth? “Judas came to Jesus and said to him, Hail, Master, and kissed him.” Thus through the soft blandishment of a kiss he implanted the execrable dart of betrayal. In response the Lord said to him, “Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?” You observe that he was appraised by the traitor’s covetousness at thirty pieces of silver.
