But, says someone, “Are these things to be understood of the Lord? Could the Lord be held prisoner by men and dragged to judgment?” Of this also the same prophet shall convince you. For he says, “The Lord himself shall come into judgment with the elders and princes of the people.” The Lord is judged then according to the prophet’s testimony, and not only judged but scourged and slapped on the face with the palms [of men’s hands], and spit on, and suffers every insult and indignity for our sake. And because all who should hear these things preached by the apostles would be perfectly amazed, therefore also the prophet speaking in their person exclaims, “Lord, who has believed our report?” For it is incredible that God, the Son of God, should be spoken of and preached as having suffered these things. For this reason they are foretold by the prophets, lest any doubt should spring up in those who are about to believe.
