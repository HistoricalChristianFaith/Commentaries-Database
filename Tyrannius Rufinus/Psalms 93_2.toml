To sit at the right hand of the Father is a mystery belonging to the incarnation. For it does not befit that incorporeal nature without the assumption of flesh; neither is the excellency of a heavenly seat sought for the divine nature but for the human. Thus it is said of him, “Your seat, O God, is prepared from thence forward; you are from everlasting.” The seat, then, on which the Lord Jesus was to sit, was prepared from everlasting, “in whose name every knee should bow, of things in heaven and things on earth and things under the earth; and every tongue shall confess to him that Jesus is Lord in the glory of God the Father;” of whom also David says, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit on my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.” Referring to these words the Lord in the Gospel said to the Pharisees, “If therefore David in spirit calls him Lord, how is he his Son?” By which [Jesus Christ] showed that according to the Spirit he was the Lord, according to the flesh he was the Son of David. Also the Lord says in another place, “Truly I say to you, henceforth you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the power of God.” And the apostle Peter says of Christ, “Who is on the right hand of God, seated in the heavens.” And Paul also, writing to the Ephesians, “According to the working of the might of his power, which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead and seated him on his right hand.”
