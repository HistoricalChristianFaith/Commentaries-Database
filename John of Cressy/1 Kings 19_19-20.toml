After receiving the garment from the prophetical hand,
at the same time you have received the privilege,
when you were transformed from worker into a prophet
through the radiance of the Spirit that was glorified.
Since you foreknew, O Christ, the inclination to goodness
Of the heart of Elisha, he has understood with no doubt
The glorious call that you had established and followed it.
