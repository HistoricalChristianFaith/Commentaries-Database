But what does this mean: “Until the day on which the Lord shall send rain on the earth”? except that he, too, “shall come down like rain upon a fleece, and like the drops that water the earth.” In this passage the mystery of the old history is disclosed where Gideon, the warrior of the mystic conflict, receiving the pledge of future victory, recognized the spiritual sacrament in the vision of his mind, that that rain was the dew of the divine Word, which first came down on the fleece, when all the earth was parched with continual drought, and by a second true sign, moistened the floor of all the earth with a shower, while dryness was upon the fleece. - "Concerning Widows 3.18"

Someone perhaps will enquire whether Gideon does not seem to have been lacking in faith, seeing that after being instructed by many signs he asked [for] still more. But how can he seem to have asked as if doubting or lacking in faith, who was speaking in mysteries? He was not doubtful then, but careful so that we would not doubt. For how could he be doubtful whose prayer was effectual? And how could he have begun the battle without fear, unless he had understood the message of God? For the dew on the fleece signified the faith among the Jews, because the words of God come down like the dew. - "On the Holy Spirit 1, Prologue 6"

Nor was it without a reason that he put the fleece neither in a field nor in a meadow, but in a threshing floor, where the harvest of the wheat is: “For the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few;” because, through faith in the Lord, there was about to be a harvest fruitful in virtues. - "On the Holy Spirit 1, Prologue 10"

Nor, again, was it without a reason that he dried the fleece of the Jews and put the dew from it into a basin, so that it was filled with water, yet he did not himself wash his feet in that dew. The prerogative of so great a mystery was to be given to another. He was being waited for who alone could wash away the filth of all. Gideon was not great enough to claim this mystery for himself, but “the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but to minister.” Let us, then, recognize in whom these mysteries are seen to be accomplished. Not in holy Gideon, for they were still at their commencement. Therefore the Gentiles were surpassed, for dryness was still upon the Gentiles, and therefore did Israel surpass them, for then did the dew remain on the fleece.
Let us come now to the gospel of God. I find the Lord stripping himself of his garments and girding himself with a towel, pouring water into a basin, and washing the disciples’ feet. That heavenly dew was this water, this was foretold, namely, that the Lord Jesus Christ would wash the feet of his disciples in that heavenly dew. - "On the Holy Spirit 1, Prologue 11.12"
