Now let us turn our attention to the characteristic of fatness or richness of which David speaks intelligibly when he says, “Let my soul be filled as with marrow and fatness.” Before that he had said, “And may your whole burnt offering be made fat.” By this he means that the requirements for a sacrifice are that it be fat or rich, that it be glistening and that it be weighted with the sustenance inspired by faith and devotion and by the rich nourishment of the Word of God. Frequently we use the word fat or rich when we refer to something that is heavily and elaborately adorned, and to the finest victim as one that is not thin and scrawny. Wherefore we designate as “rich” a sacrifice that we desire to be regarded as the “finest.” We also have proof of this when we consult the prophetic passage in the Scriptures where fine cows are compared with years of fertility!
