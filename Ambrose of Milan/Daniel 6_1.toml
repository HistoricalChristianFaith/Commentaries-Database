Daniel received the Holy Spirit and therefore prophesied. So, too, the king promoted him because he had the grace of the Spirit. For the king spoke in this regard, “I have heard of you that the Spirit of the holy God is in you.” And farther on it is written, “Then Daniel became distinguished above all the other presidents and satraps, because an excellent spirit was in him.” And the spirit of Moses also was shared by those who were to be judges.
