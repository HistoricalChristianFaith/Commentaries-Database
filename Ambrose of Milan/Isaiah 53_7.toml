It is the price of our freedom, as Peter says, “You were redeemed with the precious blood,” not of a lamb but of him who came in meekness and humility like a lamb and freed the whole world with the single offering of his body, as he himself said, “I was led like a lamb to be sacrificed,” and John also said, “Behold, the lamb of God, behold the one who takes away the sins of the world.”
