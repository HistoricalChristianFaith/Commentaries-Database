They came and they seized him. They would die a more dreadful death as a fruit of their zeal. These wretches did not understand the mystery nor revere such compassion of piety, because Christ did not let even his enemies be wounded. They inflicted death on the righteous One, and he healed the wounds of his persecutors.
