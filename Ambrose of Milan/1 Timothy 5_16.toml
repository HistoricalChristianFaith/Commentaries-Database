But if it is praiseworthy to have one’s soul free from this failing of greed, how much more glorious is it to gain the love of the people by liberality. This should be neither too freely shown to those who are unsuitable, nor too sparingly bestowed upon the needy.… There is also another kind of liberality which the apostle teaches, “If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her assist them. Let the church not be burdened so that it may assist those who are real widows.” Useful, then, is liberality of this sort.
