When they questioned him about the penny, he asks about the image, because there is one image of God and another image of the world. The apostle also admonishes us, “As we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly.” Christ does not have the image of Caesar, because he is the image of God. Peter does not have the image of Caesar, because he said, “We have left all things, and have followed you.” The image of Caesar is not found in James and John, because they are the Sons of Thunder. It is found in the sea, where there are dragons with crushed heads upon the water. The large dragon itself, with its head broken, is given there as food to the Ethiopian people. If he did not have the image of Caesar, why did he pay the tax? He did not give from his own but gave back to the world what was of the world. If you would not be indebted to Caesar, do not possess what belongs to the world. You have wealth; therefore you are indebted to Caesar. If you want to owe nothing to an earthly king, leave all that you have and follow Christ.
