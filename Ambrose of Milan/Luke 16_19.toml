But not all poverty is holy, or all riches criminal, but as luxury disgraces riches, so does holiness commend poverty.
This seems rather anarrative than a parable, since the name is also expressed.
But the insolence and pride of the wealthy is manifested afterwards by the clearest tokens, for it follows, and no one gave to him. For so unmindful are they of the condition of mankind, that as if placed above nature they derive from the wretchedness of the poor an incitement to their own pleasure, they laugh at the destitute, they mock the needy, and rob those whom they ought to pity.
