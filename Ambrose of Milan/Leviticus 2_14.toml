The sacrifice should consist of a gift, the newest of the new, or it should be dried or broken into pieces, or it should be unbroken. The “newest of the new” belongs to the early season of the year and is consistent with the nature of first fruits. Now it has been made clear to us that this refers to those who are renewed by the sacrament of baptism.
