Anger destroys not just the ordinary run of people, but even the wise. David warns the wise, saying to them, “Cease from anger,” for once that fire is set alight it will not cease until its flames have consumed you. “Leave aside,” he says, “your rage.” Here is his meaning: nature catches hold of you, it stirs up your feelings, you get excited about some fault, some slight that has offended you, you begin to rage but not to the point where you cannot stop. Drop it. Put an end to it, or it will drag you into sin.
