The wheel within a wheel is life under the law, life under grace; inasmuch as Jews are within the church, the law is included in grace. For one is within the church who is a Jew secretly; and circumcision of the heart is a sacrament within the church. But that Jewish people are within the church of which it is written: “In Judah is God known”; therefore as wheel runs within wheel, in the same way the wings were still and the wings were flying.
