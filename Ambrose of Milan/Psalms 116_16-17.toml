Learn, then, what this means: “He took on himself the form of a servant.” It means that Christ took on himself all the perfections of humanity in their completeness and obedience in its completeness. And so it says in the thirtieth psalm, “You have set my feet in a large room. I am made a reproach above all mine enemies. Make your face to shine on your servant.” “Servant” means the Man in whom he was sanctified; it means the Man in whom he was anointed; it means the Man in whom he was made under the law, made of the Virgin; and, to put it briefly, it means the Man in whose person he has a mother, as it is written: “O Lord, I am your servant, I am your servant and the son of your handmaid”; and again: “I am cast down and deeply humbled.”

While we often read that sacrifices were offered by David to the Lord, he adds this passage: “To you I will offer sacrifice of praise.” He does not say “I offer sacrifice” but “I will offer sacrifice,” meaning that the sacrifice will have been completed when each one stands before the Lord, freed of the chains of this body, and offers himself as a victim of praise. For before death no praise is completed, nor could anyone in this life be praised with final praise, since his later actions are uncertain. Death then is the freeing of the soul from the body. And so we have taught what was written by the apostle: “by far the better to be dissolved and to be with Christ.” And what is the effect of that dissolution? The body is released and at rest, while the soul turns to its place of repose and is free; if it is devout, it is going to be with Christ.
