“Therefore will I remember you, O Lord, from the land of Jordan and Hermon.” Therefore, one who is troubled, if he takes good counsel, goes out from Egypt and follows the way of light, for Hermon is interpreted to mean “way of the lamp.” And so, go out first from Egypt, if you wish to see Christ’s light. The Canaanite woman went out from the territory of the pagans and found Christ; she said to him, “Have pity on me, O son of David!” Moses went out from Egypt and was made a prophet and sent back to the people, that he might free their souls from the land of affliction. Moreover, the lamp is in the body of Christ, and this is the lamp that shows you the way. For this reason also holy David says, “Your word is a lamp to my feet,” a lamp, because it has enlightened the souls of all people5 and shown the way in the darkness. The way of the lamp is the gospel; it shines in the darkness, that is, in the world.
