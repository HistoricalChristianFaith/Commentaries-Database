Do you hear him [the psalmist] saying, “The sorrows of death have compassed me”? “Still, I have loved the Lord even in the sorrows of death. The perils of hell have found me, not fearing indeed, but loving, but hoping, because no distress, no persecution, no dangers, no sword shall separate me from Christ.” Therefore, he accepted tribulation and sorrow willingly, knowing that “suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope.” As a good athlete, he sought the contest that he might gain the crown, but he knew that this was given to him not through his own strength but by the aid of God. He could not have been victorious had he not called on him who helps contenders.
