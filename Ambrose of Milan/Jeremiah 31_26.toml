Let us, then, submit ourselves to God and not be subject to sin, and when we ponder the remembrance of our offenses, let us blush as though at some disgrace and not speak of them as a glory to us, as some boast of overcoming modesty or putting down the feeling of justice. Let our conversion be such that we who did not know God may now ourselves declare him to others, that the Lord, moved by such a conversion on our part, may answer to us: “Ephraim is from youth a dear son, a pleasant child, for since my words are concerning him, I will truly remember him; therefore have I hastened to be over him. I will surely have mercy on him, says the Lord.” And what mercy he promises us, the Lord also shows, when he says further on: “I have satiated every thirsty soul and have satisfied every hungry soul. Therefore, I woke up and beheld, and my sleep was sweet to me.” We observe that the Lord promises his sacraments to those who sin. Let us, then, all be converted to the Lord.

The Lord Jesus said, “Now my soul is troubled.” For he who took on our infirmities also took on our feelings. He was sad even to death, but not by reason of death. For the death that was freely chosen could not have held sorrow. In it was the future joy of all people and the refreshment of all. Concerning it the Scripture said, in another passage, “And I rose up and saw, and sleep became pleasant to me.” Good is the sleep that has made the hungry not to hunger and the thirsty not to thirst and has prepared for them the pleasant savor of the mysteries. How then was Christ’s soul troubled when he made the souls of others not to fear? He was sad, then, even to death, until grace should be fulfilled. This is proved by his testimony as he speaks of his death, “I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how distressed I am until it is accomplished.”
