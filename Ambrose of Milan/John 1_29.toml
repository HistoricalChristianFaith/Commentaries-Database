Abel knew how to divide when he offered a sacrifice from “the firstlings of his flock,” teaching that the gifts of the earth, which had degenerated in the sinner, will not please God. But those in which the grace of the divine mystery shone forth will please him. And so he prophesied that we were to be redeemed from fault through the passion of the Lord, of whom it is written: “Here is the lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.” Thus, too, he made an offering from the firstlings, that he might signify the firstborn. Therefore, he shows that God’s true sacrifice would be us, of whom the prophet says, “Bring to the Lord the offspring of rams.” And worthily is he confirmed by the judgment of God.
