And not only is the operation of the Father, Son and Holy Spirit everywhere one, but also there is one and the same will, calling and giving of commands, which one may see in the great and saving mystery of the church. For as the Father called the Gentiles to the church, saying, “I will call her my people which was Not my people, and her beloved who was not beloved;” and elsewhere, “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations,” so too the Lord Jesus to Ananias: “Go, for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before all nations.”
