It is good to be inebriated on the cup of salvation. There is also the intoxication arising from the riches of Scripture. There is, too, the inebriation that follows on the infusion of the Holy Spirit. We read in the Acts of the Apostles of those who spoke in foreign tongues and appeared, to those who heard them, to be drunk on new wine. In brief, the house is the church; the riches of the house is the abundance of grace; the torrent of delight is the Holy Spirit.
