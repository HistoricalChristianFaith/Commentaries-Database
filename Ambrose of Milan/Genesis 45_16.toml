And Pharaoh rejoiced because Joseph had known his brothers. From there the news spread in Pharaohâ€™s house, and he urged the holy Joseph to invite his brothers to come with their father. He also gives orders that their packs be filled with grain and loaded onto wagons. What can account for such consideration shown to a stranger? Only that a great mystery was being revealed, a mystery the church today does not deny. The Jews will be redeemed; the Christian people will rejoice at this union, give aid to the limit of their resources and send people to preach the good news of the kingdom of God, so that their call may come sooner.
