It was not the Father who divested himself of the flesh; for not the Father, but, as we read, the Word was made flesh. You see, then, that the Arians, in dividing the Father from the Son, run into danger of saying that the Father endured passion. We, however, can easily show that the words treat of the Son’s action, for the Son himself indeed raised his own body again, as he himself said: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” And he himself quickens us together with his body: “For as the Father raises the dead and quickens them, so also the Son quickens whom he will.” … He, therefore, who has achieved the work of our resurrection, is plainly pointed out to be truly God.
