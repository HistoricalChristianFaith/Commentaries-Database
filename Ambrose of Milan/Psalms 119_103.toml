The soul presses forward for a glimpse of hidden mysteries, to the very abode of the Word, to the very dwelling place of that highest Good, and his light and brightness. In that bosom and secret dwelling place of the Father the soul hastens to hear his words, and having heard them, it finds them sweeter than all things. Let the prophet who has tasted this sweetness teach you, when he says, “How sweet are your words to my lips, above honeycomb to my mouth.” What else can a soul desire when it has once tasted the sweetness of the Word, when it has once seen its brightness? When Moses remained on the mountain forty days to receive the law, he had no need of food for the body. Elijah, resting [under a broom tree], asked that his life be taken away from him. Even Peter, foreseeing on the mountain the glory of the Lord’s resurrection, did not wish to come down and said, “Lord, it is good for us to be here.” How great is the glory of that divine Essence, how great the graces of the Word at which even angels wish to gaze!
