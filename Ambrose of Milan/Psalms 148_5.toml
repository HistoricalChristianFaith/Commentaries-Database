The causes of the beginnings of all things are seeds. And the apostle of the Gentiles has said that the human body is a seed. And so in succession after sowing there is the substance that is needed for the resurrection. But even if there were no substance and no cause, who could think it difficult for God to create people anew whence he will and as he wills. Who commanded the world to come into being out of no matter and no substance? Look at the heaven, behold the earth. Whence are the fires of the stars? Whence the orb and rays of the sun? Whence the globe of the moon? Whence the mountain heights, the hard rocks, the woody groves? Whence are the air diffused around, and the waters, whether enclosed or poured abroad? But if God made all these things out of nothing (for “he spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created”), why should we wonder that which has been should be brought to life again, since we see produced that which had not been?

God has no need of human assistance. God commanded the heavens to come into existence, and it was done. He decided to create the earth, and it was created. Who carried the stones on his shoulders? Who paid the cost? Who helped him with the work? These things were done in a moment. Do you want to know how quickly? “He spoke, and they were made.” If the material universe sprang into being at a word, why should not the dead also rise again at a word?
