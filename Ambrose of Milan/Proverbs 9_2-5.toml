“Come, eat my bread and drink my wine which I have mingled for you.” Do you find delight in songs which charm the banqueter? Listen to the voice of the church, who exhorts us not only in canticles but in the Canticle of Canticles, “Eat, O friends, and drink and be inebriated, my brethren.” But this inebriation makes people sober. This inebriation is one of grace, not of intoxication.

“Come and eat of my bread and drink the wine which I have mixed for you.” Plato judged that the discourse over this bowl should be copied into his books, he summoned forth souls to drink of it, but did not know how to fill them, for he provided not the drink of faith but that of unbelief.

And so he comes; whether you eat or drink, if you call upon Christ he is present, saying, “Come, eat of my bread and drink of my wine.” Even if you are asleep, he is knocking at the door. He comes, I say, frequently and reaches in through the window. Frequently (but not always and not to everyone) he comes to that soul which can say, “At night I had put off my garment.” For in this night of the world the garment of corporeal life is first to be taken off as the Lord divested himself in his flesh that for you he might triumph over the dominions and powers of this world.
