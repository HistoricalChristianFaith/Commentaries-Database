He said, I do not have a man; that is, because through a man is death, and through a man is the resurrection of the dead. He could not descend, he could not be saved, who did not believe that our Lord Jesus had taken flesh from the Virgin. But this one who was waiting for the mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, expecting him of whom it was said: And the Lord will send a man to save them; he said: I do not have a man; and therefore he deserved to come to health, because he believed in the one who was coming.
