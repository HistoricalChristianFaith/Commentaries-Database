But if heretics deny that either the heavens or the earth were made by you, O Lord, let them take heed of the abyss into which they are hurling themselves by their own madness. The prophet writes, “Perish the gods that have not made heaven and earth.” Shall he then perish, O Arian, who had found and saved that which had perished?

“Who has understood the sense of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor or has taught him?” Of him we also read elsewhere: “For he holds the circuit of the earth and made the earth as nothing.” And Jeremiah says, “The gods that have not made heaven and earth will perish from the earth and from among those places that are under heaven. He that made the earth by his power and prepared the world by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens at his knowledge and a multitude of waters in the heaven.” And he adds, “Humankind is become a fool for knowledge.” How can one who pursues the corruptible things of the world and thinks that from these things he can comprehend the truth of divine nature not become a fool as he makes use of the artifices of sophistry?
