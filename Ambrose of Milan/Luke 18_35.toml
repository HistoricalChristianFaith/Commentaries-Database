In the Gospel according to St. Matthew, two men are depicted, but Luke depicts one. Matthew depicts it as Jesus was leaving Jericho, but Luke as he was approaching the city. Otherwise there is no difference. The image of the Gentile people is in this case one man who through the divine blessing received the clarity of his lost sight. It makes no difference whether the Gentile people received the healing through one or two blind men since, taking the origin from Ham and Japheth, sons of Noah, they set out the two authors of their race in two blind men.
