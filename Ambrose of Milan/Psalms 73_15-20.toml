And therefore I conferred with my heart and I said to myself, “if I will speak thus, that I have justified my heart in vain,” and the voice of God replied to me and said, “Behold the generation of your children, to which I have made distribution.” This means: Behold, you find in the Scriptures, O you son of Adam, that I have made distribution to the generation of your children, that wealth may be granted to the wicked simply by chance and not from some merit. Neither are the rewards of virtue the profits of a treasury, just as poverty … is not a punishment for sin. But such things come without distinction, for they roll along on a kind of flow of life that is like a river.

Such, then, is the first supposition of true knowledge, that things in the world happen by chance. The second is that “on account of the subterfuges you have placed before them” prodigious success, worldly profits and an abundance of riches. Otherwise, they might plead by way of excuse that they had been less devout by reason of want or of some bitter pain or grief and had been driven to the guilt of robbery and to the desire to plunder under compulsion of poverty. For they were enriched with wealth and exalted with honors, not for tranquility of life or the enjoyment of delight but that complaining might be foreclosed and distress piled up.

Therefore, in regard to the latter, David also says, “They have ceased to be and have perished by reason of their iniquity as the dream of one that wakes up.” This means: The wicked cease to be, and they disappear as a dream does when one first wakes up from sleep, “because they are in darkness and have walked in darkness”;7 not a trace of their good work remains, but they are like those who see a dream. Now one who dreams, dreams at night, whereas night is in darkness. The children of darkness are deprived of the Sun of justice and the splendor of virtue, for they sleep always and do not keep watch, and of them it is appropriately said, “They have slept their sleep and have found nothing.” For indeed, when their souls are separated from the body, and they are, as it were, released from the sleep of the body, they will find nothing, they will possess nothing, and they will lose what they thought they possessed. For although the unwise and foolish person may overflow with riches, he will leave his riches to strangers, and the glory of his house will not descend to hell together with him.

Subsequent events also go to show how the image of such a person is not found but perishes, since his image is not found in the city of the Lord, that Jerusalem which is above. For the Lord has painted us in his image and likeness, even as he teaches us, saying, “Behold, O Jerusalem, I have painted your walls.” If we have acted well, that heavenly image continues in us; if anyone acts badly, this image is destroyed in him that is the image of him who came down from heaven, and there is in him the image of the earthly. On this account also the apostle says, “Even as we have borne the image of the one that is earthly, let us bear also the image of the other that is heavenly.” Therefore, the images of good continue to shine forth in that city of God. But if anyone has turned aside to graver sins and has not done penance, his image is destroyed or else cast out even as Adam was cast out and excluded from paradise. But whoever has conducted himself in a holy and honorable fashion enters into that city of God15 and brings in his own image so that it may shine in that city of God. “O Lord, in your city you shall reduce their images to nothing,” because those who have clothed themselves with the works of darkness cannot shine in the light. Let us adduce an example from the world. See how the images of good rulers continue in cities, whereas the images of tyrants are destroyed.
