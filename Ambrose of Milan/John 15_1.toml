Jacob spoke of [our Lord as] a grape, because Christ hung on the wood like a grape. He is the vine; he is the grape. He is the vine because he cleaves to the wood and the grape because, when his side was opened by the soldier’s lance, he sent forth water and blood3 … water for baptism, blood for redemption. The water washed us; the blood redeemed us.
