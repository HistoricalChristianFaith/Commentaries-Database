This monster’s cavern [of heresies], your sacred Majesty, is thick laid (as seafaring men do say it is) with hidden lairs, and all the surrounding neighborhood, where the rocks of unbelief echo to the howling of her black dogs, we must pass by with ears stopped up. For it is written: “Hedge your ears about with thorns” and again: “Beware of dogs. Beware of evil workers”;6 and yet again: “One who is a heretic, avoid after the first reproof knowing that such a one is fallen and is in sin, being condemned of his own judgment.” So then, like prudent pilots, let us set the sails of our faith for the course wherein we may pass by most safely and again follow the coasts of the Scriptures.
