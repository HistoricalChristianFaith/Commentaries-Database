We do not read of [Moses], as we do of others, that he fell sick and died. We read that “he died by the word of God”—for God does not grow weak or undergo diminution or addition. Hence Scripture added, “No man has known of his sepulcher until this present day”—by which we are to understand that he was taken up into heaven rather than buried, for death may be called a separation of the soul from the body. He died therefore as the Scripture states: “by the word of God”—not “in accordance with the word”—so as to make known that this was not an announcement of his death but was more in the nature of a gracious gift to one who was translated rather than left here and whose sepulcher was known to no one.
