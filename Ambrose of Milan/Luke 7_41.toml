Who are those two debtors if not the two peoples, the one from the Jews, the other from the Gentiles, in debt to the Creditor of the heavenly treasure? … We do not owe this Creditor material wealth but standards of merits, accounts of virtues. The weight of seriousness, the likeness of righteousness, and the sound of confession measure the worth of this wealth. Woe is me if I do not have what I have received. One can pay off the whole debt to this Creditor only with difficulty. Woe is me if I do not ask, “Remit my debt.” The Lord would not have taught us to pray for the forgiveness of our sins if he had not known that some would be worthy debtors, only with difficulty. … There is nothing that we can worthily repay to God for the harm to the flesh he assumed, for the blows, the cross, the death and the burial. Woe is me if I have not loved! I dare to say that Peter did not repay and thereby loved more. Paul did not repay. He certainly repaid death for death, but he did not repay other debts, because he owed much. I hear him saying, because he did not repay, “Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?” Even if we were to repay cross for cross, death for death, do we repay that we possess all things from him, by him, and in him? Let us repay love for our debt, charity for the gift, and grace for wealth. He to whom more is given loves more. ,
