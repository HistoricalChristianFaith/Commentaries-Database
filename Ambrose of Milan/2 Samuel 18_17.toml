What should I say of Peter, who went up to the roof at the sixth hour and learned there the mystery of the baptism of the Gentiles? On the other hand, the murderer Absalom set up a pillar to himself in the valley of the king and was thrown into a ditch when he was slain. Thus the saints go up to the Lord, the wicked go down to sin; the saints are on the mountains, the guilty in the valleys, “For he is the God of the mountains and not the God of the valleys.”
