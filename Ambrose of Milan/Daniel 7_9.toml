Let him then be standing for you that you may not be afraid of him sitting; for when sitting he judges, as Daniel says, “the thrones were placed, and the books were opened, and the Ancient of Days did sit.” But in Psalm 81 [82] it is written, “God stood in the congregation of gods and decides among the gods.” So then when he sits he judges, when he stands he decides, and he judges concerning the imperfect but decides among the gods. Let him stand for you as a defender, as a good shepherd, lest the fierce wolves assault you.
