We observe … that when Scripture speaks of “the Lord’s hand,” it refers to temptation that a person undergoes from the attacks of Satan.… When the devil wounds him, the arrows are the Lord’s, and it is the Lord who has given Satan the power of hurting him.… There is, too, that … reason why the Lord gives power to the tempter; it is so that one’s love might be tested by temptations. That is why there are persecutions, so that faith may shine out and virtue excel and the inner thoughts of one’s heart may be made manifest to all.
