Comprehend, if you can, how pain passes at the contact with the Savior’s hand, and wounds are healed not when sprinkled with a cure, but when covered with his touch. The clay recognizes its maker, and the flesh follows the hand of the Lord who formed it, for the creator repairs his work as he wishes. Thus in another place, vision is restored to the blind man after clay is spread on his eyes, as if he had returned to nature. He could have commanded but preferred to act, so that we should realize that it is he himself who from the dust of the earth fashioned the limbs of our bodies, suited to different functions, and quickened us with infused strength of mind.
