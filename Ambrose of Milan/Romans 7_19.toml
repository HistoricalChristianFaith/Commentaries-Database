In fact, I would not have known sin if the law had not said: You shall not covet. And further: Without the law, sin is dead. For what benefit is it to me to know what I cannot avoid? What benefit is it to me to know that the law of my flesh opposes me? Paul is opposed, and he sees the law of his flesh resisting the law of his mind, and he is held captive under the law of sin, and does not presume of his own conscience; but by the grace of Christ, he trusts that he will be liberated from the body of death: and do you think that anyone who knows cannot sin? Paul says: For I do not do the good that I want, but the evil that I do not want, that I do: and do you think that knowledge benefits man, which increases envy of sin?
