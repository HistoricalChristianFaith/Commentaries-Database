And lest any one should perhaps think that, as the Scripture says, “God raised up the Holy Spirit of a young youth,” the spirit in him was that of a person, not the Holy Spirit, let him read farther on, and he will find that Daniel received the Holy Spirit and therefore prophesied. Lastly, too, the king advanced him because he had the grace of the Spirit. For he speaks thus: “Daniel, you are able, forasmuch as the Holy Spirit of God is in you.” And farther on it is written: “And Daniel was set over them, because an excellent Spirit was in him.”
