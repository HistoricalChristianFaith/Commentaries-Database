Do you wish to know how it is consecrated with heavenly words? Accept what the words are. The priest speaks. He says: “Perform for us this oblation written, reasonable, acceptable, which is a figure of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. On the day before he suffered he took bread in his holy hands, looked toward heaven, toward you, holy Father omnipotent, eternal God, giving thanks, blessed, broke, and having broken it gave it to the apostles and his disciples,” saying: “Take and eat of this, all of you; for this is my body, which shall be broken for many.” Take note. Before it is consecrated, it is bread; but when Christ’s words have been added, it is the body of Christ.
