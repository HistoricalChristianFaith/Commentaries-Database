Love faith. For by his devotion and faith Josiah won great love for himself from his enemies. For he celebrated the Lord’s Passover when he was eighteen years old, as no one had done it before him. As then in zeal he was superior to those who went before him, so do you, my children, show zeal for God. Let zeal for God search you through and devour you, so that each one of you may say, “The zeal of your house has eaten me up.” An apostle of Christ was called the zealot. But why do I speak of an apostle? The Lord himself said, “The zeal of your house has eaten me up.” Let it then be real zeal for God, not mean earthly zeal, for that causes jealousy.
