To this verdure of grace ever-flourishing in Christ the church refers in saying, “I sat down under his shadow whom I desired.” The apostles received this privileged gift of verdure, whose leaves could never fall, so as to provide shade for the healing of the sick. Their fidelity of heart and the superabundance of their merits provided shade for bodily infirmities.

“As an apple tree among the trees of the woods, so is my beloved among young men.” And seeing this, the church is glad and rejoices, saying with great delight, “I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.”
