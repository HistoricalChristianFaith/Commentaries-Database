Joseph hurried to receive a blessing. Indeed, he presented his sons Manasseh and Ephraim, and Jacob blessed them. Because Jacob had twelve sons, and Paul, as one chosen later, was going to be the thirteenth apostle, a thirteenth tribe would thus be sanctified from the descendants of Manasseh and Ephraim, and divided between them both. Thus Paul would not appear outside the enumeration of the tribes of the fathers; as an outstanding preacher of the Old and the New Testaments, he would readily confirm that the inheritance of a fatherâ€™s blessing was of help to himself as well.
