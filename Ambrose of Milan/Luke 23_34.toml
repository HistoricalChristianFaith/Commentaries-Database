It is important to consider what type of man ascends. I see him naked. Let him who prepares to conquer this age ascend in this way so that he does not seek the help of the age. Adam, who desired clothing, was conquered. He who laid down his clothes conquered. He ascended in the same way that nature formed us with God as Creator. In the same way as the first Adam lived in Paradise, the second Adam entered paradise. In order not to conquer for only himself but for all, he held out his hands26 to draw all things to himself. Having wrenched them from the bonds of death and hung them on the yoke of faith, he joined those of heaven to those who before were of earth.
