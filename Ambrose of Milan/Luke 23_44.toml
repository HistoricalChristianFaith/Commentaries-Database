“Saying this, he gave up his Spirit.” He suitably “gave up” the Spirit, because he willingly gave him up. Matthew says “yielded up his Spirit,” because what is yielded is spontaneous, but what is lost is unavoidable. Since this is true, he added, “with a loud voice.” He did this with a glorious declaration that he descended to death for our sins. I do not blush to confess what Christ did not blush to proclaim in a loud voice. This was a clear revelation of God witnessing to the separation of the Godhead and the flesh.

The veil is torn. This declared the division of the two peoples or the profanation of the mysteries of the synagogue. The old veil is torn, so that the church may hang the new veils of its faith. The veil of the synagogue is taken away, so that we may see the inner mysteries of religion with unveiled eyes of the mind. Even the centurion confesses the Son of God whom he had crucified.
