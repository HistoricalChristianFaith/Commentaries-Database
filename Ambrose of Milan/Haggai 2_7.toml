How the disposition of the earth therefore depends upon the power of God, you may learn also where it is written: “He looks upon the earth and makes it tremble,” and elsewhere: “once again I move the earth.” Therefore the earth remains immovable not by its balances, but it is moved frequently by the nod and free will of God, as Job too says: “The Lord shakes it from its foundations, and its pillars tremble.” And elsewhere: “Hell is naked before him, and there is not covering for death. He stretches out the north over the empty space and hangs the earth upon nothing. He binds up the waters in his clouds. The pillars of heaven that fled away are in dread at his rebuke. By his power the seas are calmed, by his wisdom is struck down the sea monster, and the gates of heaven fear him.” By the will of God, therefore, the earth remains immovable. “The earth stands forever,” according to Ecclesiastes, yet it is moved by nods according to the will of God. It does not therefore continue to exist because it is based on its own foundations. It does not stay stable because of its own props. The Lord established it by the support of his will, because “in his hand are all the ends of the earth.” The simplicity of this faith is worth all the proffered proofs.
