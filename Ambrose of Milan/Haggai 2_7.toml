Therefore, gather from this that the establishment of the earth is in the power of God, as it is written: "He looks at the earth, and it trembles." And elsewhere: "Yet once more I shake the earth." Therefore, it does not remain motionless in its balance, but it is frequently moved by the will and power of God, as even Job says: "For the Lord shakes it from its foundation; its pillars tremble." And elsewhere: "The naked underworld is in his sight, and there is no covering for death, extending the North for nothing, suspending the earth into nothingness, binding the water in his clouds... The pillars of the heavens tremble and quake at his reproof; by his power he stilled the sea, by his understanding he struck down Rahab." Therefore, it does not rely on its own foundations, nor does it persist stable on its own supports; but the Lord has established it and sustains it by the firmness of His will; for all the ends of the earth are in His hand. And this simplicity of faith surpasses all arguments.
