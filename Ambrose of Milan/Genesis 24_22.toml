For this also is evidence of familiar association with the virtues, that each person walks about in the innocence of … heart, in no wise involves himself in earthly vices, and with the mind’s unhindered step takes the path that is without reproach and does not open up any place in himself to corruption.Such was Isaac as he awaited Rebekah’s coming and made ready for a spiritual union. For she came already endowed with heavenly mysteries. She came bearing mighty adornments in her ears and on her arms, because in her hearing and in the works of her hands there is clearly revealed the beauty of the church, and we note that it was rightly said to her, “May you become thousands of myriads, and may your seed possess the cities of their enemies.” Therefore the church is beautiful, for it has acquired sons from hostile nations. But this passage can be interpreted in reference to the soul, which subdues the bodily passions, turns them to the service of the virtues and makes resistant feelings subject to itself. And so the soul of the patriarch Isaac, seeing the mystery of Christ, seeing Rebekah coming with vessels of gold and silver, as if she were the church with the people of the nations, and marveling at the beauty of the Word and of his sacraments, says, “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” And Rebekah, seeing the true Isaac, that true joy and true source of mirth, desires to kiss him.
