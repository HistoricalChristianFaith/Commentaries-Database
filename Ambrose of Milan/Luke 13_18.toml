If the kingdom of heaven is as a grain of mustard seed, and faith is as a grain of mustard seed, surely faith is the kingdom of heaven and the kingdom of heaven is faith. One who has faith has the kingdom. The kingdom and faith is among us. We read, “The kingdom of heaven is within you,” and “Have faith in yourselves.” Peter, who had all faith, received the keys of the kingdom of heaven to unlock it also for others.
