Not understanding this, the ruler of the synagogue commanded that no one should be healed on the sabbath since the sabbath is an image of a future day of rest, days of rest from evil deeds, not from good works. It is commanded that, neither bearing the burden of offenses nor being devoid of good works, we shall celebrate future sabbaths after death. The Lord then is seen to reply spiritually when he says, “You hypocrites, does not every one of you on the sabbath day untie his ox or his donkey and lead them to water?” Why did Jesus mention another creature? He showed the future to his opponents, the rulers of the synagogue. The Jewish and the Gentile peoples would lay aside the thirst of the body and the world’s heat through the abundance of the Lord’s fountain. “The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s feeding trough.” The people who were fed on the food of common hay, which before it is plucked up is withered away, received the Bread that came down from heaven.
