[[commentary]]

By “brass heaven” Scripture means that the heavens are shut up and deny their benefit to the earth. And the earth is iron when it rejects crops and refuses to receive. It is as if in hostile hardness the seed is cast upon the earth, which should be a fruitful field, but it is hard and hostile. The earth ought to nourish the seeds as if in the bosom of a gentle mother. But when does iron bear fruit? When does copper let loose showers?
