“How good is God to Israel, to them that are right in heart!” Growth in moral perfection is evident as a theme from the beginning of the psalm. Indeed, no one can truly proclaim that God is good but one who knows that goodness is not from his own successes and profits but out of the depth of the heavenly mysteries and the height of God’s plan. For it is to be weighed not by the appearance of things present but by the advantage of things to come. Consequently, to the just person God is always good. Whether tormented by bodily pain or overwhelmed by bitter punishments, he always says, “If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, why do we not bear up under those that are evil?” He rejoices that he is being chastised here, so that he may gain consolation for the future; he knows that one who has received good things in this life has his reward. The person who has not struggled or been tried in the combat of various contests will not be able to hope for future rewards.

Indeed, in what follows, David describes his own experience when he says, “But my feet were almost moved, my steps had well nigh slipped, for I was envious in the case of sinners, when I saw the peace of sinners.” He is surely not speaking of bodily feet and bodily steps but of the uprightness of the heart and of the step concerning which he says in another passage, “Let not the foot of pride come to me and let not the hand of sinners move me.” And so, we ought always to ask that the Lord may direct the footsteps of our spirits. Else they may fall, slip in a kind of morass of error and be unable to maintain their firm hold. Moreover, the reason for David’s fall is that he emulated the peace of sinners. But we ought to emulate what is good, not what is filled with shame, even as the apostle Paul also put it when he said, “to emulate the good is always a good thing.”
