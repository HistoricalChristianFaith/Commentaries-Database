For what is asked of you, O man? Only that you fear God: seek for him, walk after him, follow in his ways. “With what shall I win over the Lord? Shall I win him over with burnt offerings?” The Lord is not reconciled, nor are sins redeemed, with tens of thousands of young goats or thousands of rams or with the fruits of unholiness, but the grace of the Lord is won with a good life.
