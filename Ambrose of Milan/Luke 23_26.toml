Christ therefore bearing His cross, already as a conqueror carried His trophies. The cross is laid upon His shoulders, because whether Simon or Himself bore it, both Christ bore it in the man, and the man in Christ. Nor do the accounts of the Evangelists differ, since the mystery reconciles them. And it is the rightful order of our advance that Christ should first Himself erect the trophy of His cross, then handit down to be raised by His martyrs. He is not a Jew who bears the cross, but an alien and aforeigner, nor does he precede but follow, according as it is written, Let him take up his cross, and follow me.
