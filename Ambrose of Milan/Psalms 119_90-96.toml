If we are to believe this [that God knows the past, present and future] about the ages, much more must we believe it about the day of judgment, on the ground that the Son of God has knowledge of it, as being already made by him. For it is written, “According to your ordinance the day will continue.” He did not merely say “the day continues” but even “will continue,” so that the things that are to come might be governed by his ordinance. Does he not know what he ordered? “He who planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who formed the eye, shall he not see?”
