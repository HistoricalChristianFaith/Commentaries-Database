Scripture also says in the book called Numbers: “Amalek, the beginning of nations, whose seed will be destroyed.” And of course Amalek is not the first of all nations. Amalek in fact is interpreted to mean the king of the wicked, and by the wicked it is intended to mean the Gentiles. There is no reason why we should not accept him as one whose seed shall perish. His seed are the wicked and the unfaithful, to whom the Lord says, “You are the voice of your father the devil.” .
