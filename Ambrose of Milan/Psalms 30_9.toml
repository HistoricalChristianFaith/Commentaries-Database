God first predestined us and then called us.… Can he abandon those whom he has honored with his mighty benefits even to the point of their reward?… Can Christ then condemn you, when he redeemed you from death and offered himself on your behalf, and when he knows that your life is what was gained by his death? Will he not say, “What profit is there in my blood,” if I condemn the one whom I myself have saved?… Can he give a sentence that is very harsh when he prays continually that the grace of reconciliation with the Father be granted us?
