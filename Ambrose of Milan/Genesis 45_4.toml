“Come to me,” because I have come near to you, yes, even so far that I made myself a sharer in your nature by taking on flesh. At least do not flee a partaker of your fellowship, if you do not know the Author of your salvation. “And they came to him, and he said, ‘I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. Now therefore be not grieved, and let it not seem to you a hard case that you sold me here; for God sent me before you for life.’ ” What fraternal devotion!… Christ would even excuse his brothers’ crime and say that it was God’s providence and not humanity’s wickedness, since he was not offered up to death by humans but was sent by the Lord to life. What else is the meaning of that intervention made by our Lord Jesus Christ, who excelled all his brothers in holiness? When he was on the cross, Jesus said in behalf of the people, “Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing.” … And when they were startled and panic-stricken and thought they saw a spirit, again Jesus said to them, “Why are you disturbed, and why do doubts arise in your hearts? See my hands and feet, that it is I myself. Feel and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.”
