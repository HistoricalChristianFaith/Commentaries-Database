Micah means “one who is from God,” or, as we find elsewhere, “one who is the son of the Morashite,” in other words son of the heir. Who is the heir but the Son of God, who says, “All things have been delivered to me by the Father,” who, being the heir, wished us to be co-heirs. It is well to ask, “Who is he?” He is not one of the people but one chosen to receive the grace of God, through whom the Holy Spirit speaks. He began to prophesy in the days of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah. By this order the progress of the vision is signified, for it goes from the times of evil kings to those of the good king.
