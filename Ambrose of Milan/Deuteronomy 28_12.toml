The good God reveals an understanding of this gift to his saints and gives it “from his good treasury,” as the sacred law attests, when it says, “The Lord swore to your fathers to give to you” and to open “his good treasury.” From this heavenly treasury he gives rain to his earth “to bless all the works of your hands.” The rain is this: “the utterance” of the law, which falls like dew upon the soul that is fecund and fertile with good works, so that it may possess the moisture of grace.
