The soul too wishes to arrive at the prize that it longs to obtain. And so it wisely asks that it be drawn, because not all are able to follow. Indeed, when Peter said, “Where are you going?” the Word of God replied, “Where I am going, you cannot follow me now. But you will follow afterward.” The Lord had entrusted to him the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and yet Peter judged himself unequal to following. The Lord did not put off this soul, however, for Peter was not presuming but asking.
