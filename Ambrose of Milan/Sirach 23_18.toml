We are always to walk becomingly, as in the day, and reject the works of darkness. We know that the night has been appointed for the rest of the body, not for carrying out some task or activity, and therefore it is at night that we pass into sleep and blissful oblivion. “We are not to be involved in feasting and drunkenness, in orgies and immodesty.” We should not say, “The darkness and the walls hide us, and goodness knows if the Most High will succeed in seeing us.” We are instead to love the light and be honest in our dealings, so that, like walking in the sunlight, we want our works to be resplendent in the presence of God.
