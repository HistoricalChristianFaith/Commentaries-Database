Therefore, let us always walk as if in the day, and let us cast off the works of darkness. For we know that night is given for the rest of the body, not for the pursuit of any task or work, which is passed in sleep and oblivion. Let there not be among us revelry, drunkenness, debauchery. Let us not say: Darkness and walls cover us, and who knows if the Most High will see? But let there be among us a love of light and a care for honesty, so that as if walking in daylight, we may desire our works to shine before God, to whom be honor, praise, and glory, perpetuity from age to age, now and forever, and for all ages of ages. Amen.
