Nor was Mary less than was befitting the mother of Christ. When the apostles fled, she stood before the cross and with reverent gaze beheld her Son’s wounds, for she awaited not her child’s death but the world’s salvation. Or perhaps that “regal chamber” knew that through her Son’s death would be the world’s redemption, and through her own death she thought she would give herself for the common good. But Jesus had no need of a helper in redeeming all, for he saved all without a helper. Therefore he says, “I have become as a man without help, free among the dead.” Indeed, he received the devotion of his parent, but he did not seek another’s aid.
