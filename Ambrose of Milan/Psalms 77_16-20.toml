This is not the only example of the obedience of water available to us, for elsewhere we find it written, “The waters saw you, O God; the waters saw you, and they were afraid.” What is said here of the waters does not seem to be without a semblance of truth, since elsewhere the prophet also speaks in the same manner: “The sea saw and fled; Jordan was turned back.” Who does not know how in actual fact the sea fled at the crossing of the Hebrews? When the waters were divided, the people crossed over, believing because of the dust under their feet that the sea had fled and that the waters had vanished. Therefore, the Egyptian believed what he saw and entered in, but the waters that had fled returned for him. The waters, then, know how to gather, how to fear and how to flee, when commanded to do so by God. Let us imitate these waters, and let us recognize one congregation of the Lord, one church.
