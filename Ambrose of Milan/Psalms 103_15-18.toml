Concerning the resurrection more will be said later; but now let us return to our immediate subject. We have shown that even holy people have, without any consideration for their merits, suffered many difficult things in this world, together with toil and misery. So David, in self-reflection, says, “Remember, Lord, that we are dust; as for [a] man, his days are but as grass”; and in another place, “[A] man is like a breath, his days pass away as a shadow.” For what is more wretched than we, who are sent into this life as it were plundered and naked, with frail bodies, deceitful hearts, weak minds, anxious in regard to cares, slothful as to labor, prone to pleasures.
