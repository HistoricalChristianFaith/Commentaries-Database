Indeed they are expressed in the same words, so that we may know that Jesus is the same who spoke before in Joseph and afterward in his own body, seeing that he did not change even the words. For at that time Jesus said, “Be not grieved,” and later, “Go up to my father and say to him, ‘Thus says your son Joseph: God has made me master of the whole land of Egypt.’ ” And in the Gospel Christ says, “Do not be afraid. Go, tell my brothers to go into Galilee, and there they shall see me.” And later he says, “All power in heaven and on earth has been given to me,” which is to say, “This was the doing of God’s design in order that I might receive power, and not the work of human cruelty.” He who is counting out the reward does not reproach the crime. Now as to what appears in Genesis, “for God sent me before you to life,” Christ repeats this in the Gospel when he says, “Teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” For this is the recompense and the life of the saints, that they have also brought about the redemption of others. And notice that the following too was not written without purpose in Genesis, “And you will be near me, you and your sons and your sons’ sons.” For this is what Christ said in the Gospel, “Behold, I am with you all days, even unto the consummation of the world.” How clear also is that mystery! For when every commandment had been fulfilled, so to speak, Joseph embraced his brother Benjamin and fell upon his neck. Likewise, when the gospel is brought to completion, Christ embraces Paul in the arms of his mercy, as it were, so as to lift him up into heaven.
