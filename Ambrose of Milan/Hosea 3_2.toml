Those are the seven and eight of which Hosea says that with this number he bought and took to himself the fullness of faith, for you read, “And I went and bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver and for a core of barley and for a half core of barley and a measure of wine.” The Lord had told him previously to buy a harlot, and it is proof that he bought her, since he declares how much he paid. The fifteen pieces of silver consist of seven and eight.
