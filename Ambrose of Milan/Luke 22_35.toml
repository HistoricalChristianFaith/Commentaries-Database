Why do you who forbid me to wield a sword now command me to buy one? Why do you command me to have what you forbid me to draw? Perhaps he may command this so that a defense may be prepared, not as a necessary revenge, but that you may be seen to have been able to be avenged but to be unwilling to take revenge. The law does not forbid me to strike back. You say to Peter when he offers two swords, “It is enough,” as if it were permitted even to the gospel…. This seems wicked to many, but the Lord is not wicked, he who when he could take revenge chose to be sacrificed. There is also a spiritual sword, so that you may sell your inheritance and purchase the Word, which clothes the innermost parts of the mind. There is also the sword of suffering, so that you may lay aside the body…. The disciples may have offered two swords: one of the New and one of the Old Testament, with which we are armed against the deceits of the devil. Then the Lord says, “It is enough,” as if nothing is lacking to him whom the teaching of each Testament has strengthened.
