Afterward, when the blessing had been pronounced, the elder brother arrived. By this it is revealed that the kingdom was predestined to be bestowed on the church rather than on the synagogue but had secretly entered the synagogue so that sin might abound, and, when sin had abounded, that grace might also abound. At the same time, it would be clear that the candidate for the kingdom of heaven must be quick to carry off the blessing and to appropriate the prerogative for which he has been recommended. On this account the younger son was not blamed by his father but praised, for Isaac says, “Your brother came deceitfully and received your blessing.” For deceit is good when the plunder is without reproach. Now the plunder of piety is without reproach, because “from the days of John the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent bear it away.” Our fathers celebrated the Passover in haste and ate the lamb in haste, not making delay, and the holy Joseph summoned his brother Benjamin by a holy fabrication and deceit.
