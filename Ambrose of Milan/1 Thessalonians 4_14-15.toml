All men shall rise again, but let no one lose heart, and let not the just grieve at the common lot of rising again, since he awaits the chief fruit of his virtue. All indeed shall rise again, but, as says the apostle, “each in his own order.” The fruit of the divine mercy is common to all, but the order of merit differs. The day gives light to all, the sun warms all, the rain fertilizes the possessions of all with genial flowers. We are all born, and we shall all rise again. But each shall be in his proper state, whether of living or living again, for grace differs and the condition differs.… Therefore he is aroused that he may live, that he may be like to Paul, that he may be able to say, “For we that are alive shall not precede those that are asleep.” He speaks here not of the common manner of life and the breath which we all alike now enjoy but of the future merit of the resurrection.
