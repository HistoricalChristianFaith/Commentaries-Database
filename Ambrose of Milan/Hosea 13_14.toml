No one could have known wisdom, because “no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” Therefore he revealed him to John, since wisdom was with the apostle, and so he spoke not his own thought but that which wisdom poured into him: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.” Death indeed could not hold it, for wisdom said, “O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?”
