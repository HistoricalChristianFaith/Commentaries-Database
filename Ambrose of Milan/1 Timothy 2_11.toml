I think the prohibition in the law against a man wearing female garments refers not so much to clothing as to manners and to our habits and actions, since one act is becoming to a man, another to a woman. Therefore, the apostle, as the interpreter of the law, says, “Let your women keep silence in the churches, for it is not permitted them to speak, but to be submissive, as the law says. But if they wish to learn anything, let them ask their husbands at home.” And to Timothy he says, “Let a women learn in quietness in all submissiveness. I permit no woman to teach or have authority over men.” How unsightly it is for a man to act like a woman!
