It is from heaven that mercy must be sought; it is from the oracle of the prophets that truth must be gatheredâ€”for they like clouds veil the mysteries of divine knowledge. God made darkness his covering, so that you would first receive the downpour of mystical fruitfulness, and then, refreshed with heavenly dew, have strength to gaze on the splendor of heavenly light.
