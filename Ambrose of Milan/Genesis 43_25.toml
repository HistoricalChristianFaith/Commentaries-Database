“And they made ready the presents, until Joseph came at noon.” Paul’s faith hastened the coming of noon. Before, Paul was blind; afterward he began to see the light of justice, because if anyone opens his way to the Lord and hopes in him, the Lord will also bring forth his justice as the light and his judgment as the noon. And when God appeared to Abraham by the oak of Mamre, it was noon, and the everlasting light from the Lord’s presence shone on him. It is noon when the real Joseph enters into his house to dine. The day shines more at that time, when we celebrate the sacred mysteries.
