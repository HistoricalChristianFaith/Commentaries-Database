This is a great sign of divine power and a great lesson of virtue. The intention of betrayal is revealed, and yet patience is not denied. You have shown, Lord, whom he betrayed, while you reveal the hidden things. You have also shown whom he betrayed, when you say “the Son of man,” because the flesh, not the Godhead, is meant. Nevertheless Christ even more refutes the ingratitude that betrayed him. Although he was the Son of God, yet for our sake he was willing to be the Son of man. It is as if he would say, “Because of you, ungrateful one, I took upon myself what you betray.” Look at the hypocrisy! I think it is exposed through the question that accuses the traitor with the compassion of love: “Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?” That is like saying, “Do you wound with the pledge of love, shed blood in the duty of charity, and give death with the instrument of peace? Do you, a servant, betray your Lord, a disciple his master, a chosen one the creator?” In other words, “The wounds of a friend are more useful than the voluntary kisses of an enemy.” He says this to a traitor. What does Christ say to a peacemaker? “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” He kissed Judas, not that Christ should teach us to pretend but that he should not appear to flee from betrayal. Hence he did not deprive Judas of the dues of love. It is written, “I was peaceful among those that hate peace.” –.

It must be used I think by way of question, as if he arrests the traitor with alover's affection.
He says, Betray you with a kiss? that is, do you inflict a wound with the pledge of love? with the instruments of peace do you impose death? a slave, do you betray your Lord; a disciple, your master; one chosen, Him who chose you? .
O great manifestation of Divine power, great discipline of virtue! Both the design of your traitor is detected, and yet forbearance is not withheld. He shows whom it is Judas betrays, by manifesting things hidden; He declares whom he delivers up, by saying, the Son of man, for the human flesh, not the Divine nature, is seized. That however which most confounds the ungrateful, is the thought that he had delivered up Him, who though He wasthe Son of God, yet for our sakes wished to be the Son of man; as if He said, &#8220;For you did I undertake, O ungrateful man, that which you betray in hypocrisy.
Our Lord kissed him, not that He would teach us to dissemble, but both that He might not seem to shrink from the traitor, and that He might the more move him by not denying him the offices of love.
For Peter being well versed in the law, and full of ardent affection, knowing that it was counted righteousness in Phineas that he had killed the sacrilegious persons, struck the High Priest's servant.
The Lord in wiping away the bloody wounds, conveyed thereby a divine mystery, namely, that the servant of the prince of this world, not by the condition of His nature but by guilt, should receive a wound on the ear, for that he had not heard the words of wisdom. Or, by Peter so willingly striking the ear, he taught that he ought not to have a ear outwardly, who had not one in a mystery. But why did Peter do this? Because he especially obtained the power of binding and loosing ,therefore by his spiritual sword he takes away the interior ear of him who understands not. But the Lord Himself restores the hearing, showing that even they, if they would turn, might be saved, who inflicted the wounds in our Lord's Passion; for that all sin may be washed away in the mysteries of faith.
