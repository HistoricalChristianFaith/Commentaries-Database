And Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you idle? Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy food for us.” This is not something Jacob said one time; he says it daily to his sons who come to Christ’s grace too late, “Why are you idle? Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.” From this grain there comes the grain that rises again. And so whoever suffers famine ought to attribute it to his own laziness. “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt.” Generally, indeed, younger men hear of something more quickly than their elders, for many of the former travel about and are engaged out of doors. But an old man is the first to hear of this business matter, yet an old man who has lived to a great age in faith, an old man whose old age is worthy of respect, and the time of his old age is a spotless life.
