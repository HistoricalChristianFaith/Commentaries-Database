Joseph was sold in Egypt because Christ was going to come to those to whom it was said, “It was for your sins that you were sold,” and thus he redeemed with his own blood those who had been sold by their own sins. But Christ was sold because he took our condition on himself, not our fault. He is not held to the price of sin, because he himself did not commit sin. And so he made a contract at a price for our debt, not for money but for himself. He took away the debtor’s bond, set aside the moneylender, freed the debtor. He alone paid what was owed by all. - "Joseph 4.19"
