Matthew depicts this woman pouring ointment upon Christ’s head, and perhaps therefore was reluctant to call her a sinner. According to Luke, a sinner poured ointment on Christ’s feet. She cannot be the same woman, lest the Evangelists seem to have contradicted each other.… If you understand this, you will see this woman, and you will certainly see her blessed wherever this gospel is preached. Her memory will never pass away, since she poured the fragrances of good conduct and the ointment of righteous deeds on the head of Christ.
