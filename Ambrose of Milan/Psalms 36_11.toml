Oh, beware of pride, for it plants its foot when all is going well and prosperously. Adam fell in paradise far more ruinously that if he had fallen on earth. To fall from great heights is precipitous; to fall on level ground is simply a case of losing one’s footing. The foot of the proud person strays, because he has lost his head. As Scripture says, “The eyes of a wise person are in his head.” Is it any wonder that feet go astray if a person has no eyes in his head? The eye leads, and the foot follows. You, who are on a journey, how can you make your way in the dark? We stumble easily by night, unless perhaps the moon, like a sort of eye of the world, should lend its beams and light the way. You are in the night of this world; let the church shed its light on your journey; let the sun of justice illumine you from on high. In that way, you need have no fear of falling.

Let not the actions of sinful people make me stir from the way of justice. For very often when we see sinners abounding in prosperity and enjoying great success, we waver in our allegiance; a sort of hand steals out from these sinners, and we are plucked from the root of virtue. Beware, beware, do not let the hand of the enemy uproot those whom the hand of God has planted in his house.
