The patriarchs had gone at first without Benjamin, and the apostles without Paul. Each came, not as the first, but was summoned by those who were the first, and by his arrival he made the goods of those who were first more plenteous. “There is grain in Egypt”; that is, where the famine is greater, the plenty is greater. There is much grain in Egypt. Surely, and God the Father says, “Out of Egypt I called my Son!” Such is the fecundity of that grain, for there could not have been a harvest unless the Egyptians had sown the grain earlier. There is, then, grain which no one earlier believed to exist; the patriarchs engage in negotiations in regard to this grain. And they indeed brought money, but the good Joseph gave them the grain and gave them back the money. For Christ is not bought with money but with grace; your payment is faith, and with it are bought God’s mysteries. Moreover, this grain is carried by the ass, which before was unclean according to the law but now is clean in grace.
