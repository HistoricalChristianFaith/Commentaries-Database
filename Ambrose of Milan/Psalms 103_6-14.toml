Therefore do not forget one who is weak. Remember, Lord, that you have made me weak. Remember that “you have fashioned me as dust.” How will I be able to stand, unless you direct your care always so as to strengthen this clay, so that my strength may proceed from your countenance? “When you turn away your face, all things will be troubled.” If you exercise your care, woe is me! You have nothing to behold in me but the contagion of sins. It is no use either to be abandoned or to be examined, for even while we are being looked on, we are committing offenses. Still, we can hold that God does not reject those whom he looks on, because he makes clean those whom he beholds. A fire blazes before him that burns away sin.
