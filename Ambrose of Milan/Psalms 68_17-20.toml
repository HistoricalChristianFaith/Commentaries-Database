It does not escape our notice that some copies have likewise, according to Luke: “How much more shall your heavenly Father give a good gift to them that ask him.” This good gift is the grace of the Spirit, which the Lord Jesus shed forth from heaven, after having been fixed to the gibbet of the cross, returning with the triumphal spoils of death deprived of its power, as you find it written: “Ascending up on high he led captivity captive, and gave good gifts to people.” And well does he say “gifts,” for as the Son was given, of whom it is written: “Unto us a Child is born, unto us a Son is given,” so, too, is the grace of the Spirit given. But why should I hesitate to say that the Holy Spirit also is given to us, since it is written: “The love of God is shed forth in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who is given to us.” And since captive hearts certainly could not receive him, the Lord Jesus first led captivity captive, that our affections being set free, he might pour forth the gift of divine grace.
