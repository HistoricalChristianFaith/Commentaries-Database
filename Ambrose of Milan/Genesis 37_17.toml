Now Joseph found his brothers in Dothan, which means “desertion.” And where is the person who deserts God but in desertion? No wonder if they deserted who did not hear him saying, “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” Therefore Joseph came to Dothan, “and they saw him coming from afar, before he drew near to them, and they raged that they might kill him.” It is right that they were far off who were in desertion, and so they were raging, because Christ had not drawn near to them. For if the model of Christ had drawn near to them, they would surely have loved their brother. But they could not be near, for they were plotting fratricide. “Behold, that dreamer is coming. Now therefore come, let us kill him.” Were not the men who were saying such words plotting a sacrilegious fratricide, as Solomon says of them, “Let us remove the just one, because he is profitless to us”?
