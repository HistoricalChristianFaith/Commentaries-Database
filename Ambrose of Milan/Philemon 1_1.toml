How many masters he has who runs from the one Lord. But let us not run from him. Who will run away from him whom they follow bound in chains, but willing chains, which loose and do not bind? Those who are bound with these chains boast and say: “Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy.” It is more glorious for us to be bound by him than to be set free and loosed from others.
