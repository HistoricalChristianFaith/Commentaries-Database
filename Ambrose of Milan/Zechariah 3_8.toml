Of him he speaks also through the mouth of Ezekiel, saying, “And I will set up one shepherd over them, and my servant David will rule them, and he will be their shepherd. And I the Lord will be their God, and my servant David the prince in the midst of them.” Of course, David the king was already dead, but the true David, the truly humble, the truly meek, the true Son of God, strong of hand, is foretold by this name. He also is pointed out in the book of the prophet Zechariah, God the father saying, “I will bring my servant, the Orient is his name.” Although he wore sin-soiled garments, was not the Sun of justice clothed with the splendor of his divinity?
