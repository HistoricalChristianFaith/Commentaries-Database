I dearly love those priests and deacons who, once they have finished a duty, do not allow themselves to remain away any longer. As the prophet says, “I am not weary following after you.” Who can be weary following Jesus, for he says, “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” Let us, then, always follow Jesus and never falter, for if we follow him, we never fail, because he gives his strength to his followers. The nearer you are to this strength, the stronger you will be. Sometimes, while we follow him, our adversaries say to us, “Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come.” Let us not grow weary of following him, and let us not be turned aside when confronted by a crafty question. It was said to the prophet when he was being sent to prison and cast into a pit of mire, “Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come.” But he followed it the more and therefore reached the goal and received the crown, because he was not weary following Jesus. “There is no weariness in Jacob, nor will sorrow be seen in Israel.”
