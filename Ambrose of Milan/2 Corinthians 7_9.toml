Hence Paul teaches us that that kind of sorrow is of value which has not this world but God as its end. It is right, he says, that you become sorrowful, so as to feel repentance in the face of God.… Take note of those who in the Old Testament were sorrowful in the midst of their bodily labors and who attained grace, while those who found delight in such pleasures continued to be punished. Hence the Hebrews, who groaned in the works of Egypt, attained the grace of the just and those “who ate bread with mourning and fear” were supplied with spiritual good.22.
