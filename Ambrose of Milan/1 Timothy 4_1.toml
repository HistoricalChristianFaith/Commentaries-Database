As for me, indeed, would that they might have a will to hear, that they might believe—to hear with true love and meekness, as men seeking what is true and not assailing all truth. For it is written that we pay no heed to “endless fables and genealogies, which do rather raise disputes than set forward the godly edification, which is in faith. But the aim of the charge is love from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and faith unfeigned, whence some have erred and betaken themselves to empty babbling. For they are desirous of being teachers of the law, without understanding the words they say, nor the things whereof they speak with assurance.” In another place also the same apostle says, “Avoid foolish and ignorant questionings.” Such men, who sow disputes—that is to say, heretics—the apostle bids us leave alone. Of them he says in yet another place that “certain shall depart from the faith, giving heed to deceitful spirits and the doctrines of devils.”
