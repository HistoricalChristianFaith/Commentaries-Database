Why did He Who restored life at command, Who gave health by His word, saying to the dead, "Come forth," and Lazarus came forth from the grave, saying also to the sick of the palsy, "Arise and take up thy bed," and the sick of the palsy rose and himself began to carry his bed, whereon, when all his limbs were paralyzed, he had been wont to be carried; why, I say, did He spit on the ground and make clay, and anoint the eyes of the blind man, and say to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Siloam, which is by interpretation, Sent. He went his way therefore, and washed, and came seeing"? What is the reason of this? Great indeed is the reason, if I mistake not, for he who is taught by Jesus comes to see more clearly.

Observe at the same time both His Divinity and His sanctity; as being Himself Light He touched and so communicated light to others; as being a Priest He fulfilled by the figure of Baptism the mysteries of spiritual grace. He spat, that you might learn that the inner parts of Christ are light; and clearly indeed does he see who receives cleansing thereby. His spittle cleanses, and so does His discourse, as it is written, "Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you."

But His making clay and anointing the eyes of the blind was intended to signify to us that the Same Who made man of clay, restored him to health by anointing with clay, and to signify also that this flesh of our clay must receive the light of eternal life by the Sacrament of Baptism. Do you also draw near to Siloam, that is, to Him Who was sent from the Father, as it is written, "My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me." Let Christ wash you that you may see. Come to Baptism, the time itself is at hand, make haste and come that you may say, "I went, and washed, and I received sight"; that you may also say, "whereas I was blind, now I see," that you may say, as that man on whom light was poured said, "the night is far spent, the day is at hand."
