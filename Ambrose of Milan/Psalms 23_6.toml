When do you not have something that you owe to God? Or when are you without a gift of God, since your daily enjoyment of living is from God? “For what have you, that you have not received?” Therefore, because you always receive, always call on God; and since what you have is from God, always acknowledge that you are his debtor. I prefer that you pay your debts rather through love than as one forced to do so.
