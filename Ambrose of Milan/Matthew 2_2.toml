In Luc., iii, 41: It is said, that some Idumaean robbers coming to Ascalon,brought with them among other prisoners Antipater. He was instructed in the law and customs of the Jews, and acquired the friendship ofHyrcanus, king of Judaea, who sent him as his deputy to Pompey. He succeeded sowell in the object of his mission, that he laid claim to a share of the throne. He was put to death, but his son Herod was under Antony appointed king of Judaea, by a decree of the Senate; so it is clear that Herod sought the throne of Judaea without any connection or claim of birth.
