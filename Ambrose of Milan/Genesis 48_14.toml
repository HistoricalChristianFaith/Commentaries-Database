What extraordinary mysteries there are in this! Joseph took his sons, who were born to him in Egypt, and brought them before his father. He placed Ephraim at his right, but at the left of his father Israel, and Manasseh at his left, but at Israel’s right. But Israel, stretching out his right hand, put it on Ephraim’s head, although he was the younger son and stood at his grandfather’s left. And he put his left hand on Manasseh, who was at his right, and with his hands crossed so, he blessed them. In this Joseph observed the order of nature, to grant more to the elder son. Likewise Isaac also desired to give his blessing to Esau, the first son, but Jacob believed the younger son was to be preferred as a symbol of the younger people, just as he himself had been preferred by his mother. Indeed, in our tongue, Manasseh signifies “out of forgetfulness,” because the people of the Jews forgot their God, who made them, and whoever from out of that people believes is called back, as it were, from forgetfulness. Moreover, Ephraim promises fruitfulness in faith by the meaning of his name, “who made his father to grow,” just as Joseph himself says, “because God has made me to grow in the land of my humiliation.” This refers especially to the younger people, which are the body of Christ, making its Father to grow and not forsaking its own God.
