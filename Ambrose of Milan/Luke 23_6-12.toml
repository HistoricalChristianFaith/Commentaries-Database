He was silent and did nothing, for Herod's unbelief deserved not to see Him, and the Lord shunned display. And perhaps typically in Herod are represented all the ungodly, who if they have not believed the Law and the Prophets, cannot see Christ's wonderful works in the Gospel.

It is not without reason that He is arrayed by Herod in a white robe, as bearing a sign of His immaculate Passion, that the Lamb of God without spot would take upon Himself the sins of the world.

Under the type also of Herod and Pilate, who from enemies were made friends by Jesus Christ, is preserved the figure of the people of Israel and the Gentile nation; that through our Lord's Passion should come to pass the future concord of both, yet so that the people of the Gentiles should receive the word of God first, and then transmit it by the devotion of their faith to the Jewish people; that they too may with the glory of their majesty clothe the body of Christ, which before they had despised.

There follows a wonderful passage that gives human hearts the spiritual endurance to submit calmly to injustice. They accuse the Lord, and he stands mute. The one that does not lack a defense is suitably mute. Let those who fear to being overcome seek a defense. By remaining silent, he does not confirm the accusation. By not refuting it, he despises it. A special attribute of Christ is that among wicked judges he seemed to have been unwilling rather than unable to be defended. The Lord explained why he would remain silent, saying, “If I should tell you, you will not believe me; and if I should also ask you, you will not answer me.” It is extraordinary that he chose to prove himself a king, rather than speak, so that those who confess what they taunt would have no grounds for condemnation. When Herod wanted to see him work wonders, he was silent and performed none because Herod’s cruelty did not merit to behold the divine and the Lord shunned boasting. Perhaps Herod prefigures all the impious, who if they did not believe in the law and the prophets cannot see the miraculous works of Christ in the gospel either.

It is significant that Jesus is clothed in a white garment by Herod. It denotes his sinless passion, because the Lamb of God without stain and with glory accepted the sins of the world. Herod and Pilate, who became friends instead of enemies through Jesus Christ, symbolize the peoples of Israel and the Gentiles, since the future harmony of both follows from the Lord’s passion. First the people of the nations capture the Word of God and bring it to the people of the Jews, through the devotion of their faith. They clothe with glory the body of Christ, whom they had previously despised.
