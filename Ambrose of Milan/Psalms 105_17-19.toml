Not nature but foolishness makes the slave. Not manumission but learning makes a person free. Esau was born free, but he became a slave; Joseph was sold into slavery, but he was raised to power8 so that he might rule those who had purchased him. Yet he did not slight his obligation to work zealously; he clung to the heights of virtue; he preserved the liberty of innocence, the stronghold of blamelessness. So the psalmist beautifully says, “Joseph had been sold into slavery. They had bound his feet with fetters.” “He had been sold into slavery,” he says; he did not become a slave. They had bound his feet, but not his soul.How is his soul bound when he says, “The iron pierced his soul”? Although the souls of others were pierced with sin (iron is sin, because it pierces within), the soul of blessed Joseph did not lie open to sin but pierced through sin. He was not swayed by the beauty of his mistress’s charms, and so he did not experience the flames of passion, for he was aflame with the greater flame of divine grace. Thus, it is said very aptly of him, “Because the word of the Lord burned him,” and with this he quenched the fiery darts of the devil.
