Therefore, the apostle laid down the law saying, “If any one is without reproach, the husband of one wife.” Whoever, then, is without reproach, the husband of one wife, is included among those held by the law to be qualified for the priesthood, but he who entered a second marriage has not the guilt of pollution, though he is disqualified from the privilege of the priesthood.
