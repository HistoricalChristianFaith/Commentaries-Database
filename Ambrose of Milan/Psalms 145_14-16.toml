And the apostle [Paul] added, “For of him, and through him and in him are all things.” What does “of him” mean? It means that the nature of everything exists according to his will and that he is the creator of everything that has come into existence. What does “through him” mean? It means that the creation and preservation of all things is his gift. What does “in him” mean? It means that all things by a wonderful kind of longing and unspeakable love look on the author of their life and the giver of their abilities and functions according to that which is written: “The eyes of all look to you,” and “You open your hand and fill every living creature with your good pleasure.”
