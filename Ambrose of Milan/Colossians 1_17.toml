Now we come to that laughable method, attempted by some, of showing a difference of power to subsist between Father and Son…. It is urged that no small difference in degree of divine majesty is signified in the affirmation that all things are “of” the Father and “through” the Son. Whereas nothing is clearer than that here a plain reason is given of the omnipotence of the Son, inasmuch as while all things are “of” the Father, nonetheless are they all “through” the Son. The Father is not “among” all things, for to him it is confessed that “all things serve Thee.” Nor is the Son reckoned “among” all things, for “all things were made by him,” and “all things exist together in him, and he is above all the heavens.” The Son, therefore, exists not “among” but above all things. Indeed, after the flesh, he is of the people, the Jews. Yet at the same time he is God over all, blessed forever, having a name which is above every name, it being said of him, “You have put all things in subjection under his feet.” -.
