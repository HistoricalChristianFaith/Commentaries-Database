He who wallows and sinks in mud pits falls into the snares of treachery. For “the people sat down to eat and drink,” and they demanded that gods be made for them. Whence the Lord teaches that he who gives his soul over to these two types of shameful deeds is divested of a garment not of wool but of living virtue, for the cloak of virtue is not temporal but eternal.
