For God and Lord is a name of majesty, a name of power, even as God himself says, “The Lord is my name,” and as in another place the prophet declares, “The Lord almighty is his name.” He is God, therefore, and Lord, either because his rule is over all or because he beholds all things and is feared by all without exception.
