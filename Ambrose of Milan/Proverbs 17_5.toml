Let no one think that he is to be paid more deference because he is rich. In the church a person is rich if he is rich in faith, for the faithful person has a whole world of riches. Is it strange that the faithful person owns the world, since he owns Christ’s inheritance, which is more priceless than the world? “You were redeemed with the precious blood,” surely was said to all, not only to the rich.
