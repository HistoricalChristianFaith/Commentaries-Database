We have seen that rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen. In this world, he reclined at table and feasted elegantly every day, while the poor man Lazarus would gather what fell from his table. When he was in torments in hell, he could not lean back and rest; but with great difficulty he lifted up only his eyes to Abraham, not his whole body, and asked him to send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water and to cool his tongue. Therefore “there was no rest to his death nor strength in his affliction.” For scourges have no value after death. And so, while David was in this bodily life, he made himself ready for scourges, so that the Lord might receive him as one that had been chastised. Think again, I ask you, on holy Job. He was covered all over with sores, afflicted in all his limbs and filled with pain over his entire body. He dissolved clods of earth with the corrupt matter and the liquid from his wounds, and since he could not rest in this body, he found death a repose. And so, thinking of his own case, he said, “Death is a repose for a person.” He, therefore, was not moved in his affliction, nor did he totter in the morass of his own speech, for “in all those things, he did not sin with his lips,” even as Scripture testifies. Rather, he found strength in his affliction, through which he was strengthened in Christ. And thus both Job and David, because they were scourged here, had strength in their afflictions, because “the father scourges the son whom he receives.” But those who are not scourged here are not received as sons there. And there “they are not in the toils of people and they shall not be scourged with people,” so that they may be scourged forever with the devil.

Hence we should know that the Holy Spirit has condemned those detestable people who hold such views. For what other people does he specifically condemn except the Arians, who say that the Son of God does not experience periods of time and years? For there isn’t anything with which that God is not familiar. If, however, Christ is God and Christ is the highest God, then he is God above all things. Notice how outraged the blessed David was with such people who limit the Son of God’s knowledge. He says, “They do not share the troubles common to human beings, and they will not be plagued like other people. They are burdened with their pride; they are clothed in iniquity and impiety. Their iniquity is proportionate with their portliness. They extend into the condition of the heart.” Without a doubt he condemns those who believe that divine things must be determined from the “condition of the heart.” For God is not subject to [any temporal] condition or order because these are things that are peculiar to human beings and according to succeeding generations. But we know that they do not always occur according to some formal plan but more often happen according to some secret and hidden mystery.“They have thought,” he says, “and they have spoken wickedly and sinfully against God. They have set their mouth against heaven.” And so we see that he condemns those who are responsible for impious blasphemy and who claim for themselves the right to arrange the secrets of heaven according to the manner of human nature.

“Therefore their pride has gripped them; they are covered with their iniquity and their wickedness.” Iniquity affords a bad covering, and if anyone wishes to hold it over us, we ought to remove it; else he may begin to come into judgment with us. And if anyone tries to carry off our spiritual tunic that we have received, remove the cloak of iniquity and take up the covering of faith and of patience, with which David covered himself in fasting, so that he would not lose the garment of virtue. Fasting is itself a covering. Indeed, unless a sober fasting had served to cover the holy Joseph, he would have been stripped by the wanton adulteress. Had Adam chosen to cover himself with that fasting, he would not have been made naked. But because he tasted of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil contrary to heaven’s prohibition and violated the fast imposed on him by taking the food of incontinence, he knew that he was naked. Had he fasted, he would have kept the clothing of faith and would not have beheld himself uncovered. Let us not, therefore, clothe ourselves with iniquity and wickedness; else it may be said about one of us, “He clothed himself in cursing.” Adam clothed himself badly; while he searched for coverings of leaves, he received the sentence of a curse. The Jews clothed themselves with a curse, for in regard to them it is written, “Their injustice will go forth as from fat; it has passed into the condition of their heart.” For from “fat” is derived “fatty,” that is, “rich.” For just as a soul that is fed on good things and stuffed with virtues is filled “as with fat and richness,” as it is written, so iniquity, which proceeds, as it were, from fat, is not symbolized as thin and poor but as filled with vices. In fact, they did not fall into error by some chance misstep but passed into sacrilege by plan and intent.

“They have set their mouth against heaven, and their tongue has passed over the earth.” We learn the meaning of “to set one’s mouth against heaven” from the younger of the two brothers, who returned to his father and said, “Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you.” But those who think that freedom to sin is given to them by some inevitability of birth are setting their mouth against heaven. Such people usually spare neither heaven nor earth, that they may believe that people’s lives are governed by the course of the stars, as it were. They leave nothing to providence, nothing to good character. And would that they also had returned like that one of the two young men—the good Lord would not have denied them a remedy! And yet, even if they do not wish to be healed, the Lord keeps open the option of a return, so that those in Israel who were driven out by the blindness of their own hearts may come back through the fullness of the church. Thus they may spend the days of their lives, not in emptiness but filled with good works and faith, when the Lord has filled them with his spiritual favor. Learn how they may return. “A partial blindness only has befallen Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles should enter and thus all Israel should be saved.” But it was fitting that the mystery be fulfilled, that God should shut up all things in unbelief, that is, that he should refute and convict them. (For when two parties contend, if one is the stronger, it is said, “He has shut up the other.”)45 And thus, by his mercy, that people indeed went back among the heirs, so that the world might be made subject to God. But they were led astray by the delusion of their late wickedness, so that they would not believe that God had foreknowledge of things hidden. But that they may be redeemed at some time, the Lord has kept open for them the option of future salvation and has said, “Therefore will my people return here.” What is “here”? It is “to me, to my equity and justice, to my worship.” “And full days will be procured for them.” This you will interpret as follows, that the people who have believed are assuredly redeemed. According to this, even though those who have not believed are not redeemed, still the redemption of the people is granted as a special favor of God.
