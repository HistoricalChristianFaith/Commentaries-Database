The Evangelist John says, “It was cold.” If we consider the season, it could not have been cold. But it was cold where Jesus was not acknowledged, where there was none to see the light, where the consuming fire22 was denied. Peter stood beside the brazier, because he felt he was freezing. Evil is the … flame [that night]. It burns but does not warm. Evil is the hearth that scatters a soot of error even on the minds of the saints because even the inner eyes of Peter were darkened.
