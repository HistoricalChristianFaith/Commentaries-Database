Let us be bound with bonds of a faith that is like a fruitful branch and cannot be undone, as it were, to that everlasting vine, that is, to the Lord Jesus, who says, “I am the vine; my Father is the gardener.” This explains the mystery that the Lord Jesus in the Gospel ordered an ass’s colt to be loosed and himself sat upon it;69 thus, like one that was bound to a vine, he could find rest in the everlasting goodness of the saints.

“He will wash his robe in wine.” The good robe is the flesh of Christ, which has covered the sins of all people, taken up the offenses of all, concealed the misdeeds of all—the good robe which has clothed all people with the garment of rejoicing. He washed this robe in wine at his baptism in the Jordan, when the Holy Spirit came down like a dove and remained upon him. By this, it is indicated that the fullness of the Holy Spirit will be indivisible in him and will not depart. On this account also the Evangelist says, “The Lord Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan.” Therefore Jesus washed his robe, not to wash away his stain, for he had none, but to wash away the stain that was ours. Then Jacob continued, “and his mantle in the blood of the grape.” This means that in the passion of his body he washed the nations with his blood. Truly the mantle represents the nations, as it is written, “As I live, says the Lord, unless I shall clothe myself with them all, as with a garment,” and in another passage, “Like clothing you will change them, and they will be changed.” And so with his own blood he cleansed not his own sins, for there were none, but the offenses that we committed. It was appropriate that Jacob spoke of a grape, because Christ hung on the wood like a grape. He is the vine, he is the grape; he is the vine because he cleaves to the wood and the grape because, when his side was opened by the soldier’s lance, he sent forth water and blood. For thus John said that “there came out from him blood and water,” water for baptism, blood for redemption. The water washed us, the blood redeemed us.
