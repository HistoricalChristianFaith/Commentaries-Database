The righteous person lives a happy old age. It does not say “long” but “happy,” because the righteous person grows old happily. This is not the case, however, for any of the godless, even if they were to live longer than the oldest stag. In fact, long life is common to both the wise and fools. To live well, however, belongs to the wise person, whose “old age is venerated and for whom advanced age is a blameless life.” It also says that “it is not calculated by the number of years” or by gray hair but by wisdom. Therefore, one who has been wise ages well.

Who would deny that adolescence and, in the beginning, youth itself, churn under the delusion of the various passions? Or that when a more mature age arrives, inasmuch as the season of youthful lusts fades away, it gives way to tranquility, and the boat of the exhausted soul arrives at quiet ports? The violent movements of our adolescence, therefore, are calmed in the tranquil season of old age.
