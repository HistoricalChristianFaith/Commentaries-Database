The just man lives a good life in old age. It is not said "long" but "good", for the just man ages well; however, no one of the unjust, even if he lives a longer life than lively stags, lives a good life. For to live long is common for both the wise and the foolish, but to live well is special to the wise man, whose old age is venerable and whose old age is a blameless life: not long-lasting, as he says, nor calculated by the number of years, nor by the gray hair on his head, but by his senses. He, therefore, ages well who has sensed well.

Indeed, old age is venerable not by years grown grey, but by character. And the age of senescence, it is said, is a blameless life. Therefore, wherever generation is expressed, let Cain come first; wherever preaching of discipline is made, let Abel run ahead. Who would deny that even youth and itself in the beginnings of young adulthood fervently burn with the various allurements of passions? But when a more mature age is succeeded, as if by the storm of a youth's lasciviousness being dissipated, tranquility is restored and the weary soul withdraws its ship into certain quiet harbors. Thus, the tumultuous movements of our youth are calmed by the steady presence of faithful old age.
