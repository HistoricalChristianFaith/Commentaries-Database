David was not ashamed when he danced before the ark of the covenant in the presence of all the people.… Yet, these actions of the body, though unseemly when viewed in themselves, become reverential under the aspect of holy religion, so that those who censure them drag their own souls into the net of censure. Thus, Michal censured David for dancing.…
David did not blush at a woman’s censure, nor was he ashamed to meet with reproach, because of his devotion to religion. He played before the Lord as his servant and pleased him the more in so humbling himself before God and laying aside his royal dignity, performing the humblest tasks for God like a servant. She who censured such dancing was condemned to barrenness and had no children by the king lest she should beget the proud. In truth, she had no continuance of posterity or of good deeds. - "Letter 28"
