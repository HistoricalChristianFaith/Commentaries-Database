Accordingly, the apostle says, “What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?” He mentioned a rod first, striking those who were astray as with an almond rod, that he might afterwards comfort them with the spirit of meekness. So the man whom the rod deprived of the heavenly sacraments was restored by meekness. He gave similar instructions to his disciple also, saying, “Reprove, exhort, rebuke,” two stern words and one gentle, but stern only that he might soften them. To bodies sick with excess of gall, bitter food and drink taste sweet and, on the other hand, sweet dishes taste bitter. Similarly when the mind is wounded, it sickens under the attentions of an unctuous flattery and is again tempered by the bitterness of correction.
