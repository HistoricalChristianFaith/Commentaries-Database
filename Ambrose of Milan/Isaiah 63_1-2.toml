The angels, too, were in doubt when Christ arose; the powers of heaven were in doubt when they saw that flesh was ascending into heaven. Then they said, “Who is this King of glory?” And yet some said, “Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors! That the King of glory may come in.” In Isaiah, too, we find that the powers of heaven doubted.
