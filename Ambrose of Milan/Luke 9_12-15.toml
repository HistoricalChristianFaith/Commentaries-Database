For we read that first five thousand are fed with five loaves, then four thousand with seven loaves. So let us seek the mystery which the miracle represents. Those five thousand, like the body’s five senses, seem to have received from Christ food similar to physical food. But the four thousand8 are still in the body and in the world that is known to be of four elements.… Seven baskets of fragments remained from the four thousand. This bread of sabbaths is no ordinary bread. It is sanctified bread. It is a bread of rest. Perhaps, if you will first eat the five loaves with the senses, I shall dare also to say you will not eat bread on earth on the third day, after eating the five loaves and the seven. You will eat eight loaves above the earth, like those who are in the heavens. As the seven loaves are loaves of rest, so the eight loaves are the loaves of the resurrection. Therefore those who are fed on the seven loaves will persevere to the third day and, perhaps, attain the whole faith and steadfastness of the future resurrection. Then there is the voice of the saints: “We will go a three days’ journey, that we may feast with the Lord our God.”
