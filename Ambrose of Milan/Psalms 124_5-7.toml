It is the same with David. Where the soul is supported with spiritual wings, he has chosen to describe the soul as a bird, as he has said in one place, “My soul has escaped like a bird from the snare of the fowlers”; and again, In the Lord I take refuge; how can you say to my soul, “Flee like a bird to the mountain.” Thus the soul has its wings by which it can raise itself free from the earth. But this movement of the wings is not of something constructed of feathers but a continuing series of good works, like those of the Lord of whom it is well said, “And in the shadow of your wings I shall take refuge.” In the first place, the hands of our Lord fixed on the cross were extended like something in flight, and, second, the actions of God are like a refreshing shadow of eternal salvation that can regulate the conflagration raging in our world.
