In place of the body, God showed the ram in the bush, that he might restore the son to his father and yet that a victim should not be lacking to the priest. Consequently neither was Abraham stained with the blood of his own son, nor was God deprived of a victim. When the prophet saw the ram, he did not assume a boastful attitude; he did not persist obstinately in his resolve but took the ram in place of the boy. His conduct shows all the more how piously he offered the son whom he received back so gladly.

Through motives of high devotion and in obedience to the word of God, Abraham offered his son as a holocaust, and like a man devoid of natural feeling he drew his sword that no delay might dim the brightness of his offering. Yet, when he was ordered to spare his son, he gladly sheathed his sword, and he who with the intention of faith has hastened to sacrifice his only-begotten son hurried with greater zeal for piety to put a ram in place of the sacrifice.
