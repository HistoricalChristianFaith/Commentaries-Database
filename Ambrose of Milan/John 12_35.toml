[In the] form of a servant the fullness of true light was there. And when the form emptied itself, there was the light. Then he said, “Walk while you have the light.” Even when he was in death, he was not in the shadow.… The true light of wisdom shone there as well. It illumined hell but was not shut up in hell.
