A woman accused of adultery was brought by the scribes and Pharisees to the Lord Jesus. But the woman was presented with guile, so that if Jesus should absolve her, he would appear to break the law. But if Jesus should condemn her, he would deviate from the purpose for which he came, since he came to forgive the sins of all. Earlier he said, “I do not judge anyone.” But presenting her, they said, “We found this woman openly committing adultery. Now it is written in the law of Moses that every adulteress is to be stoned. But what do you have to say about her?”
