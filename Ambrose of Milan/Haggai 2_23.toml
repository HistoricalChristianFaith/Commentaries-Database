So it is mystically said to him alone: “I will take you, O Zerubbabel, and I will make you as a signet ring, for I have chosen you.” For, when our soul becomes so peaceful that it is said to her, “Return, return, O Sulamitess,” which means “peaceful,” or to your own name, “Irenic,” then she will receive Christ like a signet ring upon her, for she is the image of God. Then she will be according to that image, because heavenly is the heavenly man. And we need to bear the image of the heavenly one, that is, peace. And that we may know that this is true, you have in the Canticles to the soul, now full perfect, what I wish the Lord Jesus may say to you, “Put me as a seal upon your arm.” May peace glow in your heart, Christ in your works, and may there be formed in you wisdom and justice and redemption.
