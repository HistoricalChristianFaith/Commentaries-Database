“I [the prodigal son] have sinned,” he says, “against heaven and before you.” He confesses what is clearly a sin to death, that you may not think that any one doing penance is rightly shut out from pardon. For one who has sinned against heaven has sinned either against the kingdom of heaven or against his own soul, which is a sin to death, and against God, to whom alone is said: “Against you only have I sinned and done evil before you.”
