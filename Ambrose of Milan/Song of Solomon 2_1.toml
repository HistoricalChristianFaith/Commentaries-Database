He himself said, “I am the flower of the plain, a lily of the valley.” The flower, when cut, keeps its odor, and when bruised increases it, nor if torn off does it lose it. So, too, the Lord Jesus, on the gibbet of the cross, neither failed when bruised nor fainted when torn. And when he was cut by that piercing of the spear, being made more beautiful by the color of the outpoured blood, he, as it were, grew comely again, not able in himself to die, and breathing forth upon the dead the gift of eternal life. - "On the Holy Spirit 2.38–39"

He says himself, “I am a flower of the field, a lily of the valleys, as a lily among brambles.” Consider, then, another place in which the Lord likes to reside, and not only one place but many. He says, “I am a flower of the field,” because he often visits the open simplicity of a pure mind;“and the lily of the valleys,” for Christ is the bloom of lowliness, not of luxury, voluptuousness, of lasciviousness, but the flower of simplicity and lowliness. “A lily among brambles” as the flower of a good odor is sure to grow in the midst of hard labors and heartfelt sorrow (since God is pleased with a contrite heart). - "On Virginity 9.51"
