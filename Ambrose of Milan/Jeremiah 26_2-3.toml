The Novatians bring up a question from the words of the apostle Peter. Because he said, “if perhaps,” they think that he did not imply that forgiveness would be granted on repentance. But let them consider concerning to whom the words were spoken—of Simon, who did not believe through faith but was contemplating trickery. So, too, the Lord, to him who said, “Lord, I will follow you wherever you go,” replied, “Foxes have holes.” For he knew that the man was not being fully sincere. If, then, the Lord refused to him who was not baptized permission to follow him, because he saw that he was not sincere, do you wonder that the apostle did not absolve him who after baptism was guilty of deceit and whom he declared to be still in the bond of iniquity? But let this be my answer to them. As to myself, I say that Peter did not doubt, and I do not think that so great a question can be so easily disposed of by the questionable interpretation of a single word. For if they think that Peter doubted, did God doubt, who said to the prophet Jeremiah, “Stand in the court of the Lord’s house, and you shall give an answer to all Judah, to those who have come to worship in the Lord’s house, even all the words that I have appointed for you to answer to them. Do not omit a word, perhaps they will listen and be converted.” Let them say, then, that God also did not know what would happen. But ignorance is not implied in that word, but the common custom of Holy Scripture is observed to be taken in its simplest sense. Inasmuch as the Lord says also to Ezekiel, “Son of man, I will send you to the house of Israel, to those who have angered me, both themselves and their ancestors, this very day, and you shall say to them, Thus says the Lord, if perhaps they will hear and be afraid.” Did God not know that they could or could not be converted? So, then, that expression is not always a proof of doubt.
