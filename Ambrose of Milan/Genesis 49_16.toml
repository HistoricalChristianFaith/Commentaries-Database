The simple interpretation is this, that the tribe of Dan also supplied the judge in Israel. Granted, after Joshua the son of Nun, the judges of the people were from various tribes. However, Samson was from the tribe of Dan, and he judged for twenty years. But the prophecy does not refer to him but the Antichrist, a cruel judge and savage tyrant who will come from the tribe of Dan and will judge the people. Like a serpent sitting in the way, he will try to throw down those who walk in the way of truth, for he desires to overthrow the truth. Indeed, this is to bite the horse’s heel, so that the horse, injured by the infusion of poison and wounded by the serpent’s tooth, lifts up his heel. Just so the betrayer Judas, when tempted by the devil, lifted up his heel upon the Lord Jesus to throw down the rider who threw himself down to lift up all people.
