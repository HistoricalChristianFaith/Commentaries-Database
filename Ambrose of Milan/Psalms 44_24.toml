We cannot see God’s face. But there is a place where, by faith, God shows himself to us. The place is with God; and if we were to stand on the rock—that is, in awareness of this flesh and in firmness of faith—we will see as much as can be allowed to us to see. We cannot see the fullness, but we can, in a certain sense, drink in some remnant of his light. Moses did not see the full and entire divinity that dwells in Christ corporeally. But he saw the back of Christ. As man he saw his splendor, he saw the glory of his passion, he saw him draw back for us the bolts of the heavenly kingdom.
