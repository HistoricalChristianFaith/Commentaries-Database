The members of the church are similar to this vine. They are planted with the root of faith and held in check by the shoots of humility…. He placed in the church a tower of apostles, prophets and doctors who are ready to defend the peace of the church. He dug around it when he had freed it from the burden of earthly anxieties. Nothing burdens the mind more than concern for the world and lust for either wealth or power. An example of this is in the Gospel. We can read the story of the woman “who had sickness caused by a spirit, and she was bent over so that she was unable to look upwards.” In fact, her soul was bent over. It inclined to earthly rewards and did not possess heavenly grace. Jesus saw her and addressed her. She immediately laid aside her earthly burdens. These people also were burdened with lusts. He addressed them in these words, “Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will give you rest.” The soul of that woman breathed once more and stood up like a vine around which the soil has been dug and cleared.
