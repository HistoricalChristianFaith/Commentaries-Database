God, indeed, never descends from any place, for he says, “I fill heaven and earth.” But he seems to descend when the Word of God enters our hearts, as the prophet has said, “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” We are to do this, so that, as he himself promised, he may come together with the Father and make his abode with us.
