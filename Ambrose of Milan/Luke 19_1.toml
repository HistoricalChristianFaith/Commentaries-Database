“And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus.” Zacchaeus in the sycamore; the blind man by the wayside. The Lord waits for the one to have mercy on him and honors the other with the radiance of his visit. He questions the one before healing him and attends the other’s house as an uninvited guest. He knew that his host’s reward was to be rich. Although Christ had not yet heard his voice of invitation, he has heard his good will.

What means the Evangelist by describing his stature, and that of none other? It is perhaps because he was young in wickedness, or as yet weak in the faith. For he was not yet prostrate in sin who could climb up. He had not yet seen Christ.
Uninvited he invites Himself to his house; as it follows, Zacchaeus, make haste, and come down for He knew how richly He would reward his hospitality. And though He had not yet heard the word of invitation, He had already seen the will.
Let the rich learn that guilt attaches not to the goods themselves, but to those who know not how to use them. For riches, as they are hindrances to virtue in the unworthy, so are they means of advancing it in the good.
He has well added, that our Lord was to pass that way, either where the sycamore-tree was, or where hewas who was about to believe, that so He might preserve the mystery, and sow the seeds of grace. For He had so come as that through the Jews He came to the Gentiles. He sees then Zacchaeus above, for already the excellence of his faith shone forth amidst the fruits of good works, and the loftiness of the fruitful tree; but Zacchaeus stands out above the tree, as one who is above the law.
