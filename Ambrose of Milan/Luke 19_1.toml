“And, behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus.” Zacchaeus in the sycamore; the blind man by the wayside. The Lord waits for the one to have mercy on him and honors the other with the radiance of his visit. He questions the one before healing him2 and attends the other’s house as an uninvited guest. He knew that his host’s reward was to be rich. Although Christ had not yet heard his voice of invitation, he has heard his good will.
