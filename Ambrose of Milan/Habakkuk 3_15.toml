For the soul at peace swiftly turns and corrects itself, even though it sinned before, and Christ mounts it, rather, and considers it appropriate to guide it. To him it is said, “Mount your horses, and your riding is salvation,” and in another passage, “I have sent your horses into the sea.” These are the horses of Christ. Therefore Christ mounts his horses; the Word of God mounts pious souls.
