This is our faith. Thus did God will that he should be known by all, thus believed the three children [of the fiery furnace] who did not feel the fire into which they were cast, which destroyed and burned up the unbelievers while it fell harmless as a dew upon the faithful. The flames kindled by others became cold, seeing that the torment has justly lost its power in conflict with faith. For with them there was one in the form of an angel, comforting them, to the end that in number of the Trinity one supreme power might be praised. God was praised; the Father of God was seen in Godâ€™s angel and holy and spiritual grace in the children.
