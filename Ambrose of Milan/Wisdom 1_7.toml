As the Lord fills all things, so too we read of the Spirit, “For the Spirit of the Lord fills the whole world.” You see also that it was said of all those who were gathered with the apostles, “They were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.” You see that the Holy Spirit gives both fullness and boldness. It is his work that the archangel announces, saying to Mary, “The Holy Spirit shall come on you.”
