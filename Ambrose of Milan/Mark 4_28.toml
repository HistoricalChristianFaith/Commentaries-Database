But even in these things that are sought by human hands, a great part of divine benefits remain with us, so that even the grains themselves are produced while we are at rest. This is taught as an example of the proposed lesson, with the Lord saying: For the kingdom of God is like a man who throws seed upon the earth and then sleeps and rises, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows, while he does not know how (Mark, IV, 26). For the earth produces fruit willingly, first grass, then ear, then full wheat in the ear. And when it has produced fruit, it immediately sends forth the sickle, for the harvest is at hand. Therefore, to you, o man, who sleep and know not its fruits, the earth produces them willingly. You sleep and rise, and marvel at the growth of wheat during the night.
