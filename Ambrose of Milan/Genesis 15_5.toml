What is the meaning then of the expression “he brought him outside”? The prophet is as it were led out, so that he goes outside of the body and sees the limitations imposed by the flesh that is his garment and the infusion of the Holy Spirit who makes a kind of visible descent. We too must exit from the confinement of this our temporary dwelling. We must purify the place where our soul dwells from all uncleanness, throw out every stain of wickedness, if we wish to receive the spirit of wisdom, because “wisdom will not enter a wicked soul.” Abraham believed, not because he was drawn by a promise of gold or silver but because he believed from the heart. “It was reckoned to him as righteousness.” A reward was bestowed that corresponded to the test of his merit.
