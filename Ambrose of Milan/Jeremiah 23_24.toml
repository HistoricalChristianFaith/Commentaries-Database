Of what creature can it be said that it fills all things, as it written of the Holy Spirit: “I will pour my Spirit on all flesh.” This cannot be said of an angel. Lastly, Gabriel, when sent to Mary, said, “Hail, full of grace,” plainly declaring the grace of the Spirit that was in her, because the Holy Spirit had come on her, and she was about to have her womb full of grace with the heavenly Word. It is the Lord who fills all things, who says, “I fill heaven and earth.” If, then, it is the Lord who fills heaven and earth, who can judge the Holy Spirit to be without a share in the dominion and divine power, seeing that he has filled the world, and what is beyond the whole world, filled Jesus, the Redeemer of the whole world? For it is written, “But Jesus, full of the Holy Spirit, departed from the Jordan.” Who, then, except one who possessed the same fullness could fill him who fills all things?

God says, “I will dwell in them.” Elsewhere also it stands that God said, “Come, let us go down and confound their language.” God, indeed, never descends from any place, for he says, “I fill heaven and earth.” He seems to descend when the Word of God enters our hearts, as the prophet has said: “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” We are to do this, so that, as he himself promised, he may come together with the Father and make his home with us. It is clear, then, how he comes.

Since we are in his image and likeness, as Scripture says, let us presume to speak, just as he expresses himself in the fullness of his majesty and sees all things—sky, air, earth, sea—embracing all and penetrating each one, so that nothing passes his notice and nothing exists unless it exists in him and depends on him and is full of him, as he says: “I fill heaven and earth, declares the Lord.”
