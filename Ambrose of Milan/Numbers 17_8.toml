In the book of the prophet Scripture says, “Take up for yourself a rod from a nut tree.” Consider the reason why the Lord said this to the prophet. For indeed, what was written is not inconsequential, since also in the Pentateuch we read that the priest Aaron’s staff, cut from a nut tree, blossomed when it had been put away for some time. Now it seems to mean that prophetic or priestly authority ought to be direct, so that it urges not so much what is enjoyable as what is beneficial.

For that reason, too, [God] himself chose Aaron as priest, in order that not human cupidity but the grace of God would be the preponderant force in choosing the priest. It would not be a voluntary offering or one’s own assumption but a heavenly vocation. The one who can suffer on behalf of sinners may offer gifts on behalf of sins, because “even he himself,” Scripture says, “bears infirmity.” No one should assume the honor for himself but be called by God, just as Aaron was. In this way even Christ did not claim the priesthood but received it.

Paul came to preach the cross of the Lord, an oak that is always verdant. And almonds appear, which are rather hard in shell but more tender in meat—it was right that Aaron’s priestly rod was of the almond tree, and Jeremiah’s staff as well—and double money too. Who would doubt that these gifts were useful? For the life of the patriarch and the preaching of the apostle are always verdant in the heart of each man, and the speech of the saints shines brightly with the splendor of the precepts of salvation, like silver tried by the fire. And it is with reason that they carry double money, for in them there is prefigured the coming of Paul, who presented presbyters who labor in the word and in the teaching with a double honor.
