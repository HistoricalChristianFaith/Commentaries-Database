You see the Lord is teaching you a lesson, challenging you to goodness by his own example, teaching you even when he reproves. When accusing the Jews, for instance, he says, “O my people, what have I done to you? Or wherein have I grieved you? Or wherein have I offended you? Answer me. Is it because I brought you out of the land of Egypt, and delivered you out of the house of bondage?” adding, “And I sent before your face Moses, Aaron and Miriam. O my people, remember what Balak king of Moab devised.” You were indeed oppressed, an exile in foreign lands, laden with heavy burdens.
