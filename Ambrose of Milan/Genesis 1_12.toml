Let everyone be informed that the sun is not the author of vegetationâ€¦. How can the sun give the faculty of life to growing plants when these have already been brought forth by the lifegiving creative power of God before the sun entered into such a life as this? The sun is younger than the green shoot, younger than the green plant.
