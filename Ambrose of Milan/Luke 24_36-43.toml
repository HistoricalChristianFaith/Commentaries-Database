Persuaded by so many examples of virtue, we believe that Peter could not have doubted. It is also clear that John believed when he saw the Savior. He had already believed when he saw the tomb empty of its body. Why then does Luke say that they were troubled? First, the saying of a majority includes the opinion of the few. Second, although Peter had believed the resurrection, he could be troubled when he saw that the Lord appeared unexpectedly in his body in a room where the doors were bolted and the walls solid. Luke pursued details historically. One contemplated the end, and the other the course of events. By saying, “Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,” he also declares that the disciples believed.

Then, the disciples being troubled, thought they saw a spirit. To show us the appearance of the resurrection, the Lord said, “Touch, and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me to have.” He actually penetrated the closed and inaccessible room through the likeness of a bodily resurrection and not through a spiritual nature. They touch and handle a body, so we rise in the body. It is sown a natural body, but it rises a spiritual body. The one is fine; the other is crude, since it is still hard with the nature of earthly stains. Did not the Lord offer them to touch a body that retained the signs of the wounds and the marks of the scars?17 He not only strengthens faith but also kindles devotion, because he set his wounds accepted for our sake and refused to remove them, to show God the Father the costs of our freedom. The Father seats such a One at his right hand, embracing the trophies of our salvation.
