Shall we, then, think of festival days in terms of eating and drinking? On the contrary, let no one call us to account with respect to eating, “For we know that the law is spiritual.” “Let no one, therefore, call you to account for what you eat or drink or in regard to a new festival or a new moon or sabbath. These are a shadow of things to come, but the body is of Christ.” So let us seek the body of Christ which the voice of the Father from heaven, the last trumpet, as it were, showed to you on that occasion when the Jews said that it thundered for him. … Wherever the body of Christ is, there will be the truth.
