“O the depths of the riches, the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How inscrutable his judgments and unsearchable his ways! In fact, who has ever known the thoughts of the Lord? Or who has been his counselor? Or who has given him something, so as to receive something in return? Since from him, because of him and for him all things are. To him be glory forever.” Of whom does this speak—the Father or the Son? Perhaps of the Father? But the Father is not the Wisdom of God, because the Wisdom of God is the Son. And what can Wisdom not do, of whom it is written, “Though one, she can do all things; though remaining in herself, she renews all things”? Thus we read that Wisdom is not something temporary but permanent. According to Solomon, then, Wisdom is all-powerful and permanent. You will also read that it is good, because it is written, “Against wisdom, wickedness cannot prevail.”
