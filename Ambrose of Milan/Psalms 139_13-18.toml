Therefore the Lord supported us when he fashioned us; he supports us also when he bids us to be born. Consequently, the just person says, “You have supported me from my mother’s womb.” Whose mother’s? “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you.” Those, whom the Lord forms, he also supports; he supports them even in their coming forth: “And before you came forth from your mother’s womb, I sanctified you.” He is our supporter, for he has supported us with his hands. He is called a supporter as the Creator of the human race. And he is our supporter, for he has supported us by his visitation, that he may protect us. In view of this, the psalmist himself says in another passage, “He that dwells in the aid of the most High shall say to the Lord, ‘You are my supporter and my refuge.’ ” The first support is that of God’s working in us, the second in that of his protection of us. Indeed, listen to Moses saying, “Spreading his wings he received them and supported them upon his shoulders.” He supported them like the eagle, which was accustomed to examine its progeny, so as to keep and to bring up those whom it observed to possess the qualities of a true offspring and the gift of an undamaged constitution and to reject those in whom it detected weakness of a degenerate origin even at that tender age.
