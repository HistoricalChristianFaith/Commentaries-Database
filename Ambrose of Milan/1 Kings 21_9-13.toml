How clearly the custom of the rich is portrayed! They are made sad if they are not seizing the property of others; they renounce food, they fast, not that they may lessen their sin but that they may commit crime. You may see them at such times coming to church, dutiful, humble and assiduous, in order that they may deserve to obtain the accomplishment of their wickedness. But to them God says, “Not this fast have I chosen, not if you should wind your head about like a circle and spread also sackcloth and ashes, and not thus will you call an acceptable fast. Not such a fast have I chosen, says the Lord. Loose every bond of injustice, loose the bonds of violent contracts, let them that are broken go free, and tear asunder every unjust writing. Deal your bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and harborless into your house. If you shall see one naked, cover him, and you shall not despise the domestics of your seed. Then shall your morning light arise, and your health shall speedily arise, and your justice shall go before you, and the majesty of the Lord shall surround you. Then shall you call, and God shall hear you; even while you speak, he shall say, Here I am.” Do you hear, O rich person, what the Lord God says? You too come to church, not to bestow anything on a poor person but to take away. You fast, not that the cost of your banquet may profit the needy, but that you may obtain spoil from those in want.
