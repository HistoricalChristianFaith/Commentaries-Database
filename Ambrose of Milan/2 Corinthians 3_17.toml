The same, then, is the Lord, who is the Spirit of the Lord; that is, he called the Spirit of the Lord, Lord, just as also the apostle says: “Now the Lord is a spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.” You have then, the Lord called also the Holy Spirit; for the Holy Spirit and the Son are not one person but one substance.

Just like children, so are the Jews also under a tutor. The law is our tutor; a tutor brings us to the master; Christ is our only master.… A tutor is feared, the master points out the way to salvation. Fear brings us to liberty, liberty to faith, faith to love, love obtains adoption, adoption an inheritance. Therefore, where there is faith, there is freedom, for a slave acts in fear, a free man through faith. The one is under the letter, the other under grace; the one in slavery, the other in the spirit; for “Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”.
