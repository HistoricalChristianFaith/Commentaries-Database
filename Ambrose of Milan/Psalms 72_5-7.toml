Nor is it strange that they should suffer the drought of unbelief, whom the Lord deprived of the fertilizing shower of prophecy, saying, “I will command my clouds that they rain not on that vineyard.” For there is a health-giving shower of salutary grace, as David also said: “He came down like rain on a fleece and like drops that fall on the earth.” The divine Scriptures promised us this rain on the whole earth, to water the world with the dew of the divine Spirit at the coming of the Savior. The Lord, then, has now come, and the rain has come; the Lord has come bringing the heavenly drops with him, and so now we drink, who before were thirsty, and with an interior draft drink in that divine Spirit.
