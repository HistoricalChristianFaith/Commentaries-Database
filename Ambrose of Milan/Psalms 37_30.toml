The just, when he speaks God’s judgment or when he himself utters opinions that are just and full of wisdom, never speaks in an angry, passionate way. He does not speak in bitterness of soul; he does not speak from anguish, grievance or any passion. He simply speaks out the truth and states what is honest, just and fair. He weighs things not according to personal feelings but according to truth. He carefully considers what things should be said and what should not be said. He is like the one of whom it is said, “The lips of the wise shall be bound by good sense.” All that the wise say will be seen to accord with sound common sense; and such people, guided by their own prudence, understand well when they ought to remain silent. Matters that ought to be kept silent they keep confined to their own bosom and imprisoned, so to speak, by tightly closed lips. But when something ought to be said, then they loosen the bonds of their lips and come out with what they must say. Therefore the prophet aptly said, “The mouth of the just shall meditate wisdom.”

Let us speak the Lord Jesus, for he is wisdom. He is the Word, the very Word of God. Does not Scripture say, “Open your mouth to the word of God”? Echo his speech, meditate his words, and you will breathe Jesus. When we speak of wisdom, it is he.… When we speak of truth and life and redemption, it is he.
