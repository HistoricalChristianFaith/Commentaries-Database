The church, having put on these garments through the laver of regeneration, says in the Song of Songs, “I am black and comely, O daughters of Jerusalem.” Black through the frailty of its human condition, comely through the sacrament of faith. And the daughters of Jerusalem beholding these garments say in amazement, “Who is this that comes up made white?” She was black; how is she now suddenly made white? - "On the Mysteries 7.35"

It is written, “Ethiopia shall stretch out her hand unto God.” In this is signified the appearance of holy church, who says in the Song of Solomon, “I am black and comely, O daughters of Jerusalem”: black through sin, comely through grace; black by natural condition, comely through redemption, or certainly, black with the dust of her labors. So it is black while fighting but comely when it is crowned with the ornaments of victory. - "On the Holy Spirit 2.10.112"
