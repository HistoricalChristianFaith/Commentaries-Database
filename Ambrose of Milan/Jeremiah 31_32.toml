The number seven has gone. The number eight has come. Yesterday is gone. Today has come. That is the promised day on which we have been warned to hear and follow God’s Word. The day of the Old Testament is gone. The new day has come in which the New Testament is made perfect, of which Jeremiah says, “Behold the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their ancestors, in that day that I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.” He adds the reason why the covenant was changed: “They did not abide by my covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord.”
