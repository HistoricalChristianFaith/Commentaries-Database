God himself has said that he would rather have his commandments obeyed than sacrifice offered to him. God proclaims this, Moses declares it to the people of Israel, Paul preaches it to the nations. Do that which you see is better for the time. “I desire mercy more than sacrifice,” it says. Are not those who condemn their sin truer Christians than those who think to defend it? “The just accuses himself in the beginning of his words.” The one who accuses himself when he sins is just, not the one who praises himself.
