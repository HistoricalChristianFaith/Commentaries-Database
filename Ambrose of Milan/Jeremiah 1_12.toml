It is written in the book of the prophet, “Take a branch from a nut tree.” So we must consider why the Lord said this to the prophet, for it is not written without a purpose, since we also read in the Pentateuch that the nut tree of Aaron, the priest, blossomed after it had been laid away for a long while. - "Letter 62"
