It is only right that heaven is first and last in the creation of the world, for heaven also has what is beyond heaven, the God of heaven who says, “Heaven is my throne.” For God does not sit above the element of heaven but in the heart of humankind. For this reason the Lord also says, “We will come to them and make our home with them.” Heaven, therefore, is the first of the works on earth. Human beings are the close or end or last of his works.
