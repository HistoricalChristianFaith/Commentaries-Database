If the Spirit came from one place and went to another, then the Father would also be in a place, as well as the Son. If he were to leave a place when sent by the Father or the Son, it would certainly seem, as in godless interpretations, that the Spirit, moving and going to a place, would leave the Father and the Son, as with a body. I say this after the manner of those who say that the Spirit has a descending movement. But the Father is not circumscribed by a place, since he is above all thingsâ€”not only those of a corporeal nature but also invisible creatures. Nor is the Son limited by the places and times of his works, because as the creator of every creature he is above every creature. And neither is the Spirit of truth, being the Spirit of God, circumscribed by any kind of corporeal limit. Indeed, being incorporeal, he is higher than every intelligible created being, because of the unspeakable fullness of the divinity. He blows where he wills16 and inspires whom he wills, endowed with power over all things.
