The Lord says, “Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.” Mount Zion is there, and so is the city of peace, Jerusalem, built not of earthly stones but of living stones, with ten thousand angels and the church of the firstborn and the spirits of those made perfect and the God of the just, who spoke better with his blood than Abel. For one cried out for vengeance, but the other for pardon. The one was a reproach to his brother’s sin. The other forgave the world’s sin; the one was the revelation of a crime, the other covered a crime according to what was written, “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven.”

But because we ought always to be anxious, always attentive, and because the Word of God leaps forth like the gazelle or the young stag, let the soul who searches after the Christ and longs to possess Christ always be on watch and maintain its senses. “Upon my bed at night I sought him whom my soul loves,” as if Christ had stolen in upon her. Let one who seeks carefully seek while in his bed; let him seek at night. Let there be neither nights nor holiday, let no time be free from service, and if one does not find Christ at first, let him persevere in searching after Christ. And so the soul says, “I will rise now and go about the city, in the streets and in the squares.” And perhaps [the soul] still does not find Christ, because it sought in the public places, where there are court cases, in the streets, where there are markets with goods for sale; for Christ cannot be obtained for any amount of money.… That soul searches for Christ who seeks after Christ with tranquility and peace. It searches at night because Christ spoke through parables60—“he made darkness his covering around him,” and “night to night declares knowledge”62—and also because “the things we say in our heart we ought also to be sorry for on our beds.” But [the soul] does not find Christ in this way, and so it says, “I am a strong city, a city besieged.” The city is besieged through Christ; the city is that heavenly Jerusalem, in which there are interpreters of God’s law and people skilled in doctrine in great abundance; through them one seeks the Word of God.

The Lord Jesus came to raise up Adam; Abel also was raised up, for his offerings were pleasing to God. The Lord Jesus offered his own self, that is, the firstlings of his own body, in the sprinkling of blood that speaks better than the blood of Abel spoke upon the earth.
