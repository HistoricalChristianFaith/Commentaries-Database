The person who crucified the author of his salvation and afterward did not beg for forgiveness is not free from sin. Granted, he did not know previously whom he was persecuting. Nevertheless he should have recognized that the one placed on the cross was the Lord of all the elements. All the elements trembled beneath him. The sky was darkened. The sun fled away. The earth split apart. The tombs of the dead lay open, and the dead regained the company of the living. For this reason also the centurion said, “Truly this man was the Son of God.” The centurion recognizes a stranger, but the Levite does not know his own. The Gentile worships him, but the Hebrew denies him. It was reasonable that the pillars of the world moved when the chief priests did not believe.
