But neither is he free from guilt who crucified the author of his own salvation and did not seek forgiveness afterwards. Let it be that he did not know before whom he was persecuting; nevertheless, when he was placed on the cross, he ought to have recognized that he was the Lord of all the elements, under whom all elements trembled, the sky was darkened, the sun withdrew, the earth split, the tombs of the dead were opened, and the dead received the company of the living. And the centurion said: Truly this man was the Son of God. The centurion recognizes the foreigner, the Levite does not recognize his own: the Gentile venerates, the Hebrew renounces. Therefore, it is not without reason that the pillars of the world were moved when the chief priests did not believe.
