You have blotted it out, indeed, in your hearts and minds, but the Word of God is not blotted out, the Holy Spirit is not blotted out but turns away from impious minds. It is not grace but iniquity that is blotted out; for it is written, “I am he, I am he who blots out your iniquities.” - "On the Holy Spirit 3.10.61"
