Now Rebekah conceived and by her patience untied the knot of sterility. Let us consider what her prophetic and apostolic soul brought to birth, and how. “She went to consult the Lord,” because the children leapt up in her womb, and she received the reply, “Two nations are in your womb.” For of herself she presumes nothing but invokes God as supreme protector of her counsels; filled with peace and piety, she joins two nations together by her faith and by prophecy and encloses them in her womb, so to speak. Not without reason is she called sister rather than wife, because her gentle and peaceable soul enjoys a reputation for affection common to all rather than for union with one individual and because she thought that she was bound to all rather than to one.
