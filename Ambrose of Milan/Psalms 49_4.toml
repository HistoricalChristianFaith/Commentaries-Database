The Lord opens up a theme or problem that has been closed when he finds an apt organ and a chosen instrument. Call it a harp. Such as this was Paul. He rang out the sweet canticle of grace, awaking all the strings of his harp in harmonious sound; plucking the inner chords by grace of the Holy Spirit and playing in ringing tones both interiorly and exteriorly.… Excellent harp, where a person’s life is in tune with his faith, and his flesh with his soul. Sweet harp, where discipline of lifestyle sings a canticle.
