Wisdom does not live with vice in any way but unites without conflict with the other virtues. Her spirit is intelligent, without blemish, trustworthy, holy, loving of the good, acute, not opposed to any good, beneficent, stable, sure, possessing all virtues and seeing all. And then, "She teaches temperance and prudence, justice and fortitude." - "Duties of the Clergy 2.13.65"
