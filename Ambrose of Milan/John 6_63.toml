Learn now that as the Father is the Fount of life, so, too, many have stated that the Son is signified as the Fount of life. This is why he says that with you, almighty God, your Son is the Fount of life. That is the Fount of the Holy Spirit, for the Spirit is life, as the Lord says: “The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life,” for where the Spirit is, there also is life. And where life is, there is also the Holy Spirit.
