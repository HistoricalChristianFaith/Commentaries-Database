And what shall I say about the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, at whose death the people were mourning and the flute players were playing their music? On the assumption that she was indeed dead, solemn funeral services were already being performed. But her spirit returned immediately at the voice of the Lord. She arose with revived body and partook of food to furnish proof that she was alive.
