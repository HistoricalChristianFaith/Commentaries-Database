Our ancestors, as heirs and next of kin of the patriarchs, were planted in the promised land. They did not gain this by any merits of their own. It was not Moses who led them in, for fear they should attribute it to the Law and not to grace. For the Law examines our merits; but grace looks to faith. How excellently the apostle has followed the faith of his ancestors when he says, “he that plants is nothing, he that waters is nothing. It is God who gives the increase.” It was not Joshua, son of Nun, even though he led the people in and planted them—but God who gave the increase. To him first be the glory.

When God is pleased with us, it is because he has given us the grace to be pleasing to him. Scripture teaches us that this is a gift specially bestowed on people in pure and utter kindness and not to be arrogantly usurped.
