Deceit should be far from your thoughts, and you should not indulge in slander against your neighbor. God has made you a hunter, not a harrier, for he says, “Behold, I will send you many hunters”—hunters not of crime but of absolution from it. Hunters certainly not of sin but of grace. You are a fisher of Christ, for whom it is said, “From now on, you shall make people live.”
