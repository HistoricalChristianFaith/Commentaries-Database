I now understand more plainly what I have read, that one wheel runs within another and is not impeded. For a life lived without any offense is a rounded life, whatever the sufferings in which it is lived, and even within such it runs like a wheel. The law runs within grace, and the keeping of the law lies within the course of Godâ€™s mercy; the more it rolls, the more it gains approval.
