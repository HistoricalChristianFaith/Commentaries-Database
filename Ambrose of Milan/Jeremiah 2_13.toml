And so the church of the soul went down to the fountain of wisdom to fill its own vessel and drew up the teachings of pure wisdom that the Jews did not wish to draw from the flowing fountain. Listen to him as he says who that fountain is: “They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water.”

So when the whole world was parched with the drought of Gentile superstition, then came that dew of the heavenly visits on the fleece. But after that the lost sheep of the house of Israel (whom I think that the figure of the Jewish fleece foreshadowed), after that those sheep, I say, “had refused the fountain of living water,” the dew of moistening faith dried up in the breasts of the Jews and that divine Fountain turned away its course to the hearts of the Gentiles.
