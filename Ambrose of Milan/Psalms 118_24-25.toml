We must keep the law regarding Easter in such a way that we do not observe the fourteenth as the day of the resurrection; that day or one very close to it is the day of the passion, because the feast of the resurrection is kept on the Lord’s day. Moreover, we cannot fast on the Lord’s day; fasting on this day is what we criticize in the Manichaeans. One shows disbelief in the resurrection of Christ if he proposes a law that we fast on the day of the resurrection, since the law says that the Passover should be eaten with bitterness, that is, with sorrow because the author of our salvation was slain by humanity’s great sacrilege. On the Lord’s day the prophet bids us rejoice, saying, “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us be glad and rejoice at it.”
