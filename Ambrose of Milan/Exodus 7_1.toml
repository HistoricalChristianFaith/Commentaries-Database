He so far exceeded the dignity of his human state that he was given the title of “god” as we read in the Scriptures, where the Lord speaks: “I have appointed you the god of Pharaoh.” He was in fact victorious over all his passions and was not allured by the enticements of the world. He enveloped this our habitation here in the body with a purity that savored of a “citizenship that is in heaven.” By directing his mind and by subduing and castigating his flesh with an authority that was almost regal, he was given the name of “god,” by whom he had modeled his life through numerous acts of perfect virtue.

But if they think [Christ] is called God because he had an in-dwelling of the Godhead within him, as many holy men were (for the Scripture calls them gods to whom the word of God came)—they do not place him before other men but think he is to be compared with them. They consider him to be the same as he granted other men to be, even as he says to Moses: “I have made you a god unto Pharaoh.” Similarly it is also said in the psalms: “I have said, you are gods.”
