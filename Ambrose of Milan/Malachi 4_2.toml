But in case the evidence presented to your eyes may appear to be scanty, cleanse your ears and apply it to the heavenly oracles: “On the word of two or three witnesses every word is confirmed.” Hear God speaking: “Let there be lights made in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth.” Who says this? God says it. And to whom is he speaking, if not to his Son? Therefore God the Father says, “Let the sun be made,” and the Son made the sun, for it was fitting that the Sun of justice should make the sun of the world. He therefore brought it light. He illuminated it and granted it the power of light. Therefore the sun was made. For this reason it is also a subject, since it has been said, “You have founded the earth and it continues. By your ordinance the day goes on, for all things serve you.”

Do not, therefore, without due consideration put your trust in the sun. It is true that it is the eye of the world, the joy of the day, the beauty of the heavens, the charm of nature and the most conspicuous creation. When you behold it, reflect on its author. When you admire it, give praise to its creator. If the sun as consort of and participant in nature is so pleasing, how much goodness is there to be found in that Sun of justice? If the sun is so swift that in its rapid course by day and night it is able to traverse all things, how great is he who is always and everywhere and fills all things with his majesty! If that which is bidden to come forth is deemed worthy of our admiration of whom we read, “Who commands the sun and it rises not!” If the sun which the succession of the seasons advances or recedes is mighty, how mighty must he be also who “when he emptied himself” that we might be able to see him, who “was the true light that enlightens every man who comes into this world!”

Because Jacob’s faith and devotion were unconquerable, the Lord revealed his hidden mysteries to him by touching the side of his thigh. For it was by descent from him that the Lord Jesus was born to a virgin, and Jesus would be neither unlike nor unequal to God. The numbness in the side of Jacob’s thigh foreshadowed the cross of Christ, who would bring salvation to all by spreading forgiveness of sins throughout the whole world and would give resurrection to the departed by the numbness and torpidity of his own body. On this account the sun rose on holy Jacob, for the saving cross of the Lord shone brightly on his lineage, and at the same time the Sun of justice recognizes God, because he is himself the everlasting light. But Jacob limped because of his thigh. “On account of this the children of Israel do not eat the sinew even to the present day.” Would that they had eaten it and believed! But because they were not about to do the will of God, therefore they did not eat. There are those too who take the passage in the following sense that Jacob limped from one thigh. Two people flowed from his lineage, and there was then being revealed the numbness which one of them would presently exhibit toward the grace of faith. And so it is the people itself that limped by reason of the numbness of its unbelief.
