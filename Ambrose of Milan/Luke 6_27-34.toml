Love is commanded when it is said, “Love your enemies,” so that the saying which was uttered already before the church may be fulfilled: “Set in order love in me.” For love is set in order when the precepts of love are formed. See how it began from the heights and cast the law undeneath the backs of the gospel’s blessing. The law commands the revenge of punishment. The gospel bestows love for hostility, benevolence for hatred, prayer for curses, help for the persecuted, patience for the hungry and grace of reward. How much more perfect the athlete who does not feel injury!

What Christ said in word, he proved also by example. Indeed, when he was on the cross, he said in reference to his persecutors who were slandering him, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing,” so that he might pray for his slanderers, although he could have forgiven them himself.
