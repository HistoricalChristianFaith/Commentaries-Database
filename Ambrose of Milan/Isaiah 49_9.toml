[When] we have changed our creditor, we have not entirely escaped, or, rather, we have escaped, but the debt remains, while the interest is canceled, the Lord Jesus saying, “To them that are bound, come forth. And to them that are in prison, go forth,” for your sins have been forgiven. He has forgiven all, and there is no one whom he has not set free.
