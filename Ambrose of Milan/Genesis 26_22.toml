Now Isaac reopened many wells that his father had dug, but strangers had filled them after the death of his father Abraham. Beyond the others he dug the following wells: one in the valley of Gerar, and he found there a well of living water; and the shepherds of Gerar disputed with Isaac’s shepherds, because they claimed the water of this well as their own, and he called its name “Injustice.” And he dug another well over which a quarrel arose, and he called it “Enmity.” And he dug a third well, over which no dispute began among the shepherds, and he called it “Room Enough.” He also dug a well and did not find water in it and called that well “Well of the Oath.” Would anyone reading of these things consider that those works were earthly rather than spiritual?
