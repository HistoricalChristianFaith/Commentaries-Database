Yes, the famine had taken hold of them. For all people that have not been fed by Christ are hungry. And so let us buy the nourishment with which we can avert famine. Let no one hold back out of consideration of his poverty; let no one who does not have money be afraid. Christ does not ask money but faith, which is more valuable than money. Indeed Peter, who did not have money, bought him. “Silver and gold I do not have,” he said, “but what I have I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ arise and walk.” And the prophet Isaiah says, “All you who are thirsty, come to the water, and you that have no money come, buy, and drink and eat without money and without the price of the wine.” For he who paid the price of his blood for us did not ask a price from us, because he redeemed us not with gold or silver but with his precious blood. Therefore you owe that price with which you have been bought. Even though he does not always demand it, you still owe it. Buy Christ for yourself, then, not with what few people possess, but with what all people possess by nature but few offer on account of fear. What Christ claims from you is his own. He gave his life for everyone; he offered his death for everyone. Pay on behalf of your Creator what you are going to pay by law. He is not bargained for at a slight price, and not all persons see him readily. Indeed, those virgins in the Gospel whom the bridegroom kept out upon his coming were left out of doors exactly because they did not buy the oil that was for sale. On this account it is said to them, “Go rather to those who sell it, and buy some for yourselves.” Likewise that merchant deserves praise who sold all his goods and bought the pearl.
