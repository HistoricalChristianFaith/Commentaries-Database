Lowly servants have grounds on which they may glory; Joseph also was a servant. Those who have passed from freedom into slavery through some exigency have a source of consolation. They have something to imitate, so that they may learn that their status can change but not their character; that among household servants there is liberty; and that in servitude there is constancy. Masters have something to hope for through good and humble servants. Abraham found a wife for his son through a servant of his household. The Lord blessed the Egyptian’s house on account of Joseph, and the blessing of the Lord was granted to all his property in house and in fields. “And he entrusted all things whatsoever were his into the hands of Joseph.” We note that what the masters could not govern, mere servants governed.
