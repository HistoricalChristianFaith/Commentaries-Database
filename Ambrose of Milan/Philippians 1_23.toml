And so that you may know that it is good to agree the beginning and the end, Jesus Himself says: I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. Therefore, since our mind is always with him, let it never depart from his temple, from his word. Let it always be in the reading of the Scriptures, in meditations, in prayers, so that his word, who he is, may always work in us, and so that every day as we go to the Church, or as we engage in domestic prayers, we may begin with him and end in him. Therefore, may the whole day of our life and the course of the day take its beginning from him and end in him. For just as it is necessary to believe and be initiated to God from the beginning of life, so perseverance is necessary until the end. But no one is good, except God alone. From Him we proceed, created by Him: to Him we return, for to be with Christ is much better.

What does this departure mean but the dissolution and torpor of the body, while the soul for its part is turned toward its rest and made free, if it be faithful, “to be with Christ”?
