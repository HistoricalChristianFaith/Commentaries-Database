He had above proposed that the kingdom of God should be preached. When he had said that one tittle cannot fall from the law, he added, “Everyone who puts away his wife, and marries another, commits adultery.” The apostle rightly admonishes, saying that this is a great sacrament concerning Christ and the church. You find a marriage that doubtlessly was joined by God, when he himself says, “No man comes to me, unless my Father who sent me has drawn him.” He alone could join this marriage. Solomon mystically said, “A wife will be prepared for a man by God.” The man is Christ, and the wife is the church that is a wife in love and a virgin in innocence. Do not let him whom God has drawn to the Son be separated by persecution, distracted by extravagance, ravaged by philosophy, tainted by Manichaeus, perverted by Arius, or infected by Sabellius. God has joined; let not a Jew separate. All who desire to defile the truth of faith and wisdom are adulterers.… Come, Lord Jesus, to find your bride not tainted or polluted. She has not defiled your house or disregarded your commandments. Let her say to you, “I found him whom my soul loved.” Let her lead you into the house of wine. Wine makes glad the heart of man. Let the Spirit saturate her. Let her recognize the mystery and speak the prophecy.
