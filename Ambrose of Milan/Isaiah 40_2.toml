There is also another type of consolation to those who remove heavy punishments, as you have it written in the book of Isaiah: “Comfort, comfort my people,” says the Lord. “Priests, speak to the heart of Jerusalem, comfort it, for its humiliation is complete, its sin is removed, for it has received from the Lord’s hand double for its sins.” Although faith was lacking, punishment makes good; those who are not absolved by the praise of merits are relieved by the removal of punishments.
