We have shown by the clear evidence of the Scripture that the apostles and prophets were appointed, the latter to prophesy, the former to preach the gospel, by the Holy Spirit in the same way as by the Father and the Son. Now we add what all will rightly wonder at and not be able to doubt, that the Spirit was on Christ; and that as he sent the Spirit, so the Spirit sent the Son of God. For the Son of God says, “The Spirit of the Lord is on me, because he has appointed me, he has sent me to preach the gospel.” And having read this from the book of Isaiah, he says in the Gospel, “Today has this Scripture been fulfilled in your ears,” that he might point out that it was said of himself.

Here is the one who says, “My teaching is not mine but his who sent me. If anyone wants to do his will, let him know about the teaching, whether it is from God or I am speaking by my own authority.” For one is teaching from God, the other is human teaching. Thus, the Jews, when they asked whether his teaching was taken from people, saying, “How has he known these writings without learning them?” Jesus replied, “My teaching is not mine.”
