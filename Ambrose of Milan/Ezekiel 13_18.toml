The prophet was lamenting the wretched frailty of our condition, which has no rest in this life and loses everything by death’s sudden onset. For the Holy Spirit revealed to him that man would not arise for so long a time, until he should come who would refuse to stitch the old to the new or join new material to the old but would make all things new, even as he said, “Behold, I make all things new!”
