Now “he sent away his brothers, and they departed. And Joseph said to them, ‘Be not angry on the way.’ ” How well he teaches us to guard against anger, for that can separate even brothers who love one another.… Is this not what our Lord Jesus said when he was about to depart from this body, when he was sending away his disciples, that they should not be angry on the way? For he says, “Peace I leave with you, my peace I give to you.” For where there is peace, wrath does not have place, discord is removed, dissension routed. And so this is what he is saying, “My peace I give to you,” that is, “Be not angry on the way.” … On this account also, when the Lord Jesus sent away his disciples to preach the gospel, he sent them without gold, without silver, without money, without a staff, and he did it so that he might remove incentives to quarreling and the tools of vengeance.
