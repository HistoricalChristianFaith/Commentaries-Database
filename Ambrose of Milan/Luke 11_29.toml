The mystery of the church is clearly expressed. Her flocks stretch from the boundaries of the whole world. They stretch to Nineveh through penitence and to the Queen of the South through zeal to obtain wisdom. Thus it may know the words of the peaceable Solomon. The queenâ€™s kingdom is undivided and rises from diverse and distant peoples to one body. That great sacrament is concerning Christ and the church, but this is nevertheless greater because of what prefigured it. The mystery is now fulfilled in truth. There was the image of Solomon, but here is Christ in his own body.
