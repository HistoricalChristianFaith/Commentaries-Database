Ambros., in Luc 7:19: Some understand it thus; That it was a great thing that John should be so far a prophet, as to acknowledge Christ, and to preach remission of sin; but that like a pious prophet; he could not think that He whom he had believed to be He that should come, was to suffer death; he doubted therefore though not in faith, yet in love. So Peter also doubted, saying, "This be far from thee, Lord; this shall not be unto thee.‚Äù .
And perhaps the two disciples sent are the two people; those of the Jews, and those of the Gentiles who believed.
