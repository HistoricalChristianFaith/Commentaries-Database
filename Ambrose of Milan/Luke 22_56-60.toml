What difference does it make that the maid is the first to give Peter away? The men could have recognized him instead. Perhaps this happened so that we may see that the female sex also sinned by killing the Lord, so that his passion should also redeem womankind. A woman therefore was the first to receive the mystery of the resurrection and to obey the commands, so that she abolished the old error of her sin.
