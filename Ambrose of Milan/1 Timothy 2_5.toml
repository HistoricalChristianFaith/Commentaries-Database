But what is he who is at once the Most High and man, what but “the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus who gave himself as a ransom for us”? This text indeed refers properly to his incarnation, for our redemption was made by his blood, our pardon comes through his power, our life is secured through his grace. He gives as the Most High; he prays as man. The one is the office of the Creator; the other of a redeemer. Be the gifts as distinct as they may, yet the Giver is one, for it was fitting that our Maker should be our Redeemer.

Let not the venom of Apollinaris flatter itself because it is written, “And in appearance he was found as a man,” for the manhood of Jesus is not thereby denied but confirmed, since elsewhere Paul himself speaks of him as “Mediator of God and men, himself man, Christ Jesus.” It is the customary manner of Scripture so to express itself as we also read in the Gospel, “And we saw his glory—glory as of the only-begotten of the Father.” As he is there called only-begotten Son of God, so he is said to be man, and the fullness of humanity that was in him is not denied.
