The Song of Songs alludes to [the vine and fig of the field] in this way: “I have adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and by the virtues of the field, that you do not rouse or wake my love until he please.” This is the same peaceful field [of righteousness] of which the Lord also says in the psalm, “All that moves in the field is mine.” In this field the grape is found that was pressed and poured out blood and washed the world clean. In this field is the tree, and beneath it the saints will find rest and be renewed by a good and spiritual grace. In this field is the olive tree fruitful in the overwhelming ointment of the peace of the Lord. In this field flourish the pomegranate trees that shelter many fruits with the one bulwark of faith and nurture them with the warm embrace of love, so to speak. .

We read in Genesis that God planted a garden to the east and put there the man he had formed. Who had the power to create paradise, if not almighty God, who “spoke and all was made” and who was never in need of that which he wished to bring into being? He planted, therefore, that paradise of which he says is his wisdom: “Every plant which my Father has not planted will be rooted up.” This is a goodly plantation, for angels and saints are said to lie beneath the fig tree and the vine. In this respect they are the type of the angels in that time of peace which is to come.
