But is this the only place we read of “substance”? Has it not also been said in another passage: “The gates of the cities are broken down, the mountains are fallen, and his substance is revealed”? What, does the word mean something created here also? Some, I know, are accustomed to say that the substance is substance in money. Then, if you give this meaning to the word, the mountains fell in order that someone’s possessions of money might be seen. But let us remember what mountains fell, those, namely, of which it has been said, “If you shall have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say to this mountain, ‘Be removed, and be cast into the sea!’ ” By mountains, then, are meant high things that exalt themselves.
