Although Peter was ready in spirit, he still was weak in physical love. Christ rebuked him before he denied the Lord. Not even Peter could equal the steadfastness of the divine purpose. The Lord’s Passion has imitators but no equals. I do not criticize Peter’s denial, but I praise his weeping. The one is common to nature, but the other is peculiar to virtue.

Beware then of boasting, beware of the world; he is commanded to strengthen his own brethren, who said, Master, wehave left all, and followed you.
Now Peter although earnest in spirit, yet still weak in bodily inclination, is declared about to deny his Lord; for he could not equal the constancy of the Divine will. Our Lord's Passion has rivals, but no equal.
