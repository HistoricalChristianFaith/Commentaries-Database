“And Joseph was wandering about,” because he could not find his brothers. And it was right that he wandered about, for he was seeking those that were going astray. Yes, “the Lord knows who are his.” Indeed, Jesus also, when he was wearied from his journey, sat at the well. He was wearied, for he was not finding the people of God whom he was seeking; they had gone out from the face of the Lord. The person who follows sin goes out from Christ. The sinner goes out; the just person enters in. Indeed, Adam hid himself as a sinner, but the just person says, “Let my prayer enter in before you.”
