It is their right to possess the land, for in them God finds rest. We see this from the words of divine prophecy spoken by Isaiah: “On whom shall I rest, if not on those who are poor and little and who tremble at my word?” Who are the meek? They are those not easily roused to wrath, not quick to quarrel. Anger does not trouble them, fierceness does not drive them mad, raging cruelty does not enflame them. While still in the body they loved the peace of the Lord better than wine, banquets and riches. They thought to give up bodily pleasures and delights to gain instead eternal grace; these are the people who “shall delight in abundance of peace.”
