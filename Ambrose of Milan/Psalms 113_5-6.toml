Another psalm that was read says, “Who is as the Lord our God who dwells on high and looks down on the low things in heaven and in earth?” God, no doubt, casts his eyes on the lowly, he who laid bare the relics of the holy martyrs of his church, lying hid under the lowly turf, their souls in heaven, their bodies in the earth: “Raising up the needy person out of the dust, lifting up the poor person out of the dunghill,” placing him, as you see, with the princes of his people. Whom are we to think of as the princes of his people if not the holy martyrs in whose number long ago the unknown Protase and Gervase were given place? They now cause the church at Milan, barren of martyrs, now the mother of many children, to rejoice in the glory and examples of their suffering.
