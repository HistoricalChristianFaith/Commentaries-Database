The veil also is rent, by which is declared the division of the two people, and the profanation of the synagogue. The old veil is rent that the Church may hang up the new veils of faith. The covering of the synagogue is drawn up, that we may behold with the eyes of the mind the inward mysteries of religion now revealed to us.

The veil is torn. This declared the division of the two peoples or the profanation of the mysteries of the synagogue. The old veil is torn, so that the church may hang the new veils of its faith.
