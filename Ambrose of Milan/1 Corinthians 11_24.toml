Do you wish to know how it is consecrated with heavenly words? Accept what the words are. The priest speaks. He says: Perform for us this oblation written, reasonable, acceptable, which is a figure of the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ.… Before it is consecrated, it is bread; but when Christ’s words have been added, it is the body of Christ.… And before the words of Christ, the chalice is full of wine and water. When the words of Christ have been added, then blood is effected which redeemed the people.
