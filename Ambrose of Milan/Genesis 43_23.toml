They indeed had said to him, “We found the money of each one of us in our sacks. We have brought back our money in full weight.” O mighty mysteries, and mysteries clearly portrayed! This is to say: Why are you puffed up? Do you assume too often that the money you have in your sacks is your own? What indeed do you have which you have not received? But if you have received it, why do you boast as if you have not received it? Now you have been satisfied, you have become rich;10 you believe that you possess the money, but the God of your fathers has given the money to you. He is your God, he is the God of your ancestors, and you have denied him. But he grants pardon and forgiveness and receives you back if you should return. He is the one who does not ask your money but gives his own. He has given you money in your sacks. Now your sacks hold money that used to hold mire; and therefore he is your companion who says, “You have cut off my sackcloth and have clothed me with gladness.” The gift of gladness is Christ. He is your money; he is your price. The Lord Jesus does not demand from you the price of his grain, does not ask the weight of your money. Your money is unsound; the money in your purse is not good. “I have received your good money”;12 that is, it is not your material money but your spiritual money that is good. You have brought it down out of faith and devotion like the sons of Jacob; it is expended without loss and is counted out without any deficit, seeing that for such a price the loss that is death is avoided and the profit that is life is gained.
