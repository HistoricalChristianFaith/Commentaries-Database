Therefore we ought to believe that God is good, eternal, perfect, almighty and true, such as we find him in the Law and the Prophets and the rest of the Holy Scriptures, for otherwise there is no God. For he who is God must be good, seeing that fullness of goodness is of the nature of God. God, who made time, cannot be in time. Again, God cannot be imperfect, for a lesser being is plainly imperfect, seeing that it lacks somewhat whereby it could be made equal to a greater. This, then, is the teaching of our faith—that God is not evil, that with God nothing is impossible, that God does not exist in time, that God is beneath no being. If I am in error, let my adversaries prove it.

You may know both that the Father is eternal and that the Son is not different from him. The source of his generation is he who is, and he is begotten of the Eternal. He is God, coming forth from the Father. He is the Son. He is from God. He is the Word. He is the radiance of the Father’s glory, the expression of his substance, the counterpart of God, the image of his majesty. He is the bounty of him who is bountiful, the wisdom of him who is wise, the power of the mighty One, the truth of him who is true, the life of the living One. ON THE CHRISTIAN FAITH 2.
