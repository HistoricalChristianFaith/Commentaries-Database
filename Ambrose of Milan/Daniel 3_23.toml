It happens that one may witness merit and virtue made manifest even in captivity. For Jeremiah was not less happy in captivity, nor was Daniel, nor Esdras, nor were Anania and Azaria and Misael less happy than if they had not fallen into captivity. They entered into captivity in such a way that they brought to their people both present consolations in captivity and the hope of escaping it. It falls to the one who has been perfected to sustain nature’s common lot with courageous spirit, to bring it to better things and not to give way before those experiences that most people consider fearful and frightening. Instead, like a brave soldier, one must withstand onslaughts of the most severe calamities and undergo conflicts; like a pilot of foresight, he must steer his ship in the storm, and as he meets the mounting waves, he must avoid shipwreck by plowing through such waters rather than by turning away from them.… He is not weak in regard to wrongs done to his own or anxious about the burial of his body, for he knows that heaven is its due.… The one who is perfected is such that he wished to do good to all people and desires that no evil befall anyone; but if something happens beyond his wish, he loses nothing of his own happiness.
