John, who baptized, stood by, and behold, the Holy Spirit descended as a dove. Not a dove descended, but “as a dove.” … Descended for what reason? Not that the Lord Jesus himself might seem to be in need of the mystery of sanctification, but that he himself might sanctify, that the Spirit also might sanctify.
