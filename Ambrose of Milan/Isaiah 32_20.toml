Accordingly, like a perfect man learned in the law and made firm in the gospel, accept the faith of both Testaments, for, as we read today, “Blessed is he who sows upon every water, where the ox and the donkey tread,” that is, who sows upon the people who follow the teaching of both Testaments. This is the ploughman’s ox, wearing the yoke of the law, of which the law says, “You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out your corn,” for this ox has the horns of holy Scripture. But in the Gospel the Lord, representing the people of the Gentiles, mounts the colt of a donkey.
