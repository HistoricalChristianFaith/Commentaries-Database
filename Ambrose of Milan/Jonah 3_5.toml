If the apostle said too little [about fasting], let them hear the prophet [in the psalm] saying, “I afflicted my soul with fasting.” One who does not fast is uncovered and naked and exposed to wounds. Finally, if Adam had uncovered himself with fasting, he would not have become naked. Nineveh freed itself from death by fasting. The Lord himself said, “But this kind of demon will be cast out only by prayer and fasting.”
