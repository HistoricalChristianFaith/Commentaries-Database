This is a great sign of divine power and a great lesson of virtue. The intention of betrayal is revealed, and yet patience is not denied. You have shown, Lord, whom he betrayed, while you reveal the hidden things. You have also shown whom he betrayed, when you say “the Son of man,” because the flesh, not the Godhead, is meant. Nevertheless Christ even more refutes the ingratitude that betrayed him. Although he was the Son of God, yet for our sake he was willing to be the Son of man. It is as if he would say, “Because of you, ungrateful one, I took upon myself what you betray.” Look at the hypocrisy! I think it is exposed through the question that accuses the traitor with the compassion of love: “Judas, do you betray the Son of man with a kiss?” That is like saying, “Do you wound with the pledge of love, shed blood in the duty of charity, and give death with the instrument of peace? Do you, a servant, betray your Lord, a disciple his master, a chosen one the creator?” In other words, “The wounds of a friend are more useful than the voluntary kisses of an enemy.” He says this to a traitor. What does Christ say to a peacemaker? “Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth.” He kissed Judas, not that Christ should teach us to pretend but that he should not appear to flee from betrayal. Hence he did not deprive Judas of the dues of love. It is written, “I was peaceful among those that hate peace.”
