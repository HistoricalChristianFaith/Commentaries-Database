Because the Lord said of the Jews in Jeremiah: “My inheritance has become to me like a lion,” Paul would not say they were not heirs. But there are heirs without property and those with property, and while the testator lives, those who are mentioned in the will are called heirs, though they are without property.… Just like children, so are the Jews also under a tutor. The law is our tutor. A tutor brings us to the master. Christ is our only master: “Do not say lord and master to yourselves, for one only is your master, the Christ.”
