I know that this part of the text is disturbing to many. Indeed, if circumcision is a good thing, it should be maintained today as well. If it is useless, it never should have been mandated in the first place, particularly not by divine precept. But, inasmuch as the apostle said, “Abraham received the sign of circumcision,” certainly the sign is not the reality itself but points to another reality. That is, it is not the truth but points to the truth. In fact, Paul expounds this teaching in the following terms: “He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of justice and of faith.” For this reason it is not inappropriate for us to understand that bodily circumcision is a sign of spiritual circumcision. Therefore the sign remained until the truth arrived. The Lord Jesus arrived, he who says, “I am the way and the truth and the life,” because he circumcises the whole person in truth, not a minor bodily member in sign. He abolished the sign; he installed the truth, because once that which was perfect arrived, that which was partial was abolished. Thus the circumcision of a part ceased when the circumcision of the whole shone forth. For it is now no longer man in part but the whole man who is saved in body, saved in soul. For it is written, “If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.” This is the perfect circumcision, because through the sacrifice of the body the soul is redeemed, of which the Lord himself says, “Whoever loses his life for my sake, he will save it.”

Abraham is ordered to circumcise himself when he is about to receive the inheritance of a true progeny. Is it not evident that “circumcision of the flesh” is the precept of chastity, that one should remove the passions of the flesh and curb the desires that unbridled lust renders indomitable? Indeed, the very word circumcision prescribes this, that every stench of impurity be wiped away and that the stimulus of the passions be removed.
