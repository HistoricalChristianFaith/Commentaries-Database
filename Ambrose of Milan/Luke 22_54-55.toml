One close to denial fittingly followed from afar, because he could not have denied him if he had stayed close to Christ. Perhaps we should venerate him for this with the greatest admiration, because he did not forsake the Lord although he was afraid.â€¦ Peter follows Christ because of devotion. He denies because of sudden temptation. It is commonplace that he falls, and it is through faith that he repents. The fire was already burning in the house of the chief priest. Peter approached to warm himself, because with the imprisonment of the Lord, the warmth of his mind had already cooled within him.
