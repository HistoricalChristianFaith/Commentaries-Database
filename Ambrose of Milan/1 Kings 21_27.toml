Rich people grow angry and calumniate so that they may do injury if they do not obtain what they desire. But when by their calumny they do cause injury, they pretend they are sorry; yet sad and grief-stricken, as it were, not in heart but in countenance, they set out for the place of the stolen estate and take possession by their unjust and violent procedure. - "On Naboth 11.47"
