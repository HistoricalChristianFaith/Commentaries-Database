What more should I say? He did not open his mouth to those planning deceit, and, as though he did not hear, he thought no word should be returned, nor did he answer their reproaches. When he was spoken of evilly, he prayed. When he was cursed, he blessed. He walked in simplicity of heart and fled from the proud. He was a follower of those unspotted from the world, one who mixed ashes with his food when bewailing his sins, and mingled his drink with weeping. Worthily, then, was he called for by all the people. All the tribes of Israel came to him, saying, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. Also yesterday and the day before when Saul lived, and reigned, you were he that led out and brought in Israel. And the Lord said to you, you shall feed my people!” And why should I say more about him of whom the word of the Lord has gone forth to say: “I have found David according to my heart” Who else always walked in holiness of heart and in justice as he did, so as to fulfill the will of God; for whose sake pardon was granted to his children when they sinned, and their rights were preserved to his heirs?
