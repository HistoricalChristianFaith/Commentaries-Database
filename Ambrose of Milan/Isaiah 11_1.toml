Also in Isaiah is it written: “There will come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower will go up from his root.” The root is the family of the Jews, the rod is Mary, and the flower is her Christ. When he blossoms in our land, makes fragrant the field of the soul, and flourishes in his church, we can no longer fear the cold or rain, but only anticipate the day of judgment. - "Apology on David 8.43"

Scripture also expresses the Son’s incarnation beautifully: “from a bud you have gone up,” for like a plant of the earth he was to be conceived in the womb of a virgin. And like a fragrant flower sent forth from the maternal bosom in the splendor of the dawn, he was to go up for the redemption of the whole world, as Isaiah says: “There will come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a flower will blossom from his root.” The root is the family of the Jews, the rod is Mary, and the flower is her Christ. It is right, therefore, that the rod which is of royal lineage from the house of David, whose flower is Christ, who vanquished the foul odor of worldly filth, poured forth the fragrance of eternal life. - "On the Patriarchs 4.19–20"

The root of Jesse the patriarch is the family of the Jews, Mary is the rod, Christ the flower of Mary, who, about to spread the good odor of faith throughout the whole world, budded forth from a virgin womb, as he himself said: “I am the flower of the plain, a lily of the valley.” - "On the Holy Spirit 2.5"
