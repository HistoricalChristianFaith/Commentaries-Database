By Abel we understand the Christian who cleaves to God, as David says: “It is good for me to adhere to my God,” that is, to attach oneself to heavenly things and to shun the earthly. Elsewhere he says, “My soul has fainted in your word,” thus indicating his rule of life was directed toward reflections on the Word and not on the pleasures of this world. Wherefore we realize that what we read concerning David in the book of Kings is not an idle statement but is said with due weight and reflection: “And he was laid with his fathers.” We are given to understand that his faith was like that of his father’s. It is clear, then, that there is reference here to participation in life and not to the burial of a body.
