But God, who knew that wine consumed in moderation would bring health and increase wisdom, and that excessive consumption would lead to vices, created the substance and left its abundance to human discretion. This way, the moderation of nature would serve as a lesson in sobriety, and the harmful consequences of excess would be attributed to human choice. In fact, even Noah himself became intoxicated and fell asleep as a result of wine. And so, through wine, the deformity that arose from the flood became evident to glory: but the Lord also reserved his grace in it, so that he might convert its fruit for our salvation, and through it forgiveness of sins might come to us.
