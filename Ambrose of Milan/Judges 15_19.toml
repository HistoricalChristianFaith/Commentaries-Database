Soon Samson began to feel a fierce thirst; there was no water, and he could no longer stand to bear his thirst. Knowing that to attain human help would not be easy and that it would be difficult without divine aid, he called upon and begged almighty God. He did not think God would help him because of his offense against him, and because he had unwisely and carefully attributed any success to himself. No, he even assigned the victory to almighty God, saying, “You have given this very great deliverance into the hand of your servant, and it has been my help. And behold! Because I die of thirst, I am placed by my need of water into the power of those over whom you gave me a great triumph.” Then God’s mercy opened the earth when Samson threw down the jawbone, and a stream issued from it, and Samson drank and resumed his spirit and called the place “the invoking of the spring.” Thus, by his prayer, he atoned for his vaunting of victory. - "Letter 35"
