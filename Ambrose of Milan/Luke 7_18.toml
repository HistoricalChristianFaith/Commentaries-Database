John is the type of the law which was the foreteller of Christ, the law which was held confined in the hearts of the unbelievers as if in prisons devoid of eternal light. The fruitful inner workings of punishment and the doors of malice restrained their hearts. The law rightly cannot achieve an outcome full of evidence of the divine dispensation without the assent of the gospel.
