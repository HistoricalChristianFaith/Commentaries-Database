There is also a third entreaty, for although David was set in the midst of people doing evil deeds, he eagerly desires that his case be separated from contagion with them. Many suppose that this sentiment should be attributed to the Lord Jesus, because it belongs to him alone not to fear judgment, as the one who overcomes when he is judged. Indeed, he has judgment from the unjust man, and into it Christ entered willingly, as you find it written, “O my people, what have I done to you? Or wherein have I grieved you?” But since the Father has given all judgment to him, not indeed as if to one that was weak but as if to a Son, what judgment can he undergo? If they think that the Son must undergo the Father’s judgment, surely “the Father does not judge any man, but all judgment has been given to the Son, that all men may honor the Son even as they honor the Father.” The Father honors the Son, and do you not put him to judgment? We have expressed this thought here, so that no one would think that we substituted the figure of the psalmist in the Lord’s place out of fear of inquiry. Holy David foresees in spirit that the Jews will rise up against the Lord in his passion. Since he is not greatly afraid of the judgment upon his own faith, he beseeches that his own case be distinguished also from a nation of persecutors. Else, the stock of the entire Jewish race could be implicated with those wicked heirs of his own race and posterity.
