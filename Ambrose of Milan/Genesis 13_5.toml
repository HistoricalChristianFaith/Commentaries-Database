It remains to be seen if Lot too, his nephew, was rich as one who belonged to the same family. But Scripture says only that he had many cattle. In fact, the text reads, “Lot also, who went with Abraham, had flocks, herds and tents.” He had no silver, because he was not yet just; in fact, “the tongue of the just man is like silver purified by fire.” He had no gold, which was the possession of the one who saw the posterity of Christ, of whom it is written: “And his posterity shines like gold.” Abraham saw him, as the Lord testified when he said, “Abraham saw my day and rejoiced.” This is why he deserved to shine like gold and to have gold as his endowment.

It is impossible for me to omit here a discussion of a question that has stumped even the more learned, namely, why the text is worded this way: “Lot also, who went with Abraham,” as though we were to understand that there was another Lot who did not go with him. And many believe the problem is as yet unresolved. So to satisfy these and at the same time to abide by the rule of Scripture, we would say that there is one person who takes on two roles, that in one and the same individual two things are signified. Numerically Lot is a single individual; virtually he is two. In fact, Lot, according to the Latin interpretation, means declinatio (“a deviation”). But one can deviate either from the good or from the bad. So when Lot deviated from the bad, that is, from error, from base and criminal behavior, he was joined to his uncle. When he deviated from the good, that is, from what is just, innocent, holy and sacred, he was joined to baseness. This is why it says, “now Lot too, who accompanied Abraham,” because he had not yet chosen Sodom, and he was not dwelling among those who are authors of evil. Thereafter he did go to live in Sodom. And so it was that he became alienated from himself; he thought of himself as of another, as of one, that is, who withdraws not only from the just man but even from himself.
