He describes the works of divine healing begun on the sabbath day, to show from the outset that the new creation began where the old creation ceased. He showed us that the Son of God is not under the law but above the law, and that the law will not be destroyed but fulfilled. For the world was not made through the law but by the Word, as we read: “By the Word of the Lord were the heavens established.” Thus the law is not destroyed but fulfilled, so that the renewal of humankind, already in error, may occur. The apostle too says, “Stripping yourselves of the old man, put on the new, who was created according to Christ.” He fittingly began on the sabbath, that he may show himself as Creator. He completed the work that he had already begun by weaving together works with works.

St. Luke did well to first set before us the man freed from a spirit of wickedness, then substituted the healing of a woman. The Lord had come to heal both sexes, and man must first be cured because he was created first. But woman, who had sinned by an uncertain mind rather than depravity, must not be overlooked.
