It is appropriate, for that person rises up who is hastening to Christ. Faith precedes devotion. First Jacob rose up; later he sacrificed. The man who has searched out the knowledge of God offers a good sacrifice. Now “at night in a vision God spoke to Israel, saying, ‘Jacob, Jacob.’ He said, ‘What is it?’ God said, ‘I am the God of your fathers, do not fear, go down into Egypt; for there I will make you into a great people, and I will lead you forever.’ ”
