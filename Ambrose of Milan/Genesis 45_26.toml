We surely notice how the Scripture says that he is alive and ruler of the whole land, for he opened his storehouses of spiritual grace and gave the abundance to all people. But when the apostles spoke this way, the Jews did not believe them; rather, they laid hands on them and thrust the preachers of salvation into prison. On this account also it is written of Jacob, “He was greatly frightened in heart,” for he did not believe his sons. He was greatly frightened from love of an unbelieving people, but afterward he came to recognize Christ’s deeds. Won over by the mighty benefactions and mighty works, he revived and said, “It is a great thing for me, if my son Joseph is still alive. I will go and see him, before I die.” The first and greatest foundation of faith is belief in the resurrection of Christ. For whosoever believes Christ has been restored to life, quickly searches for him, comes to him with devotion and worships God with his inmost heart. Indeed, he believes that he himself will not die if he has faith in the source of his resurrection.
