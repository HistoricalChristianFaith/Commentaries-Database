Therefore, in this psalm, the Lord reproaches the Jews, saying, 'I am poor because of you, I am in pain for you, and yet you raised impious hands against me, saying: Let us kill the righteous one, for he is useless to us' (Wis. 2:12). Let us put wood into his bread (Jeremiah 11:19). He spoke well of bread in place of his flesh. He brought nourishment, they gave punishment in return for kindness. It is not surprising, therefore, that those who denied themselves the food of eternal life are hungry. They also cleverly combined these two things: Let us put wood into his bread. The Jews did not know what they were saying, and they were speaking a mystery. The Cross of Christ gave us Paradise. This is the wood that the Lord showed to Adam, saying that from the tree of life, which was in the middle of Paradise, it was to be eaten; but not from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Adam erred, did not keep the commandment, tasted the forbidden fruit. Through the wood we began to hunger; because his flesh received nourishment. Therefore the Lord joined flesh and wood in Christ, so that ancient hunger would cease and life would be restored. Blessed is the wood of the Lord, which crucified all sins. Blessed is the flesh of the Lord, which provided food for all!
