Anna, who, by reason of her years of widowhood and her virtues, is set before us as wholly worthy of belief, announces that the Redeemer of all people has come... Not without purpose, however, does he make mention of the eightyfour years of her widowhood, because both the seven twelves and the two forties seemed to imply a number that is sacred.
