We will now speak of the fact that no one is without sin, except God. We ask of our adversaries to teach that there is sin in the Holy Spirit. They cannot teach this, however, instead demanding an authoritative testimony showing why we teach from the Scriptures that the Holy Spirit has not sinned, as one reads of the Son that he has not committed sin. And they would accept that we teach with the authority of Scripture, since it is written, “Because in wisdom there is a spirit intelligent, holy, unique, manifold, subtle, mobile, penetrating, without blemish.” The Scripture calls him “without blemish.” But has it perhaps lied regarding the Son, so you might believe it has also lied regarding the Spirit? In fact, the prophet said in the same passage of the book of Wisdom that “nothing defiled gains entrance into her.” Wisdom is without blemish, and its Spirit is without blemish. If, therefore, there is no sin in the Spirit, he is God. But how could the one who forgives sins be guilty of sin? Therefore he has not committed sin. And since there is no sin in him, he is not a creature. Every creature is in fact subject to sin. Only the eternal divinity is exempt from sin and without blemish.
