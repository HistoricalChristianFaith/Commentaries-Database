Peter also wept bitterly. He wept so that he could purge his sin with tears. If you want to deserve pardon, you should wash away your guilt with tears. At that same moment and time, Christ looks at you. If you perhaps fall into some sin, because he is a witness to your secrets, he looks at you so that you may recall and confess your error. Imitate Peter, when he says in another place for the third time, “Lord, you know that I love you.” Since he denied him a third time, he confesses him a third time. He denied at night, but he confesses by day. These words were written that we should know that no one must boast of himself. If Peter fell because he said, “Although others shall be scandalized in you, I shall not be scandalized,” what other person can rightly take himself for granted? Since David also said, “I said in my prosperity, ‘I shall never be moved,’ ” he admitted that his boasting had harmed him, saying, “You turned away your face, and I was troubled.”
