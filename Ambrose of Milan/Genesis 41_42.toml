On this account I think that Joseph merited rewards that were more mystical, because he spoke concerning mystical things. For what is the meaning of the ring that was put upon his finger? Only this, that we may understand that the pontificate of faith was bestowed on him so that he could himself seal others. What of the robe, which is the garment of wisdom? Only this, that preeminence in wisdom was granted to him by the King of heaven. The chain of gold appears to represent good understanding; the chariot too signifies the exalted height of merit.
