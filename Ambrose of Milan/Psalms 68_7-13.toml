Damasus cleansed not, Peter cleansed not, Ambrose cleansed not, Gregory cleansed not; for ours is the ministry, but the sacraments are yours. For human power cannot confer what is divine, but it is, O Lord, your gift and that of the Father, as you have spoken by the prophets, saying, “I will pour out of my Spirit on all flesh, and their sons and their daughters shall prophesy.” This is that typical dew from heaven, this is that gracious rain, as we read: “A gracious rain, dividing for his inheritance.” For the Holy Spirit is not subject to any foreign power or law but is the arbiter of his own freedom, dividing all things according to the decision of his own will, to each, as we read, individually as he wills.
