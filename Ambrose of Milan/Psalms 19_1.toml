As heaven is lighted with the splendor of the stars, so do people shine with the light of their good works, and their deeds shine before their Father in heaven. The one is the firmament of heaven on high; the other is a similar firmament of which it is said, “On this rock I will build my church.” The one is a firmament of the elements, the other of virtues, and this last is more excellent.
