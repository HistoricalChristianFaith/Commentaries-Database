Paul fled too, that he might pass out through a window and be lowered in a basket. Yes, he knew that the triplestranded rope could not break, but he fled so that he might preach the gospel of the Lord in the entire world, and consequently he was taken up into paradise. Let us also flee through the window while heeding the Lordâ€™s precepts and keeping them with steady vision and chaste eyes.
