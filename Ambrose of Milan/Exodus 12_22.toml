For he who is baptized is seen to be purified both according to the law and according to the gospel. According to the law, because Moses sprinkled the blood of the lamb with a bunch of hyssop. According to the gospel, because Christâ€™s garments were white as snow, when in the gospel he showed forth the glory of his resurrection.
