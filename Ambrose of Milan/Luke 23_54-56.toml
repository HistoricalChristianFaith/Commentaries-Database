Not everyone can bury Christ. Although the pious women stand far away because they are pious, they watch the place closely to bring ointments and anoint him. The anxious women are the last to leave the tomb and the first to return to it. Although stability is lacking, diligence is not. Women hesitate, and devotion cools. They are present at the time of the resurrection, and when the men were chased away, an angel commanded only the women not to be afraid. First in zeal, they summon Peter, but they are behind him in confidence. Then he arrives without fear, and he who had come later is the first calmly to enter16 as he who had received the keys of the kingdom, in order to open for others. The resurrection is an earthquake for the faithful, because the sluggish body awakes itself from the sleep of death. It is a cause of dread for the ignorant, because, disturbed by the trembling of the body and the movement of the earth, the ignorant depart from faith and belief in the resurrection.
