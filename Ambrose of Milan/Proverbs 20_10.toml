Every kind of unfair action is shameful. Even in common things, false weights and unjust measures are accursed. And if fraud in the market or in business is punished, can it seem free from reproach if found in the midst of the performance of the duties of virtue?

He who commands must always keep to the exact scope of the commandments, and he who distributes tasks must observe equity in looking into them, for “a false balance is an abomination to the Lord.” There is, then, an excess and a defect in weight, but the church acccepts neither, for “excessive and defective weights and diverse measures, both of them are alike abominable in the sight of the Lord.”
