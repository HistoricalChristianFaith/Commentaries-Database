What, then, is more divine than the working of the Holy Spirit, since God himself testifies that the Holy Spirit presides over his blessings? … For no blessing can be full except through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. Wherefore, too, the apostle found nothing better to wish us than this, as he himself said: “We cease not to pray and make request for you that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding walking worthily of God.” He taught that this was the will of God: that by walking in good works and words and affections, we should be filled with God’s will, who puts his Holy Spirit into our hearts. .
