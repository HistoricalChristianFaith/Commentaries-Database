He judges not, and do you judge? He says that “whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness,” that is, that if he is in darkness he may not remain that way but may amend his error, correct his fault and keep my commandments. For I have said, “I do not desire the death of the wicked, but their conversion.” I said above that he who believes on me is not judged, and I keep to this: “For I have not come to judge the world, but that the world may be saved through me.” I pardon willingly, I quickly forgive. “I will have mercy rather than sacrifice,” because by sacrifice the just is rendered more acceptable, by mercy the sinner is redeemed.
