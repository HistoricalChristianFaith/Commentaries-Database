quote='''
It is Peter, chosen by the Lord himself to feed his flock, who merits three times to hear the words “Feed my little lambs; feed my lambs; feed my sheep.” And so, by feeding well the flock of Christ with the food of faith, he effaced the sin of his former fall. For this reason he is admonished three times to feed the flock. He is asked three times whether he loves the Lord in order that he may confess him three times whom he had denied three times before his crucifixion.
