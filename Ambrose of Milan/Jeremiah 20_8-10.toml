I think, too, we cannot leave out of sight that fire when we read that the Lord Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire, as John said in his Gospel. Rightly was the sacrifice consumed, for it was for sin. But that fire was a type of the Holy Spirit, who was to come down after the Lord’s ascension and forgive the sins of all, and who like fire inflames the mind and faithful heart. For this reason, Jeremiah, after receiving the Spirit, says, “It became in my heart as a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am vile and cannot bear it.”

Indeed, Christ, loving Moses, appeared to him in fire. And Jeremiah, having in himself the gift of divine love, said: "And there was a fire inflaming in my bones: and I was dissolved on every side, and I cannot bear it." Therefore, good charity having the wings of a burning fire, which flies through the chests and hearts of the saints, and consumes whatever is material and earthly: it tests whatever is sincere, and improves whatever it touches with its fire. This fire the Lord Jesus sent upon the earth, and faith shone forth, devotion was kindled, charity was illuminated, justice shone brightly.

But even now He discloses them partly and in a figure to those whom He deems worthy, and at the same time sheds forth from the Spirit and from His own countenance floods of resplendent light, so that he who is illuminated thereby may say, "But it was as a fire blazing in my bones and I am melted on all sides, and cannot stay." And David says, "Let my sentence come forth from Thy presence!"
