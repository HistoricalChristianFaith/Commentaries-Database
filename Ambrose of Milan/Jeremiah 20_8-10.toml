I think, too, we cannot leave out of sight that fire when we read that the Lord Jesus baptizes with the Holy Spirit and with fire, as John said in his Gospel. Rightly was the sacrifice consumed, for it was for sin. But that fire was a type of the Holy Spirit, who was to come down after the Lord’s ascension and forgive the sins of all, and who like fire inflames the mind and faithful heart. For this reason, Jeremiah, after receiving the Spirit, says, “It became in my heart as a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am vile and cannot bear it.”

Indeed, Christ, loving Moses, appeared to him in fire, and Jeremiah, having in himself the gift of divine love, said, “There was a burning fire in my bones, and I have become weakened on every side, and I cannot bear it.” Love is good, then, having wings of burning fire as it flies through the breasts and hearts of the saints and consumes whatever is material and earthly but tests whatever is pure and with its fire makes better whatever it has touched. This fire the Lord Jesus sent on earth, and faith shone bright, devotion was enkindled, love was illuminated, and justice was filled with splendor.

Now, God reveals in part and in mystery to those who are worthy, and he sheds forth the Spirit and from his countenance, like a torrent, a brilliant light, so that a person who has been illumined may say, “And there was in my bones a flaming fire, and I am melted on all sides and cannot bear it.” And David says, “Let my sentence come forth from your presence.”
