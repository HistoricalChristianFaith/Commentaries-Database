Then let us flee the wickedness of this world, in which “the very days are evil,” and flee it relentlessly. On that account Isaiah cries out, “Be strong, you hands which are feeble and you knees which are without strength.” This means: Be strong, you knees, not of the body but of the soul, so that the footstep of the spirit can rise up straightway to the heights of heaven. Thus conduct will be more stable, life more mature, grace more abundant and discretion more guarded. - "Flight from the World 7.37"

Therefore the traders came from Gilead, that is, from their possessions of or dwelling in the law, and brought their wares to the church, so that that balm might heal the sins of the nations. Of them it is said, “Be strong, you hands that are feeble and you knees that are without strength.” The balm is unspoiled faith. Such a faith Peter exhibited when he said to the lame man, “In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk.” And he arose and walked, as was right. Such a faith Peter had when he said to the paralytic, “Aeneas, the Lord Jesus heals you; get up and make your bed.” And he got up and made his bed. Such a faith he had when he said to the dead woman, “Arise in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” And the departed woman arose. With the mortar made from this cement those stones are fastened together from which God is able to raise up children to Abraham. - "On Joseph 3.17"
