“Behold, the Lord is seated on a light cloud and will come to Egypt.” David also said, “Protect me under the shadow of your wings.” The shadow was emptied, therefore, for us whom the sun of iniquity had consumed. For we saw Christ in a shadow when the faith was first arising. Now that he illuminates the entire world, we nevertheless still see him through the shadow of his body, which is the church, not yet face to face, for our bodily eyes are incapable of beholding the brilliance of his divinity. And this shadow daily protects all the earth. An imprisonment, therefore, was advantageous: “God imprisoned all things in unbelief, that he might have mercy on all.”
