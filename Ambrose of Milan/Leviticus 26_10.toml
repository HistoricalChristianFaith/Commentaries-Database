There ought to be a concurrence of the old and the new, as in the case of the Old and New Testament. It is written, “Eat the oldest of the old store and, new coming on, cast away the old.” Let our food be knowledge of the patriarchs. Let our minds banquet in the prophetic books of the prophets. Such nourishment should our minds partake of, the truth of the body of Christ, and not just the external appearance of a lamb. Our eyes should not be affected by the shadow cast by the law. Rather, the clear grace of the Lord’s passion and the splendor of his resurrection should illuminate our vision.
