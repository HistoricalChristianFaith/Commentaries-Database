He and the Father are One, and the Father is his Father by possession of the same nature.… Speaking as the Son, he called God his father, and afterward, speaking as man, named him as God. Everywhere, indeed, we have witness in the Scriptures to show that Christ, in naming God as his God, does so as man. “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? And again: “From my mother’s womb you are my God.” In the former place he suffers as a man; in the latter it is a man who is brought forth from his mother’s womb. And so when he says, “From my mother’s womb you are my God,” he means that he who was always his father is his God from the moment when he was brought forth from his mother’s womb.
