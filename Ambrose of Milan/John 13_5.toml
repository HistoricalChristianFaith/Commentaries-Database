I find the Lord divesting himself of his garments and girding himself with a towel, pouring water into a basin, washing the feet of his disciples. This water was that heavenly dew with which, it was prophesied, the Lord Jesus would wash the feet of his disciples. And now let the feet of our souls be extended. The Lord Jesus wishes to wash our feet also.â€¦ There is a kind of water that we pour into the basin of our soul, water from the fleece and from the book of Judges, water from the book of Psalms. The water is the dew of the heavenly message. Therefore, Lord Jesus, let this water come into my soul, into my flesh, that by the moisture of this rain the valleys of our minds and the fields of our inmost heart may grow green. Let your drops come on me, sprinkling grace and immortality. Wash the steps of my mind that I may not sin again. Wash off the heel of my spirit62 that I may be able to abolish the curse so that I may not feel the bite of the serpent on my inner foot, but, as you yourself have ordered your followers, that I may have the power with uninjured foot to tread on the serpents and scorpions. You have redeemed the world. Redeem the soul of one sinner.
