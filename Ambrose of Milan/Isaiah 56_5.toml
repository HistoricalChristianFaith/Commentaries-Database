The Lord says this to the eunuchs: Let not the eunuch say, “I am only a dry tree,” for the Lord says to the eunuchs, “Whoever keeps my commands and chooses what I want and embraces my covenant … will receive a place that has a better name in my house and within my walls. I will give them the eternal name of sons and daughters.” He promises others that they will not be deprived. Was anyone deprived of their own mother? Mary did not go without [a family]; the mistress of virginity did not go without, just because she was not thought able to bear a man, who had already borne God.
