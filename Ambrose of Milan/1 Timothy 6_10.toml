How happy is the man who has been able to cut out the root of vices, avarice. Surely he will not dread this balance. Avarice generally dulls men’s senses and corrupts their judgments, so that they think piety a gain, and money a sort of reward for sagacity. But great is the reward of piety and the gaining of sobriety. The possession of these virtues is sufficient.

Therefore the man of good counsel says, “I have learned in whatever state I am to be content.” For he knew that the root of all evils is the love of money. Therefore he was content with what he had, without seeking for what was another’s. Sufficient for me, he says, is what I have. Whether I have little or much, to me it is much.
