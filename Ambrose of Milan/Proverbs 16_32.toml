If you are angry, be angry with yourselves, because you are roused, and you will not sin. For he who is angry with himself, because he has been so easily roused, ceases to be angry with another. But he who wishes to prove his anger is righteous only gets the more inflamed and quickly falls into sin. “Better is he,” as Solomon says, “that restrains his anger than he that takes a city,” for anger leads astray even brave men.
