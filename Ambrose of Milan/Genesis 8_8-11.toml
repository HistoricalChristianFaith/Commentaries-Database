The oil is not for the synagogue, since it does not possess the olive and did not understand the dove that brought back the olive branch after the flood. For that dove descended afterwards, when Christ was being baptized and dwelt with him, as John brought witness in the Gospel saying, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and it remained upon him.”
