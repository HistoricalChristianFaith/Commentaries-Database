When I speak of the Father, I do not make separation of the Son, because the Son is in the bosom and the solitude of the Father. When I speak of the Son alone, I also associate the Father, even as the Son also associated him, saying, “Behold the hour is coming for you to leave me alone. But I am not alone, because the Father is with me.” In this way is the Father called “the blessed and only Sovereign”—in such a way that the Son, who is always in the Father, is not separated from him.
