The Lord himself also opened his mouth and said to the apostles, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” By these words he declared that he was the one who said to Moses, “I will open your mouth and will teach you what you are to say.” Therefore this wisdom, divine, “indescribable,” “unmixed and uncorrupted,” pours its grace into the souls of the saints and reveals knowledge, so that they may look upon his glory.
