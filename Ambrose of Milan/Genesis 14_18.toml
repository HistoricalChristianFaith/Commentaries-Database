But one who is victorious should not claim the victory for himself; rather, he should attribute it to God. This is the teaching of Abraham, who became more humble, not more proud, in victory. Indeed, he offered a sacrifice and gave tithes; for this reason too, he received the blessing of Melchizedek, which means in translation “king of justice, king of peace.” He was indeed the priest of the most high God. Who is the king of justice, the priest of God, but he to whom it is said, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek,” that is, Son of God, priest of the Father, the one who through the sacrifice of his body propitiated the Father for our transgressions?
