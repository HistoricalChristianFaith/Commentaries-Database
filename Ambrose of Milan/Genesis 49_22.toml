What is the reason why the father honored his son Joseph more abundantly than all his sons? Only because he saw in him the mysteries prefiguring Christ. On this account he blessed him who was awaited rather than him who was seen and said, “My son Joseph is to be increased.” Who is to be increased but Christ, whose grace is always increased, for his glory does not have an end to its advance? Of him also John says, “He must increase, but I must decrease,” because, through that perfect and saving name of his, grace was piled up and abounded in this world—“My son is to be increased.” And so, because his brothers saw that he was growing, they began to envy him; moreover, he whom Joseph prefigured also met with envy from those whom he loved more. In fact he said, “I have not come except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” And they said, “We do not know where he is from.” He had care for them, and they denied him.

“My young son”—in truth he was young, for he was almost the last to be born. Indeed, Scripture also says, “Jacob loved him, because he was the son of his old age.” This has reference likewise to Christ. For the Son of God, rising like the dawn through his birth from the Virgin Mary, came late to a world that was growing old and on the point of perishing. As a son of old age, he took on a body according to the mystery, while before the ages he was always with his Father. For this reason the Father says to him, “Return to me,” calling forth from earth to heaven the one whom he had sent for our salvation. And so, raising up his only-begotten Son, he made vain the counsel of those who spoke evil.
