In the very beginning of this psalm we hear the voice of the Lord of salvation inviting the Gentiles into his church. He calls on them to renounce error, to follow truth, to fulfill the duties of love and adoration. The hearts of these people were infected by the Serpent’s venom, passed down from generation to generation, and their inclination was toward sin. So long as they despair of pardon, they cannot be called back. But the Lord promises a remedy, and out of the greatness and kindness of his heart he freely assures them of forgiveness.… All, without exception, are invited to grace. Without having to pay any ransom money they are redeemed from sin, and they grasp the fruit of eternal life.
