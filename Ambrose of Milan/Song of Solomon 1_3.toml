After this, you went up to the priest. Consider what followed. Was it not that of which David speaks: “Like the ointment upon the head, which went down to the beard, even Aaron’s beard”? This is the ointment of which Solomon, too, says, “Your name is ointment poured out, therefore have the maidens loved you and drawn you.” How many souls regenerated this day have loved you, Lord Jesus, and have said, “Draw us after you, we are running after the odor of your garments,” that they might drink in the odor of your resurrection.Consider now why this is done, for “the eyes of a wise man are in his head.” Therefore the ointment flows down to the beard, that is to say, to the beauty of youth; and therefore, Aaron’s beard, that we, too, may become a chosen race, priestly and precious, for we are all anointed with spiritual grace for a share in the kingdom of God and in the priesthood.
