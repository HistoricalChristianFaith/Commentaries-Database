[The father of the prodigal son] orders the shoes to be brought out, for he who is about to celebrate the Lordâ€™s Passover, about to feast on the Lamb, ought to have his feet protected against all attacks of spiritual wild beasts and the bite of the serpent.

The just man gives an added force to his vow by acting quickly. Accordingly our fathers ate the paschal lamb in haste, girding up their reins, and with shoes on their feet, and standing ready, equipped for departure. The pasch is the passage of the Lord from passion to the exercise of virtue. It is called the pasch of the Lord because the truth of the passion of the Lord was then indicated in the type of the lamb, and its benefits are now being observed.
