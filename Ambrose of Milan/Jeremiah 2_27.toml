How is a person wise who looks not for his Maker but says to a stone, “You are my father”? Who says to the devil as the Manichaean does, “You are the author of my being”? How is Arius wise, who prefers an imperfect and inferior creator to one who is a true and perfect one? How can Marcion or Eunomius be wise, who prefer to have an evil rather than a good God? And how can one be wise who does not fear his God? For “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.”
