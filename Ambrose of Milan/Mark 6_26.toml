A good disposition ought to be open and straightforward, so that one may utter words without deceit, and possess one’s soul with singleness of intent, and not delude another with false words, and not promise anything dishonorable. If he has made such a promise, it is far better for him not to fulfill it, than to fulfill what is shameful. Sometimes people bind themselves by a solemn oath, and, though they come to know that they ought not to have made the promise, fulfill it in consideration of their oath. This is what Herod did. For he made a shameful promise of reward to a dancer—and then cruelly performed it. .

When it is said that “the king was sorry,” that does not indicate genuine repentance on the part of the king, but rather a confession of his guilt. Thus, according to the design of divine governance, those who do evil condemn themselves by their own confession. But what was the motive, in this case: “Because of his oath and his guests”! What could be more vile than a murder done to not displease one’s guests?

It was shameful in the first place for a kingdom to be promised for a dance. And it was cruel, in the second place, for a prophet to be sacrificed for the sake of an oath.
