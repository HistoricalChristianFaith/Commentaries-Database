However, we who are exposed to the outbreaks of barbarians and the storms of war are tossed in the midst of a sea of many troubles and can only infer from these labors and trials more grievous trials in the future. The saying of the prophet seems to be in accord with our condition: “I saw the tents of the Ethiopians for their labors.” Having now lived fifty-three years in the body, amid the shadows of this world that obscure the reality of the future perfection, and having already endured such heavy sorrows, am I not encamping in the tents of the Ethiopians and dwelling with the inhabitants of Midian? They, owing to their knowledge of the works of darkness, fear to be judged even by mortal men. “For the spiritual man judges all things, and he himself is judged by no man.”
