Take the example of Pharaoh, a man given to vain, empty thoughts. His land of Egypt was afflicted with a plague of frogs. They gave forth a surfeit of sound, meaningless and senseless. Moses said to Pharaoh, “Set me a time when I shall pray for you and for your servants and for your people that the Lord may exterminate the frogs.” Pharaoh, who because of his plight should have besought him to offer prayer, replied, “Tomorrow,” thus showing himself indifferent to the punishment that the delay would bring, although he was still intent on saving Egypt from the plague. And so, when his prayer was finally granted, he was unmindful of gratitude. Being puffed up in heart, he forgot God. .
