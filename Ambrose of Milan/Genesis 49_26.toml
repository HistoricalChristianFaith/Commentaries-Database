From here “he grew strong over all the mountains and the desires of the everlasting hills.” For he shone forth like a heavenly light above all those men of exalted merit, patriarchs and prophets and apostles, and beyond the sun and moon and archangels as well, even as he says, “No disciple is above his teacher, nor is the servant above his master.” Who indeed among them was there to whom all things were subject? Rather, Christ gave to them their nature. In him all his saints are blessed, because he is the head of all, above the heads of all—for “the head of the woman is the man, the head of the man is Christ”—and above the crowns of the heads of all men, because he is the surpassing crown of the whole of humanity. But the highest crown belongs to the just, because he won them through grace and through a sharing of his resurrection, as it were, and calls them brothers. On this account also we understand by the brothers of Joseph those brothers, rather, of whom the psalmist says, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the assembly I will sing your praises.”
