[[commentary]]
quote='''
You owe that price with which you have been bought. Even though God does not always demand it, you still owe it. Buy Christ for yourself, not with what few men possess but with what all men possess by nature but few offer on account of fear. What Christ claims from you is his own. He gave his life for all men. He offered his death for all men. Pay on behalf of your creator what you are going to pay by law. He is not bargained for at a low price, and not all men see him readily.
