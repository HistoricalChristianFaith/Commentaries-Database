But how remarkable is the humility of the divine that the Lord of heaven did not scorn to visit the servant of a centurion! Faith shines forth in works, but humanity operates more in emotions. He certainly did not do this because he could not care for him in his absence, but to give you a form to imitate in humility, by teaching you to be submissive to those who are lower and deferential to those who are higher. Finally, in another place, he says: Go, your son lives (John 4:50); so that you may know both the power of divinity and the grace of humility. He did not want to continue there, lest he appear to have bestowed his riches more on his adopted son: he himself went ahead, lest he appear to have despised the lowly status of a centurion's servant; for we are all one in Christ, slave and free.
