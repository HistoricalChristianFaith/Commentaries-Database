A person might be rich in disputation, as are certain irreligious philosophers of this world. They can discourse on the movement of the heavenly bodies, of the stars, of Jupiter and Saturn, on the generation of humankind, on the cult of idols, on geometry and dialectics. Those philosophers are therefore rich in eloquence, but in faith they are poor, and in truth they are needy. On the other hand, very often the Lord’s priests are simple people. They are poor in eloquence but sublime in abstinence and virtue. Those philosophers utter falsehood to the multitude; these priests preach the faith to the few. Those others lose priests every day; but this poor priest adds whole peoples to the number of believers and to the church. Anyone who hears and sees the quality of their works will say, “Better is a little to the just than the great riches of the wicked.”

(Vers. 16.) It is better to be a little just, than to have many riches from the sins of the wicked. Therefore, riches are not condemned, but the riches of sinners; unless perhaps because a sinner said: All these things have been delivered to me, and I give them to whomever I wish (Luke 4:6). Furthermore, since riches inflame the torch of greed more, and each person desires greater things, they do not turn away from the paths of sin. Hence, the Savior said: Make friends for yourselves with the mammon of wickedness (Luke 16:9). For the census of wickedness is the one who is in the power of the devil, to whom he wants to give it. It can also be understood: It is better for the unjust to have little than for the wealthy sinners to have many riches; because there is one who is rich in words, like the philosophers of this world who discuss sacrilege, the movement of the stars, the star of Jupiter and Saturn, the generation of humans, the worship of idols, geometry, and dialectic. Therefore, philosophers are rich in speech, poor in faith, devoid of truth. And there are many simple priests of the Lord, poor in speech but exalted in abstinence and virtue. They speak deceit to many, while only a few affirm the faith; they lose their own priests daily, while this one gains the poor people for the Church, with a significant number of believers. Therefore, whoever hears these (priests) and sees the quality of their works, says: It is better to have little with righteousness, than great riches with many sins. Hence, Solomon derived that saying which he seemingly put forth as his own: From much talking, you will not escape sin (Proverbs 10:19). Therefore dialectic flows with an abundance of words, while piety preserves the fear of God. Thus, one should be sparing in words, rich in spirit, and more inclined to fear than to boast empty words. For fear is the discipline of wisdom: loquacity is the shipwreck of innocence and virtue, and an incentive to falling and fault.
