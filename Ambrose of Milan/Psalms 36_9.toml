Our psalm prophesies the coming into the world of the Lord and Savior, who would say, “The Father and I are one.” This means: We are one light even as we are one name; one in light, and one in name, we two are one. Truly, in substance the Trinity is one; in distinction of persons it is three. A trinity signifies distinction of persons; unity signifies power. It can be said to the Father: “With you is the fountain of life.” From him proceeded the life that was the Word, that ever was and always was the Word, so it can be said, “With you was the Word.” Through him and in him all things were made, and he himself is the life of all people. He has shown you, Father, to us. He has enlightened the hearts of people that they might know your majesty.
