It is written, they say, “The Word was made flesh.” It is written. I do not deny it. But consider what follows, for there follows: “And dwelt among us,” that is, that word that took on flesh, this Word dwelt among us, that is, dwelt in human flesh, and so he is called Emmanuel, that is, “God with us.” So this statement, “The Word was made flesh,” stands for that which took place. He became man even as he said in Joel: “I will pour out of my spirit upon all flesh,” for the future pouring out of spiritual grace is promised not for irrational flesh but for humanity.
