“Not every one who says to me Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven,” says the Scripture. Faith, therefore, august sovereign, must not be a mere matter of performance, for it is written, “The zeal of your house has devoured me.” Let us then with faithful spirit and devout mind call on Jesus our Lord, let us believe that he is God, to the end that whatever we ask of the Father, we may obtain in his name. For the Father’s will is that he be entreated through the Son, the Son’s that the Father be entreated.
