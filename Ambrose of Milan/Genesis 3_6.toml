It is temperance that cuts off desires. God commanded the first humans to hold to it, for he said, “What is in the middle of the garden, you shall not eat, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.” And because they did not preserve temperance, the transgressors of this signal virtue were made exiles from paradise, with no share in immortality. For the law teaches temperance and pours it into the hearts of all.
