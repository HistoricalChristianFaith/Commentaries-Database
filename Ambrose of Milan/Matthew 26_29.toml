De Sacr., v. 1: If Melchisedech offered bread and wine, what means this mixing of water? Hear the reason. Moses struck the rock, and the rock gave forth abundance of water, but that rock was Christ. Also one of the soldiers with his spear pierced Christâ€™s side, and out of His side flowed water and blood, the water to cleanse, the blood to redeem.
