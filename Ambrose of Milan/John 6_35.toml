[Christ] is a rich treasure, for his bread is rich. And “rich” is an apt term, for one who has eaten this bread will be unable to feel hunger. He gave it to the apostles to distribute to a believing people, and today he gives it to us. For he, as a priest, daily consecrates it with his own words. Therefore this bread has become the food of saints.
