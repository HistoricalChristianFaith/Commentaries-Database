God himself is justified through baptism, but people justify themselves by confessing their sins, as it is written, “First confess your transgressions, that you may be justified.” One is justified because the gift of God is not rejected through stubbornness but acknowledged through righteousness. “The Lord is righteous and has loved righteousness.” The justification of God is in those who see him to have bestowed his gifts not on the unworthy and the guilty but on the righteous and those made guiltless by baptism. Let us then justify the Lord that we may be justified by the Lord.
