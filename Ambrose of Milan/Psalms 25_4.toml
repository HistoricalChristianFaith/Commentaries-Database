Now the ways of the Lord are, we may say, certain courses taken in a good life, guided by Christ, who says, “I am the way, and the truth and the life.” The way, then, is the surpassing power of God, for Christ is our way, and a good way, too, is he, a way that has opened the kingdom of heaven to believers. Moreover, the ways of the Lord are straight, as it is written: “Make your ways known to me, O Lord.” Chastity is a way, faith is a way, abstinence is a way. There is, indeed, a way of virtue, and there is a way of wickedness; for it is written, “And see if there is any way of wickedness in me.”
