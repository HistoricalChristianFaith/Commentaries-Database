“It made me like the chariots of Aminadab,” which name means “the father of a people.” Now he that is a father of a people is likewise the father of Nahashon, which is “of the serpent.” Now recall who hung like a serpent upon the cross for the salvation of all men, and you will understand that the soul is at peace that has God as its protector and Christ as its captain.
