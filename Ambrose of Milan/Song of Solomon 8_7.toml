Love ought to exist in us in such a fashion that we are not called away from Christ by any dangers. For it is written, “Much water cannot shut out love, and floods will not confine it,” because the soul of the lover passes through the torrent. No storm, no profound danger, no fear of death or of punishment diminishes the strength of love; in such happenings as we are tested, in them lies the happy life, even though it is deluged by many dangers. For the wise person is not broken by bodily ills nor is he disturbed by misfortunes, but he remains happy even amid troubles. Bodily adversities do not diminish the gift of the happy life or take away anything from its sweetness. For the happiness of life does not lie in bodily pleasure, but in a conscience pure of every stain of sin, and in the mind of the one who knows that the good is also the pleasurable, even though it is harsh, and that what is shameful does not give delight, even though it is sweet. - "Jacob and the Happy Life 1.7.27"
