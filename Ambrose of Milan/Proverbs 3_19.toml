Paul declares that it was said of the Son: “You, Lord, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.” Whether therefore the Son made the heavens, as also the apostle would have it understood, while he himself certainly did not alone spread out the heavens without the Father; or as it stands in the book of Proverbs, “the Lord in wisdom has founded the earth, in understanding he has prepared the heavens,” it is proved that neither the Father made the heavens alone without the Son, nor yet the Son without the Father.
