For this reason the Father says to him, “Return to me,” calling forth from earth to heaven the one whom he had sent for our salvation. And so, raising up his only-begotten Son, he made empty the counsel of those who spoke evil—on this account Isaiah also says, “Vain is the counsel of your spirit”—and he abolished all the reproaches which they directed as if they were shooting arrows. He destroyed the power of those who were trusting in their own strength and not in God.
