The twelve thrones [are] refuges for corporeal sitting, but because Christ, according to the divine likeness, judges by discernment of hearts, not by examination of deeds, rewarding virtue and condemning wickedness. Thus also, the apostles are shaped for spiritual judgment in recompense of faith and in rebuking error by virtue and execration of unbelief, and prosecuting the blasphemers with aversion. .
