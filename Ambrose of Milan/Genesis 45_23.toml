And presents are also sent on ahead to the father. The son does honor to the father; so Christ invites his people with promises and invites them with presents. The presents are carried on asses that before were profitless and fit only for toil but now are profitable. They carry in a figurative way the presents of Christ, and in the gospel the donkeys are going to carry the giver of the presents.
