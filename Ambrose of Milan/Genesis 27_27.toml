For of him it is written, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field.” He had been made perfect in virtue’s every flower and was fragrant with the grace of the holy blessing and of the happiness of heaven. He is indeed the field that the Lord has blessed. [This field is] not the earthly field with its rugged woods and crashing torrents, its swampy, sluggish waters, unproductive grain lands, and barren vineyards, filled with sterile rock and gravel, pockmarked and arid with drought or wet with blood, and choked over with brambles and thorns, but the field of which the church speaks in the Canticle, “I have adjured you, O daughters of Jerusalem, by the powers and virtues of the field.” This is the field of which the Lord also says, “With me is the beauty of the field.” In this field the grape is found that was pressed and poured out blood and washed the world clean. In this field is the fig tree, and beneath it the saints will find rest and be renewed by a good and spiritual grace. In this field is the olive tree fruitful in the overflowing ointment of the Lord’s peace. In this field flourish the pomegranate trees7 that shelter many fruits with the one bulwark of faith and, so to speak, nurture them with the warm embrace of love.

And so Jacob was fragrant with the fragrance of such fruits; he followed God amid dangers and believed that he was safe everywhere, led by the Lord. Although the fragrance of the field is pleasant and sweet because it is a natural fragrance, still there breathed in the holy patriarch the fragrance of grace and virtue. How moderate and restrained he was! He did not claim the food that had been prepared for him but yielded without delay to his brother’s request for it and received from him the birthright of the firstborn. How respectful he was toward his parents! Through his mother’s love he earned the preference over his elder brother, and through the gift of his father’s blessing he was made holy. How respectful of God’s commands he was! He refused to do wrong to his brother. How honorable! He resisted practicing deceit upon his father. How respectful! He could not refuse his mother what she ordered.
