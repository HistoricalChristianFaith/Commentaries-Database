It may be thought strange by some that the disciples wished to prevent the little children from coming to our Lord, as it is said, when they saw it, they rebuked them. But we must understand in this either a mystery, or the effect of their love to Him. For they did it not from envy or harsh feeling towards the children, but they manifested a holy zeal in their Lord's service, that he might not be pressed by the crowds. Our own interest must be given up where an injury is threatened to God. But we may understand the mystery to be, that they desired the Jewish people to be first saved, of whom they were according to the flesh.
Lastly, our Savior expressed this when He said, Verily I say to you, Whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a little child What child were Christ's Apostles to imitate but Him of whom Esaias speaks, Unto us a Child is given? Who when Hewas reviled, reviled not again. So that there is in childhood a certain venerable antiquity, and in old age a childlike innocence.

Why does he say that children are fit for the kingdom of heaven? Perhaps it is because they do not know spitefulness, have not learned to deceive, dare not strike back, neglect to search for wealth, and do not work after honor and ambitionâ€¦. Childhood is not meant, but rather goodness rivaling childlike simplicity. It is not a virtue to be unable to sin, but to be unwilling to do so and to retain perseverance of will, so that the will imitates childhood and the person imitates nature.
