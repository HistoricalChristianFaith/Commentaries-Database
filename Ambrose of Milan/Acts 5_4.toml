You have not lied to men, but to God:
First, we understand that he called the Holy Spirit the Spirit of the Lord (vv 3;9). Then, since he mentioned first the Holy Spirit and added: “You have not lied to men but unto God,” you must necessarily either understand the oneness of the Godhead in the Holy Spirit, since when the Holy Spirit is tempted a lie is told to God; or, if you endeavour to exclude the oneness of the Godhead, you yourself according to the words of Scripture certainly believe Him to be God.
