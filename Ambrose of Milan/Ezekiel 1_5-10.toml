Now, in every sort of person, the astute Greeks have said, are to be found logisticon, thymeticon, epithymeticon, dioraticon; in Latin these are prudence, fortitude, temperance and justice. Prudence concerns the human reason. Fortitude bestows a certain power of fierce strength and contempt for death. Temperance, when it contemplates the heavenly mysteries and is retrained by consecrated chastity, cares nothing for bodily pleasures. And justice, from a certain high position of revelation, sees and searches out anything produced for others rather than itself; justice does not examine its own conveniences as much as what benefits society. It is appropriate that the soul that has acted with justice is symbolized by an eagle. It should fly away from earthly things and be totally intent on the divine mystery of the sublime resurrection. It struggles for and attains glory insofar as it is impartial.
