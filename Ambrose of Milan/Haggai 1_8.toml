Neither does he build a sepulchre for himself who dies before the time, for "he is dead while he liveth;" and he hears not the voice of Haggai, that is being interpreted, of the Feaster, for he enters not the Tabernacle of God, "in the voice of praise and thanksgiving, the sound of one feasting." For how can he hear His voice, who sees not His works? If he saw them, he would have heard the Word which has been put in His Hand, rejoicing in His acts, whereby "He knocked and it was opened to Him," and He descended into his soul that He might feed therein upon the food of sincerity and truth. Now because he has not heard, the word of Haggai comes again to hand, and says, Rise up from your "cieled houses" that are weighed down by wickedness, and "go up to the mountain" of the heavenly Scriptures, and "hew wood," the wood of wisdom, the wood of life, the wood of knowledge; and make straight your ways, direct your acts that they may keep their due order which is useful and necessary for building the house of God.
