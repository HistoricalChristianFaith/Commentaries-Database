On this account, when we run well in the way, let us beware that the serpent may not lie hid anywhere in the path and undermine the footstep of the horse—that is, of our body—and suddenly throw the sleeping rider. For if we are vigilant, we ought to be on our guard in some measure and shun the bites of the serpent. Therefore let the sleep of neglect, the sleep of the world, not overwhelm us. Let the sleep of wealth not overwhelm us, lest it be said of us also, “They have slept their sleep, and all the men of riches have found nothing.” But there are indeed riders who sleep, of whom it is written, “They have slumbered who mounted on horses.” Should avarice wound your heart, should lust inflame it, you are a sleeping rider.… Judas was sleeping; therefore he did not hear the words of Christ. Judas was sleeping, yes, sleeping the sleep of wealth, for he sought recompense from his betrayal. The devil saw that he was sleeping, yes, buried in the deep sleep of avarice. He let himself into Judas’s heart, wounded the horse and threw the rider, whom he separated from Christ.
