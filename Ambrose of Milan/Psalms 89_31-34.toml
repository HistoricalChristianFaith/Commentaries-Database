Not without reason was [the soul] given horns and hoofs, to bruise all the sheaves of the threshing floor, like the calf of Libanius, for, unless the sheaves are bruised and the straw winnowed, the corn within cannot appear and be separated. Let the soul that would advance in virtue first bruise and thresh out its superfluous passions that at the harvest it may have its fruits to show. How many weeds choke the good seed! These first must be rooted out, so that they will not destroy the fruitful crop of the soul.The careful guardian of the soul then sees how he may restrain [the soul] in its pleasures and cut off its desires, to prevent it being overwhelmed with delight in them. The correction of the father who does not spare the rod is useful, that he may render his son’s soul obedient to the precepts of salvation. He punishes with a rod, as we read: “I shall punish their offenses with a rod.” Therefore, one who with a rod strikes an Israelite’s soul on the cheek instructs that one by the Lord’s punishment in the discipline of patience. No one who is chastened and corrected need lose hope, for one who loves his son chastises him. No one should despair of a remedy.
