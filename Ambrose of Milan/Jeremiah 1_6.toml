Both Moses and Jeremiah, chosen by the Lord to declare the words of God to the people, avoided through modesty that which through grace they could do.

But perhaps you may say, How does Jeremiah call the yoke heavy, when the Lord in the Gospel has said, “For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light”? Now, first understand that the Greek has “yoke” only, and has not added “heavy.” Notice this, also, that although it was so in Lamentations, in the Gospel he said “easy yoke” and “light burden,” not “light yoke.” For the yoke of the Word can be heavy, yet easy. Heavy to the youth, heavy to the young man whose age is in fuller flower, so that he is unwilling to offer the neck of his mind in subjection to the yoke of the Word. The yoke of the Word can seem heavy because of the burdens of discipline, the rigor of improvement, the weight of abstinence and the curbing of lust. Yet it is easy because of the fruitfulness of grace, the hope of eternal reward and the sweetness of a purer conscience. Still, he called the yoke of the Word “easy” and the burden of conscience “light,” because for him who has taken up the yoke of the Word with a patient neck the burden of discipline cannot be heavy.
