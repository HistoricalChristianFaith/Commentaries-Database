“Yet to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we to him; and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we through him.” … The apostle says according to the prophecy of Isaiah, “Who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?” And he added, “For him and through him and in him are all things,” which Isaiah said of the artificer of all, as you have it. “Who has measured the water with his hand, and the heaven with his palm?” And the apostle has added, “For of him and through him and in him are all things.” What is “of him”? That the nature of all things is of his will, and he is the author of all things that come into existence. “Through him” means what? That establishment and continuance are seen to have been bestowed on all things through him. “In him” means what? That all things by a certain wonderful desire and ineffable love look on the Author of their lives and the minister of their graces and functions, according to what is written: “The eyes of all hope in you,” and “You open your hand and fill every living creature with your good pleasure.”
