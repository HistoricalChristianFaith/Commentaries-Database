The free person is the wise one who was bought with the price of heavenly speech, the gold and silver of God’s word, bought with the price of blood (not least important is it to know the buyer), bought with the price of grace, for he heard and understood the one who said, “All you who thirst, come to the waters, and you that have no money, make haste, buy and eat and drink.”
