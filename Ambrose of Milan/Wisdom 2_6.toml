All these things will be left behind. No one will take anything with him, except what he has received through the pleasure of the body. Therefore I have arrived at this conclusion, and there is none truer except the one that says that the good is what is gentle and cheerful. Therefore you must give credit to philosophy, or rather to the Wisdom of Solomon.
