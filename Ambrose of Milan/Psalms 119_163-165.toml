Frequent prayer also commends us to God. For if the prophet says, “Seven times a day have I praised you,” though he was busy with the affairs of a kingdom, what ought we to do, who read, “Watch and pray that you enter not into temptation”? Certainly our customary prayers ought to be said with giving of thanks, when we rise from sleep, when we go forth, when we prepare to receive food, after receiving it and at the hour of incense, when at last we are going to rest.
