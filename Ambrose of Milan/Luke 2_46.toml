The beginning of the Lordâ€™s disputation is taken from his twelfth year. This number of the evangelists was intended for the preaching of the faith. Nor is it idly that, forgetful of his parents according to the flesh, he who according to the flesh assuredly was filled with the wisdom and grace of God is found after three days in the temple. It is a sign that he who was believed dead for our faith would rise again after three days from his triumphal passion and appear on his heavenly throne with divine honor.
