The apostle says that Christ is the image of the Father. He says in fact that he is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creatures. He speaks of the firstborn, and not of the first created, so that we would believe that by nature he is generated, and first from all eternity. Elsewhere the apostle says, “He made him heir of all things, and through him he also made the world, the one who is the radiance of his glory and the imprint of his being.” The apostle says that he is an image, and Arius says that he is different. Why, then, speak of an image, if he were not the same? People ordinarily do not accept the image of a portrait as being different from the original, but Arius asserts that the Father is different from the Son. He maintains that the Father generated someone who is different from him, as though he were incapable of generating someone like himself. The prophets say, “In your light we see light.” They say, “He is a reflection of the eternal light, an unspotted mirror of the majesty of God and an image of his goodness.” See in how many ways they speak. “Radiance,” because the brightness of the Father’s light is in the Son. “Unspotted mirror,” since the Father is visible in the Son. “Image of his goodness,” since it is not one body seen reflected in another but the whole power of the Godhead in the Son. “Image” teaches that here is no difference. “Imprint” indicates that he is the manifestation of the Father. “Splendor” bespeaks eternity. In fact, the “image” is not the bodily face, nor is it made with colors or from wax but is simply from God. He is from the Father, pouring forth from the spring.
