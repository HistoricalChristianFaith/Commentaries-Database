Be content with what is your own and do not let your well-being be based on doing harm to your neighbor. You may find your livelihood in the simplicity of innocence. The person in possession of his own good knows nothing of waylaying others. He is not inflamed by the desires of the avaricious person, whose every gain is at the expense of virtue and a further incentive to cupidity. Therefore, should he come to know his blessings, the poor person is truly happy who lives righteously in a manner which is to be preferred to all the treasures of the world, because “better a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasures without fear.” How much under these circumstances does one need to support life? If you go beyond that little and seek that, also, which others find pleasure in possessing, that, too, has little to commend it: “It is better to be invited to herbs with love than to a fatted calf with hatred.”Let us use our talents, therefore, for the acquisition of grace and the attainment of salvation, not to circumvent others who do us no harm.
