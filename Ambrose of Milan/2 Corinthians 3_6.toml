Rightly, then, does Paul say that "the letter kills, but the spirit gives life." The letter circumcised a small part of the body, but the understanding spirit keeps the circumcision of the entire soul and body so that chastity might be preserved, frugality loved and the unnecessary parts cut off (for nothing is so unnecessary as the vices of greed, the sins of lust, which did not belong to nature but which sin has caused). Bodily circumcision is the symbol, but the reality is the spiritual circumcision; the one cuts off a member, the other sin.

Moreover, what wonder is it if the Spirit works life, who gives life as the Father does, who gives life as the Son does? Moreover, who would deny that to give life is of the eternal Majesty?… Therefore, let us see whether the Spirit is enlivened, or himself enlivens. But it is written: "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life." So the Spirit gives life. But that you may understand that the quickening of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is not divided, learn that there is also a oneness of quickening, since God himself quickens through the Spirit; for Paul said: "He that raised up Jesus Christ from the dead shall quicken also your mortal bodies, because of his Spirit dwelling in you."
