Let no one think that this was said only recently and that it was spoken of by the philosophers before it was mentioned in the gospel. For the philosophers, that is to say, Aristotle and Theophrastus, as also Zeno and Hieronymus, certainly lived before the time of the gospel, but they came after the prophets. Let them rather think how long before even the names of the philosophers were heard of, both of these [Aristotle and Theophrastus] seem to have found open expression through the mouth of the holy David; for it is written, “Blessed is the man whom you instruct, O Lord, and teach him out of your law.” We find elsewhere also, “Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, he will rejoice greatly in his commandments.” We have proved our point as regards knowledge, the reward for which the prophet states to be the fruit of eternity, adding that in the house of the one who fears the Lord or is instructed in his law and rejoices greatly in the divine commandments “is glory and riches; and his justice abides for ever and ever.” He has further also in the same psalm made statements about good works, that they gain for an upright man the gift of eternal life. He speaks thus: “Blessed is the man who shows pity and lends; he will guide his affairs with discretion, surely he shall not be moved for ever, the righteous shall be in everlasting remembrance.” And further, “He has dispersed, he has given to the poor, his justice endures forever.”
