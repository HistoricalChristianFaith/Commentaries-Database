Very many deny that the Sacred writers wrote according to the rules of art. Nor do we contend for the contrary; for they wrote not according to art, but according to grace, which is above all art; for they wrote that which the Spirit gave them to speak. And yet they who wrote on art made use of their writings from which to frame their art, and to compose its comments and rules.

Again, in art there are principally required, a cause, a subject, and an end. When then we read that holy Isaac said to his father, "Behold the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for a burnt offering," which of these is wanting? For he who asks, doubts, he who answers the query pronounces and solves the doubt. "Behold the fire," that is the cause, "and the wood," that is hulē, which in Latin is 'materia,' what third thing remains but the end, which the son asked for, saying, "Where is the lamb for a burnt-offering," and the father replied, "My son, God will provide Himself a lamb for a burnt offering?"

Let us discuss for a little while the mystery. God shewed a ram hanging by his horns. Now the ram is the Word, full of tranquillity, moderation, and patience; whereby is shewn that Wisdom is a good sacrifice, and that He was well skilled in the mode of meritorious propitiation. Wherefore the Prophet also says, "Offer the sacrifice of righteousness." And so it is a sacrifice both of righteousness and of wisdom.
