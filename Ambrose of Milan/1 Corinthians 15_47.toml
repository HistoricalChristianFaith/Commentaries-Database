[[commentary]]
quote='''
It is not the spiritual that comes first but the physical, and then the spiritual.â€¦ The last one is like the sum of the whole. It is he alone who, like the cause of the world for which all things were made, dwells in all the elements. The second man from heaven, the resurrected, heavenly man, lives amid beasts, swims with fish, flies above the birds, talks with angels, dwells on earth, does battle in heaven, ploughs the sea, feeds in the air, is a tiller of the soil, a traveler on the deep, a fisher in streams, a fowler in the air, an heir in heaven, a joint heir with Christ.
