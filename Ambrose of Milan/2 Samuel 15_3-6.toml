Moreover, due measure befits even our words and instructions, that it may not seem as though there was either too great mildness or too much harshness. Many prefer to be too mild, so as to appear to be good. But it is certain that nothing feigned or false can bear the form of true virtue; no, it cannot even last. At first it flourishes; then, as time goes on, like a flower it fades and passes away, but what is true and sincere has a deep root.…Absalom was king David’s son, known for his beauty, of splendid appearance and in the heyday of youth; so that no other man like him was found in Israel. He was without a blemish from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. He had his own chariot and horses and fifty men to run before him. He rose at early dawn and stood before the gate in the way, and whoever he knew to be seeking the judgment of the king, he called to himself, saying … “Is there no one given to you by the king to hear you? Who will make me a judge? And whosoever will come to me, that has need of judgment, I will give him justice.” With such words he cajoled them. And when they came to make obeisance to him, stretching forth his hand he took hold of them and kissed them. So he turned the hearts of all to himself. For flattery of this sort quickly finds its way to touch the very depths of the heart.
