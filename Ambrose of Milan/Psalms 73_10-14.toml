Therefore those who were in sin said, “How has God known? And is there all knowledge in the most High?” Indeed, they suppose that knowledge is not in God, because sinners abound in worldly prosperity. And the Scripture still represents such individuals as saying, “Behold, these are sinners, and abounding in the world they have obtained riches.” You find this more clearly portrayed in the Gospel where Simon the Pharisee, seeing that the sinful woman had come into his house and had poured ointment over Christ’s feet, said to himself, “This man, were he a prophet, would surely know who and what manner of woman this is who is touching him, for she is a sinner.” But God’s patience is not prejudicial to truth, while his foreknowledge and providence are proved even more by this very fact, that one who is in sin abounds in worldly prosperity and success. Seeing this, one who is stronger laughs, but one who is incautious is moved and led astray.
