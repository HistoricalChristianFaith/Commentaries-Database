One could judge that merit and virtue could be evident even in captivity. For Jeremiah was not less happy in captivity, nor was Daniel or Esdras, nor were Anania and Azaria and Misael less happy than if they had not fallen into captivity. They entered into captivity in such a way that they brought to their people both present consolations in captivity and the hope of escaping from it. - "Jacob and the Happy Life 8.36"
