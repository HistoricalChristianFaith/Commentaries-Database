I will take the fool’s line and propound some examples drawn from the things of a lower world. “I am become a fool; you have compelled me.” What indeed is more foolish than to debate over the majesty of God, which rather occasions questionings, than receiving godly instruction which is by faith. But to arguments let arguments reply. Let words make answer to them. Rather we will answer with love, the love which is in God, issuing of a pure heart and good conscience and faith unfeigned.
