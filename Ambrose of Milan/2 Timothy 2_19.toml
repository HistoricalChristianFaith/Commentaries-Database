And if there is some disturbance here, lift up the footstep of your spirit to the things which are to be, and you will discover that the wicked whom you believed to be here will not be there. For one who is nothing is not. Indeed, “the Lord knows those who are his.” He does not recognize those who are not, because they have not recognized him who is.
