Who would dare deny the immortality of the Son, simply because he has given immortality also to others? Indeed, it is written of the wisdom of God, “Through her I will obtain immortality.” But the immortality of his nature is one thing and the immortality of ours another. Perishable things must not be compared with divine things: the being of the divinity is one alone and cannot die. Thus the apostle, though knowing that the soul and the angels are immortal, preached that God alone is immortal. In fact, even the soul dies: “The soul that sins will die.” And neither is an angel immortal by nature, because his immortality is dependent on the will of the Creator.
