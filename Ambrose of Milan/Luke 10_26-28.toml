With these verses belongs the text that exposes those who seem to themselves to be experts on the law, who keep the letter of the law but disregard its spirit. He teaches that they are ignorant of the law from its very first chapter. He proves this immediately at the beginning of the law. Both the Father and the Son proclaimed and announced the sacrament of the divine incarnation, saying, “You shall love the Lord your God” and “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” The Lord said to the lawyer, “Do this, and you shall live.” He who did not know his neighbor, because he did not believe in Christ, answered, “Who is my neighbor?” Whoever does not know Christ does not know the law either. How can he know the law when he is ignorant of the Truth, since the law proclaims the Truth?
