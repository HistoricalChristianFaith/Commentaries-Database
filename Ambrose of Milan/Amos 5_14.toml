And so, where the good God is, there are the good things that David desired to see and believed that he would see, even as he says, "I believe I shall see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.(Ps. 27:13)"' They indeed are the good things that endure always, that cannot be destroyed by change of time or of age.
