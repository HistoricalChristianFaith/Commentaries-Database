However, a title is written and placed above the cross, not beneath the cross; for the beginning is on his shoulders. And what is the beginning, if not his eternal power and divinity? Therefore, when he was asked who he was, he replied: The beginning, who also speak to you. Let us read this title: Jesus, he says, the Nazarene, king of the Jews. The title is rightly placed above the cross; because the kingdom that Christ has is not of a human body, but of divine power. The title is rightly placed above the cross; for although the Lord Jesus was on the cross, he shone with the majesty of a king above the cross.
