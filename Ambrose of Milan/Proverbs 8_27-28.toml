Learn also that the Father was with him, and he with the Father, when all things were being made. Wisdom says, “When he was preparing the heavens I was with him, when he was making the fountains of waters.” And in the Old Testament the Father … showed that the Son was to be worshiped with himself as the maker of all things. As, then, those things are said to have been created in the Son, of which the Son is received as the Creator, so too when God is said to be worshiped in truth by the proper meaning of the word itself often expressed after the same manner it ought to be understood, that the Son too is worshiped. So in like manner is the Spirit also worshiped because God is worshiped in Spirit. Therefore the Father is worshiped both with the Son and with the Spirit, because the Trinity is worshiped.
