And how did Abraham’s progeny spread? Only through the inheritance he transmitted in virtue of faith. On this basis the faithful are assimilated to heaven, made comparable to the angels, equal to the stars. This is why he said, “So will your descendants be. And Abraham,” the text says, “believed in God.” What exactly did he believe? Prefiguratively he believed that Christ through the incarnation would become his heir. In order that you may know that this was what he believed, the Lord says, “Abraham saw my day and rejoiced.” For this reason “he reckoned it to him as righteousness,” because he did not seek the rational explanation but believed with great promptness of spirit.
