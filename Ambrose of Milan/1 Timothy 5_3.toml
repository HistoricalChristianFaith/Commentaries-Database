So, then, a widow is not only marked off by bodily abstinence but is distinguished by virtue. It is not I who give this command but the apostle. I am not the only person to do them honor, but the teacher of the Gentiles did so first, when he said, “Honor widows that are widows indeed. But if any widow has children or nephews, let her first learn to govern her own house and to take care of her parents.” Thus we encourage every inclination of affection in a widow to love her children and to do her duty to her parents. So when discharging her duty to her parents she is teaching her children and is rewarded herself by her own compliance with duty, in that what she performs for others benefits herself.
