The Holy Spirit also came down “and filled the whole house, where very many were sitting, and there appeared parted tongues as of fire.” Good are the wings of love, the true wings that flew about through the mouths of the apostles, and the wings of fire that spoke the pure word. On these wings Enoch flew when he was snatched up to heaven.

Enoch called upon God in hope and so is thought to have been transported. And so only that man who puts his hope in God seems to be “man.” Moreover, the clear and truthful sense of the passage is that one who puts his hope in God does not dwell on earth but is transported, so to speak, and cleaves to God.
