This does not pertain to the fullness nor to a portion of the Spirit, because neither does the human mind grasp Godâ€™s fullness, nor is God divided into any portions of himself. But he pours out the gift of the grace of the Spirit in which God is adored, as he is also adored in truth, for no one adores him except he who draws in the truth of his godhead with pious affection.
