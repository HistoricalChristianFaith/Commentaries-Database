Simeon had prophesied, a woman united in marriage had prophesied, a virgin had prophesied, it was meet also that a widow should prophesy, that there might lack no sex or condition of life, and therefore it is said, And there was one Anna a prophetess.

Now Anna, both from the duties of her widowhood and her manner of life, is found to be such that she is thought worthy to announce the Redeemer of the world. As it follows, She was of a great age, and had lived with her husband, &c.

Therefore Simeon prophetized, the Virgin had prophesied, the one united in marriage had prophesied, and so too should the widow; so that neither the profession nor the sex may be lacking. And for this reason Anna is introduced with both the wages of widowhood and the character of such; so that she may be truly believed to have been worthy to announce the redeemer of all. Since we have described her merits elsewhere, when we exhorted widows, in this place as we hasten to other matters, we do not think it necessary to repeat. However, she spent eighty-four years of widowhood not idly; because both seven decades and two forties seem to represent a sacred number.
