Christ fills his world with copious lights, since “his going out is from the end of heaven, and his circuit even to the end of it, and there is no one who can hide himself from his heat.” Benignly he gives light to all, wishing not to repel the foolish but to correct them and desiring not to exclude the hard of heart from the church but to soften them. Hence … Christ in the Gospel invites them, saying, “Come to me, all you who labor, and are burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart.”
