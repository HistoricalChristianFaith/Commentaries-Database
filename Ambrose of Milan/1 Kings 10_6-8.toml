We entrust our case to the most prudent person we can find and ask advice from him more readily than we do from others. However, the faithful counsel of a just person stands first and often has more weight than the great abilities of the wisest of people: “For better are the wounds of a friend than the kisses of others.” And just because it is the judgment of a just person, it is also the conclusion of a wise one: in the one lies the result of the matter in dispute, in the other readiness of invention. And if one connects the two, there will be great soundness in the advice given, which is regarded by all with admiration for the wisdom shown and with love for its justice. And so all will desire to hear the wisdom of that person in whom those two virtues are found together, as all the kings of the earth desired to see the face of Solomon and to hear his wisdom. No, even the queen of Sheba came to him and tried him with questions. She came and spoke of all the things that were in her heart and heard all the wisdom of Solomon, nor did any word escape her. Who she was whom nothing escaped, and that there was nothing which the truth-loving Solomon did not tell her, learn, O man, from this which you hear her saying, “It was a true report that I heard in my own land of your words and of your prudence, yet I did not believe those that told it me until I came and my eyes had seen it; and behold, the half was not told me. You have added good things over and above all that I heard in my own land. Blessed are your women and blessed your servants, who stand before you and hear all your prudence.” Recognize the feast of the true Solomon and those who are set down at that feast; recognize it wisely and think in what land all the nations shall hear the fame of true wisdom and justice and with what eyes they shall see him, beholding those things that are not seen. “For the things that are seen are temporal, but the things that are not seen are eternal.”What women are blessed but those of whom it is said “that many hear the word of God and bring forth fruit”? And again: “Whosoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother.” And who are those blessed servants, who stand before him, but Paul, who said, “Even to this day I stand witnessing both to great and small”; or Simeon, who was waiting in the temple to see the consolation of Israel? How could he have asked to be allowed to depart, except that in standing before the Lord he had not the power of departing, but only according the will of God? Solomon is put before us simply for the sake of example, of whom it was eagerly expected that his wisdom should be heard.
