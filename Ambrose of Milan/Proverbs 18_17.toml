The just person takes note of his own weakness.… The wise person recognizes it; the foolish one does not. Indeed, the wise person is moved to repentance by his own faults, while the foolish one takes pleasure in his. “The just man is the accuser of himself,” while the unjust one is his own apologist. The just person wishes to anticipate his accuser in the admission of his sin, while the unjust one desires to conceal his. The one rushes on in the beginning of his speech to reveal his wrongdoing, the other attempts to lay the accusation to rest by the garrulousness of his speech, so as not to reveal his wrongdoing.

Let us who are free from sin, purchased, as it were, by the price of Christ’s blood, let us not be subject to the slavery of people or of passion. Let us not be ashamed to confess our sin. See how free is the one who could say, “I have not been afraid of a very great multitude, so that I would not confess my sin in the sight of all.” One who confesses to the Lord is freed from his slavery: “The just is the accuser of himself in the beginning of his speech.” He is not only free but just, for justice is in liberty, and liberty in confession, and as soon as one has confessed he is pardoned.

Are not those who condemn their sin truer Christians than those who think to defend it? “The just accuses himself in the beginning of his words.” He who accuses himself when he sins is just, not he who praises himself.
