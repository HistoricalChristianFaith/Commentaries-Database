But let us come to the turtle-dove, which the law of God has chosen as the offering of a chaste victim. Finally, when the Lord was circumcised, it was offered; for it is written in the law of the Lord that they should offer a pair of turtle-doves or two young pigeons. For this is truly the sacrifice of Christ, chastity of the body, and grace of the spirit. Chastity is referred to the turtle-dove, grace to the pigeon.
