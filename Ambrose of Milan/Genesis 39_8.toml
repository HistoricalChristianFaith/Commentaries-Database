But why should I enlarge on arrangements that pertained to a private house in the case of that slave who ruled an empire? It counts for still more that Joseph earlier ruled himself; although he was good-looking and very handsome in appearance, he did not direct the charm of his countenance toward another’s wrongdoing but kept it to win grace for himself. He thought that he would be even more attractive if he were proved more handsome not by the loss of his chastity but by the cultivation of modesty. That is the true beauty that does not seduce the eyes of others or wound their fragile hearts but gains the approval of all. It will do harm to none but win praise for itself. Now if any woman gazes with wanton eyes, the sin is attributable only to her who cast the wicked glance, not to him who did not wish to be looked upon with wicked intent, and there is no guilt in the fact that he was looked upon. It was not within the power of a mere servant not to be looked upon. The husband should have been on his guard against the roving eyes of his wife. If the husband had no fear in regard to his spouse, Joseph thought it to be evidence of her chastity, not the permissiveness of neglect. Still, let men also learn to guard against the roving eyes of women; even those men who do not wish to be loved are very much loved. Indeed, Joseph was very much loved, although he rejected the lover. And Scripture did well to absolve him, for it said, “The wife of his master cast eyes on Joseph”;8 that is, he did not show himself or take her unawares, but she cast her nets and was captured in her encircling of him. She spread her snares and stuck fast in her own bonds.
