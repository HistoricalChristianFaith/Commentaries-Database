We have seen now the prog-ress of the noble mind, which, finding itself in perilous deviation from the path of virtue, immediately arose to search for the reward of wisdom, the inheritance of justice. The readings that follow will show how harmful are the vices connected with frivolity. For those four kings who defeated the five kings and took captive the whole cavalry of the Sodomites captured Lot the son of Abraham’s brother as well and went on their way. The five kings are our five bodily senses: sight, smell, taste, touch and hearing. The four kings are the seductions of the body and of the world, because human flesh and the world are composed of four elements. Rightly are they called kings, because sin has a sovereignty of its own, has its own great kingdom. For this reason, the apostle says, “Let not sin reign in your mortal body.” Our senses, then, easily yield to the pleasures of the body and of the world and become as it were subject to their dominion. Indeed, the pleasures of the body and the seductions of the world are conquered only by a mind that is spiritual, that clings to God and separates itself totally from earthly things—for every perversion is subjection to these allurements. Hence John says, “Woe to the inhabitants of the world!” He was certainly not referring to every human being living on earth at that time—for there are those who live on earth but whose citizenship is in heaven—but rather to those who had been overcome by attachment to this earthly citizenship and the seduction of the world. We are not then inhabitants of this world but pilgrims. Pilgrims live in hope of finding a temporary lodging, but inhabitants seem to place every hope and every use of their goods where they believe they are living by right. Thus one who is a pilgrim on earth is an inhabitant of heaven, but the inhabitant of earth is an owner of death.
