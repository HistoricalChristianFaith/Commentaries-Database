Either faith is the light, as it is written, Thy word, O Lord, is a lantern to my feet. (Ps. 119:105.) For the word of God is our faith. But a lantern cannot shine except it has received its quality from something else. Hence also the powers of our mind and senses are enlightened, that the piece of money which had been lost may be found. Let no one then place faith under the law, for the law is bound by certain limits, grace is unlimited; the law obscures, grace makes clear.

The Word of God is our faith. The Word of God is the light, and faith is the lamp. “That was the true Light, that enlightens everyone that comes into this world.” The lamp cannot shine unless it has received light from elsewhere. The lamp that is lit is the virtue and perception of our mind, so that the woman can find the coin that she lost. No one finds faith beneath the law, for the law is within a bushel basket. Grace is outside. The law overshadows, but faith illumines. No one conceals his faith within the bushel basket of the law but brings it to the church in which shines the sevenfold grace of the Spirit. … The church standing on the highest mountain of all, that is, on Christ, cannot be hidden in the darkness and ruins of this world. Shining with the splendor of the eternal Sun, it enlightens us with the light of spiritual grace.
