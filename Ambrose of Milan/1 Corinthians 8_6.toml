When he says “through him,” did he deny that all things were made in him, through whom he says that all things are? These words, “in him” and “with him,” have this force, that by these is understood one and the same reality, not something contrary.… Scripture bears witness that these three phrases—“with him,” and “through him,” and “in him”—are one in Christ.

It is written: “Go baptize the nations in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” “In the name,” he said, not “in the names.” So there is not one name for the Father, another name for the Son, and another name for the Holy Spirit, because there is one God, not several names, because there are not two gods, not three gods.
