What then does he mean by “Adam, where art thou?” Does he not mean “in what circumstance” are you; not, “in what place?” It is therefore not a question but a reproof. From what condition of goodness, beatitude and grace, he means to say, have you fallen into this state of misery? You have forsaken eternal life. You have entombed yourself in the ways of sin and death.
