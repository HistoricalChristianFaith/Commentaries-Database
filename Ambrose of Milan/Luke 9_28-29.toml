You may know that Peter, James and John did not taste death and were worthy to see the glory of the resurrection. It says “about eight days after these words, he took those three alone and led them onto the mountain.” Why is it that he says “eight days after these words”? He that hears the words of Christ and believes will see the glory of Christ at the time of the resurrection. The resurrection happened on the eighth day, and most of the psalms were written “For the eighth.” It shows us that he said that he who because of the Word of God shall lose his own soul will save it, since he renews his promises at the resurrection. But Matthew and Mark say that they were taken after six days. We may say this means after six thousand years, because a thousand years in God’s sight are as one day. We counted more than six thousand years. We prefer to understand six days as a symbol, because God created the works of the world in six days, so that we understand works through the time and the world through the works.

Only three, three chosen, were led to the mountain.… This perhaps means none can see the glory of the resurrection except he who has preserved the mystery of the Trinity intact with the undefiled purity of faith. Peter, who received the keys of the kingdom, John, to whom his mother was entrusted, and James, who was the first to mount a bishop’s throne, ascended.
