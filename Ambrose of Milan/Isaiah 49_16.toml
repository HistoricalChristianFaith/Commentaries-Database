Let us flee these evils and elevate our soul to the image and likeness of God. The flight from evils is the likeness of God, and the image of God is gained through the virtues. And so, like a painter, he has painted us with the colors of the virtues. “See, I have painted your walls, Jerusalem.” Let us not wipe away with the brush of neglect the props of the painted walls of our soul.
