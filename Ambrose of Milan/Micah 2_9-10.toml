Let him who cannot fly like an eagle fly like a sparrow. Let him who cannot fly to heaven fly to the mountains. Let him flee before the valleys that are quickly destroyed by water. Let him pass over the mountains. Abraham’s nephew passed over the mountain of Segor and was saved. But Lot’s wife could not climb it, for she looked back in womanly fashion and lost her salvation. “Draw near the everlasting mountains,” the Lord says through the prophet Micah, “arise from here, for this is not a rest for you by reason of uncleanness. You have been corrupted with corruption, you have suffered pursuit.”And the Lord says, “Then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.” Mount Zion is there, and so is the city of peace, Jerusalem, built not of earthly stones but of living stones, with ten thousand angels and the church of the firstborn and the spirits of those made perfect and the God of the just, who spoke better with his blood than Abel. For the one cried out for vengeance but the other for pardon. The one was a reproach to his brother’s sin; the other forgave the world’s sin. The one was the revelation of a crime; the other covered a crime according to what is written, “Blessed are they whose sins are covered.”
