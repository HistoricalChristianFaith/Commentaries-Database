Look therefore on that Hebrew as he says to the chief of the eunuchs, who had incurred the displeasure of the king but had been restored to his post, “Remember me by your own case, when it shall be well with you, and you will do me a kindness and remember me.” He made his request a second time for this reason, because he knew that the other would not remember what harm he had escaped, when he had regained power. And so Joseph reminded him a second time, because he freed him a second time. Thus, if the recollection of the earlier kindness did not have a hold on him, at least the remembrance of the later one would present itself, and that man would not scorn the author of his deliverance or do violence to him out of treacherous deceit. But what is worse, forgetfulness of the kindness swiftly stole in during time of prosperity. The butler, once restored to his post, did not remember the interpreter of his dream but forgot about him. But even though he forgot, Christ did not forget but spoke to the butler, yes, spoke to him through a mere servant and said, “Remember me by your own case,” that is, “Remember what you have heard in regard to your office. But even though you have forgotten now, you will remember me to get out of a danger, while you forgot a kindness.” Nevertheless when he was raised up in power, he did not remember. Yet how important was this power, the charge of the wine? See the basis of all his boasting—that he was chief of the eunuchs who supplied the wine for the cups of the king!
