If the soul, with its capacity for pleasure and delight, has tasted this true and highest good and has adhered to both with the means at its disposal, putting away sorrow and fear, then it is wonderfully inflamed. Having embraced the Word of God, it knows no bounds, it knows no satiety, and says, “You are sweet, O Lord, and in your joy teach me your laws.” Having embraced the Word of God, the soul desires him above every beauty; it loves him above every joy; it is delighted with him above every perfume; it wishes often to see, often to gaze, often to be drawn to him that it may follow. “Your name,” it says, “is as oil poured out, and that is why we maidens love you and vie with one another but cannot attain to you. Draw us that we may run after you, that from the odor of ointments we may receive the power to follow you.

Sin abounded by the law because through the law came knowledge of sin, and it became harmful for me to know what through my weakness I could not avoid. It is good to know beforehand what one is to avoid, but, if I cannot avoid something, it is harmful to have known about it. Thus was the law changed to its opposite, yet it became useful to me by the very increase of sin, for I was humbled. And David therefore says, “It is good for me that I have been humbled.” By humbling myself I have broken the bonds of that ancient transgression by which Adam and Eve had bound the whole line of their succession. Hence, too, the Lord came as an obedient man to loose the knot of human disobedience and deception. And as through disobedience sin entered, so through obedience sin was remitted. Therefore, the apostle says, “For just as by the disobedience of one man the many were constituted sinners, so also by the obedience of the one the many will be constituted just.”
