Now then, the butler was reminded of his own dream through the dream of the king and said, “I remember my sin.” That confession was late indeed, but would it were true. After committing sin, you confess what you should have avoided before you committed sin. How swiftly you had forgotten, “Remember me.” Of course you know that this word was spoken at that time, but you had ears blunted by the arrogance of power, and being drunk with wine, you did not hear the words of sobriety. Even now, “remember me,” you that confess your sin late. You that inquire of the mere servant, why do you deny the Master? Now be drunk, not with wine but with the Holy Spirit. Remember what the baker suffered, with whom you slept your sleep and dreamed your dream. He too was a chief, and chief over the royal banquets, which were part of the work of the bakers. He believed that he was exalted because he had in his power the king’s bread; he did not know that such power took many turns. He threatened others, although he was shortly to be given over to the extreme penalty himself, and he did not listen to Joseph, who spoke prophecy even though he was only a humble servant of the Lord. The prophecy was that he was going to lose his head at the command of that king in whose regard he flattered himself so very much, and he was to be left as food for the birds. At least this example should restrain you from giving credence to unbelief.
