For it is clear that the soul does not die with the body, because it is not of the body. And that it is not of the body Scripture teaches us in many ways. For Adam received the breath of life from the Lord God “and became a living soul,” and David says, “Turn, O my soul, into your rest, for the Lord has been good to me.” And learn the nature of God’s goodness: “For he has freed my feet from falling.” You see that David rejoices in the remedy of such a death, because an end has been put to error, because guilt has perished but not nature. And so he says, as if liberated and free, “I shall please the Lord in the land of the living.” For that22 is the land.… Further, he says that the land of the living is that resting place of souls, where sins do not enter in and where the glory of the virtues lives. Now that land is filled with the dead, because it is filled with sinners, and it was rightly said, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead.” But likewise he also said above, “His soul shall dwell in good things, and his seed shall inherit the land”; that is, the soul of one who fears God will dwell in good things, so that it is always in them and in conformity with them. The passage can also be taken to refer to one who is in the body, so that he too, if he fears God, dwells in good things and is in heavenly things, for he possesses his body and enjoys mastery over it as if it had been reduced to slavery, and he possesses the inheritance of glory and of the heavenly promises.

Theodosius, now at peace, rejoices that he has been snatched away from the cares of this world, and he lifts up his soul and directs it to that great and eternal rest. He declares that he has been admirably cared for, “since God has snatched his soul from death,” the death that he frequently withstood in the treacherous conditions of this world, when he was disturbed by the waves of sin. And God has snatched his eyes from tears, for sorrow and sadness and mourning shall flee away. And elsewhere we have, “He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and death shall be no more; neither shall there be mourning or crying or pain.” If, then, death will be no more, he cannot suffer a fall when he is in that rest, “but he will please God in the land of the living.” For while humankind is here enveloped in a mortal body subject to falls and transgressions, that will not be so there. Therefore, that is the land of the living where the soul is, for the soul has been made to the image and likeness of God; it is not flesh fashioned from earth. Hence, flesh returns to earth, but the soul hastens to celestial rest, and to it is said, “Turn, my soul, to your rest.”
