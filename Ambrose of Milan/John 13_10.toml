In baptism all fault is washed away. So fault withdraws. But since Adam was overthrown by the devil and venom was poured out on his feet, this is why you wash the feet, so that in this part in which the serpent lay in wait, the greater aid of sanctification can be added so that he cannot conquer you later. Therefore, you wash the feet so that you can wash away the poisons of the serpent. It also benefits humility because then we are not ashamed of what we disdain in obedience in the Mystery.
