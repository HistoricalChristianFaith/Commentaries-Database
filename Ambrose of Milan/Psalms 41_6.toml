Judas went out, and he spoke. He went out from the faith, he went out from the council and number of the apostles. He went out from Christâ€™s banquet to the villainy of Satan; he went out from the grace that sanctifies to the noose that strangles. He went to speak vain things to infidels. He went outside, leaving behind the mysteries of life that lay within. He went out, for he had never known the mysteries that are contained in Scripture.
