Then, the disciples being troubled, thought they saw a spirit. To show us the appearance of the resurrection, the Lord said, “Touch, and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones, as you see me to have.” He actually penetrated the closed and inaccessible room through the likeness of a bodily resurrection and not through a spiritual nature. They touch and handle a body, so we rise in the body. It is sown a natural body, but it rises a spiritual body. The one is fine; the other is crude, since it is still hard with the nature of earthly stains. Did not the Lord offer them to touch a body that retained the signs of the wounds and the marks of the scars? He not only strengthens faith but also kindles devotion, because he set his wounds accepted for our sake and refused to remove them, to show God the Father the costs of our freedom. The Father seats such a One at his right hand, embracing the trophies of our salvation. –.

Persuaded by so many examples of virtue, we believe that Peter could not have doubted. It is also clear that John believed when he saw the Savior. He had already believed when he saw the tomb empty of its body. Why then does Luke say that they were troubled? First, the saying of a majority includes the opinion of the few. Second, although Peter had believed the resurrection, he could be troubled when he saw that the Lord appeared unexpectedly in his body in a room where the doors were bolted and the walls solid. Luke pursued details historically. One contemplated the end, and the other the course of events. By saying, “Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the Scriptures,” he also declares that the disciples believed.

Therefore I think itmost natural that our Lord indeed instructed His disciples, that they should see Him in Galilee, but that He first presents Himself as they remained still in the assembly through fear.
But afterwards when their hearts were strengthened, the eleven set out for Galilee. Or there is no difficulty in supposing that they should be reported to have been fewer in the assembly, and a larger number on the mountain.
But persuaded by the example of their virtues, we can not believe that Peter and John could have doubted. Why then does Luke relate them to have been affrighted. First of all because the declaration of the greater part includes the opinion of the few. Secondly, because although Peter believed in the resurrection, yet he might be amazed when the doors being closed Jesus suddenly presents Himself with his body.
Let us then consider how it happens that the Apostles according to John believed and rejoiced, according to Luke are reproved as unbelieving. John indeed seems tome, as being an Apostle, to have treated of greater and higher things; Luke of those which relate and are close akin to human. The one follows an historic course, the other is content with an abridgment, because it could not be doubted of him, who gives his testimony concerning those things at which he was himself present. And therefore we deem both true. For although at first Luke says that they did not believe, yet he explains that they afterwards did believe.
Our Lord said this in order to afford us an image of our resurrection. For that which is handled is the body. But in our bodies we shall rise again. But the former is more subtle, the latter more carnal, as being still mixed up with the qualities of earthly corruption. Not then by His incorporeal nature, but by the quality of His bodily resurrection, Christ passed through the shut doors.
