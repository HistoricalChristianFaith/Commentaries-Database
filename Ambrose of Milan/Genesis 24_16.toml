And so Isaac is good and true, for he is full of grace and a fountain of joy. To that fountain came Rebekah to fill her water jar. For Scripture says that “going down to the fountain she filled her water jar and came up.” And so the church or the soul went down to the fountain of wisdom to fill its own vessel and draw up the teachings of pure wisdom, which the Jews did not wish to draw from the flowing fountain. Listen to him as he says who that fountain is. “They have abandoned me, the fountain of living water.” The soul of the prophets ran thirsting to this fountain, even as David says, “My soul has thirsted after the living God,” that he might fill his thirst with the richness of the knowledge of God and might wash away the blood of foolishness with watering of spiritual streams.
