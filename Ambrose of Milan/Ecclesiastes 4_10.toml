Fittingly does Ecclesiastes say, “For if one falls, he raises up his companion.” He himself is not raised up, for Christ was not raised up by another’s help and power, but he himself raised himself. Indeed, he said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. This he said of the temple of his body.” It is well that he who did not fall should not be raised by another, for one who is raised by another has fallen, and one who falls needs help to be raised up. Additional words also teach this when Scripture says, “Woe to him that is alone: for when he falls, he has none to lift him up. And if two lie together, they shall warm one another.” We have died with Christ, and we live together with him. Christ died with us to warm us, and he said, “I have come to cast fire upon the earth.” Letter , To His Clergy.
