This, then, is what the patriarch Isaac says, “You shall serve your brother. But the time will be when you shall shake off and loose his yoke from your neck.” He means that there will be two peoples, one the son of the slave girl, the other of the free woman6—for the letter is a slave, whereas grace is free. The people that is attentive to the letter is going to be a slave as long as it needs to follow the expounder of learning in the spirit. Then that will also come to pass what the apostle says, “that the remnant may be saved by reason of the election made by grace.” “You shall serve your brother,” but then you will perceive your advancement in servitude only when you begin to obey your brother voluntarily and not under compulsion.
