He has given [judgment to the Son], that is to say, not out of largess but in the act of generation. See, then, how unwilling God was that you should dishonor his Sonâ€”even to the point that he gave him to be your judge.

But if there is fear that the judge may be too harsh, think about who your judge is. For the Father has given every judgment to Christ. Can Christ then condemn you when he redeemed you from death and offered himself on your behalf? Can he condemn you when he knows that your life is what was gained by his death?
