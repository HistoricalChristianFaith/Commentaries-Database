But of what creature can it be said that it fills all things, as it is written of the Holy Spirit: “I will pour my Spirit upon all flesh”? This cannot be said of an angel. Lastly, Gabriel himself, when sent to Mary, said, “Hail, full of grace,” plainly declaring the grace of the Spirit which was in her, because the Holy Spirit had come upon her, and she was about to have her womb full of grace with the heavenly Word.

But that the Spirit is the arbiter of the divine counsel, you may know even from this. For when we showed that the Holy Spirit was the Lord of baptism and read that baptism is the counsel of God, as you read, “But the Pharisees despised the counsel of God, not being baptized of him,” it is quite clear that as there can be no baptism without the Spirit, so too the counsel of God is not without the Spirit. And that we may know more completely that the Spirit is power, we ought to know that he was promised when the Lord said, “I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh.” He, then, who was promised to us is himself power, as in the Gospel the same Father of God declared when he said, “And I will send the promise of the Father upon you, but do you remain in the city until you are endued with power from on high.”
