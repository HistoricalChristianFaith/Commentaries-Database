[[commentary]]
quote='''
Jesus stood as a helpmate; he stood as if anxious to help Stephen, his athlete, in the struggle. He stood as though ready to crown his martyr. Let him then stand for you that you may not fear him sitting, for he sits when he judges.â€¦ He sits to judge, he stands to give judgment, and he judges the imperfect but gives judgment among the gods.
