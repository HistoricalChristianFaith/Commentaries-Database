And why should i speak of all one by one? Samson, born by the divine promise, had the Spirit accompanying him, for we read: "The Lord blessed him, and the Spirit of the Lord began to be with him in the camp." And so foreshadowing the future mystery, he demanded a wife of the aliens, which, as it is written, his father and mother knew not of, because it was from the Lord. And rightly was he esteemed stronger than others, because the Spirit of the Lord guided him, under Whose guidance he alone put to flight the people of the aliens, and at another time inaccessible to the bite of the lion, he, unconquerable in his strength, tore him asunder with his hands. Would that he had been as careful to preserve grace, as strong to overcome the beast!

Above, you read that “the Lord blessed him, and the Spirit of the Lord began to go with him.” Farther on it is said, “And the Spirit of the Lord came upon him.” Again he says, “If I be shaven, my strength will depart from me.” After he was shaven, see what the Scripture says: “The Lord,” it says, “departed from him.”4You see, then, that he who went with him, himself departed from him. The same is, then, the Lord, who is the Spirit of the Lord, as also the apostle says: “The Lord is the Spirit, now where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.”
