As for the person who wishes to be lifted up by the hand of Christ, let him first fly away himself, let him have his own wings, for one who flees from the world has wings. And if he does not have wings of his own—and perhaps only the individual who is able to fly has them—if then he does not have his own, let him get them from the one who has them. Thus a person who flees from the world does fly. “Behold, I have gone far off flying away, and I remained in the wilderness.” Thus, David flew away like the night raven in the dwelling, like the lone sparrow in the house. Now if you apply this to Christ, he flew away in the passion of his body, so that he could protect the peoples of the nations under the shadow of his wings. He flew away from the Godhead; he remained in the body and dwelled in the desert, so that the children of the deserted wife might be more than those of her who had a husband. Therefore let us seek after Christ’s body that we also may rise again; for where the body is, there also will the eagles be.
