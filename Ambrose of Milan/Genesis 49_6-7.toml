Likewise, when he said to Simeon and Levi, “I will divide you in Jacob and scatter you in Israel,” he revealed that they were to be redeemed in the gathering together of the nations. For when the shepherd has been struck down, the flock that was previously brought together is scattered; thus one who did not belong could enter in and all Israel could be saved. And we ought in particular to assume this as regards the tribe of Levi, for it appears that the Lord Jesus traced his origin from that tribe, as concerns his taking on of the body. Of that tribe are the priests Levi and Nathan, and, in the Gospel which he wrote, St. Luke counted them among the ancestors of the Lord. For the Priest of the Father and Chief of all priests, even as it is written, “You are a priest forever,” should have laid claim to succession from a priestly line. On this account also Moses blessed this tribe and said, “Give to Levi the lot of his own approbation, and to the holy man his truth.”
