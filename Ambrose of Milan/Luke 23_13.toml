What kind of people crucified the Lord of glory! Those that violently demand the death of an innocent man fittingly seek the release of a murderer. Wickedness has such laws as to hate innocence and love guilt. The interpretation of the name gives the likeness of the image, because Barabbas means “son of the father.” He belongs to those to whom it is said, “You are of your father the devil.” They were about to choose the Antichrist as son of their father, rather than the Son of God. –.

They send Christ to Herod and then to Pilate. Although neither pronounces him guilty, both gratify the desires of strange cruelty. Pilate washes his hands but does not wash away his actions. A judge should not yield to either envy or fear and then sacrifice the blood of the innocent. Pilate’s wife warned him. Grace shone in the flight. The Godhead was revealed, yet he still did not abstain from a sacrilegious verdict.
