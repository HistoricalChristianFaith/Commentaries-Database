“For your lifeblood and your souls I will require a reckoning of every beast and of the hand of man.” He compared human iniquity to beastly wickedness and considered it to be even more culpable than the wildness of the beasts. For he added, “of every man’s brother I will require the life of man.” Actually beasts have nothing in common with us, are not united to us by any fraternal bond. If they harm a man, they harm somebody who is stranger, do not transgress the rights of nature, do not obliterate the affection of brotherhood. Therefore one who makes an attempt on his brother’s life commits a more serious sin. For this reason the Lord threatened a more severe punishment by saying “of the hand of his brother I will require a reckoning of the blood of man.” Is not perhaps a brother someone of a rational nature come forth from a certain womb, so that we are united by a generation from the same mother? One single nature is mother of all humanity. Therefore we are all brothers generated by one and the same mother and united by the same kinship.
