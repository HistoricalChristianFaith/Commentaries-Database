It is not strange if the rocks would respond against their nature with praises of the Lord since murderers, harder than rocks, also proclaim them. Perhaps this means when the Jews are speechless after the Lordâ€™s passion, the living stones, according to Peter, will cry out. Even with mixed emotions, the crowd nevertheless leads God to his temple with praise.

The multitude then acknowledging God, proclaims Him King, repeats the prophecy, and declares that the expected Son of David according to the flesh had come, saying, Blessed be the King that comes in the name of the Lord.
Nor is it wonderful that the stones against their nature should chant forth the praises of the Lord, whom His murderers, harder than the rocks, proclaim aloud, that is, the multitude, in a little while about to crucify their God, denying Him in their hearts, whole with their mouths they confess. Or perhaps it is said; because, when the Jews were struck silent after the Lord's Passion, the living stones, as Peter calls them, were about to cry out.
Rightly we read that the crowds praising God met Him at the descent of the mountain, that they might signify that the works of the heavenly mystery had come to them from heaven.
