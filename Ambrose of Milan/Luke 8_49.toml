Jesus took the girl’s hand, healed her, and ordered that she should be given something to eat. This is evidence of life, so that not an apparition but the truth may be believed. Blessed is he whose hand Wisdom holds. I wish that righteousness held my acts and my hands. I want the Word of God to hold me, bring me into his closet, turn away the spirit of error, replace it with that of salvation, and order that I be given something to eat! The Word of God is the Bread of heaven. The Wisdom that filled the holy altar with the nourishment of the divine body and blood says, “Come, eat of my bread, and drink wine that I have mixed for you.” What is the reason for such diversity? Above, Christ raised the son of the widow in public. Here, he dismissed several eyewitnesses. I think that the Lord’s compassion is also revealed since the widowed mother of an only son did not suffer delay. He is prompt; for fear that she would be further afflicted. It is also wise that the church would immediately believe through the widow’s son, but the Jews, albeit a few, would believe through the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue. –.

What shall I say about the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, at whose death the people were mourning and the flute players were playing their music? In the belief that she was indeed dead, solemn funeral services were being performed. The spirit returned immediately at the voice of the Lord, she arose with revived body, and she partook of food to furnish proof that she was alive.
