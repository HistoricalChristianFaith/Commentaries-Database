[The righteous person] does not say, “My portion consists of herds of oxen, donkeys or sheep,” except, perhaps, he counts himself among those herds which know their owner and wishes to consort with that donkey which does not shun the crib of Christ … [For this person] that sheep is his portion which was led to the slaughter and the “Lamb which was dumb before his shearer and did not open his mouth.” In [Christ’s] humiliation, judgment has been exalted. - "Letter 59 (14.93)"

What is more evident than that it is said of the passion of the Lord: “The ox knows his owner and the donkey his master’s crib.” Let us, then, know the Lord’s crib where we are nourished, fed and refreshed. - "Letter 36 (13.6)"
