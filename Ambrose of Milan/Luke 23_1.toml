Our Lord is accused and is silent, for He needs no defense. Let them cast about for defensewho fear to be conquered. He does not then confirm the accusation by His silence, but He despises it by not refuting it. Why then should He fear who does not court safety? The Safety of all men forfeits His own, that He may gain that of all.
