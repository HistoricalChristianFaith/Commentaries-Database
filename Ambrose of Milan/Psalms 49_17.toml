quote='''
Do not be troubled when you hear that the glory of someone’s house has increased. Think deeply about it, and you will see that a house is empty if it is not filled with faith.… Adam, by his ruin, left us void and empty, but Christ’s grace has filled the void. Christ emptied himself so that the fullness of virtue might live in human flesh.
