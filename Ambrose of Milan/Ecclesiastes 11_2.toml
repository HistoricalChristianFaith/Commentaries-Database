The Old Testament took note of this number eight, called by us in Latin an octave, for Ecclesiastes says, “Give a portion to those seven, and also to those eight.” The seven of the Old Testament is the eight of the New, since Christ arose and the day of the new salvation has shed light upon all. It is the day of which the prophet says, “This is the day which the Lord has made; let us be glad and rejoice in it.”

The seventh day symbolizes the mystery of the law, the eighth that of the resurrection, as you have in Ecclesiastes.
