Why do you dishonor yourself by surrendering to the allurements of the body, a slave to the whims of appetite? Why do you deprive yourself of the intelligence with which the Creator has endowed you? Why do you put yourself on the level of the beasts? To dissociate yourself from these was the will of God, when he said, “Do not become like the horse and the mule, which have no understanding.”

Fools are not free.… Many blows are necessary that their wickedness be controlled. Training, not harshness, exacts this. Besides, “he who spares the rod hates his son,” since each one is punished more heavily for his sins. The weight of sin is heavy, the stripes for crimes are heavy; they weigh like a heavy burden; they leave scars on the soul and make the wounds of the mind fester.
