And when he had finished giving these instructions, he teaches his disciples to follow the example of their teachers. For immediately the servant of a Gentile centurion is offered to the Lord to be healed, in whom the people of the nations, who were held captive by the bonds of earthly servitude and tormented by deadly passions, are expressed to be healed by the grace of the Lord. But what he said about the servant dying did not deceive the Evangelist; for he would indeed have died if he had not been healed by Christ. Therefore, he fulfilled the commandment with heavenly love, who loved his enemies in this way: that he might rescue them from death and bring them into the hope of eternal salvation.
