Like an athlete he comes last into the arena. He lifts his eyes to heaven.… He sees that his whole task awaits him.… He chastises his body so that it will not defeat him in the contest. He anoints it with the oil of mercy. He practices daily exhibitions of virtue. He smears himself with dust. He runs with assurance to the goal of the course. He aims his blows, he darts his arms, but not at empty spaces.… Earth is man’s training ground, heaven his crown.

Like a good athlete, Paul knew how to parry the blows of the opposing powers and even to strike them as they advanced to the attack.
