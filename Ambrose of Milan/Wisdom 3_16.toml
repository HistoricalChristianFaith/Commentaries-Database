Hence it is written: The children of adulterers will come to a complete end (Wisdom 3:16). Therefore, whoever does not follow the Father who is in heaven, but instead follows the earthly corruption, enters into the lineage of an earthly father. For as earthly, so are the earthly ones; so that his earthly life is without rest after death. He will not see eternal light forever; because he sought after worldly things. However, he who has followed Christ's glory, who has desired that light which enlightens every person coming into this world, will find and see eternal light; because Christ has redeemed him from death.
