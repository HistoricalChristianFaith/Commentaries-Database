For this reason it is written, “The children of adulterers will not reach maturity.” Therefore, one who follows not the Father in heaven but the one who lives in earthly squalor becomes part of the progeny of the earthly father. “As is the earthly person, so are those who are of the earth.” His life is earthly, and he will not have rest after death. He will not see the light for eternity, because he sought what is temporary. The one, rather, who follows the glory of Christ, who desires that “light that enlightens every person who comes into this world,” will find and will see the eternal light, because Christ redeemed him from death.
