For this reason David says, as if visited by him,” “You have held my right hand, and in your will you have conducted me and have taken me up with glory.” This is the text we have received, and it is in accord with the Greek, for the Greek said, ekratēsas tēs cheiros, that is, “you have held the hand,” tēs dexias mou, “my right hand.” A person receives good guidance when God takes hold of his right hand with his own hand. Such a one can say, “The Lord is at my right hand, that I be not moved.” Had Adam chosen to have the Lord at his right hand, he would not have been deceived by the serpent. But because he forgot God’s command and fulfilled the will of the serpent, the devil took hold of his hand and made it to reach out to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, to pluck things that were forbidden. In him, judgment was passed beforehand on all people, and the adversary began to stand by the right hand of every person. From this, there also came that model of the curse against Judas, “And may the devil stand at his right hand.” If that curse is severe, that blessing, whereby the bonds of the harsh curse are undone, is very momentous. For that reason the Lord Jesus, who had taken up humanity’s cause and condition, set the devil at his right hand, just as we read in the book of Zechariah. And so, where the inheritance of Adam stood, there Christ stood. Like a good athlete, he permitted Satan to stand at his right hand so that he could drive him back, and he said, “Be gone, Satan.” Consequently, the adversary was cast down from his place and departed; so that the devil may not stand at your right hand, Christ says, “Come, follow me.” Therefore, David foresaw the coming of the Lord, who came down from heaven to free us from the power of the adversary, and he said, “The Lord is at my right hand, that I be not moved.” But one who had the devil at his right hand was moved. David was justified, then, in saying this also, “You have held my right hand,” that is, so that now I cannot sin, so that I can take my stand in a trusty place, while before I was swaying and my step was unsure. How aptly the apostle said this! For the Lord, seeing that he was troubled, stretched out his right hand and did not allow him to falter but steadied him to walk without fear. And on his deliverance, what else did Peter say but these prophetic lines, “You have held my right hand, and in your will you have conducted me and have taken me up with glory”? What is the right hand but the power of the soul in operation? And if it is guided by the will of the Lord, it desires nothing and is in want of nothing; it demands none of the helps or aids of this world.

Therefore the holy man says, “For what awaits me in heaven? And besides you what do I desire on earth?” This means: You are my portion, you are abundant to me for all things, I have sought nothing but that I might possess you as my share, I have not made myself subject to any creature in the heavens, as the Gentiles do, and I have desired none of the wealth and enticing pleasures of this world. I have no want, for I have been taken up by you, and there is nothing further for me to seek in the heavenly bodies. Possessing nothing, I possess all things, because I possess Christ, and him the Father on high “has not spared, but he has delivered him for us all; how has he not, then, given us all things with him?” even as the apostle said. For all things are in Christ, through whom are all things and in whom all things hold together. Therefore, possessing all things in him, I seek no other reward, because he is the reward of all. And so, Christ said to him that was made perfect, “Take up your cross and follow me.” For one who follows him is not led to perfection by the reward, but by perfection he is made perfect for the reward. For the imitators of Christ are not good by reason of hope but for their love of virtue; for Christ is good by nature, not by reason of a desire for a reward. And, therefore, he suffered because it pleased him to do good, and not because he sought an increase of glory from his passion. Thus one who desires to imitate him does not do what is for his own advantage but what is for the advantage of others. It is not without reason, therefore, that he fails for himself, while for others he grows strong by the increase of virtue.

And the psalmist says, appropriately, “My heart and my flesh have failed, God of my heart.” Indeed, abiding things cannot follow unless earthly things have failed. Therefore the flesh falls when fleshly things are put to death. And those who bear about in their flesh the dying of Jesus Christ also fail, for the death of Christ works in them32 so that every enticement to sin dies. From this it is inferred that the human heart fails when evil thoughts, which proceed from the heart, are put to death. Thus forgetfulness may hide all earthly things, and, for those who are blessed with a clean heart and deserve to see God, there may come the God of their heart that they may draw near to you and not separate themselves. For God, who is near, does not drive back those who draw near to him;34 he wishes to be for all people a cause of salvation and not of death. Indeed, he rejects no one except one who has decided to remove himself from his sight.
