Therefore, as upon the cross it was not the fullness of the Godhead but our weakness that was brought into subjection, so also will the Son hereafter become subject to the Father in his participation in our nature. This is so that when the lusts of the flesh are brought into subjection the heart may have no concern for riches or ambition or pleasures. The intention is that God may be all to us, if we live after his image and likeness, as far as we can attain to it, through all. The benefit has passed, then, from the individual to the community; for in his flesh he has tamed the nature of all human flesh…. Therefore, “laying aside all these,” that is those things we read of: “anger, malice, blasphemy, filthy communication”; as he also says below: “Let us, having put off the old man with his deeds, put on the new man, which is renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him.” -.
