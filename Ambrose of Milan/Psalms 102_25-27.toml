Heaven is of the world, humanity above the world; the one is part of the world, the other an inhabitant of paradise, Christ’s possession. Heaven is considered incorruptible, yet it passes away; humanity is regarded as corruptible and is clothed with incorruption; the figure of the one perishes, the other rises as being immortal. Yet, according to the authority of Scripture, the hands of the Lord fashioned both. We read of the heavens: “The heavens are the works of your hands.” Humankind, too, says, “Your hands have made me and formed me,” and “The heavens declare the glory of God.” As heaven is lighted with the splendor of the stars, so do humans shine with the light of their good works, and their deeds shine before their Father in heaven. The one is the firmament of heaven on high, the other is a similar firmament of which it is said, “On this rock I will build my church”;20 the one is a firmament of the elements, the other of virtues, and this last is more excellent. They sucked oil out of the hard stone, for the rock is Christ’s body that redeemed heaven and the entire world.

But this opinion could not withstand the words of the prophet, which the divine majesty of our Lord Jesus Christ, our God, has confirmed in the Gospel. For David has said, “In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They shall perish, but you remain, and all of them shall grow old as a garment. And as a robe you shall change them, and they shall be changed. But you are always the same, and your years shall not fail.” To such a degree did the Lord confirm this that he said, “Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away.”

“When he has gone to sleep, he will not rise again even until the heaven is unstitched.” This appears to mean, until heaven is made new. “For there will be a new heaven and a new earth,” just as it is written. For what is stitched up is old, and what is old will be changed. Then listen as the psalmist says, “In the beginning, O Lord, you founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands. They shall perish, but you remain; and all of them shall grow old like a garment, and you shall change them like a garment, and they shall be changed.” We are able also to weave on the garment, because what is old is stitched on, whereas what is new suffers violence. “From the days of John the Baptist the kingdom of heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force.” The synagogue stitched on it in the case of a few; the church forces it in the case of thousands. Or else the meaning is that heaven now appears to be stitched on, being often interwoven with clouds and mist and the darkness of night and the golden redness of the rising day, a various and multicolored sight. Then “night shall be no more, and they shall have no need of light of lamp and light of sun, because the Lord will shed light on them,” even as John said. Or else, “Woe to those who sew pillows to overthrow the souls of the people.” The prophet was lamenting the wretched frailty of our condition, that has no rest in this life and loses everything by death’s sudden onset. For the Holy Spirit revealed to him that man would not arise for so long a time, until he should come who would not stitch the old to the new nor join new material to old material46 but would make all things new, even as he said, “Behold, I make all things new!” For he is the resurrection, the firstborn from the dead, in whom we have all indeed received the prerogative of a future resurrection; yet till now he alone has risen in a perpetual resurrection.
