quote='''
The strong hand strikes as though harshly, but it is swift to heal. If it is powerful to wound, it is also powerful when it comes to applying a remedy. As the Lord says, “I will strike, and I will heal.” … This hand of the Lord took from Job all that he had and gave it all back again. In fact, he greatly added to Job’s store of good things, even doubling what he had before. Do not be troubled because David says he has fainted. A person can faint and rise up stronger than before. “The Lord lifts up all that fall and sets up all that are cast down.” Whoever is corrected will rise up with virtue.
