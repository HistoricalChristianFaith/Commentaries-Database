There is a peace that does not have a stumbling block and a peace that does. The one that does not have a stumbling block is from love; the one which does, from pretense. So also the prophet says, “Peace, peace; and where is peace?” Let us therefore run away from the peace of sinners, for they conspire against the guiltless person, they come together to oppress him who is just, they destroy the widow or overcome her modesty.
