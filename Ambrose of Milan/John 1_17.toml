I pardon willingly, [says the Lord,] I quickly forgive: “I will have mercy rather than sacrifice,” because by sacrifice the just is rendered more acceptable, by mercy the sinner is redeemed. “I come not to call the righteous but sinners.” Sacrifice was under the law; in the gospel is mercy. “The law was given by Moses, grace by me.”
