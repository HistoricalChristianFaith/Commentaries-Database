It is not strange that one who puts to death the deeds of the flesh will live, since one who has the Spirit of God becomes a son of God. It is for this reason that he is a son of God, so that he may receive not the spirit of slavery but the spirit of the adoption of sons, inasmuch as the Holy Spirit bears witness with our spirit that we are sons of God.
