And thus, through a sequence of questions and answers, even if ten just are found in the city, [God] promises not to punish the entire populace thanks to the rectitude of a few. From this we should understand what a powerful bulwark a just person can be for the country and how we should not be jealous of saintly persons or criticize them with temerity. In fact their faith saves us; their rectitude preserves us from destruction. Even Sodom, if it had had ten just men, would have been able to save itself.
