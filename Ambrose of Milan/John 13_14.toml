I also, then, wish to wash the feet of my brothers and sisters. I wish to fulfill the mandate of the Lord. I do not wish to be ashamed of myself or to disdain what he himself did first. The mystery of humility is good because, while I wash the filth of others, I wash away my own. But not all were able to drink in this mystery. Indeed, Abraham also wished to wash feet, but out of a feeling of hospitality. Gideon, too, wished to wash the feet of the angel of the Lord who appeared to him. But he wished to do this as one who was offering obedience, not as one who was offering fellowship. This is a great mystery that no one understands.
