Just as there is one God, “so too there is only one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.” He is unique. He alone redeems humankind. He goes far beyond brotherly love, for he sheds his own blood for strangers. None other could offer him for his brother. To redeem us from sin, he did not spare his own body “but gave himself as redemption for all.” … Why, you might ask, is Christ the only one who redeems? I reply that no one has love equal to his; no one but he can lay down his life for his little servants; no one can equal him in innocence and integrity. For we are all under sin; in Adam’s fall we all had fallen. No one could be chosen as our redeemer except the One who was in no way subject to the ancient sin. It follows that by “the man” we must understand the Lord Jesus. He took on himself the human condition, to crucify in his own flesh our sin and so blot out in his blood the handwriting of the charge that had been made against our whole race.
