On this account also it is said to the soul, “Your youth shall be renewed like the eagle’s.” For the psalmist spoke to the soul and said, “Bless the Lord, O my soul.” And therefore the soul hastens to the Word and asks that she be drawn to him, so that she may not, perhaps, be left behind, for “the Word of God runs and is not bound.”
