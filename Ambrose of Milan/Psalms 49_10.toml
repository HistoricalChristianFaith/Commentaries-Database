A fool has no discernment, and his thoughts are stupid. The unwise person can think, but what he thinks is bad: “The unwise person has said that there is no God.” He is culpably wicked because he knows what goodness is. Yet, though he knows it, he commits iniquity in the evil of his own heart. He is also dishonest. Again, not because he does not know what honesty is but because he is so twisted that he would wish to destroy honesty.
