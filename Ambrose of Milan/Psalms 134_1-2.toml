People sit when they disparage, but they stand when they bless the Lord, to whom it is said, “Behold, now bless you the Lord, all you servants of the Lord, who stand in the house of the Lord.” One who sits (to speak of the bodily habit) is, as it were, unnerved, when the body is idle and when he relaxes the tension of his mind. But a cautious watchman, an active searcher, a wide-awake guard before the camp, stands. The soldier on duty, who wishes to anticipate the enemy’s designs, stands in the battle line before he is expected.
