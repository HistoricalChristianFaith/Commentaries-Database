What is this bed which he is commanded to take up, as he is told to rise? It is the same bed which was washed by David every night, the bed of pain on which our soul lay sick with the cruel torment of conscience. But if anyone has acted according to Christâ€™s teaching, it is already not a bed of pain but of repose. Indeed, through the compassion of the Lord, who turns for us the sleep of death into the grace of delight, that which was death begins to be repose. Not only is he ordered to take up his bed, but also to go home to his house, that is, to return to Paradise. That is our true home which first fostered man, lost not lawfully, but by deceit. Therefore, rightfully is the home restored, since he who would abolish the obligation of deceit and reform the law has come.
