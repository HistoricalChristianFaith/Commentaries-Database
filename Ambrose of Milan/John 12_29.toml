How does God speak? Is it with the voice of the body? Not at all. He utters oracular words with a voice that is far more significant than is the voice of the body. The prophets heard this voice. It is heard by the faithful, but the wicked do not comprehend it. And so, we find the Evangelist in the Gospel listening to the voice of the Father speaking: “I have glorified it and will glorify it again.” But the Jews did not listen, which is why they said, “It has thundered.” … Here is an occasion when he was heard speaking, whereas to some people he did not speak.
