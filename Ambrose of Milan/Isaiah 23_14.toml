“Howl,” he says—he repeats it—“O you ships of Carthage, for your strength is laid waste. And it shall come to pass in that day, Tyre shall be abandoned;” and below, “but after seventy years, Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot.” Behold what words the prophet employs, and how he does not avoid the baseness of words of this kind. We ourselves sometimes avoid them, not because our tongue is more chaste than theirs, but our authority inferior. For very great is the force of words in the vivid exposition of such things, so that they who do not blush at their sins blush at least at the names of their sins. “Tyre shall be,” he says, “as the song of a harlot.” Beware, lest, when someone sees those dances being performed, and unseemly words being sung, he says, “Behold, Tyre has become the song of a harlot.”
