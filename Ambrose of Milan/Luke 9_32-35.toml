Peter saw this grace, and so did those who were with him, although they were heavy with sleep. The incomprehensible magnificence of the Godhead overwhelms the perceptions of our body. If the sharpness of bodily vision cannot bear the ray of the sun directly into watching eyes, how may the corruption of human members endure the glory of God? The garment of the body, purer and finer after the removal of the materiality of vices, is made for the resurrection. Perhaps they were so heavy with sleep that they saw the radiance of the resurrection after their rest. Keeping vigil, they saw his majesty, because no one sees the glory of Christ unless he is vigilant.

It says, “It is good for us to be here.” “My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.” The diligent workman is not content to praise. Even more admirable, not only in affection but also in pious deeds, he promises a ministry of common worship for the building of three tabernacles. Although he did not know what he said, he promised an observance that does not heap up the fruits of piety in indiscreet carelessness but in untimely zeal. His ignorance came from his condition, but his promise from his devotion. The human condition is corruptible in this. This mortal body is not capable of making a tabernacle for God.

“While he spoke, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them.” That is the overshadowing of the divine Spirit, who is not dark with the emotions of humankind but unveils secrets. This is also revealed in another place when an angel says, “And the power of the Most High shall overshadow you.” The effect of this is shown when the voice of God is heard, saying, “This is my beloved Son; hear him.” Elijah is not the Son, and Moses is not the Son. This is the Son whom only you see, because they had withdrawn when he began to be described as Lord.… It was a luminous cloud that does not soak us with rainwater or the downpour of storm, but from dew that sprinkles the minds of men with faith sent by the voice of almighty God.
