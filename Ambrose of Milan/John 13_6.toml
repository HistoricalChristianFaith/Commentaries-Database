[Peter] did not notice the mystery, and so he refused the ministry because he believed that the humility of the servant was being overtaxed if he patiently permitted the ministry of the Lord.

You came up from the font. What followed? You heard the reading. The girded priest—for, although the presbyters also do this, the highest priest, girded, I say, washed your feet. … We are not unaware of the fact that the church in Rome does not have this custom whose character and form we4 follow in all things, except for the fact that it does not have this custom of washing the feet. So note: perhaps on account of the multitude this practice declined. Yet there are some who say and try to allege in excuse that this is not to be done in the mystery, or in baptism or in regeneration, but the feet are to be washed as for a guest. But one belongs to humility, the other to sanctification. Finally, be aware that the mystery is also sanctification: “Unless I wash you, you have no share with me.” So I say this, not that I may rebuke others but that I may commend my own ceremonies. In all things I desire to follow the church in Rome, yet we, too, have human feeling. What is preserved more rightly elsewhere we, too, preserve more rightly.
