The mystery of Christ is so great that even angels stood amazed and bewildered before it. This is why, then, it is your duty to worship him and, as a servant, this is why you should not detract from your Lord. You cannot plead ignorance because establishing your faith is why he came down in the first place. If you do not believe, he has not come down for you or suffered for you. “If I had not come,” says the Scripture, “and spoken to them, they would not have sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me hates my Father also.” Who, then, hates Christ, if not the one who speaks to his dishonor? For just as it is love’s part to render honor, so it is hate’s part to withdraw honor. The one who hates calls into question Christ’s honor; the one who loves, pays reverence.
