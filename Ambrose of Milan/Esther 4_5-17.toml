Why did Queen Esther expose herself to death and not fear the wrath of a fierce king? Was it not to save her people from death, an act both seemly and virtuous? The king of Persia himself also, though fierce and proud, yet thought it seemly to show honor to the man who had given information about a plot that had been laid against himself, to save a free people from slavery, to snatch them from death and not to spare him who had pressed on such unseemly plans. So finally he handed over to the gallows the man who stood second to himself and whom he counted chief among all his friends, because he considered that he had dishonored him with his false counsels. For that commendable friendship that maintains virtue is to be preferred most certainly to wealth, or honors or power. It is not accustomed to be preferred to virtue indeed, but to follow after it. So it was with Jonathan, who for his affection’s sake avoided not his father’s displeasure or the danger to his own safety. So, too, it was with Ahimelech, who, to preserve the duties of hospitality, though he must endure death rather than betray his friends when fleeing.
