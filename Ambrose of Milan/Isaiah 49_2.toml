“In my quiver he hid me away,” Scripture declares. The quiver, then, is your faith. Fill it with the frangrant aroma of your virtues, that is, of chastity, compassion and justice, and immerse yourself wholly in the inmost mysteries of faith, which are fragrant with the sweet odors of your significant deeds. - "Six Days of Creation 5.23.80"
