The moon toils for you and by reason of the will of God is made subject.… It is you who undergo changes of your own volition, not the moon. The moon groans and travails in pain in its changes. You without understanding often find joy in this. The moon frequently awaits your release from sin, so that it may be released from the servitude in which all creation shares. But you place obstacles in the way of your release from sin and to the moon’s freedom. The fact that you yourself still await that conversion which fails to come, whereas the moon suffers change, is the result not of the moon’s folly but of yours.
