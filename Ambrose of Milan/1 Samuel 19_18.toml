Therefore let us not be ashamed to flee, for this flight is a glorious one, to flee from the face of sin.… Thus did David, too, flee from the face of King Saul, and from the face of Absalom. Indeed, in his flight he brought about an increase of holiness, for he spared a treacherous assailant and sought after a parricide. - "Flight from the World 4.19"

Moreover the perfect soul turns away from matter, shuns and rejects everything that is excessive or inconstant or wicked, and neither sees nor approaches this earthly defilement and corruption. It is attentive to things divine but shuns earthly matter. But its flight is not to depart from the earth but to remain on earth, to hold to justice and temperance, to renounce the vices in material goods, not their use. Holy David fled from the face of Saul, not indeed to depart from the earth but to turn away from the contagion of a cruel, disobedient and treacherous man. He fled, cleaving to God, just as he himself said, “My soul has stuck fast to you.” - "Isaac, or the Soul 3.6"
