The possession of God is owed to such as these, as Isaiah says: “This is the inheritance of those who believe in the Lord.” Very aptly does he say, “This is the inheritance,” for that alone is the inheritance; there is no other. The inheritance is not a treasure that people stumble on blindly, and passing things have not the quality of an inheritance. The only inheritance is that in which God is the portion, as the Lord’s holy one says: “God is my inheritance,” and again: “I have become an heir of your precepts.” You see what are the possessions of the just person: God’s commandments, his words, his precepts. In these he is rich; on these he feeds; with these he is delighted as if by all riches.
