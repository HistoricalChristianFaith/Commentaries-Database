Again, this is said that you may know that the Father is, and the Son is, and that the work of the Father and the Son is one. Note the saying of the apostle, “Now may God himself, and our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way to you.” Both Father and Son are named, but there is unity of direction, because there is unity of power. So also in another place we read, “Now may our Lord himself, Jesus Christ, and God and our Father, who has loved us, and given us eternal consolation, and good hope in grace, console and strengthen your hearts.” How perfect a unity it is that the apostle presents to us, insomuch that the fountain of consolation is one fountain, not many. Let doubt be silenced, then, or if it will not be overcome by reason, let the thought of our Lord’s gracious kindness incline it in the right direction.
