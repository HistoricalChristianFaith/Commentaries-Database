For while I say that similar things are written of the Son as of the Spirit, I am rather proceeding to the following point. My claim is not that because something is written of the Son, therefore it would appear to be reverently written of the Holy Spirit. Rather, I am contending against the argument that because the same is written of the Spirit, therefore the Son’s honor is lessened because of the Spirit. For they say, Is it not written of God the Father? But let them learn that it is also said of God the Father, “In the Lord I will praise the word,” and elsewhere, “In God we will do mighty deeds,” “My remembrance shall be ever in Thee,” and “In Thy name will we rejoice,” and again in another place, “That his deeds may be manifested, that they are wrought in God,” and by Paul, “In God, who created all things,” and again, “Paul and Silvanus and Timothy to the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”
