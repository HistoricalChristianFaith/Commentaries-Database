That same David, I say, who had not wept for the innocent infant wept for the parricide when dead; the difference of his actions may not perhaps disturb those who cling to the words of Scripture. For at the last, when he was wailing and mourning, he said, “O my son Absalom, my son Absalom! Who will grant me to die for you!” But not only is Absalom the parricide wept over, Amnon is wept over. Not only is the incestuous wept over but is even avenged; the one by the scorn of the kingdom, the other by the exile of his brothers. The wicked is wept over, not the innocent. What is the cause? What is the reason? There is no little deliberation with the prudent and confirmation of results with the wise; for there is great consistency of prudence in so great a difference of actions, but the belief is one. He wept for those who were dead but did not think that he ought to weep for the dead infant, for he thought that they were lost to him but hoped that the latter would rise again. - "On Belief in the Resurrection 2.28"
