The small fishes blessed are the books of the New Testament, for our Lord when risen asks for a piece of broiled fish;1 or else in these little fishes, we receive the saints, seeing that in the Scriptures of the New Testament are contained the faith, life, and sufferings of them who, snatched away from the troubled waves of this world, have given us by their example spiritual refreshment.
