A city, however, placed on a hill cannot be hid, and lowliness always comes before glory. Wherefore it goes on, But the more he charged them, so much the more a great deal they published it.

Mystically, Tyre is interpreted narrowness, and signifies Jud√¶a, to which the Lord said, (v. Isa. 28:20) "For the bed is grown too narrow," and from which he turns himself to the Gentiles. Sidon means 'hunting,' for our race is like an untamed beast, and 'sea,' which means a wavering inconstancy. Again, the Saviour comes to save the Gentiles in the midst of the coasts of Decapolis, which may be interpreted, as the commands of the Decalogue. Further, the human race throughout its many members is reckoned as one man, eaten up by varying pestilence, in the first created man; it is blinded, that is, its eye is evil; it becomes deaf, when it listens to, and dumb when it speaks, evil.

And looking up to heaven, he groaned, (Cf. Mat. 12:20. Luke 11:20) that is, He taught us to groan, and to raise up the treasures of our hearts to the heavens; because by the groaning of hearty compunction, the silly joy of the flesh is purged away. But the ears are opened to hymns, and songs, and psalms; and He looses the tongue, that it may pour forth the good word, which neither threats nor stripes can restrain.
