Although the just suffer trials in this age, a greater sweetness awaits them, if they persevere to the future, which the Lord hides meanwhile for those who fear him. He does not wish to show it in this age, so he may complete it for the ones hoping in him in the presence of those who mock them. Now he hides them in the secret of his presence from the vexation of people.â€¦ Then he magnifies his mercy when he prepares a fortified city, which angels surround, the mother city of holy Jerusalem.
