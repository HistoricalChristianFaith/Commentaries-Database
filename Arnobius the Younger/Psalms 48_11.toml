Let Mount Zion rejoice; let the church rejoice; the daughters of Judah rejoice. You have judged all the spirits from the womb of the church, so that you may yoke the devil and may free the souls of people. Now, O freed spirits, encompass your mother Zion, whom you have followed; tell his mercy to the towers. In the towers they defend the city and resist the enemies. Place your hearts in his strength. Consider with what strength he fights for you â€¦, so you may tell later generations.
