He will surely come openly to judge the age through fire. Fire will burn in his countenance, and around him will be strong storms. Then apostles, martyrs and teachers will be gathered, those who have ordained his covenant over sacrifices. These will become the apostles, teachers and advisors in the present. These are the “heavens” who proclaim the glory of God. Then when God begins to judge they announce his righteousness and his mercy.
