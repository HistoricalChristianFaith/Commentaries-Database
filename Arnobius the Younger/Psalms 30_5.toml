quote='''
The world was cursed by the death of Adam, but life is revealed in the rising from the dead. Weeping will tarry till evening.… But we will have joy in the morning. In the early rising, as the shadows of the earth are ended and the time of morning rising arrives, the beauty of our faith stands.
