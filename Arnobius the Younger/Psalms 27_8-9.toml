In this place, the lover of God, not seeking any other type of purity but desiring the beauty of Christ alone, in those words which lovers are accustomed to say to those whom they love, cries out in the heart, “My heart says to you, as to your face, do not turn your face from me or turn away your servant in anger.” I have done such things by which you, rightly angered, have turned away from me, having been justly angered by my desires, but be my merciful helper, do not turn away from me or look down on me, God of my salvation.
