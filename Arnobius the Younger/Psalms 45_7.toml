God anoints him before his own people with the oil of joy. Just as he appeared before humankind incarnate and perfect, Christ appeared anointed with oil before all Christians. There were many righteous people from Abel to Christ, but none born of a virgin, none of this appearance, this form. Who is like our God among the children of God? Let us, children pleasing to him, listen to this one, anointed with oil of anointing, as angels worshiped, the stars sang out and the prophets prophesied. As John was fearing, the skies opened, the Father called from heaven, and the Spirit descended from the heavens and remained on him. It is Christ, the first before the partakers who share this name.
