[[commentary]]
quote='''
Even in this hour, we are hungry and thirsty and naked, yet our spirits act patiently and are not disturbed, for the Lord sustains us. He is our helper and protector, and, as it says in the heading of the psalm, we are commanded to “rejoice in the Lord, righteous ones, let your heart be joyful in him, and hope in his holy name.” He brings his mercy over us as we hope in him.
