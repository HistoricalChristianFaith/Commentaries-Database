Who is the King of glory? Christ, the Son of God, he is the King of glory, casting off the prince of shame. He lifts high the eternal gates of the holy universal church, having cast down the temple of idols just as the gates of their prince the devil. If you should ask, “Who is that King of glory?” the apostle will answer, “The King of all for their salvation, Christ, Son of God, who rules forever.”
