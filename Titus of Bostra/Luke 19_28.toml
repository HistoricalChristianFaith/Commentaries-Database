Here it was evident that there would be a divine summons. For no one can resist God calling for what is His own. But the disciples when ordered to fetch the colt refused not the office as a slight one, but went to bring him.
They who had tied the ass are struck dumb, because of the greatness of His mighty power, and are unable to resist the words of the Savior; for &#8220;the Lord&#8221; is a name of majesty, and as a King was He about to come in the sight of all the people.
