Some have supposed that the sun and moon and the other stars were gods with absolute powers and ascribed to them the causation of all events.  But Moses held that the universe was created and is in a sense the greatest of commonwealths, having magistrates and subjects.  For magistrates, all the heavenly bodies fixed and wandering. For subjects, such beings as exist below the moon, in the air or on the earth. These magistrates, however, in his view do not have unconditional powers but are lieutenants of the one Father of all.  And it is by mimicking the example of his governance exercised according to law and justice over all created beings that they acquit themselves aright... So all the gods which the senses know in the heavens must not be supposed to possess absolute power but to have received the rank of subordinate rulers, naturally liable to correction... let us proceed to give honor to the immaterial, invisible, understood by the intellect alone, who is not only the God of gods, whether perceived by sense or by mind, but also the maker of all.
