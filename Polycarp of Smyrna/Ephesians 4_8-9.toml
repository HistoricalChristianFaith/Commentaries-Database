The strong root of your faith, spoken of in days [Philippians 1:5] long gone by, endures even until now, and brings forth fruit to our Lord Jesus Christ, who for our sins suffered even unto death, [but] "whom God raised from the dead, having loosed the pains of Hades." [quoting variant Acts 2:24 found in a few manuscripts of the so-called "Western" text]
