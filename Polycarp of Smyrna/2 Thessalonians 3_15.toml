I am deeply grieved, therefore, brethren, for him (Valens) and his wife; to whom may the Lord grant true repentance! And be ye then moderate in regard to this matter, and "do not count such as enemies"

I have been exceedingly grieved on account of Valens, who was at one time a presbyter among you, because he forgot the office that was given him. I warn you, therefore, to refrain from the love of money and be pure and truthful.… I am, therefore, very grieved indeed for that man and his wife. “May the Lord grant them true repentance.” But you, too, must be moderate in this matter; and “do not consider such persons as enemies” but reclaim them as suffering and straying members, in order that you may save the whole body of you. For in doing this you will edify yourselves.
