I am greatly grieved for Valens, who was once a presbyter among you, because he so little understands the place that was given him [in the Church]. I exhort you, therefore, that ye abstain from covetousness,61 and that ye be chaste and truthful. "Abstain from every form of evil." [1 Thess. 5:22] For if a man cannot govern himself in such matters, how shall he enjoin them on others? If a man does not keep himself from covetousness,63 he shall be defiled by idolatry, and shall be judged as one of the heathen.
