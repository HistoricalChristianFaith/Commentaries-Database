Now I exhort all of you to be obedient to the word of righteousness and to exercise all patient endurance, such as you have seen with your very eyes, not only in the blessed Ignatius and Zosimus and Rufus but also in others who were of your membership, and in Paul himself and the rest of the apostles; being persuaded that all these “did not run in vain” but in faith and righteousness, and that they are now in their deserved place with the Lord, in whose suffering they also shared. For they “loved not this present world” but him who died on our behalf and was raised by God for our sakes.
