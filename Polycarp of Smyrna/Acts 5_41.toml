Let us then continually persevere in our hope and the earnest of our righteousness, which is Jesus Christ, “who bore our sins in his own body on the tree,” “who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth,” but who endured all things for us, that we might live in him. Let us then be imitators of his patience; and if we suffer for his name’s sake, let us glorify him. For he has set us this example in himself, and we have believed that such is the case.
