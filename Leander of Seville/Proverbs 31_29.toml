“Many women have gathered together riches; you have excelled them all.” …Heresies are generated from Christian seed; they are thorns because they have been nourished outside of God’s paradise, that is, outside of the catholic church. This is proved not by any conjecture of my own making but by the authority of divine Scripture, when Solomon said, “As a lily among thorns, so is my beloved among women.”
