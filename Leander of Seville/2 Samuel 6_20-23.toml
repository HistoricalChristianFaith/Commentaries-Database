You will be blessed if you give thanks to God both in adversity and in prosperity and if you consider the prosperity of this life as smoke and vapor that immediately vanishes. David was a king, yet, in spite of having numerous treasures and ruling countless peoples with a strong hand, he sang of himself as humble and said, “I am afflicted in an agony from my youth.” And again, he said to the daughter of Saul, “I shall walk humbly, and I shall appear humbly before the Lord, who chose me rather than your father.” Likewise, he also said, “I am a wayfarer of earth and a pilgrim like all my fathers.”
