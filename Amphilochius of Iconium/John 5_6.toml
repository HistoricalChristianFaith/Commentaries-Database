Jesus asked, “Do you want to be made whole?” See his modesty here. He does not say, “Do you desire that I heal you,” for he did not want to make himself appear as someone great by making an announcement, as it were, of his miracles. And the [lame] man says, “I desire,” but “I do not have a man” [to help me]; for where there is no love, there is not even one person [to offer help]. And so, I also ask for this reason, [Jesus says]: not only so that you should know of my plan to make whole those who are sick, but also so that you might see the cruelty of those of the city who were well, because not only did no one give their hand to help you to the streams but they even treated you like an enemy when you asked [for help].
