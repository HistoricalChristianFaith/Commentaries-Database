He is set for the fall of the unbelieving Jews, but for the resurrection of the believing Gentiles. “And for a sign that is spoken against.” The cross is a sign that is spoken against. Why? Because many who did not believe denied him at the cross. They ridiculed it both by deeds and words. They gave him vinegar to drink, offered him gall for his thirst, twisted a wreath of thorns to put on his brow, pierced his side with a spear, struck him with their hands, and shouted at him with offensive clamor: “He saved others, but cannot save himself.”
