But above all, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven, nor by earth, nor by any other oath. But let your yes be yes, and your no be no, so that you do not fall into hypocrisy.
But someone will say: If someone is compelled to swear, what should be done? We say that the fear of God will be stronger than the necessity imposing force. However, someone might doubt, since the old law holds that those who swear by the name of the Lord are worthy of praise, how does grace forbid this? Therefore, we say that the old law, leading the Jews not to swear by idols, commanded them to swear by God: just as it also commanded them to sacrifice to God, withdrawing them from sacrificing to idols: where it sufficiently taught the worship of God, then it also rejected sacrifices as useless: not seeking the sacrifice of animals, but a repentant soul as a sacrifice. But what is that? It is one that is entirely set ablaze with the fire of love through the modesty of the spirit, such as was also the soul of Paul, who, because some of the faithful were offended, was wondrously kindled.
"But let your yes be yes." This means your deposit should be firm and reaffirmed, and denial in those things that do not correspond to the act.
"That they may not fall into hypocrisy." The term hypocrisy refers to condemnation, that is, the condemnation that follows those who incessantly and without selection swear: and by the habit of swearing, they are led to perjury. Or even the term hypocrisy in this context has a specific meaning (for example, simulation) which is different from what it appears. How then does one who swears fall into hypocrisy? For in swearing, one is believed to be truthful, but by subsequent transgression, he is found to be lying instead of truthful. Or also because ναὶ, that is yes, is not presented for confirmation, nor is οὐ, that is no, in response to what does not correspond to the act. However, swearing by God is prohibited because of perjury; but swearing by heaven and the rest, so that these may not be referred to divine honor. For whoever swears, swears by the greater.
