Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.

Preach the word. But what then is the obstacle? Do not hide the message, but proclaim it.

be prepared. That is, repeat, look around and watch that no one sins. And do this promptly, untimely, that is, do not have a fixed and definite time for this, but at all times, even if it is not convenient, manage. And if you find, Paul says, someone sinning, correct. For nothing ought to be done before you have convinced: and after you have shown him to be guilty, rebuke.

Find fault, blame. Then after the wound, apply a remedy. For Paul says, "encourage," so that such a person is not swallowed up by excessive grief.

with great patience. For the matter requires patience, so that one should not simply trust those who speak, but come through every investigation and the test of time to the truth.

and careful instruction. Paul says to admonish along with the rebuke, as one lays it upon a child, not as one punishing an enemy, for he knows when encouragement has more power than rebuke.

About those who were devising new things to oppose Timothy.
