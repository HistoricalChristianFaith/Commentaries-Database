Two are sought here. How, having said above that God removed Enoch so that he would not see death, now has he said, "According to faith, all these died"? And again he said, "not having received the promises," although he said above that they had received the rewards of faith. For Noah was saved with his house. And Enoch was removed, and he did not see death. And Abel still speaks through his glory; and Abraham both took possession of the promised land and fathered from Sarah. — The solution. On the one hand, they all died, accept, with Enoch having been taken away. On the other hand, not having received the promises, it says about all, indicating that to those concerning Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, not only land was promised, but also, through their virtue, the heavenly things. This also applies to the others. For, he says, the generous God would not have released Abel for the sake of being glorified, Enoch for the sake of being removed, Noah for the sake of escaping immediate death, or Abraham for the sake of becoming a father of children, or to take hold of the land as in a sojourn. But these things were granted to them in part. And there was a taste of the truly promised things. For it indicates that they had learned beforehand concerning the kingdom of heaven, saying, having seen them from afar and greeted them.

"but having seen them from afar." Thus, he says, they believed in them, from afar by hope, that they also rejoiced in them, and not only were they embracing them.

The phrase, "having seen from afar," some say, refers to those around Abraham regarding the return of their descendants from Egypt. But this is unfitting. We say that they were evangelized concerning the kingdom of heaven, and all that Christ preached. For if they had not heard these things, why would they call themselves foreigners and sojourners? For they did not say these things longing for an earthly homeland, since they could have returned to their own land, but they were seeking heaven. Moreover, if this were not the case, both Abel and Enoch and Noah would be found, having not received the promise from God. For neither was anything earthly promised to them. Nor did it say to Noah that he would be saved in the promise. —
"and greeted them." Being persuaded.
"they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth." Not of the promised (for this is not great), but of the whole world.
"make it clear." They show.
"that they are seeking a homeland." That in heaven, obviously.
"And if they had been." For that they sought the one in heaven is clear from this. For if they sought their own from which God had expelled them, they had the strength to return. For they had time for this to return to their own. But now, seeking a homeland, not returning from which they went out, it is clear that they desire something better and heavenly.
“Therefore God is not ashamed." For just as God is called the God of the world, so Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are called by Him, having made them counterparts of creation. And this is the greatest honor, to deem God to be called their God. For just as God is adorned by the patriarchs, so He is called the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
"for He has prepared a city for them." God is not ashamed to be called their God. And therefore, He says, He is not ashamed because He has fulfilled their desire. They desired a city in heaven, and He has prepared a city for them in it.
