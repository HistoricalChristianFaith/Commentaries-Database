Once the resurrection has happened and each soul has received its own body, death, namely, the formless, disembodied life of souls in death is destroyed. [The passage] describes this in a figurative manner and speaks of their destruction symbolically when it says that death and hades were thrown into the lake of fire. The prophet Hosea also speaks similarly, saying, “Where is your penalty, O death? Where, O hades, is your sting?” “This is,” it says, “the second death, the lake of fire.” In previous passages it spoke of physical death, that is, the separation of the soul and the body as the first death, while the second death was the spiritual death, punishment and torment, which has sin as its cause.
