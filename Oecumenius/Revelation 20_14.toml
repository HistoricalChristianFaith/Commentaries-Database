And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire, this is the second death.

And Death and Hades, he says, were cast into the lake of fire; that is, the death and the immortal and incorporeal life of souls in the manner of death was taken away, once having been the resurrection and each soul receiving its own body; which, explaining more figuratively and hinting at their destruction, he said that Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire.

This is also what the prophet Hosea does, saying: "Where is your justice, O Death? Where is your sting, Hades?" (Hos. 13:14)

He says the lake of fire, this is the second death; for it has also been said above that the first death is the earthly death, the separation of soul and body, and the second is the spiritual death, punishment and retribution, which has sin as its mother.
