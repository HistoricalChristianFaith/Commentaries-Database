Women likewise must be honorable, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things. Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, managing their children and their own households well. For those who serve well gain for themselves a good standing and great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon; but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.

Women, not just any women, but deaconesses. For what did Paul wish to mention among the clergy, women of any kind?

not slanderous.  What was said above: not to be double-tongued.

managing their children and their own households well. He places this everywhere, wishing to bring the reproof upon them from home.

and great confidence. But who would have confidence in the faith of Christ, except the one who lives with faith and a righteous life?

Since he was led by the Spirit, and did not know where the Spirit was ordering him to go, therefore he always hesitates.

which is the Church of the living God. Whoever is a house, is the Church of the living God; not like the Jewish temple, but a pillar and foundation, that is, a confirmation of the truth. For the temple, he says, was a foundation of the types of truth. And rightly so, "of the living God." For do you not notice, he said, that it is filled with men: for it excels through God, and is built by Him, and has Him as its inhabitant.
