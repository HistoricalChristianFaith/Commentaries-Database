The tent of testimony was the tent constructed in the wilderness by Bezalel, the master-builder of the artifacts made at that time; it was the custom in Holy Scripture to call it thus because it was the tent of the testimonies and commands of God. For in it was the ark of the covenant, the mercy-seat, the table, the altars of incense and of burnt offering, the lampstand, and all that God had commanded blessed Moses to construct, when he said, “And you shall make for me all that I show you on the mountain.” For this reason he has used the metaphor of the old tent to describe the nature of the heavenly temple by calling it the tent of testimony. 

From there, he says, the seven angels came out. From where else could the heavenly ministers of God be seen coming out except from the heavenly temple? 

He says they had in their hands seven plagues, which they were going to let fall on the earth. For many signs will come about on earth at the time of the end, which Christ also mentioned in the gospels when teaching about the end. 

The clothing of the angels with a pure bright stone is a sign of their worth, purity, and radiance, and points to their natural steadfastness for good, since they had indeed put on Christ. For the Lord is named a stone in Holy Scripture, as found in Isaiah, “Behold, I am laying in Zion for a foundation a stone, very costly and chosen,” and in the prophet, “The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner.” Very wise Paul also advises us to put on this stone: “Put on our” stone “Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.” For whoever is clothed in this is out of reach of every lust that harms the soul. 

The girdles symbolize their capability and preparedness, for it is said of them, “Mighty in power are they who keep his word.” 

For these seven angels have taken from one of the four living creatures, of whom much was said earlier, the wrath of God in seven golden bowls. “Golden” was well said, for even the wrath of God is precious, bringing with it what is good and more profitable than justice, even if those suffering punishment are in anguish. 

He says, And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power. The smoke is a sign of the divine wrath, for Scripture says, “Smoke went up in his wrath.” Smoke is indicative of fire; but there is also the smoke that blessed Isaiah saw where he says, “And the lintel shook at the voices of the seraphim as they sang” the Trisagion, “and the house was filled with smoke.” He was describing the wrath of God directed against Jerusalem. 

The words from the glory of God and from his power are a kind of periphrasis for the smoke, as if he said, “it was filled with smoke from the wrath of God,” for God himself is the power and the glory, and who could bear his wrath? 

He says, And no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were ended: for who will mount up on the wrath of God, or who will remain alive when caught in it? “For if no one has stood at the feet of the Lord,” according to Scripture, scarcely could anyone endure God’s wrath. 

He says, And I heard a command of one who came out that they should pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the divine wrath.
