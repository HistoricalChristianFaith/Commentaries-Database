Jude prays for greater mercy because it is by the bowels of God’s mercy that we have been called back to him and enrolled as his servants. He asks for increased peace because this is God’s gift to us, by which he leads us who have sinned back to friendship with him through his Son Jesus Christ. He also desires greater love, since it is because of the love which he has shown toward us that the only-begotten Son sacrificed himself for us by dying on the cross. In praying for these things, Jude is doing no more than imitate David, who said: “O continue thy steadfast love to those who know thee.”
