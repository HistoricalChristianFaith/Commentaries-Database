"Those who are beloved in God the Father, and who are called, are saved by Jesus Christ." The Lord's word, in which He said, "No one comes to me unless the Father draws him," (Jn. 6:44) this blessed man now shows to be true. For those who are beloved by the Father, Jude says, have been saved by Jesus Christ. Therefore, he also calls them the called: for they do not have it from themselves, but from the Father, in that they are drawn, so that they may also be called. He truly prays for them that mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
Indeed mercy, for we have been recalled and taken by Him into ministry because of the bowels of the mercy of God: peace, however, because God the Father Himself has granted this to us, bringing us who had sinned back to His friendship through His Son Jesus Christ: and love, indeed, because of the love He had for us, His only-begotten Son was exposed to death for us. Therefore, he prays that these may be abundantly granted to them, saying in harmony with blessed David, who says: "Extend your mercy to those who know you." (Ps. 36:10)
