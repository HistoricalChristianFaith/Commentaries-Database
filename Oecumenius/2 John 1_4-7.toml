I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, as we received a command from the Father. And now I ask you, lady, not as writing a new commandment to you, but what we had from the beginning, that we love one another. And this is love, that we walk according to His commandments. This is the commandment, as you have heard from the beginning, that you should walk in it: for many deceivers have entered into the world, who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh.
"I was very glad." For certainly, the greatest cause of joy is to find someone who walks without offense in the straight path of faith in Christ according to His command. But what is that command? It is what Christ says in the Gospels: "Whoever loves me will keep my commandments." (Jn. 14:21) But now John calls Christ Father: since He Himself is also the Father of the children who have been given to Him by a certain privilege from His Father: according to what has been said: "Behold, I and the children whom God has given me." (Isa. 8:18) Moreover, notice the genuine wording of this epistle, which confirms what has been said previously: “And we know that whoever loves God keeps His commandments.” (1 Jn. 5:3)
For it is the same to walk according to the commandments and to receive them. For virtues operate and exist according to their operation. Therefore, whoever ceases to progress in these, neither keeps nor guards them. To walk, indeed, is said according to development and growth. For as much as one operates according to virtue, so much further one progresses, acquiring a greater habit of honor. For the way of virtue is infinite and never failing. According to this, I think that this has also been said: "In which things the angels desire to look." (1 Peter 1:12) For such is the magnificence of the goods that have been granted to us by Him who was incarnate, that it is desirable even for the angels to take a slight understanding of these things; for this is what “to look” (παρακΰψαι) indicates.
However, someone desires not what ceases, but what continually progresses, and is illuminated by sincere glory. And since that which is inexhaustible cannot be fully embraced by anyone, it is at least desirable to become a participant in it to some extent. John said: "not as writing a new commandment to you," and this he firmly states to those who are mentioned in the preceding epistle, simultaneously demonstrating that it shows what they themselves had experienced by acting according to it, and not from difficult and foreign matters, affecting them with sorrow by approaching the unfamiliar. "not as writing a new commandment to you." He also adds the work of the commandment, that we love one another, and he explains that love consists in that we love one another.
Nor for any other reason was it given from the beginning, John says, except that you might walk in it, revolving and turning the same things in the higher and lower realms: and indeed by love urging them towards inseparability, and that they should not be led away by seducers, who were already walking in the world and rejecting the coming of the Lord in the flesh: but by this that he admonishes to walk according to the Lord's command which was from the beginning, revealing the erroneous opinion of the heretics which is recent: and exhorting that by embracing the command which was from the beginning, they should not be led away by their deceit. For Christ also commanded the disciples about these seducers, saying: "Many will come in my name”, saying: I am Christ, and they will deceive many. “Therefore do not follow them." (Luke 21:8) Therefore, keeping these commands, John says, he commands that you should not be deceived, but that you should consider him who hides these things to be “an antichrist”.
