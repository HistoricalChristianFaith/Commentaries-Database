But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men count slackness; but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.
"The Lord is not slack." Having completed the discourse on the End, which will necessarily be through fire, all of which we have explained more fully, it transitions to the production or extension of the time until the world is ended, and says: The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some understand slowness. Instead, he is patient, waiting for our salvation, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance: for certainly to him who is infinite and the sea of essence unconstrained, nothing is extended, but a thousand years are just like a single day with him. Or rather, according to David, there is no multiplication of days: for he says in this way: "A thousand years in your sight, O Lord, are like a day that has just gone by and like a watch in the night" (Ps. 89:4): by watch signifying the briefest span of the night. For the night is divided into four watches: since the Lord came to the holy apostles in the fourth watch. (Matt. 14:25)
