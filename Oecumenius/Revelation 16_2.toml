We can interpret these things in a twofold manner. Either these events will occur literally at the time of the consummation, or they are to be understood allegorically. When the Lord addressed his disciples about the signs of the end, he spoke openly about the evil events that will happen at that time, saying, “And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars; and nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in various places. All of this is the beginning of the birth pangs.” And a little later he said, “For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.” As each of the seven bowls is poured out, the events said to have occurred in the present passages should be interpreted in the light of those things [the Lord said]. In this case, the sores that come from the first bowl would symbolize the tribulations and distresses that vex the souls of people at that time because of the rumors of wars.
