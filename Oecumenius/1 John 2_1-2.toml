My little children, I write these things to you so that you may not sin. And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous. And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for ours only, but also for the whole world.
Knowing our instability and inclination to sin, and that we always have a tendency towards worse things, and that there is a envious demon lurking against our salvation, it is necessary for those who have already become familiar with God to live cautiously to avoid sinning: John adds that even if we fall after remission, we should not despair of ourselves. For if we turn back, we will attain salvation through the Mediator, the Lord Jesus Christ. For He, interceding for us with the Father, will appease Him not for ours only, but also for the whole world. He said this either because He was writing to the Jews, so that the repentance would not be concluded only for them, but would also extend to the Gentiles; or because the promise was not made only to those who were alive at that time, but also to all who would come afterward.
John indeed calls Him an Advocate who prays or pleads with the Father for us. However, these things are said with regard to human nature and a certain privilege: just as that saying, "The Son can do nothing of Himself." (Jn. 5:19) For He says this so that He does not appear to oppose God. For he had shown that the Son also had the power to forgive sins in the case of the paralyzed (Matt. 9:2-6), and by giving His disciples the authority to forgive sins, He demonstrated that He conferred this power by His own authority. (Jn. 20:23)
But as we said, either the Apostle is saying this as a certain privilege, or he is showing the same nature of the Son with the Father and the same power, and that whatever one of the three holy persons would do, it would be common to the others.
