Let a woman learn in silence with all submissiveness. I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, but to remain quiet. For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression. Yet she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control. This is a trustworthy saying.

Not only does he require women to be modest, but also silent and submissive; for through silence, they signify submission.

I do not permit a woman to teach. He removed every opportunity for a woman to speak. For since he commanded them to be silent, so that they would not speak under the grounds of a reasonable excuse for teaching, he says, "Nor let them teach," not only human things but also spiritual ones. And he forbade teaching in the assembly. For he did not entirely remove teaching from them; for he allows them to teach their own children for a time, as he says later on.

or to exercise authority over a man. For to teach is indeed to assume authority over a man.

For Adam was formed first. Since Adam was formed first, the woman should not have authority over the man, but should be in submission to him.

Adam was not deceived. As to the comparison with the deceit with which the woman was deceived, the behavior of Adam is neither deceit nor trickery. For it is much more reasonable to be deceived by the serpent than to accept the fruit from the woman and eat it. Therefore, in his defense, Paul says that he was not deceived, but that "The woman whom you gave to be my helper, she gave to me and I ate." (Gen. 3:12) Calmly showing that Adam did not even err after listening to his helper. "He was not deceived." Note that what precedes is to be understood as implied.

In another way also. How was Adam not deceived? Because neither does Scripture say this, but the woman indeed: "The serpent deceived me." (Gen. 3:13) But Adam does not say; "The woman deceived me," but, "She gave me." She gave to me: For it is not the same to be persuaded by a fellow and companion, and to be persuaded by a beast, slave, and one who is subordinated. Therefore, that was the deception. But neither did Adam see the tree that it was beautiful to eat, but the woman.

but the woman being deceived. And Paul brings this forward to prevent a woman from teaching. For once a woman has taught, Paul says, she overturns everything and makes the man subject to disobedience: for she was the author herself and advised him to eat. Therefore, he does not say: Eve was deceived; but the woman was deceived, indicating a nature that is easily deceived.

but the woman being deceived fell into transgression. Not only Eve became accountable to transgression, but also the whole sisterhood of women. For as in Adam we all die, so in Eve all have sinned.

Yet she will be saved through childbearing. Not only Eve, but every woman. And by “childbearing,” it is meant not only to bear children, but also to lead them according to God. What then shall one say, that virgins and barren women, and those without children and widows, are lost? Away with that though! For it does not say that they will not be saved by their own virtue; but that childbearing will also be a means of salvation for them, that is, the acknowledged means of being saved by their own virtue.

if they continue in faith. If Christians have nurtured and remained virtuous. What then if she herself is evil, but nurtures well? It certainly cannot happen that what is bad trains well; yet if it does happen, there will be a reward. But what if being good she nurtures evil? She will die because of the evil of the children. And the priest Eli is witness. (1 Sam. 2-4)

This is a trustworthy saying. Because the fathers, Paul says, will be able to share in the virtue of the children.

On the Virtue of Bishops.
