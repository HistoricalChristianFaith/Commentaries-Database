I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and bore witness to your truth, as you walk in the truth.
"you walk in the truth." He walks in truth who walks in the righteous simplicity of the Gospel. However, to walk does not refer to the motion of limbs, since such steps, passing from one place to another, are common to all animals that have feet; but it signifies an ordered and measured progress according to the keen affection of the mind, which few attain, even among those who are not lacking in understanding.
