Honor widows who are truly widows. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to manage their own household properly and to repay their elders. For this is acceptable in the sight of God.

Why does Paul say nothing about virgins? Perhaps they were not in their prime. And who is the truly widowed woman, he goes on to say. He ordered that she herself be honored, because they have no husbands nor children, and the matter seems to be a curse for many. Therefore, he says, she should enjoy much honor from the priest, as if restoring the reproaches from others. Or Paul calls the honor the condition of necessities.

if any widow has children. These are not truly widows. For truly they are those who are isolated on all sides.

— [OECUMENIUS] to manage their own household properly. That is, to arrange well. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius] —

and to repay their elders. See the wisdom of the blessed Paul. Often he also urges from human reasoning. For he says, since those before you were not able to give back the recompenses (for they died), through the descendants of those, your children, you should repay them the favors which you owed to those.

— And furthermore. That children and grandchildren should first learn to revere their own household; that is, that children and grandchildren should learn to honor their own mother and to nourish and treat her well. For this is what it means to revere. And also the ancestors, that is, the grandmother. Add also to the account that this is acceptable to God.
