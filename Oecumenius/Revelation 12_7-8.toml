The vision that is to explain the events concerning the antichrist refers to a beginning earlier than the beginning just described. This earlier beginning … is the fall of Satan from heaven. The Lord also spoke of this, “I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven.” Why, then, does it say, “And there was war in heaven”? The holy Scripture says that Satan exalted himself against God, that is, he lifted up a stiff and insolent neck to him and devised an apostasy. Although God, who is by nature good and forbearing, was patient with him, the holy angels did not tolerate the arrogance of their master and banished him from their ranks. This passage speaks of this event. Michael, one of the great leaders of the angels, made war against Satan and his followers, and Satan did not prevail in this war against him.
