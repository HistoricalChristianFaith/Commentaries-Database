The superior things are shown from the change of the priest, the sacrifice, and the covenant, which the old has come to an end, and that which is new is better in many ways; it now wishes to show from the very arrangement of the tabernacle that those were the figures of the true things: moreover, the figure takes an end where the truth approaches. What he says: "had," signifies that it now does not have. Therefore, although it has not completely ceased, since some still cling to it, nevertheless, it has no rights.

The first tabernacle indeed had rights of worship, I think it is not about the tabernacle, but about the old covenant itself. For it did not compare the tabernacle with the new covenant, but the entire old covenant with the new, and it showed the superiority of this over that entire one. "For behold," he says, "the days are coming, and I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah, not according to the covenant I made with their fathers." (Jer. 31:31–33; Heb. 8:8–10) And again: “In speaking of a new covenant, he has made the first obsolete."(Heb. 8:13)
And after saying this, he adds: "He had also had it before." (Heb. 10:15) Therefore, it is evident that the discussion is still about the covenant. For since he had depressed it in comparison to the new, lest anyone should say that it had always been rejected, he anticipates by saying that it also had rights of worship, laws, and order, and those things which pertain to the proper worship of God. Saying that by lineage he had rights of worship, he proceeds also in part, beginning from the tabernacle.
"He had," he says, "the holy world." Then after the holy world and all that is sacred, he had again another tabernacle, set apart from the more secret and holier tabernacle. And in the set-apart one, both the lampstand and the arrangement of the loaves, which tabernacle is not called the holy world, just as the entire tabernacle, the first, but simply holy.

The first, you say, as to the holy of holies, since it was not the first, but the middle. For the first was where the bronze altar of the sacrifices and the burnt offerings was. This is the second, concerning which it is said, "in which were the lampstand, the table, and the showbread." The third, in which is a golden censer, and the Ark of the Covenant.

"the holy world." It is called world because it is open to all. Here, the temple is rightly called holy, in which the liturgy [λειτουργίαν] was performed to God, or even the tabernacle, since they had previously had this in the order of the temple, thus calling it so. And this can be learned from the first book of Kings, which clearly states: "And Samuel was sleeping in the temple of the Lord, where the Ark of God was." (1 Sam. 3:3)
Therefore, he says, the holy was in the old covenant as something worldly, so that he might say when the temple was constructed as a type of the world. God indeed created heaven and earth, as Moses says, in the beginning, (Gen. 1) saying heaven above, on the second day, preparing for this heaven to be established in the midst of the waters; so that even being elevated, the waters have it above. Therefore, as a symbol of the world, commanding Moses to construct a certain type, God instructed him to make the tabernacle.
"Make a sanctuary from the curtains, divided in the middle by another." (Ex. 26:4) Thus indeed the temple later became a type according to the same pattern. And the whole house was divided by a wall in the middle, so that the outer part was the house, in which it was necessary for the priests to perform the service through the sacrifices and to render all the rest to God; this was a symbol of that very place upon the earth, where it has now happened that we dwell; but the inner part, in which it was necessary for the high priest to enter only once a year, was a symbol of the heavenly, where the Jews believed God to dwell.
“For the first tabernacle was constructed.”

I noted that there were three tabernacles in the Octateuch that exist; one, concerning which the holy world speaks, where there was the bronze altar of burnt offerings, and it was permitted for all the people to enter and to perform the sacrifices; the second, where the priests were always permitted to perform the services, where there was the lampstand and the table and the showbread; the third, where there was the censer and the Ark, into which only the high priest entered once a year.

"And after the second veil." Therefore, there was not only one veil. A tabernacle is called everywhere, because there God dwells.
"the Ark of the Covenant." It carries the symbols of the covenant, such as the tablets of the law and the others.
"having a golden censor." All these were in the Ark, rebuking the ingratitude of the Jews.
“the rod”, because of the insurrection against the priesthood.
the tablets, because the Jews had a ploy to break the first commandments.
and the manna, because of their grumbling while eating. Therefore, these symbols should also be sent to their descendants for their caution.
"Above it." Of the ark.
"Cherubim of glory." Which are the glorious, or the beings of glory, namely, of God.

"overshadowing the mercy seat." For above the ark, as if a square golden table, which was called the mercy seat, typifying Christ (Jn. 2:2), who is called to us the propitiation and redemption (1 Cor. 1:30). See the passage in Exodus, in the places concerning these things.

"about which we cannot now speak in detail." He wishes to show that the things seen were mysteries and types of the Truth. Therefore, it is not now, he says, to speak of them in part. For more words are needed than according to the present urge.
