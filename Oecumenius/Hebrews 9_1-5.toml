The “first” part of the tabernacle was that portion near the “Holy of Holies,” since it technically was not the first but the middle part of the tabernacle. For the first part of the tabernacle was where the bronze altar was for sacrifices and whole burnt offerings, while the second part was that of which he says, “In it was the lampstand and the showbread on the table,” and the third part was “the golden altar of incense” and “the ark of the covenant.”
