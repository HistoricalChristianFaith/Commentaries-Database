"for we have no lasting city here." Therefore, we must willingly choose the death for Christ; and especially because these cities are not ours, but we must seek another, the one that remains; for these are perishing.
"Through him then." As for the high priest according to the flesh, let us offer up to the Father a sacrifice of praise, that is, thanksgiving. For we give thanks to the Father, as he has given his Son to sanctify us. This is for the weak. Since the grace of the Son, it is clear that the honor is equal; for he says, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. (Jn. 5:23)
"that is, the fruit of lips." What then is the fruit of lips? Prayers, hymns, requests to God. For when he said, "sacrifice," let them not think that he is speaking of sacrifices made through animals, Paul explained himself. He says, I mean the sacrifices that are without blood, those made through lips, those in prayers and hymns and supplications.
"that acknowledge his name." Acknowledge with the lipsHis name, that is, giving thanks knowing that He died for our sins. That is, confessing with our lips His name.
