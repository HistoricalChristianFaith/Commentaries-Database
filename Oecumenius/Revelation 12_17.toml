For he says that they were persecuted because they were the offspring of the woman; for the faithful are sons and brothers of the Lord according to the Scripture: "I will proclaim your name to my brothers," (Ps. 22:22; Heb. 2:12) and again, "Here I am, and the children God has given me." (Isa. 8:18; Heb. 2:13)
