Command these things, and teach them. Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.

Concerning those who err in knowledge, it is necessary to command them with authority; but concerning those who err in ignorance, to simply teach them. The one who encourages toward good, teaches; but the one who hinders evil, commands.

Let no one despise your youth. For the bishop must also speak more authoritatively. Therefore, "Let your forbearance be known to all men?" (Phil. 4:5) And we say that, when he himself is wronged, he ought to be gentle; but when the brothers are wronged by sinning, he ought to be strict.

Or thus. If you live a most modest life, youth, which is easily prone to contempt, will not be despised.

but be an example to the believers. Like a living image, and a standard of good living.

in word, he says, in speaking, what is necessary for a teacher. But see that the teacher must have preparation of speech.

in conduct. For example, in life and in the practice of living.

in love. Which is towards all.

in spirit. Either by spiritual rank or by the gift of the spirit, do not exalt yourself because of this.

in faith. The straight path by which one may unquestionably believe in God, even concerning the impossible.

in purity. That is, holiness, abstinence, and self-discipline.
