By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us, and we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him? My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
However, having been freed from Cain and those who imitate him, who receive the same inheritance with him, John again turns to love, showing how many good things have come from it: and he says that love persuaded the Lord laid down His life for us, and that moved by this example that we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. And since this is rare and found among few, as if encouraging them, he begins to make an admonition of brotherly love from ordinary matters, in a way arranging his discourse: "What do I say about laying down our lives for our brothers?" when we see some not even providing the necessary support for their brothers; and I do not mean those who themselves lack the necessities of life, but those who are abundant in riches almost throughout the whole world. Therefore, let them be ashamed, for if they have shut their hearts to these least things, and have shown themselves unworthy and empty of God's love, what would they offer in greater matters, namely when it is necessary to die for their brothers? Then John adds another point to exhort those who have indeed received love in word, and would only profess it with their tongues, and he says: "let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
