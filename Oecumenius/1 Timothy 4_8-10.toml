Train yourself to godliness; for physical exercise is of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.

But because of the courage of the disciple, Paul speaks clearly throughout the entire Epistle.

who is the Savior of all. He is the Savior of all here. But here, not of all, but of those worthy to be saved. And here, He especially cares for the faithful. For even though we are fought against by so many, we are saved. Paul encourages Timothy into dangers for the sake of the faith, having God as Savior.

Concerning his care, and that of the Church.
