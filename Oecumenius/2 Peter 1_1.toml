Simon may also be written as “Simeon,” of which it is the diminutive form. Compare Metras and Metrodorus, Menas and Menodorus, Theudas and Theodosius. Right from the beginning, Peter lifts up the hearts and minds of believers, encouraging us also to share in the apostles’ zeal for preaching. For it would be unjust to suggest that those who have received this gift a little later in time are somehow inferior to them, when they have officially been declared to be their equals in honor.
