If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God? He must not be a recent convert, lest, being arrogant, he fall into the judgment of the Devil. Moreover, he must have a good testimony from those outside, so that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.

Whatever the bishops commanded in these strict matters, not drunkenness, not being violent, but moderation and the like, he who commanded the disciples, "Put to death the members of your body on the earth;" (Col. 3:5) and, "Are some who crucified the flesh of Christ?" (Gal. 5:24) And Christ commanded to take up the cross and follow Him for all. (Matt. 16:24) For why did he not rather command those to be angels, as if according to the measure of mortals? And we say that the highest virtue is of few: but it was necessary to have many bishops, one for each church. Therefore, lest he make the office of bishops, which was necessary, rare or impossible, Paul commands moderate virtue, making the matter itself easy to approach:

how will he care for the church of God. Where there are greater and more numerous affairs.

He must not be a recent convert. It does not mean the younger person, but one recently instructed in the faith. For Timothy himself was also younger. “For no one should despise your youth," (1 Timothy 4:12) he says as he goes on. For he who is still a student ought, if anyone makes him a teacher, to be proud and confident.

he fall into the judgment of the Devil. To the same, Paul says, to the Devil, a judgment, into which he fell out of madness.

from those outside. Outside, says the Greeks. Observe the precision. What then if he is bad, but has a good testimony? This is impossible. For it is beloved for the most upright to be testified to by enemies. But this, along with other things, requires good qualities; for he also shows a bond. But what if, being good, he is despised concerning his life? Difficult indeed, but such a one must not become a bishop. And if from those outside, much more from the brothers.

so that he may not fall into reproach. It is fitting for one who is bad to be reproached and insulted.

and the snare of the Devil. For if he is, he says, evil in some way, he easily sets another trap for him. For if he turns from being insulted and abused to sins, he falls into another passion of anger and resentment; for no one can endure insult without anger.
