Somewhere the most wise Paul says, “Should anyone build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, fire will test the quality of the work of each, for it will be revealed by fire.” Will then not only sinners, who bring loads of kindling wood through their sins, but also the righteous, who offer gold and precious materials, be tested by fire? He says as much when he here says that those who have in every way defeated the beast stand on the sea of glass mixed with fire. For [the sea] is glass because of the brightness and purity of the righteous in it. However, it is mixed with fire because of the cleansing and purification from all filth, for there is need of purification even for the righteous. “For we all make mistakes,” as it is written, and “Who is clean from filth, even if his life upon the earth is but one day?” As has been frequently noted, the “harps” are a figure for the euphonious hymn to God sung by the saints.
