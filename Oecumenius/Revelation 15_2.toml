And he saw, he says, a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had conquered the beast and his image and the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having the harps of God. He says somewhere in his own words the wisest Paul: "If anyone builds upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw, each one's work will be tested by fire; for it will be revealed by fire." (1 Cor. 3:12-13)

So then will not only the wicked, who heap upon themselves the careless burdens of sin, but also the righteous be tested by fire, even though they bring gold and the precious materials? This is what he now says: those who have conquered the beast in every way, standing on the sea made of glass mingled with fire, glass because of the brilliant and pure nature of the righteous in it, mingled with fire because of the smoky and purifying influence of every kind of filth, since even the righteous need purification. For we all sin in many ways according to what is written (James 3:2); "and who will be clean from defilement? But not even if his life upon the earth should be one day." (Job 14:4-5)
