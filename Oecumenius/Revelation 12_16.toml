But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the Dragon had spewed out of his mouth against the woman. The earth swallowing the river signifies that the temptation was accepted within her, that is, the Lord was put to death. But the Dragon was not helped by this; rather, in restoring the Lord again, He came to life after three days, having conquered death, since it was not possible for death to hold Him (see Acts 2:24), who is "the author of life," according to the divine Peter. (Acts 3:15)

So that the composition might be so, and the earth helped the woman, it must be read completely; then, as if from a question, in what way did it help? It swallowed the river, that is, having received the Lord who was plotted against within itself, it gave Him back again, and in this it helped. Therefore, since the Dragon also failed in the second plot, what then does he do to the anointed sons and brothers of the Lord, that is, to the faithful?
