If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not leading to death, he will ask, and He will give him life for those who commit sin not leading to death. There is sin leading to death; I do not say that he should pray about that. All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not leading to death. We know that whoever is born of God does not sin, but he who has been born of God guards (τηρεῖ) himself, and the wicked one does not touch him. We know that we are of God, and the whole world lies under the sway of the wicked one. And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him who is true; and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life. Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.
"If anyone sees his brother sinning." This is one will. For it is righteous to feel compassion for the brother who has sinned and to be of help for salvation.
"There is a sin leading to death." Let this be the order: There is a sin that leads to death, and there is a sin that does not lead to death. I do not say that one should pray for the one that leads to death, but for the one that does not lead to death. Then he explains the distinction making between the sin that leads to death and the one that does not lead to death. For John simply divides it as a kind of sin and says: All unrighteousness is sin: whether it leads to death or does not lead to death.
But because it is unto death, let him not pray or ask, for he will not be heard because he asks with wrong motives (James 4:3), especially when he shows no sign of conversion. For this alone is the sin that leads death, which does not regard repentance: when Judas fell ill with this, he was taken to eternal death. And those also sin that leads death who are mindful of injuries. For the paths of those who remember injuries lead to death (Prov. 12:28 LXX.), says Solomon. Nor do they convert by remembering, retaining the memory of injuries, and keeping anger against their neighbor, but they sin without repentance. Having declared this, he subsequently indicates whose sin is the sin leads to death; and he says that whoever is born of God does not sin.
For when he has once entrusted himself to the one dwelling in him through adoption in Christ, he remains inaccessible to sin. However, lest anyone think that such a nature has been completely changed, so that he can no longer be seized by sin, he adds:
"He guards himself," as if to say: Unless he were to keep and guard himself from the evil one, he would certainly sin. Therefore, it is not nature that leads to perfection, but rather the glory of God, who, because He has adopted us, has deemed us worthy of such grace: that by keeping and guarding what has been given to us by Him, we may also have it, so that we do not sin. For unless it were so, since the world is established in evil (and the world refers to those who have not committed themselves to God through good works), nothing would prevent us from being examined along with those who perish: because the mind of man is continually inclined to evil from early youth, as God revealed during the time of the flood. (Gen. 8:22) But since, John says, the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding by which we may know the true God through internal understanding, and be in His true Son Jesus Christ: we have come to know through this glory that He is the true God and eternal life, and by knowing we are safe from the onslaught of evil and its offenses. "This is the true God." This, also, serves as a demonstrative article. Here, the article indicates relationship. "keep yourself from idols." Some have questioned: If John writes this to the perfect, why does he now command them to beware of idols? We therefore say that because he wrote to the whole Church, which was not made up of a select people, but there were also some among them who were less affected. Therefore, he commands all these, looking at their slippery nature.
John writes this as an elder to the lady and her children. The occasion for the Epistle was this: When he saw her children walking in the truth, and many deceivers going around and saying that Christ has not come in the flesh, he writes the Epistle, and first indeed commends her children for walking rightly. Then, teaching us that there is a new mystery that is among us, he again exhorts us about love, and to remain in the doctrine that has been taught to us, and consequently teaches that he is the Antichrist who says that Christ did not come in the flesh. He commands, however, that no one receive such a person into the house, nor say to them, "Greetings": and thus he concludes the Epistle.
