Where do wars and conflicts come from among you? Is it not from here, namely from your pleasures that wage war in your members? You desire and do not have; you kill and covet, and cannot obtain; you fight and wage war, and you do not receive, because you ask with wrong motives, so that you may spend it on your pleasures. You adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world is hatred against God? Therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
It shows that although they may imitate the speech of the teacher, they are all entirely fleshly and commit the most disgraceful acts, calling pleasures to themselves: some indeed seek a more delicate table (which Paul also argues against them saying, "For such are not serving our Lord but their own belly;") (Col. 2:1) others desire the possession of precious fields or houses: others again wish to take on a household or join one house to another: while another seeks something else, in which that evil one imposes upon them, attempting to steal their souls.
"You desire and do not have," etc. According to position and elevation, it proceeds from the position, being removed due to the absurdity. The absurdity, due to the pleasures, is expected to be the underlying cause of what is contemplated in the position. For both desire ends in the perfection of pleasures, and murder, rivalry, and similarly strife and war are not good: therefore, neither do those things follow whose cause they affect. It should be noted at this point that he speaks of murder and war not in a bodily sense: for it would be serious even to think about robbers; much less, therefore, about those who were somewhat faithful and approached the Lord. But as it seems to me, those are said to kill who, through these reckless attempts, destroy their own soul, which is why war is also against piety for them. And just as in the course of the text he calls adulterers and adulteresses, not because they are entirely such, but because they corrupt divine and rightly established precepts by turning to other illegitimate things: for no one would tolerate a whoremonger as a teacher, even if he were more entangled in filth than a pig: so he speaks of murder and wars not in a bodily sense, but concerning the soul,
"You ask and do not receive." Just as the Pharisee, of whom it is written in the Gospel according to Luke (18:11); for the more he recounted his good works, the more he blocked the divine ears, and the empty splendor of words flowed around his lips and dissolved into foam like a surging wave. But someone will say: if the promise of the Lord Jesus, who cannot be deceived, is true, in which He says: "Everyone who asks receives," (Matt. 7:8) how does the present apostle say this now? But we say that he who proceeds in the proper way and order to ask also has the complete promise, not being frustrated in anything he asks for. If, however, he seems to ask outside the scope of the given petition, not asking as he ought, he does not even ask, and therefore he will not receive. For example, if a grammar teacher promises to teach everyone who comes to him grammar, but the one who wishes to learn approaches improperly and does not direct himself towards the reception of what has been promised, then if he falls into absurdity similar to his own, will anyone justly accuse the teacher of lying? Certainly, such a person would not act wisely. Nor did the one who was to receive the discipline approach as the teacher exhorts. However, someone might say: And how or what should one ask? Listen to Him who made the promise. "Seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness." (Matt. 6:33) Therefore, it is clear that he who asks in this way, especially concerning such things, will not be disappointed in other matters, since receiving them will not fall outside of what is for his salvation. But he who asks for harmful and damaging things will not have them from Him who gives every good gift. Moreover, if one seeks divine knowledge or some spiritual gift out of pleasure, he will not receive it: for he asks wrongly, and it is for his own destruction; furthermore, God does not grant evil things at all.
"You adulterers and adulteresses! Do you not know that friendship with the world." For James had previously reproached a few false wise men who would corrupt the divine Scripture and pervert it to their own will, so that they might have a backing for their luxurious life: this arises from nothing other than arrogance and pride, and for this reason, he now proceeds more severely and uses words that are particularly strange to his own humor, calling such people adulterers and adulteresses, and by reproaching them, he brings them to shame, and using almost such accusations: Tell me, vain one: do you wish to present yourself as wise? and from where do you have that, while you continually avoid conflict and war, you are always fixated on the present and pursue the joy of this life with certainty of mind? This is not the way of the wise but of ordinary men, and those who have inclination towards the friendship of the world, and it shows you to be adulterers who prefer the vulgar, profane, and shameful over the hidden, divine, and honorable beauty, and bear hatred towards God out of affection for the present. Do you not know that the friendship of the world alienates from the friendship of God, or makes one an enemy of God? In this context, the world refers to all material and vile life, as if it were the mother of corruption, of which he who attempts to partake becomes an enemy of God. For due to a passion for the useless, he neglectfully and disdainfully regards the divine, which pertains only to those whom we hate and who are our enemies. Therefore, since there are two things that men strive for, namely God and the world, and around both of these revolve two things, friendship and hatred: if we are found to be studious of either, we seem to entirely neglect the other. However, diligence produces friendship, while negligence produces hatred. Therefore, whoever clings to the divine is a friend of God, and it is said: But whoever neglects God and is firmly attached to the things of the world should be considered among those who are the greatest enemies of God. Moreover, since this and all such evil has been shown to have originated from the arrogance of the false wisdom of the teachers, he used another argument, wishing to bring them back from such drunkenness and to free them from gluttony, and he says:
