Johnâ€™s message is that those of us who have been adopted into Christ must do the works of righteousness and not show ourselves to be lazy in that respect. However, the person who has sinned or will sin is not called wicked or a sinner merely on that account. What John is talking about here is the person who clings to evil and becomes a worker of evil on an ongoing basis.
