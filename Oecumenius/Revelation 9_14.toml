Who then is "the voice that was heard from the horns of the altar"? It says, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates." The divine Scripture calls the apostate an angel, and I say it is Satan and those who have rebelled with him. For indeed, he has been handed over to us as if they are kept "in eternal chains under darkness," (Jude 6) and as if they are condemned to the abyss of the sea.

For in the second epistle of Peter it says, "For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but cast them into chains of gloomy Tartarus, delivering them to be kept for judgment," (2 Peter 2:4) and in the epistle of Jude it refers to angels who "did not keep their own position, but left their own dwelling, in eternal chains under darkness for the judgment of the great day." (Jude 6) Indeed, the book of Job in the sea says that the apostate has been defiled in various ways by altering his form, size, and the bitterness of his character; and it also states that "he is mocked by the angels of God." (Job 41:25)

And Isaiah also cried out concerning him that "the sword of God will be brought down upon the dragon, the fleeing serpent, upon the crooked serpent; and he will destroy the dragon on that day who is in the sea." (Isa. 27:1) And the prophet, speaking about him after all creatures have passed away, adds this concerning those who are in the sea: "This dragon which you have fashioned to mock him" (Ps. 104:26); following these words, the divine prophet Ezekiel also speaks concerning the Egyptian, saying: "You are like a lion among the nations, and like a dragon in the sea, and you mingle with your rivers." (Ezek. 32:2)

No one, indeed, has transmitted a tradition to us that they were "bound in the Euphrates River", nor will they ever be released, nor will people be punished through them. For Jude, who said that they are "bound with eternal chains," forbade that they should ever be loosed; and the one who said through Isaiah that the Dragon in the sea will be destroyed on the day of judgment, declared that no one else would destroy him but that very one. And the Lord, sending forth in the Gospels those who have sinned into "the fire prepared for the Devil and his angels," (Matt. 25:41) declared that He would use them as punishers and executors of justice, and that they themselves are destined to suffer punishment. How then could one understand the previously mentioned statement that they are "bound in the river Euphrates" and that they will be released and will themselves punish the sinners? I believe that what was said is metaphorical, as if it were a law established for every vision; for I consider that it refers to the angels who are bound to the divine contemplation that spiritually delights God.

The "river" is allegorically used to represent the divine, both by Isaiah, who says, "Behold, I will turn toward them like a river of peace, and like torrents washing over the glory of nations," (Isa. 66:12) and by the prophet, who states, "The impulses of the river delight the city of God." (Ps. 46:4)

And the Lord Himself said to John, in the twentieth section concerning the Spirit, "He who believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from his belly." (Jn. 7:38-39) He says that these are those released from the vision of God, sent as punishment to the impious; for he says these are the ones who are condemned for the present day.

Then, which "four angels" does he mention? Perhaps those narrated in Scripture: Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, and Raphael.
