The divine Scriptures sometimes represents to us the apostate angel—by which I mean Satan and those who fell along with him—as having been bound in darkness by eternal chains. At other times it represents him as having been condemned to the depths of the sea. In his second letter Peter says, “For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned but cast them into Tartarus and to the pits of gloom, to be held for judgment,” and in his letter Jude said, “The angels that did not keep their own rule but left their proper dwelling, he kept in gloom by eternal chains for the judgment of the great day.” Also in the book of Job it says that the apostate was cast into the sea, in many ways speaking figuratively of the form, size and bitterness of his abode, saying also that “the angels of God make sport of him.” … But there is no tradition among us that they are bound at the river Euphrates or will ever be loosed, or that people will be punished through them. For when Jude says that they are bound by “eternal chains,” he excludes the idea that they will ever be released.… How, therefore, should someone understand the present claim that they are bound “at the river Euphrates” and that they will be released and that they themselves will punish sinners? I think that he is speaking figuratively, as is customary in visions. I think he means to say that the angels are bound to the vision of God, which gladdens the soul. For that which is divine is figuratively called a “river” by Isaiah, “Behold, I will extend peace to them like a river and the wealth of nations like an overflowing stream,” and by the prophet, “The streams of the river make glad the city of God.” And in section twenty-two of the Gospel of John, the Lord himself speaks of the Holy Spirit: “He who believes in me, as the Scripture says, rivers of living water will flow from his belly.” It says that he loosed these [angels] from the vision of God and sent them for the punishment of the wicked, for these have been set apart for the coming day. What kind of angels are these? Perhaps they are those mentioned in the Scripture—Michael, Gabriel, Uriel and Raphael. When this happens, they went out with an army of cavalry of a great, indeterminate size. This indicates the invincible power of the angels of God, whom he compares to a very large cavalry.
