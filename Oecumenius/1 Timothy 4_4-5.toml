that every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

that every creature of God is good. Paul speaks concerning things that are edible. He already anticipates the heresy of those introducing uncreated matter and said that those were foods.

and nothing is to be rejected. Therefore, neither should the idol's food be rejected, provided it is taken with prayer, if you are unaware: since by law you become guilty who are commanded not to be defiled by the food of idols; therefore, by transgressing the law, one is defiled: just as even what is entirely pure, and taken without thanksgiving, becomes defiled because of your voluntary ingratitude.

For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. If it is sanctified, then is it unclean? Far from it! For everything is clean; but here two points are made against those who say that some foods are unclean. First, that every creature of God is good, and nothing is unclean. But if anyone considers something to be unclean, there is also such a thing as medicine [φάρμακον], he says. For it is sanctified by the word of God, that is, by prayer. Moreover, it is stated earlier: For it is by the word and prayer made to God that it is sanctified.
