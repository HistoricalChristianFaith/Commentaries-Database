To show that God alone possesses perfect sinlessness, he says, “I have this against you.” And what do I have [against you]? “That you have the woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess,” and you do not throw her out. For in the person of Jezebel, the wife of Ahab, he sees a paradigm for the wickedness of that woman who lived at that time. And she, he says, “who calls herself a prophetess, teaches and deceives” many to commit fornication and to eat food sacrificed to idols. He refers either to physical fornication or to that apostasy from God of which it is said, “And they committed fornication in their works,” and again, “They committed adultery with wood.” But the Lord does not wish the death of a sinner but rather his conversion and life, and so he says that he gave to her an opportunity for repentance. But if she does not wish to repent, he says, I will do such and such to her and to those who commit adultery with her, so that all might know that it is I who am God—for it is the prerogative of God to search minds and the hearts. For it is said, “It is God who searches the heart and mind.” But, indeed, to those who have nothing in common with that adulterous woman, that is, those who are more simple and do not know the deceitful crafts of the evil one—for this is what you say—upon you I will place no greater burden, for your simplicity suffices. Only hold fast the teaching which has been handed over to you until my second coming.
