He says he was clothed with a garment sprinkled with blood; for in the vision the Lord also bore the symbols of the Passion and showed the all-holy body stained only with his precious blood.

And his name is called the Word of God. Do you see how, fleeing the divine name in the heavens above, the vision has now set a nominative in its place, saying "the Word of God"?
