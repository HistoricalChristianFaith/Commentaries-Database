Reject foolish and ignorant questions, knowing that they generate arguments. A servant of the Lord must not argue but be gentle to all, able to teach, patient.

but be gentle to all. If one ought to be gentle and mild, how did he say elsewhere: "Rebuke them sharply," (Titus 1:13) and: "Let not the youth be despised"? (1 Tim. 4:12) Because it happens that one can rebuke sharply with mildness, and rashly and severely.

able to teach, that is, to those who desire to learn. Furthermore, flee from a heretical man after one or two warnings.

patient. For indeed, boldness is fierce, but gentleness knows how to persuade. For who would be persuaded by the bold one, who is often opposed even by the one advising? How then does Paul say elsewhere, after the first and second admonition, to avoid heretics? For see, having said this here as well, he designated the heretics as those challenging. And we say that those confessed and incurably ill must be avoided. But those concerning whom the matter was doubtful, and it is clear from what was said, "that God may grant them repentance." For the phrase "may" is a custom for us to speak about the uncertain.
