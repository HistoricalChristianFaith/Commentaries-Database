Listen, my beloved brothers: has not God chosen the poor of this world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which He has promised to those who love Him? But you have despised the poor. Do not the rich oppress you and drag you into the courts? Do they not blaspheme that good name by which you are called? If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you do well. But if you show partiality, you commit sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
Since poverty is a serious matter for many, when James said, "the poor of this world," he immediately added, "rich." But in what way are they rich? In faith and concerning faith. For so it is. Indeed, when the poor are not distracted by worldly things, once they come to faith, they become more diligent and more devoted to labor than the rich. Therefore, the Lord also chose such disciples, whom he declared to be heirs of the kingdom.
"They blaspheme the good name." A good name is a new name according to the prophet saying: "To those who serve me, a new name will be called, which will be blessed over all the face of the earth." (Isa. 62:2) “According to Scripture." Deuteronomy says.
