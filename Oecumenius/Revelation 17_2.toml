With them he says "the kings of the earth committed fornication." And these are the ones who reigned over them; for these are the kings of the earth who have shared in her fornication and idolatry.

"And", he says, "the inhabitants of the earth were made drunk with the wine of her fornication"; and indeed the rest, over whom she was mistress, have also apostatized from God, some controlled by her, others led by her.
