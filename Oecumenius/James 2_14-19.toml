What shall it profit my brethren, if a man say he has faith: but has not works? Shall faith be able to save him? And if a brother or sister be naked, and lack daily food: and one of you say to them, Go in peace, be warmed and filled: but you give them not the things that are necessary for the body: what shall it profit? So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself. But some man says, You have faith, and I have works: show me your faith without works: and I will show you by works my faith. You believe that there is one God. You do well: the demons also believe and tremble.
Notice the spiritual understanding. For James did not only say: If you have faith, but also: What is the benefit? As if he were saying: Show me the work from which I can judge that this title suits you: for that is the benefit of faith.
“So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself.” These things are not opposed to blessed Paul, since the name faith is applied to two meanings. (Rom. 4:1) For we often say that faith is a simple approval, according to that which we also know the demons believed, that the Son of God was Christ. (Matt. 4:3; Luke 4:1) And again, when we call the consequence proceeding from affection with firm acceptance the name of faith; indeed, James says that simple acceptance is a dead faith and devoid of living works; however, Paul says that it is that which is from affection and is in no way lacking in deeds: for it could not arise without honorable deeds. Indeed, Abraham did not attain this unless a contest was first held, by which he would be expelled from his paternal kinship, for which contest faith was declared as the reward: but Paul placed this before works, namely the observance of the Sabbaths according to the law, circumcision, and other purifications. Indeed, two meanings are also seen in works. For certain works are said to confirm faith, without which faith is dead. And again, works are said to be those of the law, without which both Abraham and all who follow Christ are justified. For who would deny that it is true that faith would in no way approach the impure? But I speak of true faith. For neither would an ointment be stored in a vessel that was full of mud, nor would faith be imparted by God to an impure man. Therefore, the holy apostles are not contradictory, but each, operating in a different meaning, directs and leads to the use of its own meaning that is proposed to it.
