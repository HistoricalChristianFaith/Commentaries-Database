As if he said: Strive to have the Spirit abiding in you, and do not cast it away through bad conduct, and you will guard the deposit. "For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain; unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain." (Psalm 127:1)

Disadvantages of the transmission of divine dogmas.
