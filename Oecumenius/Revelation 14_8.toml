By “Babylon” he is referring to the confusion and arbitrarily random trials of the present life—for confusion is the meaning of Babylon—and to the manic stupefaction of those who worship idols. And the city is magnified with names, being called by them the “inspired” city. But were you to consider the physical Babylon itself, you would not fall down before the sight before you. By the “wine of the wrath of her fornication” he refers to [the city’s] apostasy from God, as it is written, “You have destroyed every one that goes a whoring from you.” Such fornication entails a darkness of the mature reason, for who, possessing a sound mind, would choose to worship wood and stones and call forth the wrath of God? Therefore, concerning this wine it is said, “Their wine is the wrath of serpents and the incurable wrath of asps.” Babylon itself at first drank of this deadly wine, and then it compelled all the nations that it ruled to drink.
