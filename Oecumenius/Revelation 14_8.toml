I suppose Babylon to mean the confusion of present life and the vain temptation; for Babylon is interpreted as confusion and the frenzy of idolaters. And it is made majestic by names, called by them enthusiasm. But if you even perceive Babylon as sensible, you would not stray from the present aim.

And the wine, he says, of the wrath of her fornication, apostasy from God according to the written word: "you have destroyed all who commit fornication from you," (Ps. 72:27) which fornication brings darkness to the nature of reason; for who of a sound mind would choose to worship with wood and stones, and to call the spirit away from God? About this matter was the wine spoken of, "the wine being the wrath of dragons; and the wrath of asps is incurable." (Deut. 32:33) This Babylon first drank of the deadly wine herself, and thereafter all the nations whom she ruled she compelled to drink.
