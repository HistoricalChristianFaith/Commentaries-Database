In the opening words, it is fitting to point out that in all his writings, the divine John, having dwelt upon the God-inspired words of our Savior Jesus Christ, in the present work dwells rather on his human aspects, so that he might not only be recognized from the more divine qualities, but also from the human ones.

For it is a sample of pure theology, just as to believe that the divine Word is from God and the Father, begotten before all ages and times, uncreated and consubstantial with the Father and the Spirit, and coexistent with the ages, and of all creation both spiritual and perceptible, according to what is said by the wisest Paul in the Epistle to the Colossians, that "in Him all things in heaven and on earth were created, the invisible and the visible, whether thrones, dominions, principalities, or authorities; all things were created through Him and for Him, and He is the head of the body and the church." (Co. 1:18) "Who is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He might be first in all things," (Co. 1:16,18) therefore we must believe in Him for the last things and for our salvation.

And having become man, not by a change of divinity, but by the assumption of human flesh, endowed with a rational soul, so that Emmanuel is understood as united from two natures, both divinity and humanity, each fully possessing according to its own nature and proper quality and distinction, neither confused in the union into one, nor divided after the indescribable and invisible union. For both Nestorius and Eutyches are equally detestable; their positions are opposed and totally evil.

Therefore, in order that the teaching of our Savior might be precise and true to Him, having engaged in the other divine matters, as the Lord has said, here John employed words and thoughts suited to human beings; yet neither in those divine matters did he separate the divine from the human, nor here did he separate the human from the divine. Moreover, he used the writings to a greater or lesser extent.

From this point on, the revelation is given to him to speak; it is given from the Father to the Son, and it is given from the Son to us, his servants. Calling the saints the servants of Christ, He preserved for Him what is fitting for God. For whose servants would humans be, except for the Maker and Creator of humans? And who is the Creator of humans and all creation? No one except the only-begotten Word and Son of God. For he who is present as the author says in the Gospels, "all things were made through him." (Jn. 1:3)

What, then, does John wish to add what must soon take place? And yet, of the things that are to come, not yet accomplished, already a considerable amount of time has already passed since these things were spoken, more than five hundred years. That all ages are regarded as nothing in the eyes of the eternal and everlasting God; "for a thousand years," the prophet says, "are in Your sight, O Lord, as the day that has just passed, or as a watch in the night." (Ps. 89:4) Therefore, the swift passage of time is not measured by the completion of the years that have come to be, but rather by the power and eternity of God. For in truth, every extension of time, even if it is the greatest and longest, is considered small compared to the infinite.

Jesus Christ therefore made it known to me what must take place. Jesus did not appear Himself and speak, but through His angel He initiated me into the mysteries. You see the reverent love of this divine one, who confessed that it was revealed to him through an angel and that he did not hear it from the Lord's own mouth.

John says that he testifies to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw. In this form, he also used it in the Gospels, preserving for himself the credibility of his teaching. He said, "This is the one who testifies about these things," (Jn. 21:24) and having written these things; and we know that his testimony is true. And now he says he is a witness of the divine Word that was revealed to him. John speaks of the present Revelation and the testimony given by Christ; that is, through testimony, I am both a witness and an author.
