“I know your works and your love and your faith and your service.” This is as though he said, “I praise you for your total devotion.” He says, “I know,” rather than “I praise,” since he had said to Moses, “I know you beyond all men,” and “the Lord knows the path of the righteous.” By “service” he means the succor which one gives to those in need. “And your latter works are more than the first.” This shows that as they progressed, they improved in their obedience to the commandments.
