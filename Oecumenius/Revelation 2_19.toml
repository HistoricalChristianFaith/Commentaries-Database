quote='''
He said, I know your works, your love and faith and service, just as he said, I praise all your efforts. For he puts "I know," instead of, "I praise," like, "I know you to be spoken of among all men" to Moses, (Ex. 33:12) and "the Lord knows the way of the righteous." (Ps. 1:6) And he says that service is assistance to those in need.

And he says that your latter works exceed the first; it shows that as they went on, they themselves became greater in fulfilling the commandments.
