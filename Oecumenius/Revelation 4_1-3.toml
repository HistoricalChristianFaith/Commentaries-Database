It is not that there is in heaven a door that is being shut and opened from time to time, but this is how it was shown to the evangelist so that he might see the things above the heavens. For when any door is opened, the things inside are necessarily observed. 

He says, And I heard a voice, which sounded like a trumpet and said to me: Come up here, he says, so that you may see the things which are going to take place. 

And I went up in the Spirit—for the way up was neither bodily nor perceptible—and, he says, I see a throne, and God and a Spirit on it like jasper and carnelian. God is certainly not like these, nor like any perceptible thing, or like a body at all; he is invisible, incorporeal, and without form, whose invisible nature the seraphim indicate as they cover their faces with their wings. God, too, when he spoke to Moses said, Nobody shall see “my face and live.” But also the evangelist himself denies this possibility, saying, “no one has ever yet seen God.” Therefore, God was not seen to be like anything, but it was from the acts of God that the vision was depicted in the Revelation. 

For jasper—which is a precious stone—looks like emerald and is green, resembling an asp’s poison, from which it also derives its name. Carnelian is another precious stone, fiery bright and blood-red. 

Jasper signifies for us God’s ability to give life and to provide for our needs, since every nourishment of human beings and four-footed animals and birds and reptiles has its source, and thus its cause, originating from green plants. For the prophet says, “He causes grass to grow for the cattle, and green plants for the service of men, so as to bring food from the earth. And wine cheers a man’s heart, making glad his face with oil.” And again, in creating the world, God says, “Let the earth put forth vegetation, seed yielding seed according to its kind.” 

So jasper connotes these things. But by carnelian he describes the awe of God. “For our God is a devouring fire,” says the hierophant Moses. And the prophet, too, says of God, “You are awesome, and who can stand before you?” In agreement with this, the wise apostle writes, “It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” 

For since the goodness of God is pure, and therefore at variance with those who love sin and despise him, it does not lead them to repentance but to fearlessness in committing sin. So God is rightly depicted as awesome, as well as being good and beneficent. Wherefore Paul, knowing that the disposition of those under instruction needs goads, and not only gentleness, wrote to the Corinthians, saying, “What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love and in a spirit of gentleness?” And one of the saints also exclaimed, “Gehenna does not terrify you. The kingdom of heaven does not persuade you; we are talking to a heart of stone.” In this way the awesomeness of God and his readiness to punish was found useful to those undergoing discipline. 

But carnelian is not the first with God; jasper is the first. For his nature is goodness itself, kindness, and gentleness, and he wishes to be our father rather than our tyrant. But, if it is permissible to say so, it is we who compel him to be awesome and ready to punish, so that he often puts aside his natural gentleness, and is driven to unnatural severity. 

He says, And round his throne was a rainbow in appearance like an emerald: the visible rainbow, which the divine Scripture calls a bow of God, which is caused by the reflection of the sun’s light when it is intercepted and impeded by a thick cloud, has a variegated color of all kinds. That spiritual rainbow, however, circling the divine throne, was of a single color, for it was like an emerald. 

It indicates all the holy and ministering spirits around God, wherefore he has called it a rainbow, even though it has a single color, so that from the variegated colors of the rainbow we may obtain an idea of the numerous ranks and differences of the divine angels. Yet all things are aglow with one color. For all are alike beneficial and bear an imitation of their own master, with the emerald color bearing witness to the [angels’] providential beneficence, just as the color of jasper bears witness to God’s providence. 

Perhaps a reader may be troubled by something here: Why is it that while the holy ranks of the incorporeal beings around God are compared to the more precious stone of the emerald, God himself is compared to the less precious, jasper and carnelian? The reason is that the account is now concerned not with the value of the objects seen but with the meaning of the colors. If anyone should meanly look for value, there is not a single thing with which God may be compared. 

Nor should anyone complain that the Lord is compared to a stone, for Isaiah says about the Lord, “See, I am laying in Zion a corner-stone.” And the prophet says about him, “The stone which the builders rejected.” The wicked ranks of demons are described allegorically as mountains: for David himself said that “mountains were being changed, in the heart of the sea, and mountains were stirred up by his mighty power.” They are of such a size that it is not even possible to discover their height.
