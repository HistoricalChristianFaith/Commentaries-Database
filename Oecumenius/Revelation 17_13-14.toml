Although these future ten kings have no agreement among themselves, yet they are of one mind in this, that they give their power and authority to the beast, that is, to the antichrist. For they will be defeated by him, and he alone will finally rule over all things. Although they will be defeated against their will, it is said nonetheless that they have one mind, since the ten suffer the same experience of defeat and ruin. It is as though he had said, “The ten agreed and consented to be defeated by the antichrist.” “These will make war on the Lamb,” it says. For before they are wholly destroyed by the antichrist, these kings, about whom the passage is speaking, will persecute the church. However, Christ will triumph, for he will hand these evil men over to the yet more evil antichrist for death. And Christ will triumph in another way also, since his servants struggle unto death for their faith in him. For it says, “they are called and chosen and faithful,” that is, the servants of Christ.
