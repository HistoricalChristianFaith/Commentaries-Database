The smoke of the divine anger is a sign, for it is written, “Smoke went up in his wrath.” This fiery smoke is symbolic, but so was the smoke that the holy Isaiah saw when he said, “and the lintel shook at the voice which the holy seraphim uttered, and the house was filled with smoke.” That smoke revealed the wrath of God against [the temple] of Jerusalem. He speaks periphrastically when he says that the smoke was from the glory of God and from his power. It is as though he said, “It was filled with smoke from the wrath of God,” for God is himself power and himself glory, and who can withstand his wrath? [No one could enter the temple], for who will confront the wrath of God, or who will live when enveloped by it? For if no one has “stood in the counsel of the Lord,” as it is written, one could hardly be able to endure the wrath of God.
