"Concerning this Christ, there is much to say and it is hard to explain." He says it is because of you, that you are sluggish, and you do not grasp the more perfect things about Him. For having spoken so many humble things about the incarnation, he wished to move on to the divine matters. Therefore, because of your cause, he says, that you are sluggish and do not allow for the perfect things, the word concerning how Christ is a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek is hard to explain. And because you do not understand, for this reason I am not able to interpret it well.
"since you have become sluggish." Trials and tribulations, he says, have made you sluggish, and you are not able to listen perfectly to the words.
"For although you ought to be teachers." He brings forth the accusation with praise. For you are sluggish and careless, he says, although you should also teach others according to the reason of the time. Thus, it shows that they had believed a long time ago,and have heard mysteries; both of these things are worthy of praise, provided they themselves have not been careless. Time, he says, makes people stronger; but you have used this in vain, having been set free.
“since you have become sluggish in hearing.” The trials and tribulations, he says, have made you sluggish, and you are not able to listen to perfect words. “For although you ought to be teachers by this time.” Then he brings the accusation with praise. For he says you are dull and lazy, though you ought to be teaching others by now because of the length of time. Thus he shows that they had trusted much and had heard the mysteries; both of these things are worthy of praise if they themselves had not become lazy. Time, he says, makes stronger; but you have wasted this opportunity after being set free. For though you ought to be teachers, you are not only not teachers, but you are also unable to learn anything except the elementary, humble, and simple things; and even these not simply, but the weaker still, the elements of the beginning of the words of God. He does not say the elements of words, but the elements of the beginning of words. The elements of the words of God would reasonably be the words concerning the incarnation; but the elements of the beginning of words, which he goes on to say, are: "Not again a foundation," and so forth.
For you are indeed ought to be teachers, not only are you not teachers, but you are also unable to learn, unless it be the most elementary, humble, and simplest things.
And these not simply, but he who is still weaker, the basic principles of the oracles of God. He does not say the oracles, but the basic principles of the oracles of God. And if there are basic principles of the oracles of God, those concerning the incarnation. But the basic principles of the oracles, which he says, "You need again a foundation," and so forth. "You need again to be taught something." What to teach? The principles, he says. "The basic principles." The basic principles, he speaks of the incarnation.but the elements of the beginning of words, which he goes on to say, are: "Not again a foundation," and so forth.
For just as we first learn the letters in writing, so also with divine oracles it was necessary to first teach about the incarnation. For these are suitable for the unbelieving and still infant ears. As for philosophizing about the divinity of Christ, it was therefore complete. Do you see the reason why it accommodates the humble? Because of the weakness of the listeners, who are not strong enough to receive the perfect things. Therefore, even at the beginning of the Epistle, having briefly philosophized about the divinity of Christ, he immediately ceased his discourse. The Epistle is indeed filled with the humble.

Basic principles of the oracles of God, he called the humbler sayings about Christ. For those who have not yet attained perfect faith, the only things offered were about humanity, the preachers of the truth. Thus, the blessed Peter measured his teaching to the weakness of the listeners while speaking to the Jews. "Jesus," he said, "the Nazarene, a man approved by God among you." (Acts 2:22) And the following things happened according to this account. And the divine Paul, offering the proclamation to the Athenians, did not call Christ God, but a man, the master. (Acts 17:31)

"And you have become in need." He did not say that you have a need, but that you yourselves have become such, that is, you have made yourselves so out of laziness, not being such by nature.
"Of milk and not solid food." He refers to the humble sayings about Christ as milk, those concerning the flesh; but solid food refers to the perfect ones concerning his divinity.
To those who are still infants, faith is seen in humble words, (for milk is suitable for infants), but to the perfect, faith is in solid food and the high thinking concerning Christ.
"For everyone who lives on milk." For everyone, he says, who partakes of humble words, concerning the humanity of the Lord, (for these are the milk), is unskilled and lacks the word of righteousness.
And he speaks of the word of righteousness, which concerns the divinity of the Lord. "solid food." The lofty word, and the high doctrines concerning Christ.
"by constant practice." He refers to habit, perfection, the well-trained, having their senses exercised, such as hearing, tongue, eyes. Indeed, he speaks of the senses of the soul.
To distinguish, he says, what is good, and high doctrines, and what are the spurious and corrupt. He hints at those who teach anything to everyone, giving themselves and being persuaded. For he who receives everything simply, has indiscriminately both good and evil.
