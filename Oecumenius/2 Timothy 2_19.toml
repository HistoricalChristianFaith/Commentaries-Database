Yet the solid foundation of God stands firm, having this seal: The Lord knows those who are His. And, let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.

Yet the solid foundation. Indeed, the faith of the weak is subverted; "a solid foundation", however, stands (referring to the faithful who cannot be overthrown), having this mark and sign:

The Lord knows those who are His. Once indeed they were foreknown as wholly devoted to God and unchangeable. For the sign that they are known by God is that they could not be overthrown by wickedness so as to depart from the faith.

depart from iniquity. Here is another indication: namely, let everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord depart from iniquity, that is, from the error of doctrines, as it is proper to call upon His name. For those who, like certain living columns, remain immovable, bear these inscriptions in their works.
