The elder, to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who have known the truth: because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever: grace, mercy, and peace will be with you from God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth and love.
Some have thought that this Epistle and the one that follows are not from John the Beloved, but from another who had the same name: because in these he writes of himself as an elder, and to a lady, and to another Gaius, and he writes of one just as he does of the lady; which does not happen in a Catholic Epistle. Furthermore, he did not make a title according to the previous epistle: for he did not begin it in that way. But we say that in the former he did not propose in that manner, because he did not write to a specific person, nor to the Church of certain places: just as blessed Peter did, clearly signifying that he was writing to the Jews who were dispersed; and before him, the holy James clearly defining that he was writing to the twelve tribes of the Jews: but addressing all the faithful in common, whether gathered or not gathered, He omitted the type of the pre-written text.
However, John writes of himself as an elder, and not as an apostle or servant of Jesus Christ, as the other apostles do. Indeed, he does not write of himself as an apostle, perhaps because he did not preach the Gospel first in Asia, but after Paul; nor did he travel around, like him, who was going through the circuit of the Gospel: but remaining there, he was present and explained the message to those present. Nor does he call himself a servant of Jesus Christ; for he was confident, because he was greatly loved, that he was free from the fear of servitude. He only wished to call himself an elder: either because he was already old when he wrote these things (for that is what an elder means) or even calling himself a bishop by the name of elder, since at that time the name elder was commonly used also for bishops: as is evident from the Acts (20:17) written by blessed Luke, and from the Epistle of Peter (5:2).
Moreover, John was not afraid to write to a faithful lady: because in Christ Jesus there is neither male nor female. (Gal. 3:28) However, writing to one Gaius, he has Paul who also wrote to Titus and Timothy, indeed even to Philemon, a common man (ἰδιώτην). And indeed, this is about the title. It is shown also from the announcement and promise and from the remaining arrangement of the discourse, that these letters are genuine: since in these John frequently repeats the discourse, saying the same things about the same matters whenever a slight occasion arises, and this way confirms the discourse. Moreover, he testifies two things to this elect lady: one indeed that she walks in truth, the other that she avoids heretics. He indeed calls her elect, either by name or from great imitation concerning virtue: whom John also says he loves in truth: not only her alone, but also all who are of similar morals with her, who truly have a firm truth within themselves: for this is signified by saying: that abides in us; this, however, is faith in Christ.
In fact, to love her in the truth; just as John himself indicated in the previous letter regarding certain corrupted believers. But where he said: "what abides in us," that is, what is true and firm, he added: "And it will be with us forever." (1 Jn. 3:24) Signifying the certain perseverance of the gift. For it happens that even those who have been confirmed in something are shaken again, because they have not rightly used the confirmation. Again, after these things, he adds: "Grace and mercy will be with us:" designating the goods that arise from perfect love.
Speaking of God the Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ, John adds, "the Son of the Father:" for only here is He properly the Father. Therefore, Paul also says, "From whom," he says, "every family in heaven and on earth is named."(Eph. 3:15)
He further adds: "in truth and love," bringing firmness to the discourse, and a certain indication of the love that he speaks of.
