I think that this angel has been appointed for the punishment of the ungodly. Therefore, he says, “Put in [the sickle] and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth.” The harvest mentioned above described the righteous and the sinners being brought to completion together. Their separation will be accomplished through “the winnowing fork of the Lord, by which he will clear his threshing floor and gather the wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire,” according to the words of the Gospels. However, this vintage of the clusters of grapes refers especially to the serious transgressors, for the vision depicts them lifelike as drunken and deranged. It is clear from the passage that their Lord did not regard them as worthy to be gathered in as were the first ones. Rather, a certain angel casts them immediately outside “into the winepress of the wrath of God,” since they were thought worthy for neither a defense nor an interrogation. They come straightway to judgment, just as sinners are prosecuted in the Gospels, for whom exclusion and banishment become an occasion for punishment. I think that the prophet spoke of these persons when he said, “The wicked will not stand in the judgment.”
