And another, it is said, an angel from the altar who had power over fire. And this, I understand, is appointed for the punishment of the ungodly.

Then he says, send and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth. Now the previously mentioned (Rev. 14:15) harvest represents the righteous and the sinners being gathered together at the same time, whose separation "the Lord's winnowing fan will make, who will thoroughly cleanse his threshing floor; and he will gather the wheat into the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire," as is said in the Gospels. (Matt. 3:12; Luke 9:17) But the vintage of the grapes plainly signifies the very lawless ones, from their drunkenness and the madness of the vision depicting them; and it is clear from these that neither the Lord deems them worthy to be gathered as the former, but some of the angels, and they are immediately cast out into the winepress of the wrath of God, not being granted defense nor asked, nor brought to judgment, as sinners also are introduced in the Gospels (Matt. 25:46; Luke 16:19-31), for whom the inexhaustible and unshared cause has become the reason of punishment. Concerning these things I think the prophet says that "the wicked shall not be raised in judgment." (Ps. 1:5) He has appropriately called the punishment a winepress by the metaphor of grapes and the harvest.
