Either he calls an earthquake the shaking of the earth, since this too is contained among the signs of the end (Luke 21:11), or he calls an earthquake the transformation of things seen, according to what is said to the Haggai: "once more I will shake not only the heaven but also the earth and the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all the nations."
