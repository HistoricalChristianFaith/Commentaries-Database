By kings and great men and generals and rich and strong he refers to those sinful demons who tyrannize those on the earth through deceit and guile, and he calls “servants” and “freemen” those among the demons who are of inferior and superior status. That they seek to hide themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains and nevertheless also say “fall upon us and hide us,” all of this is spoken figuratively, indicating that they are fugitives who are attempting to escape from the punishment of Christ that is coming upon them. For were there not a certain invisible punishment and retribution coming upon them, what would be the meaning of that spoken by the prophet Isaiah in the person of Christ: “I have trodden the winepress utterly alone, and from the peoples there was none with me, and I have trod them in my anger and trampled them in my wrath, and I have poured out their blood upon the earth,” and what would be the meaning of that spoken by the demons, hated of God, according to Matthew: “What do you have to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come to torment us?” Someone might think that these things reported in the Revelation were not only concerning the sufferings of the demons but also of those lawless Jews who nailed the Lord to the cross and who, accosted by the war with the Romans, became fugitives in the mountains and the caves and the crevices of the earth and from every direction were hemmed in by difficulty and strife.
