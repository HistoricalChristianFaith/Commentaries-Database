In which I suffer hardship even to imprisonment as a criminal, but the word of God is not imprisoned. Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain salvation, which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.

in which I suffer hardship. The afflictions of Paul reveal the truth of the Gospel.

even to imprisonment as a criminal. For who, indeed, would choose to suffer such things unless preaching the truth, and about whom he would not be made altogether more certain?

but the word of God is not imprisoned. And if I, Paul says, am imprisoned, the preaching is not imprisoned at the same time, but it goes about. For the tongue speaks with imprisoned hands. Indeed, the only prison of the tongue is fear and unbelief. This, however, he also says to the exhortation of those who were free. For if I who am imprisoned preach, what pardon can be given to those who are free and yet neglect?

for the sake of the elect. For the sake of the faithful, Paul says, whom God has chosen: for since God chose them, I must suffer everything for them, because God also suffered for us, and indeed there is some kind of repentance and reward: so that they also, just as we, he says, may obtain salvation. And as if he were saying: Certainly, I could live far from dangers, if I only cared for myself; but I suffer these things for the good of others, so that they may obtain salvation.

which is in Christ Jesus. Someone might say: If you yourself cannot obtain salvation, but behold, you are about to die, how will you secure salvation for others? Paul replied: I am not speaking of this earthly life, but of that which is in Christ Jesus, that is, what is given through Christ, what is eternal, what is future with glory. For the salvation of the world has no glory.

On faith in Christ, and tolerance for the hope of life.
