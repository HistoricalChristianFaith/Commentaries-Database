“In many times and in various ways.” God spoke in various and diverse manners through the prophets of old; but to us, he has spoken through the Son. Therefore, we have a great difference compared to our forefathers. For since they suffered evils, they did not think that they were so cared for by God as their forefathers; therefore, it shows that they are more cared for than those. For to those he sent prophets; but to us, he sent his Son.
"but in these last days." He comforts those worn out by adverse circumstances, saying: in the last. For, he says, the end is near; and for some, rest from pains, and for others, the beginning of rewards.
"He has spoken to us by His Son." He did not say, "He spoke to us in Christ," that is, through Christ; (for they were still weaker concerning Christ.) But, "by His Son," that is, through the Son.
"whom He made heir of all things." He says, "He made him heir and Lord of the whole world." The term "he made" is appropriate for the incarnation.

Who made him heir? Over whom? Over all things. Of all who approach the immortal and divine nature.Indeed, the Son is the heir and participant of the Father's substance [οὐσίας], wealth, and power. Then, when he said that the Son is the heir of the Father's possessions, he also explains how. Through him, he says, the ages were created: that is, the ages are the common works of him and the Father. But if the ages are the mutual work of the Father and the Son, then those things which are in the ages are certainly mutual to the Father and the Son. And if those things which are in the ages, much more those things which are after the ages, namely the world and those things which are in it.
Then, lest you think that the heir is not called an heir by nature, but by a certain grace and adoption, Paul adds: “He is the radiance of His glory,” saying practically: Although I have said that the Father appointed him as heir, understand that nothing humble or unworthy of God is implied. For it is not said that the heir is to be made by the act of adoption and that he is to be considered as such, but rather it is a declaration of the relationship of the Son to the Father as a cause according to nature of reference and consent: and lest you think the Son exists without a principle, alienating him from the paternal kinship, and imply two principles separated from each other. Indeed, for this very reason he was also called by me heir, so that you may immediately understand from whom the inheritance descends, nor may you suspect him to be unbegotten like the Father: for this reason it was said by me, Heir, and, He appointed. Therefore, I immediately added: Who, being the radiance.
But if it is not established that there was or would be radiance (for Paul says: when there was radiance), nor is the heir truly appointed, but only in the way I mentioned above. But see how significantly and precisely he has spoken, when he says Radiance, having said a representation, and being, and of the glory. For by radiance, he reveals the natural progression [πρόοδον] of the Son from the Father.
Indeed, the radiance of anyone never proceeds entirely through grace or adoption, neither from the sun, nor from fire, nor from any other source from which radiance is usually derived. However, by saying "he is," he shows that this is not something newly made for him to be radiance, but that it has always been from eternity.
For who is [ὤν], since He does not have a recent existence but is from eternity and always is. Then also the divine attribute is presented through who is. For thus also the Father says, "I am the the One who is [Ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὢν]," speaking to Moses (Ex. 3:14).
Therefore, there are testimonies to demonstrate both the natural progression of the Son from the Father and the consubstantiality [ὁμοούσιον], and coeternal [συναΐδιον], as well as what he says: "The Radiance," and what he states: "who is." Indeed, he also adds "of his Glory," so that you may say: "His radiance is the Son," which is most honorable, and it comes from nature, and there is nothing greater in the Father.
You see how and whose heir the Son is? Then, explaining more clearly what has been said, Paul adds: "and the exact representation of His being." That is, having embraced the essence and substance in Himself, God is of infinite authority, omnipotent, Creator, and whatever else expresses the being of the Father, besides being the Father, all these things are the Son: therefore, He encompasses and sustains all things by His powerful word, and governs them.
Do you know how he is truly the heir and sustains all that belongs to the Father? Afterwards, when Paul spoke of the divine and supernatural about the Son, he also transitions to the rest: which are most admirable and no less supernatural, yet by hearing they seem humble and lowly, for example, death and killing! But…………………………………………………….
"through whom also He made the ages.” Where are those who say, “when the Son was not”? For the Creator of the ages is not subject to time. But since the Father is the cause of the Son, it is fitting that He is also the cause of those things that came into being through Him. Therefore he says: through whom. For the Father seems to act when He begets the Son who has done these things.
"He is." It is called a radiance, indicating the manner in which it originates from the Father, as if in some way it is an outward procession, neither entirely freed from the source of its existence, nor entirely constituted, but rather emerging, as if to stand by itself, and to have its own existence. Thus, the holy Cyril in the fifth book On the Trinity. The manifestation of the consubstantial and coeternal, as light from light. The character, as the likeness of the glory, is the Son of the Father. For the Son of the Father is similar and unchangeable, and as if into a character in different being [ὑποστάσεσι].
"sustaining all things." As if carrying the invisible and the visible in the word, bearing and governing. And he said word [Ῥῆμα], showing that he easily leads and carries all things.
