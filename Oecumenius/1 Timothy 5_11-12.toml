But refuse younger widows; for when they have indulged themselves against Christ, they desire to marry, having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith.

But refuse younger widows. Therefore, when the struggle becomes greater among virgins, nowhere does it seem to express the observation of time? Because they have come to this point from a greater fervor of faith, indeed a certain necessity follows which solitude brings. Or because, also speaking about virgins, that it should be constant and careful for those who belong to the Lord (1 Cor. 7:32), great diligence was applied.

for when they have indulged themselves against Christ. Perhaps there were some who had acted this way. But see that truly widows are also joined to Christ: however, those who are joined to him are placed in the order of virgins. "For I betrothed you, he says, to one husband, pure virgin, to present you to Christ." (2 Cor. 11:2) And these things are fitting for every Church. But what does it mean, "when they have indulged themselves against"? it means, when they become foolish, when they become pampered, that is, when they become arrogant, when they become proud over Christ, not accepting Him as a bridegroom, then they fall away into marriage. For they did not choose widowhood with a judgment of reason.

Because they have abandoned the first faith. Paul speaks of the covenant with Christ. For they agreed to be joined to Christ: but they reject Him and turn to earthly marriages. After this, indeed, they fall into another sin, namely idleness. Therefore, he ordered not only men to work, but also women. For every evil arises from idleness.
