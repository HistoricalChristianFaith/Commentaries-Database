And the city, it says, lies foursquare, and its length, its breadth, and its height are equal. The foursquare shape, as it seems to those skilled in these matters, is and is called a cube; for there is also a plane square; but when it is both square and equilateral in all dimensions, they say the cube signifies stability; for the good things of the saints are permanent and unchangeable, with no transformation corrupting their blessedness. The greatness of the city reveals both the magnificence of the saints and that, even if they are far surpassed in number by the sinners, nevertheless they themselves are not few in number, but are such as to fill so great a city.
