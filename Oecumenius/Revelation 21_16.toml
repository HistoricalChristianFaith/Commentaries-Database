The foursquare shape is called by the experts a cube. It is a flat surface of four corners, and when it is foursquare and equal in all of its dimensions, they say that the cube exhibits great stability. For the blessings of the saints are permanent and unchangeable, since there is no change to corrupt their bliss. The grandeur of the city and the magnificence of the saints signify that although they are considerably less in number than are the sinners, they are not so small in number as not to fill such a city.
