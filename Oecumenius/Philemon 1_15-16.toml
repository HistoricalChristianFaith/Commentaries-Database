Since Onesimus has changed his mind from being a wicked one, he himself turns it to the doubtful, as if he said: For perhaps he fled for reasons of caution.

"for this reason he was separated". With a euphemistic name, Paul called it separation, so that the memory of the separation would not provoke the master. Then he also limits the time, calming the anger, or he speaks in terms of a season of the year.

"so that you might have him back forever", you have, that is, you receive.

"But more than a slave". Do you see that escaping brought many benefits? For instead of an hour of escape, you have an eternal one. (For the escape is but one hour compared to eternity.) And instead of a worthless slave, you have received "a beloved brother".

"how much more to you". If to me, much more to you, even in worldly services. For this is "in the flesh." And in spiritual matters. For this is "in the Lord."
