Since all were vanquished and placed under his feet, “he was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words.” By whom was it given? By those persons who had been deceived and had come to worship him. For such boasting comes from arrogance. And what is more haughty than saying, “I will ascend to heaven; I will set my throne above the stars of heaven”? And a little further down: “I will make myself like the Most High.” Isaiah here is lampooning him, since such claims are blasphemies against God. “And it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.” We earlier noted that “forty-two months” indicates a short period of time, for compared with the unending ages, all time is short, even if it should seem to be very long. [He blasphemes God’s name and his dwelling] for such are the blasphemies against God spoken by the apostate. The “dwelling” of God is the holy angels, since God dwells among them. For if it is said concerning people, “I will dwell among them and I will walk among them,” how should one speak of the heavenly powers among whom God dwells?
