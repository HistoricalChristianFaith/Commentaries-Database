He says, Outside are the dogs: it is the custom in Holy Scripture to call those who have prostituted themselves dogs on account of their shamelessness and impurity. For the law of the priest Moses in Deuteronomy says, “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the price of a dog into the house of the Lord your God for any vow of yours,” for such people are like dogs in their shamelessness, as a heathen wise man also testifies, saying, “Keep far from murder of every kind and a woman’s adulterous couch, and swearing by the gods, and youths’ shameless beds.” Therefore, the dogs, whoever they may be, are outside the holy city and the life of the righteous. For what do they have in common with the righteous folk of God? 

He says, Everyone who loves and practices falsehood will be outside: falsehood means everything which is contrary to nature. Virtue is natural, since from the beginning the Creator has sown in us the seed of virtue when he formed us, but wickedness is contrary to nature. For just as in our bodies good health is natural, and disease is unnatural, and sight and hearing are natural, but blindness and deafness are unnatural, so in the soul virtue is natural and evil is unnatural; health is analogous to virtue, and disease to evil. 

Consequently, evil is a lie, because it often falsely claims to be virtue: brashness is taken to be fortitude, evil-doing to be prudence, idleness temperance, and meanness justice. All these are evils, wearing a mask of virtue, and so he casts those who practice the falsehood of evil outside the holy precincts. 

He says, I, Jesus, have sent my angel to you to witness to these things in the presence of the churches: he means by witness, to attest solemnly, not in secret, nor in a corner, but in the hearing of the churches everywhere, so that no one could make an excuse of ignorance for being willfully wicked. 

He says, I am the root and the offspring of David, but it would seem to have been more appropriate to say, “I am the branch which has sprung up from the root of David.” But, on the contrary, he has now called himself the root of David, and not only the root but also the offspring, as was said earlier. A root is also the origin of everything, including David, so that he is, and is considered to be, God; but he is also the offspring of David, sprung from him according to the flesh, insofar as he is, and is considered to be, a human being. This is who he is. “To say the same things more than once is not irksome to me, but is safe” for those who read, as the divine apostle says somewhere of his words. 

So therefore he is “Emmanuel” in his divinity and in his humanity, each of the two natures being complete according to their respective qualities, without confusion, without change, immutable, unimaginable. We believe that after the inexpressible union there is one person, one hypostasis, and one activity, “even if the difference of the natures, from which we say that the ineffable union has been effected, may not be overlooked,” as well as the peculiar quality of each nature, according to the words of our blessed father Cyril. 

He says, I am the morning star: he may mean the sun, since Malachi has called him “the sun of righteousness,” and the prophet in his psalm says, “Fire fell upon them”—that is, on the high priests of the Jews—“and they did not see the sun” — that is, Christ, “the sun of righteousness.” Or he may mean “the morning star”: he is called this by Peter in his second epistle, saying, “Until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.” 

He says, The Spirit, that is, the prophetic spirit, and the bride—the whole church in every place—say, “Come!” We are enjoined to seek the second coming of the Lord, but also to put it into prayer. For the one who says, “Your kingdom come,” to God is asking for the kingdom of Christ, which is also the kingdom of the Father and of the Spirit. 

He says, And let him who hears say, “Come”: he means, “let everyone who hears the present words, including you, John, utter a prayer for the kingdom of the coming of Christ.” In saying this he is urging everyone to follow the works and practice of righteousness. For no one who is not himself conversant with righteousness could pray for the coming of Christ, since he will then be required to give an account of what he has done in his life. it receive the water of life as a gift: “when the time of my coming arrives,” says the Lord, “put your mouth to the spring of life by the practice of virtue.” “And all of you who have no money, come, buy, and drink without money and without price,” Isaiah enjoins us, addressing us with the same words as the Lord. It was said earlier that the acquisition of virtue involves sweat and toil; but he now says, receive it as a gift, since “the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us,” according to the words of very wise Paul. 

I bear witness, he says, to everyone who hears these present words: that is, I promise solemnly not to add anything to them, so that he may not bring upon himself the plagues spoken of herein, nor take anything away from them, so that he may not be deprived of his share of the tree of life and of the holy city, both of which are described in this book.
