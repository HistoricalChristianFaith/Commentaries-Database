Behold, it says, I stand at the door and knock; if anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me. The Lord demonstrates to His own as the gentle and peaceful One. For the Devil strikes with "an axe and a chisel" the doors of those who do not receive him, according to the voice of the prophet (Ps. 73:6). But the Lord even now, and in the Songs, says to the bride, "Open to me, my sister, my bride." (Song 5:2) And if anyone opens to Him, He enters. The supper with the Lord, which signifies the participation in the holy mysteries, is hinted at.
