Everyone who commits sin also commits iniquity, and sin is a transgression of the law. And you know that He appeared to take away our sins: and in Him, there is no sin. Everyone who abides in Him does not sin. Everyone who sins has not seen Him nor known Him. Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous. Whoever commits sin is of the Devil, for the Devil has sinned from the beginning. For this purpose, the Son of God was revealed, that He might destroy the works of the Devil.
Confirmed in the previous discourse about righteousness from the good of righteous, now also takes on demonstration from the opposites and those things that happen to them, and says: "Everyone who sins." Saying something like this: You who have been adopted, do righteousness, nor present yourselves idle in this. For just as in sin it is not he who has done or will do it, that one is called a transgressor or a sinner, but he who clings to evil and is its operator: so too the righteous one is not called he who accomplishes nothing, or the lazy one, but the diligent.
It should be noted, however, that sin (αμαρτία) is indeed a fall from that which is good; iniquity (ἀνομία), on the other hand, is a transgression against the established law. And both of these have their origin: namely, sin is an erosion from that which is good; whereas iniquity is to commit an offense against the established law.
They agree among themselves and are concerned with the same thing. For he who sins strays from the goal that is according to nature and in nature itself: for the goal of human nature is to live according to reason, so that it is far removed from foolishness. Similarly, he who acts unjustly transgresses the law given in nature, affected by greed. Therefore, the disciple of the Lord rightly transformed both into the same.
"And you know that He appeared." You can no longer have a place for sinning. For when Christ came to take away our sins, since he was not a partaker of sin, it has not been left to you to sin any longer, you who have come to him and have been confirmed in his faith. For this is what he means when he says:
"Everyone who abides in Him." But this is the one who approaches virtues seriously and without pretense, and never ceases from their operation.
"and in Him, there is no sin." The conjunction “καὶ” is taken for "and."
"Everyone who sins" and so on. When John had said that he had appeared, and the reason for his appearing, namely to take away our sins, that is, to remove and erase them from the midst, as one who had not sinned, he adds: "Everyone who sins has not seen him."
But if you, John said, who saw him while he was revealed, also received a sign [σημεῖον] that you have seen him, namely that you are not easily caught by sin as if perfectly confirmed in him, certainly those who sin have not seen him, and therefore nor have known him: saying that they have seen and known not according to the bare sight of the eyes, nor that they have acted towards knowledge according to a simplistic imagination, but that they have approached him with some judgment and knowledge, as we said above.
But he proceeds more firmly with these words, saying: "let no one deceive you." For it cannot be otherwise than this: He who does righteousness knows the Righteous One, and is righteous, just as He is, that is, God. And just as this is true, so also equally: he who easily sins is from the sinner; however, this one is the Devil, as he who sinned from the beginning. Therefore, God, providing for His creation, became righteousness and sanctification, was revealed or appeared in the world, to take away the works of the Devil, which are sin.
"Whoever commits sin is of the Devil." Since the Devil was changed by sinning, anyone who acts sinfully operates under his influence: for the Devil first enters the sinner through the prompting of wicked thoughts, just as in Judas. But someone may say: How does the Devil enter those who sin (Luke 22:3; Jn. 13:27), since they have already sinned by giving him a place? (Eph. 4:27) To which it must be said that commits sin is the same as to sin by giving place to the Devil. For he gives place to him who is subject to lust, after he has effectively received him, perfecting sin: for this signifies to do it. And he rightly said here: "Whoever practices," not "Whoever practiced"; since he who repents is no longer of the Devil: but only he who still commits sin. For thus also he is a servant of sin who commits sin, and not who did. Therefore John says: "Everyone who does sin is a servant of sin." (Jn. 8:34)
