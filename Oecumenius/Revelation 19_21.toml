“These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire. And the rest were slain by the sword.” O, what a superabundance of justice! He does not reckon those responsible for the war and those who were accomplices worthy of the same punishment. Rather, the two, namely, the devil and the antichrist, were condemned to the fire, in which they will live for eternity—for this is the meaning of their being thrown alive into the fire. The rest are killed by the sword. It is, certainly, much different to give swift justice with the sword than to condemn to fire.
