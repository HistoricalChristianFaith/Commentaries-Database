Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders.

Until I come, give attention to reading. It was likely that Timothy himself, as if deprived of Paul, wished for him. Therefore, he comforts him in two ways, both with the promise of his coming and with the consoling Scriptures. But notice that Timothy is instructed to read, which we ought to do.

to exhortation. To the people.

Do not neglect the gift that is in you. This is, the teaching or the office of a bishop. For the grace of God was that the young man was worthy to become a pastor.

which was given to you through prophecy. For bishops were appointed by the command of the Spirit, and not randomly. But there is also a kind of prophecy that speaks of the present; as is said, "Separate for me Barnabas and Saul." (Acts 13:2)

with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Paul says that the bishops are elders. For the elders would not have ordained the bishop.
