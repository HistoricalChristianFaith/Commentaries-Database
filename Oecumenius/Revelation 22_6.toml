By “spirits of the prophets” he means the prophetic gifts, as we learn from the all-wise Paul, who said, “and the spirits of the prophets are subject to prophets,” and from the holy prophet Isaiah: “We have conceived, O Lord, because of fear of you, and we have been in birth pangs and have brought forth the breath of your salvation that you have wrought upon the earth.” “To show his servants what must soon take place,” it says. By means of John and his writings, all have learned what he saw. And appropriately he says “soon,” for as we have noted earlier, in comparison with the everlasting ages that are coming, all time is short, even if someone might think it a very long while.
