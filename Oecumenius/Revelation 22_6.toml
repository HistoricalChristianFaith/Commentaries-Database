These words, he says, are faithful, that is, true. And the Lord is the spirit of the prophets. He says "spirits of prophets" to mean the prophetic gifts, according to what was said to the most wise Paul. And "the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets," (1 Cor. 14:32) and to the divine prophet Isaiah: "Because of your fear, O Lord, we conceived in the womb and we travailed; and we bore the spirit of your salvation, which you made upon the earth." (Isa. 26:18)

He says to show his servants the things which must shortly take place. For through John and his writings all things that were shown to him have been learned. And he rightly said "shortly," for every time is short, as was said before, even if some appear to be especially great, when compared with the coming unending ages.
