Regarding the Antichrist, the vision that is more complete wishes to be recorded for us, of which a brief mention has been made in the preceding texts. However, since the resurrection of this figure and his appointment by Satan as a pretext for the Incarnation of the Lord have occurred, having taken possession of and subjected the world, the Antichrist will be raised for this very reason. He will then attempt to lead the world away from Christ and persuade it to defect to Satan through apostasy. Furthermore, since the beginning of the Lord's Incarnation was marked by His conception and birth in the flesh, the vision, leading to a certain order and sequence regarding the matters it is about to recount, has made the inception of the narrative start from Christ's conception in the flesh and has depicted the Mother of God [θεοτόκον] for us.

For what does it say, and a sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet? It is said to refer to the mother of our Savior, as has been stated. It is reasonable that the vision is described as being in heaven and not on earth, as a pure soul and body, like an angel [ἰσάγγελον], as a citizen of heaven, as one who rests with God in heaven. For he says "heaven is my throne," (Isa. 66:1) having contained and incarnated it, and having nothing in common with the earth and the evils in it, but entirely lofty, entirely worthy of heaven, even if it belonged to our human nature and essence [οὐσίας]. For the Virgin is of the same essence [ὁμοούσιος] with us; for the impious doctrine of Eutyches, which also makes the Virgin of a different essence from us, along with his other doctrines, which are mere opinions, may be banished far from the sacred courts of the divine.

What does it mean to say that she is clothed with the sun, and the moon is under her feet? The divine prophet Habakkuk, prophesying about the Lord, says that "the sun rose and the moon stood still in its order to bring forth light," (Hab. 3:10-11) calling Christ our Savior "the Sun of Righteousness." (Mal. 4:2), or at least referring to the evangelical proclamation.

Where it is said that, having been exalted and increased, the moon, that is, the Law of Moses, stood still and no longer received any addition; for no longer, after the appearance of Christ, did it receive converts [προσηλύτους] from the Gentiles as before, but rather it endured removal and reduction. Therefore, do not think here to consider the holy Virgin as the sun of the intellect; for in this manner the prophet calls the Lord concerning Israel, saying, "Fire has fallen upon them, and they did not see the sun." (Ps. 58:8) But the moon, that is, the ritual according to the Law and the institution according to the Law, having been brought low and greatly diminished, is underfoot, defeated by the brightness of the Gospel. And rightly the one in the law called the moon, since it too is illuminated by the sun, that is, Christ, just as the visible moon is illuminated by the visible sun.

But regarding what is being indicated, it would have been more appropriate to say that the woman was not clothed with the sun, but that the woman clothed the Sun contained in her womb; yet, to show also in the vision that the Lord, who was being carried by the natural mother and is the Lord of all creation, was a protection, he said that He clothed the woman. The divine angel also said to the holy Virgin: "The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you." (Luke 1:35) For to overshadow, to cover, and to envelop are the same in power.

And upon her head, it says, a crown of twelve stars. For the virgin is crowned by the twelve apostles preaching Christ together with her.
