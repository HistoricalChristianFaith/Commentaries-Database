His coming upon "the clouds of heaven," and the Lord Himself said concerning Himself in the Gospel according to Mark as follows: "And the powers in heaven will be shaken; and then they will see the Son of Man coming in the clouds with great power and glory." (Mark 13:25-26) For as I suppose it was written concerning His ascension into heaven on the day of the Ascension in the Acts, that a cloud received Him out of their sight, so He will come again with clouds. (Acts 1:9)

I suppose, metaphorically, that the divine Scripture calls the holy angels "clouds" because of their lightness, their lofty nature, and their ability to walk on air [ἀεροβατές], as if it were saying that the Lord will come accompanied and attended by divine angels. For therefore the prophet also introduces Him, saying, "And he mounted upon the cherubim and flew; he flew upon the wings of the wind." (Ps. 17:11)

And he says, "every eye shall see Him, even those who pierced Him." For He will not come in an obscure manner in his second glorious coming, nor secretly as before, when He lived among the world in the flesh; the prophet spoke of that coming, which is foreshadowed, saying: "He will descend like rain upon the mown grass, and like showers that water the earth." (Ps. 71:6) But openly and plainly, so as to be seen by every eye, even by the very sinful and wicked. Among these, those who have been led astray or turned away from him must be dealt with accordingly.

"and all the tribes of the earth shall mourn because of Him," it says, referring clearly to those who have remained in unbelief and have not chosen to bow their own necks to the yoke of their Savior. But you will understand that "because of Him," in his appearance and presence.

Then, to indicate what will certainly happen, he added "Yes, amen," meaning exactly that these things will occur with absolute certainty; for just as among the Greeks the word "yes" [ναὶ] signifies assent to what is to come, so too among the Hebrews "amen" [ἀμὴν] serves this purpose.
