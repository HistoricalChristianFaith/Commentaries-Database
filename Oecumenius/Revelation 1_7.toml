he cometh with the clouds: The Lord spoke of this concerning Himself in the Gospel of Mark, saying, “And the stars of heaven shall be falling down, and the powers that are in heaven, shall be moved. 26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.(Mk. 13:25-26)” Just as it is written in Acts, when He was ascending up into the heavens on the day of the ascension, “and a cloud received him out of their sight,(1:9) so He will come again with a cloud. I believe that the Holy Scriptures call the holy angels clouds because of their lightness and being lifted high and walking on air, as though John is saying, “the Lord will come riding on the angels of God as his spearmen.” For this is how the prophets spoke of Him saying, “And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.(Ps. 17:11)” 

and every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him: For His glorious second coming will not be pushed aside, nor secretly, as the first time when visited the world in the flesh. The prophet clearly told us beforehand about His first coming, saying, “He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.(Ps. 71:6)” But the second coming will be visible so that every eye will see, even the sinful and ungodly, among whom must be divided as those who drunkenly beat Him or pierced Him.

And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him: Those are who continued on in disbelief and did not yield under His saving yoke. But the words because of him you shall understand to mean to His appearance and coming. And then to add to the assurance that this will happen he adds, Even so, Amen, as saying accurately and positively that these things will happen. For as among the Greek “Even so” points out approval to what will happen, so does “Amen” among the Hebrews.

I think that the divine Scripture figuratively calls the holy angels “clouds” because of their lightness and sublimity and movement in the air, as though it were saying, “The Lord will come, being carried and attended by his holy angels.” And the prophet speaks of him in this way: “And he rode upon a cherub and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the wind.” And he writes, “every eye will see him, every one who pierced him.” At his second and glorious coming, he will not come as though he were hiding in a corner. Nor will he come secretly as he did in his previous coming, when he visited the world in the flesh. The prophet showed that this coming would be hidden, when he said, “He will come down as rain upon a fleece and as rain drops which fall upon the earth.” He will rather come openly and visibly, so that he will be seen by every eye, even by those who are especially sinful and impious. And of these, those who maltreated or pierced him must be regarded as a class of their own. “And all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him,” namely, those peoples who have remained in unbelief and have not come to bend their neck to his saving yoke.
