he cometh with the clouds: The Lord spoke of this concerning Himself in the Gospel of Mark, saying, “And the stars of heaven shall be falling down, and the powers that are in heaven, shall be moved. 26 And then shall they see the Son of man coming in the clouds, with great power and glory.(Mk. 13:25-26)” Just as it is written in Acts, when He was ascending up into the heavens on the day of the ascension, “and a cloud received him out of their sight,(1:9) so He will come again with a cloud. I believe that the Holy Scriptures call the holy angels clouds because of their lightness and being lifted high and walking on air, as though John is saying, “the Lord will come riding on the angels of God as his spearmen.” For this is how the prophets spoke of Him saying, “And he ascended upon the cherubim, and he flew; he flew upon the wings of the winds.(Ps. 17:11)” 

and every eye shall see him, and they also that pierced him: For His glorious second coming will not be pushed aside, nor secretly, as the first time when visited the world in the flesh. The prophet clearly told us beforehand about His first coming, saying, “He shall come down like rain upon the fleece; and as showers falling gently upon the earth.(Ps. 71:6)” But the second coming will be visible so that every eye will see, even the sinful and ungodly, among whom must be divided as those who drunkenly beat Him or pierced Him.

And all the tribes of the earth shall bewail themselves because of him: Those are who continued on in disbelief and did not yield under His saving yoke. But the words because of him you shall understand to mean to His appearance and coming. And then to add to the assurance that this will happen he adds, Even so, Amen, as saying accurately and positively that these things will happen. For as among the Greek “Even so” points out approval to what will happen, so does “Amen” among the Hebrews.
