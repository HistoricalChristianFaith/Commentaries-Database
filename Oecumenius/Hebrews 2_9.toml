Note that the Nestorians stumble against the Scripture and so they read “so that without God he tasted death for all,” constructing the argument that Christ had an indwelling of the Word of God but not union with it, because he did not have his divinity when he was crucified. For they say that it is written “without God he tasted death.” But see how a certain orthodox man answered. First, the text reads “by the grace of God.” Moreover, even if we understand it to read “apart from [without] God,” it ought to be understood in the sense that Christ died for all the other beings except for God, for he died not only for humanity but also for the powers above, that “he might break down the dividing wall” and unite the lower beings with the higher ones. Similar to this is that statement which is said elsewhere, “But when it says, ‘All things are put in subjection under him,’ it is plain that the One is excepted who put all things under him.”
