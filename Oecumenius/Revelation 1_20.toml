Since it was revealed to him who the "stars" are and what the "lampstands" represent, he then proceeds to instruct what each "of the churches" must bear witness to, and how to hold accountable the one that is fully straying from the divine purpose; while praising those that, at least in part, faithfully uphold the precision of the Gospel laws. And to correct those who have erred in other matters, Christ, "who desires all to be saved" (1 Tim. 2:4) and to become heirs of His own good things and partners, appointed the divine evangelist to send the appropriate word and teaching to each of the churches as a remedy; to Him be glory forever and ever. Amen.
