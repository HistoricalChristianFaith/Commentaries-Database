Now since he has made clear to him what the stars and what the lampstands are, he goes on to speak of the evidence against each of the churches. He explains to the blessed evangelist how he is to lay a charge against the church which strays far away from the divine purpose, and how he is to commend the carefulness of those who observe part of the evangelical law, while in other cases he is to set right those which are stumbling. Christ, “who wills all people to be saved” and wishes them to become heirs and partners of his own bounty, has ordered his word and teaching as an appropriate remedy for each of the churches, and has enjoined the evangelist to spread abroad the gospel and his teaching. To him be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
