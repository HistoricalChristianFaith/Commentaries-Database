Having completed in part the contemplation concerning the common Lady, the holy ever-virgin and Mother of God Mary, he presents to us another, saying:

As in the beginning of the vision considered authoritative, it is said that the vision, wishing to narrate more fully the matters concerning the Antichrist, begins with the conception and birth of the Lord, for whose sake that destroyer, the common enemy and adversary of all, is projected so that he might again enslave those gathered by the Lord. Similarly, it must now be said that the vision, desiring to recount the events concerning the Antichrist, makes another beginning prior to the previously mentioned start of the Lord's birth, one that precedes it, namely, the origin according to Satan, how he was cast down from heaven. Even in the subsequent vision this is stated more clearly, adding that he also plotted against the Lord, so that, as if a certain foundation had been laid at the beginning, the remaining narratives concerning the Antichrist and the deeds done by him might be built upon it. With these matters therefore previously explained, we must now turn to the examination of the words themselves.

And it is said that another sign appeared in heaven, as if the narrative were striking down the original evil, Satan, because although heavenly, he has become wicked through pride; he is shown in the heavens so that the rebel might see from what heights he has fallen to what depths.

And behold, he says, a great fiery Dragon. The Dragon is called Satan because of its crookedness; for this is how Isaiah also refers to him, calling the "the dragon, the crooked serpent." (Isa. 27:1) It is described as fiery because of its bloodthirsty and wrathful nature.

Having seven heads and ten horns, and upon its heads were seven crowns. Nor did the prophet fail to recognize him as many-headed; therefore he says to God: "You have crushed the heads of the dragon; you have given him as food to the peoples of the Ethiopians."(Ps.74:14) They say he is many-headed, with most of the seven heads signifying, as has often been said, the many authorities and cunning schemes he employs against humans, through which he enslaves them, for the crown is a symbol of tyranny.

The ten horns symbolize his greatest power. For the number ten is perfect, and the horn is a sign of strength. It has also been said that "my horn will be raised like that of a unicorn." (Ps. 92:10)

As it is possible, one may come to know the one who appears in the book of Job.
