Because, he says, that you are lukewarm. Lukewarm is called the one who has indeed received the Holy Spirit through baptism, but has extinguished the gift through negligence and concern for temporary matters. This is also a divine command: "Do not quench the Spirit." (1 Thess. 5:19)

I wish you were cold or hot! So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold. He says, "I wish that you were either hot, aflame with the energy of the Spirit, or entirely cold and completely uninvolved, unbaptized, and not lukewarm, lacking the grace of the Spirit. For the one who possesses the spiritual fire of the Spirit in men is perfect, "who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil," (Heb. 5:14) and they are spiritual; but the one who has not yet received the grace of the Spirit, hoping to receive it someday, is not counted among the hopeless. However, the lukewarm person, being uncaring both to ignorance and to the possibility of being baptized and living, is rejected.

He says that I am about to vomit you out of my mouth. He indeed used the metaphor of lukewarmness appropriately; for every lukewarm thing, as the physicians say, when swallowed, provokes vomiting in the one who has drank it. Therefore, for those who have difficulty vomiting, they are given lukewarm water to drink, which is called by this name because it induces vomiting. He says that he intends to make you rejected from his household. But what is the cause of such a situation?
