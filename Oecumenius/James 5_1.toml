James makes their possession of wealth and their stinginess a source of lamentation for those who store up their riches for burial and loss rather than give them to the needy. For the person who gives his wealth to the poor does not lose it but keeps every penny. This is why the Preacher said: “Cast your bread upon the waters,” that is, upon the apparent corruption and decadence of this world, and it will not be lost, but rather it will preserve us from destruction.
