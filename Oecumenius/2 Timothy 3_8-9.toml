Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, but they will progress no further. For their folly will be evident to all, as was that of those men.

Jannes and Jambres. These were the magicians of Pharaoh. But how does one know their names when Scripture does not say? We say that it was from unwritten tradition; it was likely from the Holy Spirit that Paul knew.

so do these also resist the truth. To the true faith.

men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, but they will progress no further. When someone's mind is corrupted by passions, then they become unreliable regarding faith. How could they advance in wickedness without saying "they will advance"? Here it says, "they will progress no further." There it says that once they begin to wander, they will not stand anywhere, but will always devise something worse; here, however, it says that they will neither deceive nor seize many of the prudent.

— [OECUMENIUS] For Paul said beforehand, "Wandering and being led astray." (2 Tim. 3:13) Therefore, the power lies with those who are not easily deceived. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 181r; B f. 219r; G f. 308r] —

For their folly will be evident to all. Where does this come from? "From ancient times," Paul says, "be assured. For wickedness is easily exposed."

In another way. If you are unbelieving, learn from what happened to those magicians (Jannes and Jambres). For even they were exposed as performing illusions and deceiving, when Moses truly performed wonders, so that all things of deceit flourish only for a time.

Encouragement to imitate them in opposition to the wicked, in the patience of God.
