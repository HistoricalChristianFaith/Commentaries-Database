If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
"If we confess our sins." John repeats the statement, using it more richly, so that the frequency of the produced refutation may restrain them by the degree of sin itself and invite them to confession. However, John indicated how much good arises from confession when he said: "Say your sins first, so that you may be justified." (Is. 43:26) However, it was also the custom of the Teacher of this beloved disciple to repeat the same things more frequently, first moderately, then more perfectly, wishing to make the understanding of the words more effective, and striving to instill their habit into the listeners.
Indeed, John called God faithful. This means “truthful”. For "Πιστός", that is, “faithful”, is said not only of one to whom something is entrusted, but also of one who is confirmed in truth, who by his truthful manner causes others to become partakers of this as well. Therefore, God is called faithful in this way: just, indeed, as one who does not reject those who approach him, regardless of the sins they have committed. Therefore, he undoubtedly forgives the sins of those who run to holy baptism through repentance, whether they have sinned against him or against another.
There, if we confess, John says, we shall obtain appropriate forgiveness. But if we shamelessly say that we have not sinned, we shall commit a double evil, both showing ourselves to be liars and slandering God, who surpasses all truth, with falsehood. For He Himself says through the Prophet: “They have repaid me evil for good.” (Ps. 109:5)
And again from John’s own mouth: “If I have spoken wrongly, testify to the wrong; but if rightly, why do you strike me?” (Jn. 18:23) If, with these things being so, we still say that we have not sinned, we deny his words, which are spirit and life. (Jn. 6:64) "For the words that I speak," he says, "are spirit and life." And if we no longer have his word dwelling in us: what could be more serious?
