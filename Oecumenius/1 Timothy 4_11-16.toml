Command these things, and teach them. Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Until I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching. Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Study these things; give yourself entirely to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you.

Concerning those who err in knowledge, it is necessary to command them with authority; but concerning those who err in ignorance, to simply teach them. The one who encourages toward good, teaches; but the one who hinders evil, commands.

Let no one despise your youth. For the bishop must also speak more authoritatively. Therefore, "Let your forbearance be known to all men?" (Phil. 4:5) And we say that, when he himself is wronged, he ought to be gentle; but when the brothers are wronged by sinning, he ought to be strict.

Or thus. If you live a most modest life, youth, which is easily prone to contempt, will not be despised.

but be an example to the believers. Like a living image, and a standard of good living.

in word, he says, in speaking, what is necessary for a teacher. But see that the teacher must have preparation of speech.

in conduct. For example, in life and in the practice of living.

in love. Which is towards all.

in spirit. Either by spiritual rank or by the gift of the spirit, do not exalt yourself because of this.

in faith. The straight path by which one may unquestionably believe in God, even concerning the impossible.

in purity. That is, holiness, abstinence, and self-discipline.

Until I come, give attention to reading. It was likely that Timothy himself, as if deprived of Paul, wished for him. Therefore, he comforts him in two ways, both with the promise of his coming and with the consoling Scriptures. But notice that Timothy is instructed to read, which we ought to do.

to exhortation. To the people.

Do not neglect the gift that is in you. This is, the teaching or the office of a bishop. For the grace of God was that the young man was worthy to become a pastor.

which was given to you through prophecy. For bishops were appointed by the command of the Spirit, and not randomly. But there is also a kind of prophecy that speaks of the present; as is said, "Separate for me Barnabas and Saul." (Acts 13:2)

with the laying on of the hands of the elders. Paul says that the bishops are elders. For the elders would not have ordained the bishop.

Study these things. Which ones? Those that Paul mentioned above. In word, he says, in conduct, in faith, in purity. And from the frequent repetition of the same things, it shows that the bishop must unquestionably guard these things.

your progress may be evident to all. But if the progress does not become very great, it would not become obvious. In all, either with people or with matters.

Take regard to yourself. That is, focus and apply your mind, not only for yourself but also for the sake of learning, so that you may benefit others as well. Then, giving precise instructions, Paul said, continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you. For encouraging others, the one who encourages is also moved and benefited, becoming responsible for those whom he prevents from sinning.

That he may suitably adapt himself to each individual.
