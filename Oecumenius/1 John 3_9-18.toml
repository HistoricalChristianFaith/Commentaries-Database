Everyone who is born of God does not sin, because His seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this, the children of God and the children of the Devil are obvious. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother; for this is the message that you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another. Not as Cain, who was of the wicked one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his works were evil and his brother's was righteous. Do not marvel, my brethren, if the world hates you. We know that we have passed from death to life because we love the brethren. He who does not love his brother abides in death. Whoever hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him. By this we know love, because He laid down His life for us, and we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. But whoever has this world's goods and sees his brother in need, and shuts up his heart from him, how does the love of God abide in him? My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.
"Everyone who are born of God." For everyone who commits sin is of the Devil, and inasmuch as he sins, he is also called the child of the Devil; thus, blessed Paul said to Elymas: "O full of all deceit and all cunning, son of the Devil, enemy of all righteousness” (Acts 13:10); it is evident that even he who is born of God, as the Son of God, does not sin, and the reason is that his seed, namely, of God, or the Spirit that we have received as a gift, which remaining in us or being established, prevents our mind from receiving sin.
But Christ himself, as dwelling in the faithful, makes them children of God, inasmuch as all nations are blessed in the seed of Abraham, who is Christ. (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:9) Now, however, John proceeded in such a way in his speech, confirming what he had said before, I indeed say that the faithful are the children of God, and making that obvious, both from the same matter, namely, not to sin; and from the contrary, as we said a little earlier. For just as this contrary relates to that contrary, so again that contrary relates to this contrary according to dialectical arguments5. But consider the exact statement. For John did not first say that one is born of God or of the Devil, unless the works of either justice or iniquity are accepted beforehand. For from these indeed comes the adoption, either of God or of the Devil.
Although we have been saved by grace, this is said because of God's exceptional kindness, for although we had sinned permanently, He does not remember the evils for our salvation. (Eph. 2) Indeed, He does not give salvation to the idle. Paul confirms this by shouting: "To those who were called according to His purpose." (Rom. 8:28) Similarly, those who have been adopted by the Devil as children, although they are alienated from the womb (Ps. 58:3), since they have not yet acted according to the proposed evil: nonetheless, this is said because of their fiery hatred; for it does not happen without the operation of evil that one becomes proper and domestic to the Devil: but he who commits sin is taken by the Devil, whether as a child, so that he may further willingly commit evil, or as a servant, because he has been overcome by the wicked one, and led captive and condemned to his service.
However, it should also be noted that John did not say that he who is born of God does not sin, lest he also include infants, who from the womb have that they do not sin: but he said, "he cannot commit sin." Indeed, that: "He does not sin," corresponds totally to the denial; however, this: "He does not commit sin," signifies that he does not touch it out of affection. For this reason, John also adds that he cannot sin, not saying this according to the impossibility of nature, just as we say of irrational beings that they cannot receive knowledge: but he discusses this because of voluntary freedom or abstinence from sinning, and saying that not sinning is a sign of the children of God: just as again the children of the Devil sin. Therefore, having explained these things, he repeats after many points made in between, love for one's neighbor, as if he had treated all that was in between for its sake, since love is also the fullness of everything (Rom. 13:10), and he says:
"He who does not love his brother is not of God." But against this, this member is also placed: He is not of God, saying this: For if he who does righteousness is born of God, it follows that he who is therefore born loves his brothers; but he who does not do righteousness, because he does not do it by hating his brothers, is not of God, not in any other way except that he is not born of him. And how he is not of him is shown by saying: "for this is the message that you heard from the beginning." (see Lev. 19:24) What this announcement is, we have already said, both naturally received and through teaching; but also by the legal command to love one's neighbor, as the Lord's command says: "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another." (Jn. 13:34) The natural command regarding those of the same kind and condition also urges one to do this. Therefore, since there are so many such commands in accordance with the Lord's declaration, whoever keeps and does His word has eternal life and has passed from death to life. (Jn. 5:24)
Therefore, let us love our brothers, taking nothing harmful to imitate: for example, if we are hated by the world, let us not also hate our brothers: but let the word of the Lord be more effective in us. For whoever hates his brother is not only cast out from eternal life, but is also a murderer. For it necessarily follows that if he is a murderer, he has no eternal life. Behold Cain, John says, for he too, having hated his brother, murdered him, although he was his brother. But because Cain had evil works, he was the son of the Devil: whereas Abel, by doing righteous works, was called the son of God: the Devil is opposed to God, and evil works to good ones: therefore, Cain, being contrary to his brother, murdered him. Thus, indeed, the course of the discourse was consequent, but blessed John changed the order, always serving what was more pressing. For it was pressing, because he had mentioned the Devil and those who had been adopted by him due to their wicked actions, so as to propose him as an example who, from the beginning of the world, escaped as the wicked son through evil works.
However, having been freed from Cain and those who imitate him, who receive the same inheritance with him, John again turns to love, showing how many good things have come from it: and he says that love persuaded the Lord laid down His life for us, and that moved by this example that we also ought to lay down our lives for the brethren. And since this is rare and found among few, as if encouraging them, he begins to make an admonition of brotherly love from ordinary matters, in a way arranging his discourse: "What do I say about laying down our lives for our brothers?" when we see some not even providing the necessary support for their brothers; and I do not mean those who themselves lack the necessities of life, but those who are abundant in riches almost throughout the whole world. Therefore, let them be ashamed, for if they have shut their hearts to these least things, and have shown themselves unworthy and empty of God's love, what would they offer in greater matters, namely when it is necessary to die for their brothers? Then John adds another point to exhort those who have indeed received love in word, and would only profess it with their tongues, and he says: "let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth."
