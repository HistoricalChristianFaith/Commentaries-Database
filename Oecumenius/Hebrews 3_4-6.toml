Since he had called the people and also Moses, he remained in the figure of speech and said, These are the creations and servants. For there is no house unless something has been constructed. But all things have been constructed, including the house by Christ. Therefore, as it is fitting that he who created has preeminence over the work he created, so Christ has preeminence over Moses.
“And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house." Then Paul speaks of another distinction between Christ and Moses, that Moses was faithful as a servant, while the Christ was a genuine Son and of the same essence. For since he called Christ faithful above, and also Moses faithful, he explains the distinction of the faithful.
"for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken." To be a witness of the things spoken by God to the Jews, so that they may not be caught in the time of judgment. For it is customary for God to take heaven and earth and the depths as a testimony. "For hear, he says, O heaven, and give ear, O earth." (Deut. 32:1) And again, "Hear, O depths." (Ps. 130:1)
— “But Christ as a Son.” For even if he is called faithful, Paul says, it is as a genuine Son that he is faithful, fulfilling the will of the Father, rather the common will of the holy Trinity.
"whose house we are."Here we are the house of Christ, the faithful, according to what is written: “I will dwell in them.” (Lev. 27:12; 2 Cor. 6:16) —
“if we hold fast the confidence.” We shall be his house if we do not shrink back because of the faith that belongs to him, but boast with boldness, and hope to receive good things from Him as God, not being shaken or doubting in anything.
