The holy Scripture figuratively speaks of temptation as a “river.” Jonah said, “You have cast me into the deep, into the heart of the sea, and the rivers encircled me,” and the Lord spoke similarly: “The rain fell, and the rivers came, and the winds blew, but they did not blow that house down, because it was built upon the rock.” And so here the trial of the Lord’s passion is called a “river,” and it says that through this [the dragon] intended to drown the Virgin. And truly, since they [the rivers] did bring her to this [the cross] and to very great grief, the dragon was able to fulfill his intention. For why did Simeon say to her, “And a sword will pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts might be revealed”? “But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured out of its mouth” upon the woman. That the earth swallowed the river signifies that it received the trial into itself, that is, it received the Lord, who had been crucified. But the help that the earth rendered was not simply in this. Rather, its help was in this, that it gave the Lord back again. For on the third day he came to life again, having trampled on death, since it was not strong enough to hold him who was the Author of life, as the blessed Peter says. And that the whole narrative might be told, one must know the ending to the words “the earth came to the help of the woman.” Consequently, as though responding to a question after the manner of this aid, it says, “it swallowed the river,” that is, it received in itself the Lord, who had been betrayed, and gave him back again, and in this way [the earth] rendered its assistance.
