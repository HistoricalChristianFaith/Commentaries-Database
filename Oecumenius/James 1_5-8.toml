But if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask of God, who gives to all generously and without blame, and it will be given to him. But let him ask in faith, with no doubting. For he who wavers is like a wave of the sea, driven by the winds and swept away by force. For let not that man think that he will receive anything from the Lord. A double-minded man is unstable in all his ways.
James says wisdom is the cause of the perfect work. “let him ask of God.” Since he knows that the proof of faith and the endurance in afflictions is not the work of any men, but of those who are wise according to God, therefore he urges those who strive to achieve these things towards the pursuit of wisdom.
“he who wavers.” For if he trusts, let him ask; but if he wavers, let him not even ask, because he who does not trust that he will receive, will not obtain.
“like a wave of the sea.” For he who wavers, doubtful about his requests, after having endured for a little while, immediately withdraws. But this happens to him from pride, that he quickly despairs because he does not follow through on what he asks for: since he thinks great things of himself and deserves to be rejected in the request he makes. Moreover, he behaves in the opposite way to one who is of modest mind.
"For let not man think that," namely, one who asks out of pride and carelessness. Remove from yourself the duplicity of mind, and never waver in your mind when you ask something from God, saying to yourself, "How can I ask and receive anything from the Lord, since I have sinned against Him so often?" Do not think of these things, but turn to the Lord with all your heart, and ask of Him without hesitation, and you will know the multitude of His mercy, which will never forsake you, but will fulfill the request of your soul. For God is not like men, who holds grudges against one another, but He forgets, and He has compassion on His creation.
"A man of double mind." James calls a man of double mind unstable and not firm, who is never firmly established for the future, nor securely for the present: but is led here and there and carried about: always moving to the future, but never enduring the present. But he also compared such a thing to a wave of the sea, which has neither firmness nor stability: and to a flower of grass, which likewise does not persist, but fades away at the same time as the sun rises. Consider, however, that he did not say that such a one is likened to a grass, but to a flower of grass, signifying by the flower a very short time. But since he knows that modesty of mind gives birth and is a nurturer of all things, and without this there is nothing excellent in upright and scholarly men, therefore he adds: Let the brother who is humble glory, etc. (James 1:9) But how and why was another called double-minded? That he is not established for the present life nor for the future: for life is also called soul, when it is said: "all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life." (Job 2:4)
"In all his ways." James means the ways of the mind's emotions by which hope is raised, whether useful or useless, according to what David says: "And you have known all my ways." (Ps. 138:4)
