Is anyone among you afflicted? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing psalms. Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord, and the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up; and if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man is very effective. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
Prayer go together with affliction, so that for the one who is afflicted, the withdraw from afflictions or temptations may be lighter. Then, when through prayer it has pleased God to remove the things that trouble us, and the soul has reached its state of peace and tranquility, let him sing psalms, so that what is beneficial may be multiplied, and it may delight in spiritual joy. Indeed, joy and gladness are the right state of the mind, according to our great Basil, for hymns or divine praises confer the grace of consolation. Therefore, whoever has not progressed in this way, nor reached such a state, which David also calls holiness: "Sing to the Lord, you His saints," (Ps. 30:4) does great nonsense, singing vainly and empty, as the proverb says.
"anointing him with oil." This is what the apostles did while the Lord was still among men, anointing the sick with oil and healing them. (Mark 6:13)
"The effective prayer." The prayer of a righteous person is effective when he who prays helps the one for whom he prays with spiritual affliction. For if, while others pray for us, we indulge in pleasures and dissolutions, and our lives are full of transgressions, we dissolve through this the fervor of the prayer that strives for us: and that which Saint Peter says is fulfilled in us: "One builds and one destroys, what does it profit them but labor?" (Sirach 34:28)
