Elders must be sober, honorable, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in patience; likewise, older women must be respectful in behavior, not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, teachers of what is good, so that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be reviled.

Elders must be sober. For old age is mostly followed by slowness and sluggishness. This, therefore, corrects it.

be [εἶναι]. For the common expression is, “must be” [εἶναι δεῖ].

self-controlled [σωφροσύνη]. He basically says careful [Φρονίμους]. For self-controlled is, as it were, soundness, the salvation of the mind. For self-control would not have been sought after by the aged in matters of immorality, as this is generally acknowledged.

patience. Paul rightly says that they ought to have patience. For irritability clings to old age.

— [OECUMENIUS] likewise, older women. Paul refers to the deaconesses.

Respectful. From this Paul means clothing. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius Π f. 173v; A f. 186r anonym; B f. 225r; G f. 314v] —

behavior. From this attire, Paul says, they showed modesty and the fact of engaging in sacred services.

not slanderers. For from wine follows slander: and especially because the violence that comes of wine is hostile to weaker old age.

teachers of what is good. And how does it hinder women from teaching elsewhere? And we say that here it speaks about an exhortative speech addressed to household members, but there it is about sitting in public and speaking in the assembly. And that it has made them participants only of the teaching which is imparted at home is made clear by what follows.

so that they may train the young women. Paul is not speaking only about their daughters but of women in general, and for the younger to be subordinate to the older.

to love their husbands. This is the head of all duties that exist in the family, from which the rest arise.

to love their children. For she who loves the root will also love the branches.

homemakers. Paul says “homemaker”, those who manage the household affairs. However, such guardians are concerned neither with their own nourishment nor with untimely departures.

so that the word of God may not be reviled. For if a husband were unfaithful, having a faithful wife, but not submissive and corrupt, the very faith would be slandered which such women have. Do you see that Paul writes this, having especially the care of preaching?
