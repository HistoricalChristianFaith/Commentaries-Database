Perhaps someone might say, “How can you say that the mercy of God is many times greater in the judgment at that time, when the vision tells us that the torments of those who are punished are little short of everlasting?” For why does it say, “And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night?” To such a person one might respond, “O, sir, what is suffered is indeed eternal, but it is not suffering according to merit. If someone is deserving of fire and darkness, why is he condemned to the darkness? Such a one is tormented only in this, that he does not share in the good things of God, and he suffers only this, but he is not also tormented physically.” By the phrase “the smoke of their torment goes up” he refers to the heaving breath of the sinners that they exhale from below in their lamentations over their situation.
