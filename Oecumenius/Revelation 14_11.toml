For what does he say? And the smoke of their torment ascends forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night. To whom would one say this? "Is it, O man, to be tormented eternally and not suffer according to due merit?" For what? If someone is worthy of fire and darkness, and is condemned into darkness, and is punished merely in this, by not being in participation of God's goods, and is pained only by that, and not punished sensibly. But he says that the smoke of torment that ascends is the anguish of sinners, poured out below in weeping to the outside.
