Of whom it says whose names are not written in the book of life of heaven of the sealed from the foundation of the world; the vision very securely predetermined this; for since it has been said that all the inhabitants of the inhabited world have worshiped the apostate Devil, there were nevertheless a few who were pure from this worship, both from the Gentiles and from Israel, such as Job, his four friends, Melchizedek, and the holy prophets of Israel, and those who are testified to in the Old Testament for godliness.

He says all have worshipped him, except these who, because of their godliness, and the precision and purity of their citizenship, are written in heaven, and are guarded by God; for this is signified by the sealing of the book. Concerning this book the Lord says to his holy disciples according to the divinely inspired Luke: "nevertheless in this do not rejoice, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names were written in heaven." (Luke 10:20)
