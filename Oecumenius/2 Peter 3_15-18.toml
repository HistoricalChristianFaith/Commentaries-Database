Just as our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you, speaking in almost all his letters about these things: among which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable distort, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own destruction. Therefore, beloved, since you know this beforehand, take care that you are not led astray by the error of the wicked and fall from your own commitment, but grow in grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him be glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.
"Just as our beloved brother Paul," And where did Paul say anything of this sort? In these words when he says: "The goodness of God invites you to repentance." (Rom. 2:4) If the patience of God invites to repentance, then repentance is certainly beneficial for us, and the patience of God is for our benefit and salvation.
However, he says that the things hard to understand are interpreted by the wicked in a perverse way; for this means to be twisted, and to demonstrate the whole matter from one point, as Paul said, "Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more," (Rom. 5:20) they perverted this to mean that we sin more so that we may be forgiven more abundantly.
However, they do this, he says, to their own destruction. Just as those who killed the prophets and apostles are liable to the same judgment, so too are those who distort their words: for those killed them so that those who were being taught salvation by them could not be helped by them; and likewise, these distort the words so that no one may work salvation through them. Truly, he calls faith in the Lord its own commitment. And just as he concludes in his other Epistle with prayer, so in this one, he prays for an increase in faith in the Lord for them.
on the Epistles of John
This epistle was written by the same John who wrote the Gospel, suggesting these things to those who had already believed in the Lord. And indeed, just as in the Gospel, so in this Epistle he theologically discusses the Word, showing that it has always been in God, and teaching that the Father is light, so that we may also know the Word as a radiance from Him. However, in discussing the theology, John teaches that the mystery which is among us is not recent: but indeed, it has always been from the beginning, and now it has been manifested through the Lord, who is eternal life and the true God. And he states the reason for His coming and manifestation, saying that it is to destroy the works of the Devil, and that we might be freed from death, and that we might know the Father and His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. It is therefore written for all ages: for children, for adolescents, for the elderly, that God indeed be known, but that the diabolical energy has been defeated thereafter, taken away by death. Then the entire subsequent Epistle teaches about love and charity, wanting us to love one another: and showing that we ought to love each other, since Christ loved us. Therefore, it teaches about the distinction between fear and love, and the children of God and the children of the Devil, and about sin leading to death and that which does not lead to death, and about the diversity of spirits, and afterwards distinguishes which spirit is from God and which spirit is of error: and how we know the children of God and the children of the Devil, and for what sin that we should pray and for those who sin, and for what we should not pray: and that those who do not love their neighbor are not worthy of the calling, nor can they be called Christ's. It also shows the unity of the Son with the Father: and that he who denies the Son does not have the Father. However, in this Epistle, it argues that it is characteristic of the Antichrist to say that the Son, Jesus Christ, does not exist, so that when he does not exist, he falsely claims to be. Moreover, the entire Epistle encourages believers in the Lord not to be troubled if they are hated in the world, but rather to rejoice, as the hatred of the world shows that believers have migrated from this world and henceforth have a heavenly conversation. And at the end of the Epistle, it again brings to mind that the Son of God is eternal life and the true God, and that we should serve Him and be wary of idols.
