“And he had in his hand,” it says, “a little scroll opened.” Daniel recalled such scrolls when he said, “The tribunal sat before him, and books were opened.” It was the little scroll in which were written both the names and the transgressions of the severely wicked who are going to be punished. And therefore he used the diminutive “little scroll,” since there is a book or a scroll—both are mentioned in holy Scripture—in which the names of all people are written. But here he speaks of a little scroll in which the names of the exceedingly wicked are written. For those who worship idols and are marked by murders and sorceries and are enfeebled in other ways that he reports would not be sufficient to fill an entire book. “And he set his right foot upon the sea and his left foot upon the land.” On the one hand, this is an indication of the multitude of the saints, but on the other hand this indicates that he was carrying the instruments of punishment for those who transgressed upon the land and upon the sea, in that they were drowned in it, and who had otherwise done evil.
