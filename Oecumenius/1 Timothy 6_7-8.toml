For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.

For we brought nothing into the world. If we have brought nothing in, and we can take nothing out, what need is there to have more than what is necessary?

But if we have food and clothing. One must eat as much as is sufficient to nourish, not as much as to create luxury; and one must have as much clothing and such as to cover nakedness, not as many as to create extravagance and folly for those who bear them. For this indicates the nature of food and clothing.
