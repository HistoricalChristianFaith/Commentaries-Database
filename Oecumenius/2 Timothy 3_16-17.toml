All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for criticism, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

All Scripture is God-breathed [θεόπνευστος] and profitable. Having spoken many ways of comfort, Paul now speaks of the greatest, that which comes from the reading of the Scriptures. For he is about to say something sad, namely about his own death. But if Timothy must read, how much more must we?

for teaching. Since good things teach both lessons and actions.

for criticism. Concerning the refutation of falsehoods.

for correction. To correct the brothers.

for training in righteousness. For the training and leading into righteousness. For from these things, Paul says, something perfect [ἄρτιον] comes to be. A perfect person is one who is always equal, neither leaning downwards with a saddened spirit nor rising and swelling in prosperity, but always remains the same in unequal circumstances.

equipped for every good work. Not merely participating but being equipped and complete.
