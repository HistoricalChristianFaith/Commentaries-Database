He said, It has been done! What has been done? The things that have been spoken about, in which there is nothing false. He has written, It has been done, instead of “it will be done.” 

He says, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end: since he again resumes what he said earlier, let us also follow in his footsteps and pick up again what we said earlier: Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, indicate the unoriginate and infinite nature of God. For since there is nothing in this life which does not have an origin, he has used for our benefit the beginning and the end instead of “unoriginate and infinite.” 

He says, I myself will freely give to the thirsty from the fountain of the water of life: the Lord says in the gospels, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.” Accordingly, “to him who has such a thirst I will give life freely.” 

Why did he say freely, when the saints attain to the future life by means of countless acts of sweat and toil? Why, then, does he say that he gives it freely? He says it to indicate that no one can ever contribute anything worthy of future prosperity, even by completing innumerable tasks. This is also what the apostle explained, saying, “I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.” 

He says, He who conquers the sufferings and the wicked beast, the Devil, shall have this heritage. 

This then is the victor’s lot. But as for the cowardly and the faithless, and so on, their lot shall be in the lake of fire. He calls cowardly those who are weak in every good work on account of their voluntary baseness. 

He says, and all lies: he did not say “liars,” but “lies,” that is, those who act contrary to nature and falsify the natural beauty of virtue and turn it to spurious transformed forms of evil. 

That the fire is the second death has been mentioned earlier.
