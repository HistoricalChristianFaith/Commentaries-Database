"And if he has wronged you". Paul did not say, "He stole," but the verb is cut short. He says he "wronged" "or owes".

"charge that to me". For it was likely that they themselves had consumed together the things that had been stolen, and Paul says, "charge this to me," that is, charge these things as a debt to me, let the obligation be held against me.

"I, Paul, write". He wrote with spiritual grace, as if he said, But for safe keeping, that I will repay the debt, I have made the letters with my own hand.

"to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well". So that Paul may not seem to insult him by not daring to appeal to him openly on behalf of the runaway slave (for this would show Philemon to be somewhat harsh), it shows that Paul is also very confident in Philemon. For he says not only your own things, but also yourself you owe to me.
