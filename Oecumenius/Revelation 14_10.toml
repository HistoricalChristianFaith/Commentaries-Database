And he says that he will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed undiluted in the cup of His anger. The glorious David also remembers this cup and the wine, saying that "a cup is in the hand of the Lord, full of wine mixed undiluted, and he inclined from it to this: but the cluster of its vintage was not emptied; all the sinners of the earth shall drink." (Ps. 74:9) He says that the wrath of God is wine, not making the metaphor from joy but from darkening and from the change by which those controlled by the wrath of God are restrained.

He says of the mixed thing that it is undiluted. That is, mixed in an undiluted way; for the wrath of God has been mixed with generosity and goodness, it has been mixed undiluted; for there is no equality between anger and goodness, but generosity far outweighs. For if there were equality of both the wrath of the righteous and the goodness, not every living thing would have endured. Knowing this, the prophet said, "If iniquity be observed, Lord, Lord, who will stand before you?" (Ps. 130:3) But since goodness is diverse in the cup of God beyond righteous anger, he again spoke mysteriously, saying: "Merciful is the Lord and just, and our God has mercy." (Ps. 116:5) Having arranged his justice in the middle, so that, by the surrounding compassion being constrained and not forgiven, it may work its proper effects; and this is proper to justice, to give to each according to merit. Having once remembered the wine and therefore called forth the anger, he persisted in that course and named the cup the portion given by the hand of God to sinners. But someone may perhaps say, how do you call the mercy of God many in that judgment at the time when the vision delivered to us, having descended a little, declared that the punishments of those being punished are eternal?
