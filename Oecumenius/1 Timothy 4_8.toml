Train yourself to godliness; for physical exercise is of little profit, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of that which is to come.

Train. That is, accustom yourself.

to godliness. Godliness is the diligence and zeal of life with right faith.

for physical exercise. It makes the body healthy. However, in comparison it is only for a short time.

having promise of the life. Do you see the benefit? That godliness also in the present and in the future life gives life to the spiritual life.
