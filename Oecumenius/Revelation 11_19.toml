And he says that the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. He says that after these things were spoken, hidden blessings and, in addition, certain new mysteries were revealed to the saints; for this is the opening of the Ark of the Covenant. For he indicates that good things are hidden in the coming age, concealed from present human beings, as he says, "what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man," which God has prepared for those who love Him." (1 Cor. 2:9) And again, that there is some mystery and a different knowledge unknown to those now living, the Lord reveals by saying, "I will not drink again from the fruit of this vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father." (Matt. 26:29; Mark 14:25; Luke 22:18)

The saints were deemed worthy of these things, but to the sinners there came flashes of lightning, voices, thunder, earthquakes, and great hail, which constitute the third woe, the future punishments known to us for the impious, and the word alludes to the signs from God.
