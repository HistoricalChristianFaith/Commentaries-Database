When the angels of God took hold of the city of the Sodomites and on that occasion exacted punishment on its inhabitants and the surrounding cities—or rather, as it would seem to the saintly Cyril, when the Son of God and the Holy Spirit visited there, for “the Father judges no one,” as it is written, “but has given all judgment to the Son,” the life-giving Spirit clearly being with him according to nature and essence—then the angels said to holy Lot, “Save your own life. Do not look back nor remain in all the country round about; escape to the mountain, lest you be overtaken together with them.” This is what the Revelation now is also teaching us. For although the servants of Christ are not in one large and populous city, Rome, it says to them, “Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in their sins, lest you share in her plagues.” For to partake of sins is also to partake of the plagues, since the plagues come on account of sins. “For her sins are heaped high as heaven,” it says. This is as though he had said, “And they polluted the air all around with their sins.” And so it says, although God is in every way longsuffering, he has now arisen to give to [the city] its due.
