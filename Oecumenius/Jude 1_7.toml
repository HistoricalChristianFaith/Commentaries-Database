The unnatural lust in which the Sodomites indulged was homosexuality, which is wrong because it cannot lead to procreation. Jude mentions them in order to point out that if God destroyed them, regardless of their earlier state of blessedness, how will he spare us if we act in an ungodly and lustful way? However well-disposed and kind he may be toward us, he is still the righteous God, and because of his righteousness he does not spare those who have sinned against him.
