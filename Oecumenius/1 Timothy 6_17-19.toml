To the rich, in this present age, command not to be arrogant, nor to hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment; to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share, storing up for themselves a good foundation for the future, so that they may obtain eternal life.

For there are also other rich men, but not in this age. The truly rich are the righteous ones, that is.

not to be arrogant, Paul says. For nothing so much inflates and exalts the mind as money and possessions.

nor to hope in uncertain riches. See how he insults them, and how foolish they are. For who hopes for something uncertain?

but in the living God. For Paul says that he who hopes in God is not disappointed.

who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. For he, to whom all things common belong, has given abundantly and freely: heaven, earth, air, life, food. But greed, having taken tyranny as a partner, has seized many of the common things and made them private.

to do good, to be rich in good works. If you seek wealth, seek true wealth, not uncertain. What are these? Goods, Paul says, are easy to distribute; for this is the nature of money.

to be generous. That is, gentle, friendly, modest, and humble.

storing up for themselves. That is, laying down, Paul says, a good foundation. Where the foundation is good, all is safe and secure.

so that they may obtain eternal life. Therefore, for this life, one must lay up the foundation. But how could this be? If by doing good here, we lay up for ourselves the foundation and security of this life. For the practice of good works, which Paul also called a foundation, is able to grant the enjoyment of that life.
