This is the seducer and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward.
"This is the seducer and an antichrist." With this, it must be understood for a more perfect explanation, therefore "who do not confess that," as it should be properly added, "This is the seducer and an antichrist." Without this, the discourse will be disordered and independent, namely passing from the plural to the singular.
This is, John says, an antichrist and seducer. However, by saying, "Those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh," he reveals that he is speaking of those who reject the Lord's coming: since the Lord himself, saying, "Many will come in my name," (Matt. 24:5) does not speak of the first coming, but of the second: Nevertheless, in truth, those who reject the second also reject the first. For if he who came in the flesh also promised a second coming, certainly he who rejects the second also rejects the first: for if he believes that he has come, he would also consider the promise of the one who has come to be certain: but if he despises the promise, it cannot be said in any way that he believes even in the first. Therefore, I believe the beloved disciple used the word "to come," not "to have come," so that he might comprehend those denying both of the Lord's coming in the flesh. Therefore, John instructed them to beware of these: and he adds the reason: "Lest by adhering to them, you lose what you have previously worked for, but receive your full reward without any weakness." But perhaps someone might say in such matters: "What if I do not believe in Christ's coming in the flesh, yet I lead a life in good works, can I not be counted among the pious and religious through these works, nor receive a reward for them?"
