quote='''
If anyone prepared for murders, he will die the spiritual death in the worship of the Devil. Therefore, he says, is the endurance and the faith of the saints. Therefore one becomes innocent of the slavery to the evil one, from which slavery may we all be shown to be free by the grace of the God who called us to the knowledge of Him. To Him be glory to the ages, amen.
