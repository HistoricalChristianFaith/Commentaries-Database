"diverse and strange teachings." Paul says, do not be led astray by teachings that go beyond doctrines, neither different nor strange ones. For the doctrine itself is also recognizable; but to be carried away, as from the metaphor of those who are mad, who are carried here and there, has been said.
"for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace." For the heart established by the grace of God will not be led astray by diverse and strange teachings, but will keep to the truth.
"not by foods." Therefore, by faith, which is active through the grace of God, the heart must be strengthened, not being strengthened in regard to the observance of foods; for those who walk in these observances, that is, those who keep them, have gained nothing from them.It is said that some among them observe the food according to Jewish customs.
"We have an altar." Since Paul said that we should not observe foods, lest they think our offerings are shameful by being unobserved, he says: For do we not also have observances? But not of foods, rather of our altar, namely, of the unbloody sacrifice of the life-giving body. For even the very high priests of the Jews are not permitted to partake of this; for they who serve in the tabernacle, as it were, in the type and shadow, and not in truth.
"from which those who serve the tabernacle have no authority to eat." Not such as the Jewish ones, Paul says, and ours; so that it is not even lawful for the high priest to partake of them.
"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into.” Then Paul shows the solemn things among the Jews, being types of our own, and he says that those sacrifices were nothing, of which the people were prevented from partaking; but neither do the high priests of our law partake of our sacrifice; for those were the ones that they typified. Just as in the sacrifices offered for sin, the blood was brought into the holy place by the high priest; the bodies were burned outside the camp; so also Christ, suffering for the sins of the world, brought his own blood into the holy place to the Father as high priest; but his body was crucified outside the city of Jerusalem, because the bodies of the sacrifices for sin were burned outside the camp. Therefore, this blood is brought in by our high priest to our altar. Thus, it is not permitted for the Jewish high priests to eat from that altar.
