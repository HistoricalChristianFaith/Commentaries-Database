quote='''
There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear: for fear has torment. He who fears is not made perfect in love.
He who genuinely loves God does so not out of fear of punishment, but because of a passionate love for morality and love towards God; yet he does not consider himself safe due to a noble fear, which is the love of what is honorable. Equally, he who acts out of fear of falling into torment is the same as the former; therefore, he adds: "for fear has torment."
