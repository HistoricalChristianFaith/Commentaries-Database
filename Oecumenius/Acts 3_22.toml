Our Blessed Lord was indeed a prophet like unto Moses. The points of resemblance are many. As Moses was born in a strange land, in Egypt, so was Christ born in a world and country which knew Him not, in a city which rejected Him, in Bethlehem. To preserve his life Moses was laid in an ark of bulrushes, as Christ’s’ life was preserved by the lowliness of the manger in which He lay. Both were of the house of Israel, and children, the one of the priestly, the other of the Royal race. The jealousy of Pharaoh put the life of Moses in jeopardy as soon as he was born, as Herod sought the life of Christ because of the same jealous fear, while both kings ordered the male children to be slain, in order to preserve the stability of their respective thrones. Both were mediators between God and a sinful people, and as Moses pleaded for the children of Israel, so does Christ by His death and ascension plead for mankind. Both Moses and Christ were the legislators of God’s people, the former for those under the first covenant, the latter for those under the second. As Moses led the people from slavery into the land of promised to their fathers, so did Christ deliver His people out of the power of Satan, and go before them in heaven. Both Moses and Christ signalized and proved the truth of their mission by miracles and signs.
