The prophet had described for us the fate of those being punished in hades, saying to God, “In death there is no one who remembers you; in hades who will confess you?” He thus indicates that they are deprived of both joy with God and repentance. For spiritual joy comes from the remembrance of God—for somewhere else he says, “I remembered God and was made glad”35—and through confession there is repentance. Confession is the declaration of faults out of sorrow and a conversion that comes from contrition in the soul. Indeed, God has set before us two kinds of life, the present one and the future one. In the present one we are to live according to prudent judgment and authority, while in the future life there are rewards for how one has lived. The present life is not one of judgment, unless someone should perhaps be beneficially reminded and urged toward repentance. Nor is the future life one of works and habits, so that indeed we may be changed from a life filled with accusations into something better. This being the case, how is it then that this verse says of those being punished there, “and the rest of humankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands?” He did not say this for those who did not repent in the life there but for those who are still living and have not repented from such and such evil deeds out of obedience or from the sight of that which will occur then. And by this present plague they will not die the spiritual death—calling punishment “death”—since they endure forever with the wicked, unless they will be punished in another, harsher manner, which he attempted to explain but wisely kept secret. May it be that all of us remain free from such things by the grace and goodness of our Lord, Jesus Christ, with whom be glory to the Father with the Holy Spirit forever. Amen.
