The prophet, plucking his spiritual lyre, told us of those who were being punished in Hades, saying with reference to God that “in death there is no one who remembers you; in Hades who will give you praise?” so depriving them both of joy with God and of repentance. For by not remembering God they were deprived of spiritual joy, as the same prophet writes elsewhere, “I remembered God and I rejoiced,” and through not making confession they were deprived of repentance. For confession is the declaration of offenses resulting from a change of heart and conversion due to the pricking of conscience in one’s soul. 

For in fact, God has given us two kinds of life, the present and the future. In the present we have been permitted to conduct our life according to our opinion and ability, but in the future life we receive the consequent rewards or punishments for the actions of our lives. The present life is not one of judgment, unless someone perhaps may be profitably reminded to turn to repentance, nor is the future life one of behaving in such a way that we may be changed from a debased life to one better. 

This being so, what is the meaning of the present saying about those who are being punished there—And the rest of humankind, who were not killed by these plagues, and did not repent of the works of their hands? He means by this not those who did not repent in their life there, but those who are still living and who did not repent of their various unlawful deeds after hearing and seeing what the future holds. By this aforesaid plague, perhaps they will not die the spiritual death—calling punishment death— while they eternally live out their life with the wicked, unless, of course, they will be punished by something worse, which he has prudently passed over in silence in his attempted explanation. 

May all of us be free of these, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
