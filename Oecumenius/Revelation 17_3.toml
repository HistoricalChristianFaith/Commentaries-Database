"And", he says, "he carried me away in the Spirit into a desert." The desert foreshadows her coming desolation.

"And I saw", he says, "a woman sitting on a scarlet beast." The "beast", he says, is the Devil upon whom it rested, and by whom it was commanded; "scarlet" because it had been stained with the blood of the saints.

And the "beast" was "full of blasphemous names"; for the Devil, who is attributed to it, sins against God in the worship due to God.

He says it had "seven heads and ten horns." He himself interprets these, calling the "heads" and the "horns" kings, both those who reigned in it and those who were to reign.
