The wilderness symbolizes her coming desolation. “And I saw,” it says, “a woman sitting on a scarlet beast.” The “beast” is the devil on whom she was resting and by whom she was being commanded, and it is “scarlet” because she has become red by the blood of the saints. And the beast was full of blasphemous names, for by attributing to himself that worship due to God, the devil sinned against God. “He had seven heads and ten horns,” it says. The Evangelist will explain this later on, saying that the heads and the horns are kings who have ruled in [the harlot] and those who will rule.
