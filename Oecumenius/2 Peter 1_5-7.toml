But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue, to virtue, knowledge, to knowledge, self-control, to self-control, perseverance, to perseverance, godliness, to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love.
The step leads to promotion: first indeed faith, which is the foundation and basis or principle of good things.
Then in the second step virtue or works, for without this faith is dead, as James (2:26) says.
After this indeed is knowledge. What is this? The knowledge of the secrets of God's mysteries, which does not happen to everyone, but to one who is exercised in the habit of better works.
After this is self-control. For this is also necessary for one who has reached the measure, lest he become wanton due to the greatness of the gift. Since it does not happen that one who uses self-control for a short time can firmly possess the gift (for they always desire afflictions to lead them to what is worse), having entered into tolerance completes the whole matter and appeases godliness, producing a more perfect assurance in God: therefore from godliness, brotherly love is sought, which does not approach unless kindness grants access to all things of godliness. And above all, the fulfillment of all good things is love, as it seems to both Paul (Rom. 13:13) and the Truth. For this has both the Son of God and His Father prevailed: indeed, that He might give Him as a beloved Son, but the Son to pour out His blood for us.
