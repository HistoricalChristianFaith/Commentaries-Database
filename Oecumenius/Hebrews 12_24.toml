"and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant." Instead of Moses, here is Christ.
"The sprinkled blood," however, refers to the precious blood of Christ.
"that speaks better than the blood of Abel." For what is the blood of Abel? Did it speak? Certainly. For through it, he says, the dead still speaks (Heb. 11:4), namely in glory and reputation. But concerning the blood of Christ, it is clear that it speaks more through glory, since it is suitable for purifying the whole world. He always, however, makes comparisons from the very smallest things, due to the childishness of those who hear.

For the blood of Abel cries out against the murderer. But that of Christ speaks for us to the Father. Therefore, it is said, "that speaks better than the blood of Abel."
