I write to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for His name's sake. I write to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked one. I write to you, little children, because you have known the Father. I wrote to you, fathers, because you have known Him who is from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
Since John had said: “I write a new commandment to you” (1 Jn. 2:8), it also signifies the nature of those who are to receive the letters: this, however, is designated by progress and promotion according to physical growth. For he knew that not all would receive the message with equal honor nor with equal spirit and zeal: but these, indeed, like little children, more in the manner of instruction; to whom, however, he promises the remission of sins through faith in Christ.
But others, like those who have advanced to the perfect man, to the full stature of Christ, (Eph. 4:3) and live so that they can also make others sons: to whom it is also testified that they have knowledge of him who is from the beginning. But who is he who is from the beginning (1 Jn. 2:8), except the Word of God, which was in the beginning with God? (Jn. 1:1)
Moreover, others are like young men, who, have overcome energetically and strongly against affections and the afflictions of insults, are testified to be about to receive the palm of victory (see Rev. 7:9). Thus, approaching in another way, John repels the same, adapting the discourse of doctrine to the measure of spiritual understanding. Therefore, I say, since I know you will receive in various ways what has been written by me, it is necessary for me to measure my doctrine according to the nature of your age: and with these, certainly as with children who have known the Father, I truly say God: but with those as with fathers, who have something more than children in knowledge, not only that they have known him as a Father, but also as One who is without beginning, and whose beginning no one can describe: for he was in the beginning.
It is right and proper to add more perfect treatises: indeed, to those strong young men, suitable for struggle and contests, to anoint them: to whom, while declaring the clarity of victory, it shows that discussions on theft and military matters are necessary. Thus, therefore, according to the ages, with the spirit tempered by its own discourse: while these were indeed affected by his treatises, others would approach faith in such a way that they ought to be instructed in various ways according to their quality, John subsequently adds a discourse of exhortation, and says:
"Do not love the world." (1 Jn. 2:15) He speaks these things as if to children. For children are always affected by apparent pleasure. Then, stating the reason why one should not love the world and the things that are in the world, he confirms the doctrine handed down to the fathers and the young men: for they are helped by a more perfect disposition. And do not think that he has signified by his discourse what the world is, gathered from heaven and earth; he adds who the world is, and what those things are that are in the world.
And indeed, it says that the world is a vile crowd, which has no love of the Father in it. But what are those things that are in the world? They are the lust of the flesh that are fulfilled by the lust stirred up by the flesh. For the eyes, which hold the foremost place among the senses, encompass everything else as well. All evil revolves around lust: adultery, drunkenness, inappropriate love; arrogance, wanting to surpass everyone, suggested by lust so that whatever arises is accomplished by arrogance; murders, indeed these for greed, those to destroy adversaries; deceit, and these so that whatever is a barrier to us, we undermine by deceit. And to sum it up in one word, whatever is opposed to God is born from the lust of the flesh.
