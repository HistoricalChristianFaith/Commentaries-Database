“A red horse came forth,” urged on by one of the living creatures, and authority was given to the rider “to take peace from the earth, that they might kill one another, and a great sword was given to him.” The red horse is a figure of blood, and so a sword is given to the rider upon the horse so that he might attack and cut to pieces that consensus of evil that exists among those who dwell upon the earth—for among them there is an agreement to idolatry. “That they might kill one another,” that is, that they might slay each other’s eagerness toward increased evil. For the Lord did not come “to bring peace to the earth but a sword” and to set “a son against his father and a bride against her mother-in-law” and the young and pious against the old and accused.
