But there were also false prophets among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Lord who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction. And many will follow their obscene ways, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed. And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their judgment from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
Since prophecy is a common name that refers to both prophets and false prophets, it confirms that false prophets should not be regarded. And Paul differs slightly from this, as he teaches that no one says Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. (1 Cor. 12:3) Therefore, he begins to oppose the heresy against the Nicolaitans, saying that their wickedness is twofold. For they are indeed most impious in doctrine, as their blasphemy against the Lord Christ demonstrates; however, their life is especially obscene. And this he now signifies through shameful gain; however, having progressed a little, he will state it more openly. For now he refers to πλεονεξίαν, that is, greed, signifying shameful gain. For πλαονεξία sometimes signifies injustice, but at other times simply gain. Hence, showing that he speaks more particularly, he added:
"they will exploit you." Completely alienating them from divine doctrine, he said they would use false words. But they will have, he says, the wages of impiety, namely death. Moreover, it is already an indication of the foreknowledge of God. For just as through foreknowledge He prepared good things for the good, so also a fitting place for the wicked.
"who secretly," etc. The order: Those who, summoning swift destruction upon themselves, will secretly lead destructive sects; and denying the Lord who bought them, and through greed negotiating with false words about you.
"is not asleep." He does not cease, nor will he be idle, sluggish, or ineffective.
