Alpha means beginning, and Omega means the end. Therefore he says, “I am the first and the last (Rev. 1:17).” He professes by the first that God has no beginning, and by the last that He has no end. But with there is nothing that is without beginning and end, he says this for us instead of saying, “without beginning nor end.” This is what God also said through Isaiah, “I, God, am first, and for the things coming, I Am.(Is. 41:4)”
