"The alpha" [α] signifies the beginning, "and the omega" [ω] signifies the end; therefore, basically He is saying, "I am the first and the last," indicating through the "first" the God "who is" without beginning, and through the "last," the one "who is" without end. Since there is nothing among humans that is without a beginning and without end, In our case here, He used "the beginning and the end" instead of "being without beginning and without end." This is also what God said through Isaiah: "I am the first God; and I am He who is to come." (Isa. 41:4)

He calls God "the Almighty and Lord of creation," not only of the perceptible but also of the intelligible.
