These things he reminds you of, sincerely charging you before the Lord not to quarrel about words to no profit, which leads to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

These things he reminds you of. So that no one might think these things are unnecessary; concerning these words to Timothy, Paul says, "These things he reminds you of," testifying before the Lord, and it is a fearful thing to speak before God as a witness.

not to quarrel. Since the matter has a certain taste, and the human soul always wishes to dispute and argue, you, Paul says, protesting to them before God, do not engage in argument; instead, he says, command, taking God as a witness, so that they may know that if they despise you, God will judge them.

about words to no profit. For not only does it have no benefit to engage in disputes, arguments, and battles, but it also causes harm to the weaker among those who listen.

present yourself approved. As an example, blameless.

a worker who does not need to be ashamed. Much has been said about this shame. For it is likely that some who are perishing feel shame about the preaching, as the apostles suffer badly, and as Christ is preached with the cross, or at least because the preachers are humble, namely, Paul, a weaver of tents, and Peter, along with several others, were fishermen. The fact that he is not ashamed is because he has done nothing corrupt.

rightly dividing the word of truth. Cut away like a knife the excess and false doctrines, which those perishing have added to the preaching, and lead straight through the Spirit.
