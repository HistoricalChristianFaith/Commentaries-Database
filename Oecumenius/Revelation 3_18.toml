I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may be rich. But what is this gold refined by the spiritual fire? The prophet teaches, saying "the words of the Lord are pure words, like silver refined and tested seven times on the earth" (Ps. 11:7), symbolizing the Gospel proclamation. Therefore, ask from me the one who can make you wise and bring you into harmony with God. For by acquiring this, one will shine forth in virtue and both soul and body will be purified. For this is the new and white garment.

And he says to anoint your eyes with eye-salve so that you may see. This is directed toward those who have dimmed vision concerning the spiritual light of the Lord, reproving them with the words of Jeremiah: "Behold, your eyes are not good, nor is your heart sound." (Jer. 22:17) Therefore, it advises that one should undergo repentance as a remedy for such hardening, just as the barren fig tree undergoes condemnation and a more dishonorable existence because of its manure. (Luke 13.6:9)
