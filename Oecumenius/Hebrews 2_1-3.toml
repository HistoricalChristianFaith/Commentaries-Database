Because, he says, the one who has spoken to us, the Son, is so much greater than the prophets and the angels who served in the Old Testament, we must pay closer attention to what has been spoken by him, rather than as we were inclined to the law.
"Lest at any time we drift away." This is, let us not fall away from what is honorable and from the way that leads to salvation.
"The word spoken through angels." Either Paul speaks of the law as having been given through angels, as he also says in the Epistle to the Galatians: "Ordained through angels," (Gal. 3:19) or administered; or of those things which were said to others by angels: as concerning the Sodomites (Gen. 19:1), as concerning the lamentation in the book of Judges (2:1), when the angel of the Lord came to the Israelites and reproached them for their transgression. "It was necessary," he said, "to remove all these nations from the midst, but you also made treaties with them: therefore the Lord will not destroy the nations that have been left behind." Upon hearing this, they all wept with one heart: therefore, the place was called the Place of Weeping.
But he says, this is of such a nature. For if those things predicted by angels have happened and have come to pass, how much more will those things predicted by the Son of God happen?
“just retribution.” Not that one thing is, and another is not; but every transgression and disobedience received its just retribution, that is, a reward, and nothing remained unpunished. He calls punishment a wage, although normally the term wage is applied to a favorable name; but the apostle does not concern himself with niceties of words.
“how shall we escape” He says, it is this: If what was spoken by angels in the Old Law proved of no effect, and all who sinned received their due, what excuse shall we have, seeing those who received it and yet were careless?
"For if we neglect so great a salvation.” Which does not promise earthly goods like the Old Testament, but the kingdom of heaven and adoption as sons. However, it speaks of salvation which has been demonstrated and revealed by Christ, that is, faith in Him. This, however, it called salvation, showing that what was in the old law was not salvific.
"It was first spoken by the Lord." Paul then shows that it is worthy of faith. For no one else, he says, was a minister of this, as was Moses in the old covenant, but Christ Himself.
"and was delivered to us by those who heard it." They were delivered and believed by those who heard. But who are those who heard? Clearly the divine disciples, the eyewitnesses who became ministers of the word, as Luke also says; for they certainly informed us. (Luke 1:2) Do not take offense; Paul does not say that he himself also heard from Christ, although he did hear.
