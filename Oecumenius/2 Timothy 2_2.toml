And the things you have heard from me among many witnesses, entrust these to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.

and the things you have heard from me among many witnesses. That is, I did not tell you in secret, but openly in the presence of many. This, however, speaks about preaching. to faithful men, Paul says, not to curious investigators, nor to those reasoning by conflict, but to those who do not betray what is entrusted to them. However, he does not say: Speak, but, entrust. For what profit is it if they are indeed faithful, but not suitable to bring forth to others the things entrusted to them? For teachers must be both faithful and competent to teach.

— [PHOTIUS] to faithful men. That is, to bishops, elders, whom Timothy was about to ordain. among many witnesses, that is, of the law and the prophets. [end of the excerpt by Photius O f. 249v; Q f. 119v] —

— [OECUMENIUS] For indeed, as I think, concerning bishops and elders who are about to be ordained by Paul, these things he commands to him. For he would not have written such things concerning laymen. For how would it be, if he did not find anyone faithful and able to teach, that he would not have brought them into the faith, while Paul himself preached the word without deceit to both murderous Jews and Greeks?

among many witnesses. That is, of the law and the prophets. For the Apostle made them witnesses of his own preaching. Thus, Clement in the seventh book of "Hypotyposes." [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 178r anonym; B f. 215v; G f.304r] —

On living in the present life without anxiety about food that comes without labor.
