For, he says, the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has prepared herself. The marriage present with the Lord is still an engagement to the church and not yet a completed marriage. And this the divine apostle associates, writing the second letter to the Corinthians, in which he says: "for I engaged you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ." (2 Cor. 11:2)

Therefore the matter is still an engagement; for "I engaged you": truly. And as the sign of the engagement, we receive "the pledge of the Spirit." (2 Cor. 1:22) When, however, the church becomes one spirit with Christ, just as a husband is one body with his wife, then it is the perfect marriage. For even while philosophizing about the physical marriage, the wise apostle, adducing the scriptural statement that "the two shall be one flesh," brings forward that "this mystery is great; but I say it of Christ and the church." (Eph. 5:31-32)

Therefore the holy angels say: "The marriage of the Lamb has come," signifying then the marriage that will be celebrated in the present engagement; for the Gospel clearly handed this down to us, where first it introduces marriages of a king's son celebrated by the father, and many called to the feast, some partaking of the banquet, others refusing the dinner, and one cast out who was not clothed in a wedding garment (Matt. 22:2-14); Then the same Gospel (Matt. 25:1-13) speaks of ten virgins, of whom five, whom it also calls wise, bringing their lamps to meet the bridegroom for that blessed wedding feast, while the excluded ones, when they had no oil left, extinguished their lamps; none of this is to be understood for the present time, but for the time to come.
