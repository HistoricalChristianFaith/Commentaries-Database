And it was said that the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle, so that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she is nourished for a time, times, and half a time, away from the presence of the serpent. But the woman did not come under the power of Satan; rather, she fled into the wilderness. This, according to the earlier statements (see comments on 12:6), is Egypt. The prophet sought wings like those of a dove, so that, having flown, he might rest in the wilderness (Ps. 54:7-8); but to the all-pure Virgin are given stronger wings, those of the great eagle, he says. He says that the wings of an eagle symbolize the divine visitation of an angel, who urged Joseph to take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, through whose visitation, as if by the wings of an eagle, they reached Egypt. (see Matt. 2:13-23) Having failed in this plot, which he had devised through Herod, the Dragon attempts another against the Virgin, aiming to destroy her son. Subsequently, he narrates the crucifixion and death of the Lord.
