And so, the woman did not come into the control of Satan but fled into the desert. This is Egypt. For this reason the prophet sought “wings like a dove, so that flying away, he might take rest … in the desert.” But to the all-holy Virgin even more powerful wings were given, the wings of the great eagle. By the phrase “wings of an eagle,” he refers to the visitation of the holy angel who urged Joseph to take the boy and his mother and flee into Egypt. By means of this visitation, as though by means of the wings of an eagle, they arrived in Egypt. And since the dragon failed in this plot, which he had devised through Herod, he developed another one against the Virgin, namely, the death of her son. Consequently, the remaining portion of the narrative relates the cross and death of the Lord.
