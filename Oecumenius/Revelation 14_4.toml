He says they were redeemed by the blood of Christ. For the precious blood of Christ has been poured out for all people, yet for some in vain, those who, though able to attain salvation from here, voluntarily deprived themselves of it, of whom the Lord, reproving them through the prophet, says, "What profit is there in my blood in my going down into corruption?" (Ps. 30:9) But concerning those who have been saved and justified, of whom these are the first fruits and the first installment, about whom the present discourse is, and very profitably, and to such a degree as no one could say how great.
