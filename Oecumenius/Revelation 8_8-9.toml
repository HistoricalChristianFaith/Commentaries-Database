The divine apostle, writing to the Romans, says, “the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and obtain the glorious liberty of the children of God.” When will it “be set free”? When there will be “new heavens and a new earth according to his promises,” as Peter preaches to us in his second epistle? 

When the earth is changed so that it might be freed from destruction and become new, it follows that the sea, too, should also change, for the sea is on the earth. But how could it itself be cleansed, except by means of cleansing fire? Therefore, fire falling on it changed it into blood, and it killed a third of the [creatures] in it. 

This is taking a literal, physical view, but you could also understand the sea allegorically and according to the rules of metaphor as referring to the present life because of its turbulence and constant motion; fish and ships are then human beings wriggling in their salty and bitter sins, who will melt away in their grief because of their fruitless concerns in their lifetime.
