The divine Scripture of God explains in detail to us about a certain scroll [βίβλον] in which all people happen to be written, perhaps metaphorically calling the record of our memory before God a "scroll", except that the prophet calls it a small scroll [βιβλίον] saying, "Your eyes have seen my unformed substance; and upon your small scroll all will be written." (Ps. 138:16) Moses, the wisest of all, seeking to atone for Israel's sins, wept and cried out to God, saying: "If you forgive their sin, forgive them; but if not, then erase me from the scroll you have written." (Ex. 32:32)

This divine evangelist sees this scroll written inside and outside. And inside would be those from Israel, written as worshippers of God [θεοσεβεῖς] according to the instruction of the law; outside, and in a worse fate, those from the nations [ἐθνῶν] as idolaters before believing in Christ.

The little scroll was in the right hand of God; the paths of the saints, as I suppose, are those who succeeded in the ancient times. The little scroll was both sealed and secured with seven seals. The seventh, being a perfect number, signifies that the little scroll was sealed and marked very securely. What, then, does it mean that the little scroll is sealed? It means that no one was found worthy to look at it except for a few. For how could what is sealed be revealed, given the transgression in Adam? Rather, the majority, immersed in sin, have prepared the little scroll to be sealed. For there were those (the majority, immersed in sin) who were innumerable, just like the few who were pleasing to God, who were allowed to speak freely; this freedom and the boldness before God inscribed within them all alike was sealed, since "everyone turned away and became corrupt", according to the prophet (Ps. 13:3): for even though a few succeeded and were counted among the righteous in the past, they were merely human and did not become worthy to reclaim for all people the boldness lost through sin. Knowing this, the prophet cried out to God: "In the morning, when You hear the voice of my prayer, in the morning I will stand before You and You will look upon me." (Ps. 5:4) "In the morning", calling to mind the appearance of Christ, "the Sun of Righteousness," (Mal. 4:2) having dispersed the darkness of ignorance. In this, humanity will gain boldness; and not otherwise. So that those who pray may be heard, and may be deemed worthy of this vision, with Christ having removed the sin that separates us from God. Before his visitation to humanity, "every mouth was closed, and the entire world was held accountable to God" according to what is written (Rom. 3:19). Therefore, the deep things recorded in the scroll, as has been said, indicate that the scroll was sealed and closed.
