sealed with seven seals. The number seven, being a perfect number, indicates that the book had been truly and very securely shut and sealed up. The fact that the scroll was closed and sealed indicates, as has been said, the lack of a free approach to God by those whose names were written in the book.

The holy Scriptures depict for us a certain book, in which all of humankind is registered, perhaps calling God’s memory of us a “book,” except that the prophet calls it a “scroll,” saying, “Your eyes saw my unformed substance, and in your scroll shall they all be written.” And the most wise Moses, making propitiation for sinful Israel, weeps and cries out to God, “But now, if you will forgive their sin, forgive, but if not, blot me out of your book which you have written.” The holy Evangelist saw this book written within and without. That written “within” may be those from Israel who are registered as pious through the guidance of the law, while that “without” would be those from the Gentiles who by a worse fate had been idolaters before they believed in Christ. The scroll was in the right hand of God. This is, as I certainly think, the ways of the saints who walked uprightly in the old covenant. The scroll was rolled up and sealed with seven seals. As a perfect number, the seven shows how exceedingly securely the scroll is closed and sealed up.
