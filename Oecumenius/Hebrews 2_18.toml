"For because he himself has suffered and been tempted." The statement is humble and not outside the measures of emptiness. Furthermore, it was said also because of the infancy of those who hear. For what does he say?
For because he himself has suffered, that is, since he himself has been tempted in his own body, he will more willingly help those who are being tempted. As he said: Having learned by experience what it is to fall into temptations, not only as God, but also as a man, having learned by experience the passion (he is able, that is, he will more willingly reach out his hand to those who are being tempted).

He can help those who are being tempted, thus it must be understood. For when, he says, the Evil One attacked the sinless body of the Lord and attempted to surround it with temptations (Matt. 4:1-11); (for he attacked, tempting for his own sake; and he was the one inciting the Jews to murder against the Lord) therefore, since he was tempted and suffered while having a sinless body, he possesses righteous and reasonable strength against the Evil One, and is able to rescue those who are being led by sin from the temptations coming from there, and to become a helper to those who are being tempted. For the boldness of the Evil One against the sinless body provided just and reasonable strength to the Lord, to rescue those under sin from the temptations coming from there, and to be found a helper to those who are being tempted.
