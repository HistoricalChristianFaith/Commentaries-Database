“They shall hunger no more, nor shall they thirst any more.” For, while formerly those from the Gentiles came through every trial, now they will be satisfied with countless blessings. “Nor,” it says, “will the sun strike them.” The sun is used figuratively by some writers of holy Scripture to refer to temptations. For example, the prophet said, “The sun will not strike you by day, nor the moon by night,” or the Evangelist, who wrote that the shining sun scorched that seed which sprouted on the stony soil, interpreting the sun to be temptations. And so also in this present passage, it says that temptation would no longer harm them.
