What does John mean by this? It is exactly what Jesus said: “Whatever you want others to do to you, do the same to them.” Therefore if we want our neighbors to be well-disposed toward us, we must be equally well-disposed toward them. If this is God’s command, how much more ought we to obey it if we dwell in him and are sealed by him? He cannot deny himself, and it must surely be the case that whatever he has asked us to do he has already done or become in himself. Therefore if we do what he says, we know that he will give us whatever we ask and that his gift will be sealed in us.
