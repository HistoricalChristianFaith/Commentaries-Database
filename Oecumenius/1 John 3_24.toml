And let us love one another, as he commanded; and whoever keeps his commandments abides in him, and he in them. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
This is, he says, let us love each other with true affection. And where did he command this? In these words, when he says: "As you wish that others would do to you, do so to them." (Matt. 7:12) Therefore, if we desire that our neighbors are truly and sincerely affectionate towards us, we must be entirely similarly affectionate towards them. If this is the Lord's command, much more if we abide in Him or are established in Him, He will also present Himself to us. (1 Tim. 2:15) For He cannot deny Himself: that is, He cannot be taken away, while He provides us with His commandments, but He first establishes these in Himself. However, if this is the case, certainly if we keep His commands, we will have Him listening to us in all that we ask of Him, and His gift will be firm in us. The whole sentiment of the rule is this: That we believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and love one another truly, as His commandment is.
For whoever keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in them. And by this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit or gift which He has given us. Indeed, as long as this sanctuary remains, we undoubtedly have an indestructible gift of His. But how will it be a sanctuary? If we do not neglect anything of what He has commanded us regarding love.
