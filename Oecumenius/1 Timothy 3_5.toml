If anyone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for the church of God?

Whatever the bishops commanded in these strict matters, not drunkenness, not being violent, but moderation and the like, he who commanded the disciples, "Put to death the members of your body on the earth;" (Col. 3:5) and, "Are some who crucified the flesh of Christ?" (Gal. 5:24) And Christ commanded to take up the cross and follow Him for all. (Matt. 16:24) For why did he not rather command those to be angels, as if according to the measure of mortals? And we say that the highest virtue is of few: but it was necessary to have many bishops, one for each church. Therefore, lest he make the office of bishops, which was necessary, rare or impossible, Paul commands moderate virtue, making the matter itself easy to approach:

how will he care for the church of God. Where there are greater and more numerous affairs.
