I think that he calls the holy angels “stars” because of the abundant brightness of Christ which they have in themselves. They are in his right hand, for they were found worthy of this most exalted status before God and, as it were, they rest upon the hand of God.

“And from his mouth issued a sharp, two-edged sword.” Therefore, the holy David said to the Lord: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty One.” For he did not yet at that time command to us the evangelical precepts, the transgression of which was destruction. Therefore, the place where the sword was put suggests the delay of punishment, for it was not prepared for slaughter. But now the sword comes forth from the mouth, the image showing that those who are disobedient to the evangelical commandments will have a threat to their souls to be cut into two by the sword, which the Lord indeed mentions in the Gospels.
