Therefore, I wish the younger women to marry, bear children, manage the household, and give no opportunity to the adversary to have a cause for slander. For already some have turned aside after Satan.

The good aspect was that, once the widows were instructed, they should not abandon Christ nor reject their initial faith. But since they do this, let them marry, and let them not pledge themselves to Christ, and so let them marry. The former is blameless, the latter is unholy. For their arrogance and looseness of conduct are thus restrained, at least by greater affliction and concern.

and give no opportunity to the adversary. For if they marry correctly, not engaged to Christ beforehand, they will not expose themselves to the occasion of being slandered. Paul did not command them to live without fear in marrying, but that, pressed by cares, they should look to live modestly.

For already some have turned aside after Satan. But why then did you pay such great attention to these things, and even more to those concerning the virgins? Because they, Paul says, gave occasion, turning away after Satan. For he says this not that there are no younger widows, but because he feared lest he might reject Christ.
