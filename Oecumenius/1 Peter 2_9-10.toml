But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people who have obtained mercy, that you may proclaim the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light: who once were not a people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy.
"But you are a chosen generation." After criticizing the wickedness of the morals of the unbelievers, and that they had become the cause of their own unbelief, Peter now turns to praise those who had excelled, saying: You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood: as if to say: They, indeed, through their hardness and disobedience have stumbled upon the cornerstone, but they were not co-built; but you, on the contrary, have been built up into a royal priesthood through obedience: as a chosen generation, as a holy nation. But let them not dissolve themselves with excessive praise: and furthermore, let them not seem to have a certain inherited right as if they were a holy people and the other things that follow: and that they were considered worthy of such honor because they were of the lineage of Abraham, nor had they ever stumbled, he adds, suppressing their pride, and says: Do not be exalted because of your lineage; for you were not chosen for the royal priesthood because of Abraham: for those who descended from him had a priestly tribe distinct from the royal one: therefore, you were not chosen as a people and a lineage, separated for the royal priesthood because of Abraham: for none of these things were said about Abraham, but because of Christ, who is also called a priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 109:4), a gentle king, just and saving; (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:5) who also rode on the colt of an ass.
Therefore, to those who have both, by the merit of the sacred baptismal rebirth, you are called a chosen generation and a royal priesthood. This you have from Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Therefore, through your works made in the light, announce His virtues to other men. Thus, you have this from His kindness, since you are a people who once were not a people: and who have obtained mercy, you who once were not a people have now obtained mercy. Moreover, to ensure that the word is more devoid of hatred, it confirms the word of reproach from Hosea, "Therefore, announce His virtues through good works." (Hos. 2:1) But how do they announce? The Lord Himself teaches when He says: "Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." (Matt. 5:16)
"a people who have obtained mercy," that is, to possession or inheritance. Indeed, all are God's creation, but the possession belongs only to those who are deemed worthy of this benefit by their own deeds, "that you may announce His virtues." Therefore, He says, you are chosen, so that by obedience you may be called heralds of the virtue of Him who called you.
