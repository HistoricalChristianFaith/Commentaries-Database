This is addressed to those who would wonder, How do you say you have an altar? For what was offered upon it? And indeed, Christ himself, whom you claim was offered above and below, that he became a sacrifice for the world and an offering, was not himself sacrificed upon your altar; for it is evident that he suffered outside the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, to these, Paul says, Yes, he suffered outside, but through this it is rather established that we have an altar. For even among them, the Jews, the bodies of those being sacrificed are not burned on their altars, but outside the camp. And again, for this reason he suffered outside the gate, so that he might sanctify all, and not only the priests. If he became a sacrifice for all, how is it not also an altar?
The phrase, in order to sanctify the people, gives another meaning. Paul says that those who serve at the tabernacle have no authority to eat from our altar, not because it is impossible for them, but because they consider themselves unworthy in their own opinion; since from the love of Christ, they are not only not hindered, but also have suffered for this very reason. For he says, in order to sanctify the people, not this one, or that one, but the whole people, and make them have authority to eat from his altar, he suffered outside the gate.
