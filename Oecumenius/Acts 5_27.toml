The angel's freeing them from prison for the apostles on the one hand appeared as an encouragement, for the Jews really as [a tactical] expediency. The Jews, however, were unaware that the power was a divine one, so at first they met in the confusion of what they should do, whether they wished them to be arrested and [whether] they themselves might besides gain an understanding. To such a extent truly were they confused [/blinded], that neither were they prepared forcibly to remove from the temple the apostles, whom they nevertheless detested.
