“I know your works,” the Lord says, “you are neither cold nor hot.” He who is fervent in the Spirit is “hot,” for the holy apostle speaks of those who are “fervent in the Spirit.” Likewise, he who lacks the power and indwelling of the Holy Spirit is “cold.” But you, he says, “are lukewarm.” He calls that person “lukewarm” who in baptism received the communion of the Holy Spirit but has quenched that grace through sloth and attention to temporal matters. And so, this divine directive: “Do not quench the Spirit.” Would that you would be either “hot,” aglow by the work of the Spirit, or totally “cold,” unbaptized and utterly void of the Spirit’s grace, but not “lukewarm”! For the person who has the mental fire of the Spirit comes to maturity, since the senses have been trained to distinguish that which is good from that which is evil, and that person is spiritual. And that person who has never received the grace of the Spirit, yet may hope at some time to receive it, and so is not counted among the hopeless. But that person who is “lukewarm” is moribund and moving toward death, and risks losing both baptism and the previous zeal.
