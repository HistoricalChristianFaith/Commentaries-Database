But know this, that in the last days difficult times will come. For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, ungrateful, unholy, without natural affection, uncommitted, devilish, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, reckless, snobbish, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from these turn away.

Even in the days of Moses, there were Jannes and Jambres (Ex. 7; 2 Tim. 3:8), as he says: for this is what the words about the golden and pottery vessels signify. Therefore, these types always exist, but especially in the last times.

difficult times. It is not the times or the days that are to blame, but the wicked people living in them. For we call times good or bad based on what happens in them.

lovers of themselves. This is the root of wickedness, to consider only oneself. And those who are such, neglecting their brothers, first destroy their own.

arrogant. From lovers of themselves are lovers of money. From these offspring are the boastful and the proud, then from these, blasphemers. For evil types cling to each other just as those who are good do. For all good proceeds from love.

disobedient to parents. For arrogance is known to be carried even against nature.

ungrateful. The greedy are also ungrateful. For they give thanks only when they have fulfilled their desire, but it never happens that they themselves are satisfied. But he who is such is also impious. For he who does not have gratitude towards God the Benefactor [εὐεργέτῃ2], how will he show gratitude to others?

without natural affection. Like those who are hostile towards their own.

uncommitted. It shows that they have made no agreement with anyone.

devilish. Like slanderers. For he who is conscious of no good in himself curses and slanders everyone, finding some comfort for himself in this.

without self-control. Namely those who do not control their tongue, stomach, and those things which are under the stomach.

brutal. Some are harsh and cruel.

despisers of good. That is, enemies of all things good.

traitors. One who betrays friendship and companionship.

reckless. That is, rash and having nothing stable.

snobbish. That is, full of arrogance.

lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. Exchanging the love of the divine for something shameful. Indeed, the very form of holiness exposes both hypocrites themselves and deceivers.

having a form of godliness. From those who speak, they seem to be cultivators of godliness: but from those who act, they are found and convicted to be contrary to their words.

And from these turn away. As for those, about whom Paul passed over without going into detail. But writing to Timothy, he advises those with Timothy to avoid such people. For he would not have come to the last days, but rather immediately after the death of Paul, in which Timothy was still to be involved.
