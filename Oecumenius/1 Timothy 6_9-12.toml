But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and many foolish and harmful desires, some of which plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all evils; by craving it, some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains. But you, O man of God, flee these things; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness. Fight the good fight of faith; take hold of eternal life, to which you were called, and you made the good confession before many witnesses.

Paul does not speak of those who use wealth well, but of those who desire it. And the desirer would not share it with another, so that the things of desire would not be diminished for him.

who desire to be rich. For wealth flows abundantly, and having power, it leads to unreasonable desires.

some of which plunge people. To the point of no recovery anymore.

some have wandered away. For desire darkens the eye of the soul and does not allow it to walk straight.

and pierced themselves. For greed, like a thorn, causes the hands of the one who touches to bleed.

with many pains. Not only, Paul says, does the desire to be rich obstruct matters concerning God, but it also physically weakens the lovers, surrounding them with cares, sleeplessness, and fears.

But you, O man of God. Great is the dignity. For all men are servants of God, especially the righteous, not only according to the reason of creation, but also according to that of adoption.

flee these things. Both with emphasis; for Paul did not say, "Avoid this one, but approach that one," but rather, "Flee and pursue."

pursue righteousness. To have no more than is sufficient for life.

godliness. In doctrines.

faith. Without controversies.

love. The offspring of faith, towards God and men. The order of the statement is good. For from faith, love is born; and from love, patience. And patience, as it walks, makes gentleness.

Fight the good fight of faith. The fight of faith, both what has been said, and the courageous one in trials. And immediately the reward of such a fight, eternal life.

to which you were called. For everyone who comes to baptism is called to this.

the good confession. Rather confession, it refers to that in baptism, when we confess to renounce the Devil and to join and believe in Christ.

A command about purity, obedience until the end.
