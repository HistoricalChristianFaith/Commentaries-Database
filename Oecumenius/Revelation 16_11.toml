And he says that they gnawed their tongues because of the fire. This is accustomed to happen in every utmost distress, if indeed the tongues or some part of the body are accustomed to be taken away by the teeth, they think that it will lessen the other pain. They too must repent, if not for any other reason, then at least because of the overthrow of the Antichrist, whom they have appointed for themselves as king and god, and because they have blasphemed the true God by the deposition of the imposter.
