By this we know that we are of the truth, and before Him we shall assure our hearts. For if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and knows all things. Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God; and whatever we ask, we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and do those things that are pleasing in His sight. And this is His commandment: that we should believe on the name of His Son Jesus Christ.
"By this we know." By what? From the fact that we do not love in word, but in action and in truth. And what do we know? That we are of the truth. How? For he who says one thing and does another, not having an action conforming to his speech, is a liar and not truthful.
"and before Him we shall assure our hearts." That is to say, what John means is that by this, namely that we are truthful (furthermore, we will be truthful when our actions continue according to our words), we will assure our conscience, for he wishes to signify this by “hearts”.
And how shall we assure? By placing this among ourselves, as we express our words with God as our witness. For this means in His sight, or before Him. Indeed, if we do not do so, John says, but our conscience or heart condemns us, it does not hide that we are sinning. If our conscience, which is small as it comes from a small creature, cannot be hidden while we sin, much more can God, who is limitless and everywhere, not be hidden. Therefore, the whole discourse is this: My little children, let us not lie to one another, loving only in word, but let us also show our love through actions: for by this we will be known that we are of the truth, that is, from God; and let us speak as if God were watching. Indeed, no one, even if he were more shameless than demons, could bear to lie in the presence and sight of God.
For if we do not act so, but by saying that we love, our heart will accuse us of falsehood; we err. How? By thinking that God is hidden, who is present everywhere? And not knowing that if it cannot be that our heart, when it is small, is hidden, much less will He be hidden who is never absent.
Therefore, after we have prepared ourselves in such a way, beloved, that we are not condemned by ourselves, namely in being truthful with one another, we will have confidence towards God: through which confidence, whatever we ask, we will receive entirely from Him. Why?
because we keep His commandments: for this is of utmost importance for obtaining what is requested, namely the obedience of those who ask, when it has been without any hesitation, towards Him to whom the request is directed.
Since therefore we also keep His commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in His sight, let us trust that we shall not suffer rejection in our requests: since the affection that is in both parties greatly desires to repay the service that comes to the use of the other. And what commandment do we keep? That which says: Have mutual love among yourselves. (Jn. 13:35)
Therefore, since we have received the command to love one another with the faith that is in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, we have done this; through this we know that the grace He has given us through His Spirit is firmly established in us. It should be noted that it is often found in the New Testament, "Believe in the name of our Lord Jesus." (Act 16:31) But what does this name mean? Nothing other than glory, purpose, or good reputation. Indeed, glory and good reputation, as when it is said: "How wonderful is your name in all the earth (Ps. 81:1):" purpose and will, as in this place, and when it is said: "Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus." (Acts 2:38) For that is, in His will. But what is the will of the Lord Jesus? “That all nations be baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 28:19)
