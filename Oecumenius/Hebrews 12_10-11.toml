"And indeed they disciplined us for a few days.” For they cannot always teach us to make us perfect; but God, who always educates and corrects, makes us perfect. For the death of a father or the growth of a son halts correction.

“to what seemed right to them.”What seems good to the father does not always benefit the son: for often they teach even disgraceful arts.
"however, here for our benefit." Moreover, God always seeks our effectiveness. For He does not bestow as if to receive something from us, like earthly fathers, but rather to give, and to give not something mediocre, but holiness, that is, purity: so that as much as possible, we may become worthy of it.
"But every chastisement." Again, from common understanding, he takes opportunities for encouragement and says: "every chastisement," not only spiritual but also bodily, "does not seem to be a cause of joy." He rightly says, seem: for it is not truly sorrow; for how could it properly be sorrow, when it is the mother of joy? But as if speaking to us, he said: It seems, for we bear discipline and chastisement heavily.
"Yet afterwards." For after this present chastisement, there will be peace in the future, joy and righteousness and whatever is of this kind.
