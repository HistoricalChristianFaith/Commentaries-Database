quote='''
He does not call them blessed who are readers alone, because there would be many who would be blessed because there were many readers, but it is meant for those who hear and keep the warnings in the prophecy, and those who faithfully keep and observe its commands as divine laws. 

For he says, the time is at hand. For everyone who keeps the commandments of God the time of blessedness is at hand. That is what he means or he could mean that the conclusion of what he said is close at hand. What is meant by at hand has already been explained.
