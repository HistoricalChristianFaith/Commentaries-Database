"do not deny the one speaking." This is due to disbelief or despair. Who is the one speaking and calling to his own kingdom? It is Christ, obviously. For if his blood speaks, much more he lives.
"For if they did not escape." The danger, that is, the loss. The danger, that is, the loss.

"having refused the one warning on earth," or the one who engages in earthly matters, promising the earthly and temporary, flowing with milk and honey, the dominion of enemies, good upbringing, and a long life.
“from the one from heaven,” he speaks, promising the same heaven as an inheritance, granting the enjoyment of that overwhelming glory and eternity. It is possible to say: On earth, to engage in matters, since almost all of the physical purifications were found in the lawgiving through Moses. The new law given to us through Christ is a cleansing and illumination of the soul. Therefore, those things are said to be on earth, as they are humble and related to the material body. But these things are from heaven, as they are divine and lofty, purifying the soul and elevating it to the heavens.

For on earth, it is said that Moses speaks. He says, This is the case: If the Jews, having rejected the message of Moses, did not escape destruction, how shall we escape if we reject the one who speaks from heaven, that is, Christ? Is it not because, while the law was given by another long ago, now another speaks, and calls to his kingdom and faith, but because he is more fearful now, speaking from heaven and by himself, than he was before, when he spoke from the earth through Moses, from whom he is more justly to be heard?
That the former lawgiver is not different from the one speaking now, he himself makes clear by saying, “whose voice then shook the earth.” When? He says, when he gave the law on Mount Sinai.
"but now has promised, saying." Do you see that the same one is both then and now? But the difference is in the manner of his preaching. For then he proclaimed from the earth and through Moses, but now from heaven and through himself.
"who turn away from the one from heaven." In common, that which is speaking, as in proclaiming.

"Yet once more I shake," that is, "once more," clearly, that which comes after the second, is added another once. For previously the world was shaken at the lawgiving in Sinai. "Indeed, the earth shook," says David (Ps. 68:8). Again, during the presence in the flesh; the world will be shaken; for "all Jerusalem was shaken." (Matt. 21:10)
"And the handmade things of Egypt shall be shaken." (Isa. 19:16) By "shaking," it is said to be the renowned nature of the preaching, by which they were shaken from their former state of wandering and the people were transformed. Therefore, speaks holy Cyril: But the "yet once more," he says, will be at his second glorious coming, when he will transform and renew creation; for then creation will be shaken most truly, the true shaking and uproar or the transformation from evil to good of those then being saved. Refer also to the commentary of the blessed Cyril on the Song of Songs.

"as of things that are made," that is, those suffering according to nature. For since it takes a beginning and reaches an end, he says, as of things that are made. For since it has been made, and it began from motion, that which comes from non-being to being will reasonably be shaken and moved again in the change.
“so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.” The creation shakes and alternates, so that the unshakable may remain; that is, those that will no longer be shaken or changed; as if it were saying: Therefore, it shakes and alternates the creation, so that in the future the unshakable may remain in its place, no longer subject to shaking or changing. The unchanging, therefore, rightly will no longer be subject to shaking. For once it has received the first change, it will be incorruptible.
