The phrase “yet once more” makes clear that another “one time” would be added after the second. For the world was shaken for the first time when the law was given on Sinai: “For the earth shook,” David said. Again the earth was shaken during the sojourn in the flesh: “For all Jerusalem was shaken” and “the idols of Egypt built by human hands.” And he calls an earthquake that which was heard of the proclamation, through which people were shaken from their old condition in error and brought into a new condition. So says Cyril. He speaks of yet one more occasion, namely, at his second coming with glory, when he will alter and change creation. For then creation will especially be shaken with a real shaking and crash—a more drastic change than of people who were corrupt at the time turning from evil to good.
