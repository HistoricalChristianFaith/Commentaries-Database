He said, But no one in Heaven, on earth, or under the earth was able to open the little scroll. For neither an angel accomplished these things for us, as Isaiah says; "neither an elder nor an angel, but he himself saved them because he loved them," (Isa. 63:9) neither a living man, nor any of the dead. "A brother is not redeemed, a man shall not redeem himself," as it is written somewhere (Ps. 48:8). And what do I mean by saying to open the little scroll, when no one among men was able to look at it? For how could anyone filled with the mist of sin gaze upon the divine throne before which the little scroll was placed?
