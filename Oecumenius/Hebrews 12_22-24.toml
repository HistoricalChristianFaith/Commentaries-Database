"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to multitudes of angels.” Instead of the people of Judah, angels are present. And he says there is a festive gathering among the multitude of angels. He also speaks of the firstborn, the faithful, whose names are written in the book of life. For this is what the Lord also says to the disciples: “Rejoice because your names are written in heaven." (Luke 10:20)

He calls the firstborn holy, who have something excellent beyond other faithful ones who have received adoption from the firstborn who are among us, who by the right of the firstborn have some special birthrights.

"and to God the judge of all."As if he were saying: They did not even dare to listen to the word; but you, on the other hand, have approached the very judge, that is, Christ. "For the Father," he says, "does not judge anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son." (Jn. 5:22) —
"and to the spirits of the righteous." For you will be with them, who have come to the New Testament. Paul calls them, as those who will then have their perfection, just as he says above: "Lest they be made perfect without us.” (Heb. 11:40)
"and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant." Instead of Moses, here is Christ.
“The sprinkled blood,” however, refers to the precious blood of Christ.
"that speaks better than the blood of Abel." For what is the blood of Abel? Did it speak? Certainly. For through it, he says, the dead still speaks (Heb. 11:4), namely in glory and reputation. But concerning the blood of Christ, it is clear that it speaks more through glory, since it is suitable for purifying the whole world. He always, however, makes comparisons from the very smallest things, due to the childishness of those who hear.

For the blood of Abel cries out against the murderer. But that of Christ speaks for us to the Father. Therefore, it is said, “that speaks better than the blood of Abel."
