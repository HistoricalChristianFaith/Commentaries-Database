Be subject therefore to God, but resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Approach God, and he will approach you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners: and purify your hearts, you double minded. Be miserable, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning: and joy, into sorrow. Be humbled in the sight of our Lord, and he will exalt you.
"purify your hearts, you double minded." 'Double of mind' refers to those who do not wish to live in a certain way but are driven and carried away by the wickedness of men. For they do not dwell in the house under the Lord in one way. Moreover, that the soul is also called life will be sufficiently taught to us in Job. "Skin for skin, all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life." (Job 2:4)
