It consequently expresses what faith is, and says: Faith is the substance and essence of those thingswhich arehoped for. For since those things that exist in hope cannot be perceived, as they are not present in the meantime, faith is a certain essence and substance of them, causing them to be and in a way to become present, because one believes them to be. Moreover, faith is the proof and demonstration of things that are not seen. For faith presents visible things that are invisible. How? By the mind itself seeing those things that do not appear.

“for by it the elders have obtained a good report.” By faith, they received a report from God that they were pleasing to Him.

"the elders." Who are they? About whom Paul is about to speak.

"Through faith we understand that the ages were formed." For what reason could this be demonstrated? Therefore, it is necessary to persuade oneself by faith:

"so that what is seen was not brought into being from anything visible." For what word will demonstrate that those things were brought into being from what was not visible?None; but faith alone. Therefore, by faith we understand the ages to have been framed, that is, to have come into being, by the word of God. Why, by faith? So that the visible things did not come from things appearing; because the visible things came from things not appearing; the man of faith is needed.

"Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice." For whose example did Abel honor God, except that he believed by faith that there would be a compensation for these things?

"by which he obtained a report that he was righteous." For when God said to Cain, "If you offer rightly, but do not divide rightly," (Gen. 4:7) He testified concerning Abel that he both offered rightly and divided rightly. It is also said that fire descended from heaven upon his burnt offering.

"and by it he being dead." Indeed, the victim was the occasion for the slaughter itself.

[PHOTIUS] What is said: "and by it he being dead yet speaks," or it is understood that this victim was the occasion for envy and rivalry against his brother: moreover, this gave rise to murder. Or that he speaks through him, although dead: For this reason, it has become the cause for Abel to be remembered and regarded as unfailing. Or, if someone examines both more closely, taking into account that, through it, as it is referred to both being Dead yet Speaks: so that the meaning is: By itself or because of itself the dead host still speaks through it.

[PHOTIUS] "yet speaks." He is immortal; his deed, done through faith, does not allow him to fall into oblivion, he says. [end of the Photius excerpt]
