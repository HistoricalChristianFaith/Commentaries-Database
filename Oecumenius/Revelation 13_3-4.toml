The inspired Evangelist himself would know the meaning of this. But, as it seems to me, the meaning is something like this. The death-bearing wound which the devil received on one of its heads was because of the reverent worship of Israel. But this was healed through their subsequent idolatry. “And the whole earth followed the beast with wonder.” How would this not be the case, since even the pious people of Israel came to worship him? And this is indicated in Isaiah, who in the person of God speaks to Israel: “Because of you, my name is forever blasphemed among the nations.” But with the beast they worshiped also the dragon who is the instigator and cause of such deception and deleterious wiles.… Those from Israel whom he conquered devise for him songs of praise, saying, “Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?”
