In Exodus, God speaks to holy Moses: “I am the Lord. I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac and to Jacob, being their God, but I did not reveal to them my name, the Lord,” showing that it is to be regarded as superior to any report of man. And for this reason, the Lord also handed over to his apostles how those who had turned to the knowledge of God ought to be baptized, saying, “baptizing them in the name.” And when he said “name,” he did not transmit the proper names—for he had no power to give utterance to their names. Rather, instead of the proper names, he transmitted relational and personal names, for he spoke names of relation when he said, “in the name of the Father and of the Son,” while he added a personal name, “and in the Holy Spirit.” Therefore, most definitely, also in the Revelation he allows the proper name of the Only Begotten to remain unknown to everyone.
