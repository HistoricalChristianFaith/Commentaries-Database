And his eyes, he says, are a flame of fire. The wrath against the enemies, he shows by the burning of the eyes.

And on his head he says many crowns, as many certainly as there are orders reigning in heaven and on earth.

He says he had a name written, that no man knew but himself. God says in the Exodus of the seventh day to the prophetic Moses: "I am the Lord who appeared to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob being their God; and I did not declare to them my name, the Lord," (Ex. 6:2-3) as clearer than or capable of being conveyed by human hearing. Therefore, and as the Lord instructed the apostles to baptize those returning to the knowledge of God, he said, "baptizing them into the name," and by saying "name" he did not hand over the proper names; for he did not have the strength to sustain their proclamation, but instead he delivered it in relational and nominative terms in place of the proper names, relational when saying "into the name of the Father and of the Son," and nominative when also invoking "and of the Holy Spirit." (Matt. 28:19) Therefore, very securely and in the Revelation the divine name of the Only-Begotten is allowed to be unknown to all.
