Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope, To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

Paul still shows modesty now at the beginning when he says, I did not come on my own initiative, but was commissioned by God. But where was he commissioned? In the Acts of the Apostles, where the Spirit says, "Set apart for me Saul and Barnabas," (Acts 13:2) and there the Lord says to him, "I am sending you far to the Gentiles." (Acts 22:21) But whatever the Son or the Spirit commanded, he says the Father commanded these things. For it is the will of the Holy Trinity.

and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope. The apostles say that we suffer much, but we have God as our Savior, and Christ as the Savior of our hope. For the term "Savior" is to be understood commonly. For He Himself provides, they say, the hope that we will be saved.

a genuine child. Wow! The faith that Timothy demonstrated, that even through it he became a genuine child of Paul! For nothing changed according to the faith.

Grace, mercy. Here mercy is prayed for, not as usual, showing both the desire towards it, and that teachers need more mercy.

On the guidance into the love of God, which is not required by legal necessity.
