Brothers, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning. Again, I write a new commandment to you, which is true in Him and in you: because the darkness is passing away, and the true light is already shining. He who says he is in the light and hates his brother is in darkness until now. He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him. But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
It concerns the love for one's neighbor, and it states that the connection to God or love is first known through love for one's neighbor. For it cannot happen that one who has been enlightened by the knowledge of God and filled with His love has darkness due to hatred against his brother. Indeed, light and darkness cannot coexist in the same and according to the same. Therefore, one who is illuminated by love for God is ignited towards the love of his brother, and having God, he also has light towards his brother.
He who says he loves God and hates his brother is in continuous darkness, always blind in his intellectual eyes as one who has lost the light that was from the connection with God and with his brother: nor does he know how to proceed thereafter. Since this letter was general and directed commonly to all, both Jews and Greeks: to the Jews indeed he directs his speech when he says, "I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old one," speaking of love. For it is written in the tablets of Moses: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself." (Lev. 19:18) To the Greeks, indeed (let someone say), what is written about the ancient commandment, when this is found nowhere? Therefore, we say that there was also a written law concerning love for neighbors. Where and how? Indeed, it is written on the tablet of the heart through natural understanding. And that the natural intelligences sown in us are called law, Paul is correct to confirm this statement, who says: "I see another law opposing the law of my mind which is in me." (Rom. 7:23) The law, therefore, or the old commandment, was also received by the Greeks, as nature itself is a lawgiver, that they should be kind to all relatives and love one another, inasmuch as man is a social animal: which could not happen without love. Moreover, the ancients write in history that many men have exposed themselves to death for one another. Our Savior gives a greater sign of love when he says, "Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends." (Jn. 15:13) Thus, concerning the commandment of love for one's neighbor, which has long been established for both Jews and Greeks, John says: "Besides the old commandment that you heard about loving your neighbor, I am writing a new commandment to you: which is true in him who made you familiar with God, and in you who have communion with Him. For he himself says: “I have come as a light into the world,” (Jn. 12:46) and the true light, according to his word, now shines (Jn. 1:9); furthermore, in the light, darkness cannot stand (Jn. 1:5): let the true light of love shine from now on (Matt. 5:16), with genuine affection towards your brother, and let the darkness of hatred pass away, that is, let it depart, let it perish."
The phrase means passing away also, as the blessed Paul, where he says, “For the form of this world is passing away.” (1 Cor. 7:31) — In another manner concerning this: “I write a new commandment to you." This commandment is new, in that the commandment of Moses was not universal, but distinct according to those who were of the same kin or tribe, urging to love only friends (Lev. 19:18), while having hatred for enemies, as it says: "You shall love your friend and hate your enemy." (Matt. 5:43) The command of the Lord and His apostles, however, is very new, instructing: "Love your enemies and do good to those who hate you," (Luke 6:27) holding to natural existence, and not to that natural affection which clings to wicked men given over to evil arts out of malice.
"he who hates his brother." This kind of thing is said in these words: He who says he is of Christ and hates his brother is a liar and is not of Christ. For if Christ loved him so much that he laid down his life for him, how can he who claims to be of Christ hate his brother for whom Christ died? Or even in this way: Whoever says he is of God and hates his brother who is Christ (for he himself says, "I will declare your name to my brothers" Ps. 21:23) is not of God, but of the Devil. For if he were of God, he would surely love his brother, and thus also Christ.
