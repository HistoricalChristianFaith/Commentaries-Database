For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed. For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
"but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously," namely God, who gives to each according to their works (Rom. 2:6): this is just. But perhaps someone will say: How does Peter now say that the Lord, when he was being reviled, did not return reviling, and when he was suffering evil, did not threaten? Yet we see him calling some Jews dogs (Matt. 7:16; 15:26), and blind Pharisees (Matt. 15:14; 22:16), and threatening the Jews when he said: "It would be better for that man if he had not been born;" (Matt. 26:34) and: "It will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city;" (Matt. 10:15) and: "Where their worm does not die," (Mark 9:48) and countless other things. We will say, therefore, that he does not say the Lord did not speak reviling, or did not threaten: but, when he was being reviled, he says he did not return reviling, and when he was suffering evil, he did not threaten. But although he might have uttered some reviling, he was not opposing those who reviled him, but reproaching and rebuking those who did not convert. However, when he was affected by reproaches and heard: "You have a demon," (Jn. 7:20; 8:48) and: "By the prince of demons he casts out demons," (Matt. 7:24; 9:34) and: "Behold, a glutton and a wine-drinker," (Matt. 9:19) did he direct reviling against them, saying something reproachful against them? Not at all, but he indeed said to them: "If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out?" (Matt. 7:27) Indeed, this man, a ravenous eater and drinker of wine, opposed the parable of the indignant children in the marketplace against those with whom they conspired, that when they played the flutes, they did not dance; when they sang lamentations, they did not weep. However, crucified and afflicted by punishments, he prayed rather than threatened the Jew before he would betray, and being affected by some evil, he threatened, restraining him from evil intent. Similarly, he showed those who would not receive the disciples that they would suffer something worse than the Sodomites: partly indeed urging them towards hospitality, partly opening a place for the preaching of the Gospel through fear. Therefore, he did not threaten these things while he was being afflicted by evils; and the word of Peter concerning the Lord's mercy is very true, saying that he did not bring any accusation against anyone while they attempted to accuse him.
"As dead to sins." For having become estranged by sins, (ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἀπογενόμενοι), it is taken for ἀποθάνοντες, that is, dead.
"by whose stripes you were healed." For having been scourged by Pilate, he also bore scourges in the body.
