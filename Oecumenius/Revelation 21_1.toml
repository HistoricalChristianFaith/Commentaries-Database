In his second letter Peter speaks in a similar way: “According to his promise we wait for new heavens and a new earth.” They do not say this as though heaven and earth and sea are destroyed and pass into nonexistence and that other things come into being in their place. Rather, they mean that the present realities have cast off their corruption and become new, putting off their filth as though it were an old and dirty garment. For that is called “new” which is not such as it was formerly but is as it has now become. The creation shall then be free of every corruption that it contracted through the transgression of humankind. The holy apostle is also a very trustworthy witness to these things when in his letter to the Romans he writes this about the [new] creation: “For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of him who subjected it in hope, because the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay unto the glorious liberty of the children of God.” And not only he, but also the holy prophet sang of the heaven and the earth in the testimony just presented: “They will all wear out as a garment, and as a vesture you will fold them, and they will be changed.”
