He says, And the city has no need of the sun: for those who enjoy the divine and spiritual light have no need of perceptible light: in their new abode the saints are aware of their spiritual blessings. 

And by its light, he says, shall the nations walk— not only the nations, but also the saints from Israel who have believed. But since those from the nations are much more numerous, his reference to the majority indicated both Jews and gentiles. 

And the kings of the earth bring their glory and honor into it: he calls all the saints kings of the earth, of whom Scripture says, “When the Heavenly One gives the orders, kings will be covered with snow in Salmon,” as has been mentioned earlier. Whatever, therefore, these have of glory and honor—by which he means their virtuous exploits—they will dedicate to that holy city, as though he said that their virtuous good deeds continue with the life of the saints. 

He says, And its gates shall never be shut by day: there is a double thought here: either this means that there will be peace and freedom from fear, so that there will be no need of a guard over the city and the gates need never be closed or secured by bars, or that the apostolic teachings (for we have called the apostles “gates”) will not be silent there, and that the apostles will be there, too, as teachers of new and more divine doctrines to the saints. For since they are “sons of the day and of light,” the righteous will revel in the divine and illuminating praises and mysteries since they are constantly wrapped in daylight and the light of divine brilliance. 

He says, There shall be no night there: if the divine brilliance was ever interrupted, it would then also be night. But if it is impious to suggest this, since the divine light operates without interruption, how can it ever be night for the saints?
