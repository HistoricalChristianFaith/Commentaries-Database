The white horse is a symbol of the gospel, since through it good deeds will be done to humanity. The crown is an image of strength and victory. And [the white horse] went out to bring the crown to Christ, who had begun to conquer the devil who had placed our race under bondage. “He went out,” he says, “conquering and to conquer.” Christ was he who was conquering that he might conquer utterly and totally, and he brought the crown as a symbol of victory to him.
