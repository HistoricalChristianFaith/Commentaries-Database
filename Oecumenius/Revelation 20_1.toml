I saw another angel descending from heaven, holding the key of the abyss and a chain, and having seized he says the Devil was bound and cast into the abyss. As on a painted canvas the things that were spiritually affected by the Lord against the Devil are shown to the evangelist. For since the things that are spiritual could not be seen by a man, John being a human, the events are portrayed to him bodily: an angel having a chain and bonds binding the Devil and casting him into the abyss; for therefore also the book of Job, fashioning in a material sense the attempt of the Devil and the patience of God, made Job the one tested by God, and set down God as offering suitable words for request and giving along with the things that happened.
