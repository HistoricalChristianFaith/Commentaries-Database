And a spirit above Him resembling jasper and carnelian. God is not like these things; away with that thought [ἄπαγε]. He is unlike any of the things perceived by the senses, neither having a body at all, invisible, spiritual, and without form. The invisible God is like that of the Seraphim, revealing their unseen nature, cover their faces with their wings (Is. 6:2). And to Moses, God spoke, saying: "No one shall see my face and live." (Ex. 33:20) But even the evangelist states decisively: "No one has ever seen God." (Jn. 1:18) Therefore, God was not seen resembling anything; rather, the vision of Him was depicted through the works of God by the Revelation.

For the jasper is a precious stone, this one is emerald-like and green, resembling the venom of an asp [ἰῷ ἀσπίδος], from which it also derived its name. The carnelian is another precious stone, fiery and blood-red. The jasper is said to symbolize for us the nourishment of God, and provision, since all nourishment for humans, four-footed animals, birds, and crawling beasts has its origin, and as it were its cause, beginning from green grass. For the prophet says: "He causes grass to grow for the cattle, and vegetation for the service of mankind, to bring forth bread from the earth. And wine gladdens the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil." (Ps. 103:14-15) And again, in the creation, God says: "Let the earth bring forth grass, herb yielding seed, and fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind." (Gen. 1:11-12) Now, jasper illustrates these things. But indeed, the carnelian is described as the fearfulness of God; for our God is said by the advocator [ἱεροφάντης] Moses to be "a consuming fire", (Deut. 4:24) and the prophet also cries out to Him: "You are fearful, and who can stand before Your face?" (Ps. 75:8) Accordingly, the wise Apostle writes: "It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God." (Heb. 10:31) Since the goodness of God is incompatible with those who love sin and are scornful, and is pure, not leading to repentance but to the freedom to commit wrongdoing, it is reasonable that God, along with goodness, also possesses the generous and the awe-inspiring; therefore Paul, knowing the character of those learning and the need for incentives rather than gentleness, addressed the Corinthians, saying: "What do you want? Should I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of gentleness?" (1 Cor. 4:21) Yet one of the saints (Basil) said, "Gehenna does not frighten you; the kingdom does not urge you on? We speak to you with a heart of stone."

Therefore, it was known as a fearful and astonishing necessity for those being disciplined. But the carnelian is not the first for God, rather, the first indeed is the jasper. For His nature is that of good and humane and gentle, and He wishes to be a Father rather than a Master to us. But, if it is lawful to say, we 'force' Him, and He leaves behind His natural gentleness, and is led by unnatural sternness.

And it is said that a rainbow encircling the throne appeared like an emerald in appearance. The perceptible rainbow [ἶρις] which the divine Scripture calls the bow [τόξον] of God, consisting of the reflection of the solar light, when it is diverted in the thickness of a cloud, has become multicolored and numerous in color. But that one, the spiritual rainbow, which encompasses the divine throne, was of one kind; for it was emerald in appearance. And it itself also prefigures all the holy and ministering spirits of God, wherefore it has also been called rainbow, although it happens to be of one kind, so that from the various colors of the rainbow we may conceive the many orders and distinctions of the divine angels. Everything indeed is bound to one single color; for all things are equally beneficial and bear the likeness of their own Master, of the emerald color that itself attests to its productive power, just as the jasper does to God. And let no one stumble over those who encounter it; Why indeed are the sacred orders of the spiritual beings concerning God are overshadowed by the more precious stone of the emerald, while God Himself is associated with the less precious jasper and carnelian? For the discussion is not now about the value of what is visible, but about the meanings signified by the colors.

For if someone were to seek honor in a petty way, there would be nothing for which God could be accused, nor would anyone find fault with it; that is, that the Lord is rejected with a stone. For Isaiah says, "Behold, I am placing a cornerstone in Zion concerning the Lord." (Isa. 28:16) And the prophet speaks of the stone that the builders rejected concerning him. The evil spirits are allegorized as mountains; for David himself said that mountains can be moved—"in the hearts of the seas," and "the mountains were shaken in his mighty power," (Ps. 117:22) whose magnitude is so great that it is impossible to find anything greater than it.
