When I took it, he said, I ate it, and it was sweet in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach became bitter. Since the divine evangelist both saw and heard the punishments inflicted upon the impious, so that they might be disciplined through deeds and not by hearing alone, and so that the lawlessness of men, which is both bitter and detestable before God, might be recognized as repulsive, he teaches this through vision. For he did not know this from experience, being a holy man and a virgin, and through this he came to understand that the wrath of God against the impious is just.

The little scroll [βιβλίον] contained both the names and the sins of those who had greatly erred, as previously stated. It was therefore commanded to eat this, so that, through a certain taste and intellectual experience, the bitterness of the sins might be realized through a vision.
