“And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, ‘O Sovereign, both holy and true, how long until you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon the earth?’ ” They were not making petition against people but against the demons who like to dwell in earthly things. For it is not according to the love of the saints to rise up against their own kind, but against those who lead people to their own destruction.
