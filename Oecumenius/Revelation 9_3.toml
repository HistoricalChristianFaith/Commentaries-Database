And from the smoke "locusts came out onto the earth". I believe the term "locusts" [ἀκρίδες] refers to worms, about which Isaiah says: "Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched," (Isa. 66:24; Mark 9:48) possibly calling the worm the biting of the soul and the relentless and creeping pain.

And it was said that "they were given authority", just "as the scorpions of the earth have authority".
