Since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit. Love one another fervently with a pure heart, having been born again, not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever.
"Love one another fervently." In this way, it must be said: That you may have faith and hope in God, when you have purified your souls through obedience to the truth, that is, when you have prepared yourselves for obedience to the truth through the Spirit. For the obedience in evils and lies is not through the Spirit, that is, it is not spiritual. Since purification for obedience or preparation, exercise, care, also wishes to attract many other helpers, provided it is spiritual and free from envy: but this is the work of fervent love, making a neighbor a participant in the goods that someone has obtained: therefore, it adds: to love fervently, devoid of hypocrisy. However, this is subjected by deficiency: for it is familiar to the blessed apostles, as it is also found in blessed James, "Who is wise among you and endowed with knowledge?" (James 3:13) And again: "Now you who say, 'Today and tomorrow,'" (James 5:1) and many other similar things. That spiritual ones should, in turn, make others partakers of all good things with utmost diligence, can be learned from what he says elsewhere: "I indeed consider them to be mutual for the provocation of love," (Heb. 10:24) that is, to sharpen and stir it up.
