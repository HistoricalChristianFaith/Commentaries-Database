I think that this holy angel … is a certain military herald of the divine army and that he commands all the holy angels in heaven, here called “birds” because they are sublime and fly in the air, to partake of the slaughter of the enemies. To be sure, even one angel was sufficient to destroy an entire army of the enemy, as that one clearly demonstrated who destroyed 185, Assyrians in one night. However, he orders all to partake so that all might share in the joy against [God’s] enemies. For I think that also these say with the prophet, “Do I not hate them that hate you, O Lord? And have I not wasted away because of your enemies? I have hated them with a perfect hate, and they were counted among my enemies.” And since he commanded angels who were flying in mid-heaven, he too was standing in mid-heaven when he gave them orders. For the sun is established in the middle of the seven planets, with three above it and three below it. Either this [is the meaning], or he was giving his commands in the light, which is as it were, in the Spirit and was speaking of the coming slaughter. For the Spirit is the spiritual light, as the prophet teaches when he was discoursing with God the Father, and said, “In your Light, shall we see Light,” that is, in the Spirit we shall see the Son.
