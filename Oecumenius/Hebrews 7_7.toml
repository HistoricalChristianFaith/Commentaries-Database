"and blessed the one who has the promises. He took up Abraham, so that Melchizedek might receive more. Since it was a great thing to Abraham to receive the promises from God, he now adds this, that Melchizedek, so great and so old, having been deemed worthy of divine fellowship, and having God as his debtor, was blessed by the type of Christ. The lesser is blessed by the greater. He said that Melchizedek blessed the aged Abraham; and we all commonly and unquestionably know that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed. Therefore, Melchizedek, the type of Christ, is greater than the patriarch himself.
