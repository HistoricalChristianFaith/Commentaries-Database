Let a widow be counted as not less than sixty years old, the wife of one man, well attested for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has hosted strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has comforted the afflicted, if she has devoted herself to every good work. But refuse younger widows; for when they have indulged themselves against Christ, they desire to marry, having condemnation because they have cast off their first faith. And also they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; not only idle, but also gossips and chatterers, speaking things they ought not.

Here, Paul also considers age along with other factors, and previously he states the reason, saying that even if the age were sixty years old, without the other conditions being met, it should not be counted.

— [OECUMENIUS] They also say that Paul is referring to those designated for widowhood. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 172v, B f. 207v; G J. 295v] —

— [OECUMENIUS] well attested for good works. Having said generally, "well attested for good works," Paul then proceeds to each particular thing. And he said that the care of children is above. What then, if he has no children? Let him do the rest. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius] —

— [OECUMENIUS] He does not say "if she had children," but "if she has brought them up according to the will of God, if she has led them properly," for this is exceptional. One must understand that this is said concerning widows. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius G f. 295v] —

if she has hosted strangers. Do you see that even here Paul places the benefits to one's own people before those to foreigners? For having said this first.

if she has brought up children. Thus it suggests, "She has hosted strangers."

if she has washed the feet of the saints. But he will say: I am very poor, and I do not have the means to be host or to assist the afflicted. Does he not say, "Can you not wash the feet of the saints?" Is the ability lacking to pursue good works? For Paul spoke of each of these according to what was available.

if she washed the feet of the saints; that is, if she performed the lowest services to the saints without shame. Thus, Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes.

if she has devoted herself to every good work, that is, she has shared, supplied. For although the ability to act may be lacking, the ability to provide is nevertheless present.

But refuse younger widows. Therefore, when the struggle becomes greater among virgins, nowhere does it seem to express the observation of time? Because they have come to this point from a greater fervor of faith, indeed a certain necessity follows which solitude brings. Or because, also speaking about virgins, that it should be constant and careful for those who belong to the Lord (1 Cor. 7:32), great diligence was applied.

for when they have indulged themselves against Christ. Perhaps there were some who had acted this way. But see that truly widows are also joined to Christ: however, those who are joined to him are placed in the order of virgins. "For I betrothed you, he says, to one husband, pure virgin, to present you to Christ." (2 Cor. 11:2) And these things are fitting for every Church. But what does it mean, "when they have indulged themselves against"? it means, when they become foolish, when they become pampered, that is, when they become arrogant, when they become proud over Christ, not accepting Him as a bridegroom, then they fall away into marriage. For they did not choose widowhood with a judgment of reason.

Because they have abandoned the first faith. Paul speaks of the covenant with Christ. For they agreed to be joined to Christ: but they reject Him and turn to earthly marriages. After this, indeed, they fall into another sin, namely idleness. Therefore, he ordered not only men to work, but also women. For every evil arises from idleness.

— [OECUMENIUS] And also they learn to be idle. How do the idle women learn? Having the men who are brought in to assist them provide what is necessary for their old age, they are negligent about their tasks, but they take care to appear pleasing to the men. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f.172v; B f.208r; G f.296r] —

not only idle, but also gossips. For the mind has been created by the Creator for us to work. Therefore, when we do not provide it with good work, it itself takes on absurd tasks.
