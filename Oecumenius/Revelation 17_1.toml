Having fulfilled the matters concerning the end of the present age, the vision turns to another thing, wishing to show the evangelist the matters concerning Rome. And he says, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters" speaking of "judgment", meaning her conduct and her society, in which she has been judged to be and how she pursues it.

And he calls her a "prostitute", as one prostituting herself and apostatizing from God; for this too is called prostitution in divine Scripture according to what was said by the prophet to the God of all: "You have destroyed everyone that commits fornication against you.." (Ps. 72:27)

And he says there are "many waters", over which she rules and which are governed, as he himself says.
