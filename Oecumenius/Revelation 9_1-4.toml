Up to now the vision was describing for us the way and the kind of plagues with which the [elements] of earth and heaven, and with them human beings, were being consummated or changed. But now as though the consummation has already come about and the resurrection has been effected, he describes the punishments accorded to sinners. 

He says, I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, meaning that the star is a messenger of God because of its brilliance, which had come down on the earth, where the judgment of sinners will occur, at a certain place which one of the holy prophets named “the valley of Jehoshaphat.” 

He says, The key of the shaft of the bottomless pit was given to him. He calls Gehenna a shaft of a bottomless pit. That is why there also came up from the shaft smoke as of abundant fire, which was clearly lurking in the shaft. But the smoke symbolizes not only fire, but also darkness; for the word of the prophet, “The voice of the Lord cutting through a flame of fire,” is interpreted by the saints as though it will cut through the illumination of the fire of Gehenna so that only scorching heat and darkness remain in it. 

He says, The sun and the air were darkened with the smoke of the shaft, not because these elements were darkened, but because those who had been thrown into the shaft were filled with darkness because of their punishment, and so were blind to the air and the sun. For this is what one of the holy prophets also said: “The sun” will be darkened “at noon,” describing the disasters of the Jews, not that the sun was darkened, but that they suffered this in their affliction and could not see the sun; for the extent of their disasters was like being overcome with dizziness. 

He says, And from the smoke locusts came out on the earth. I think that he calls the worms locusts, about which Isaiah says, “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched,” perhaps calling the biting sting of the soul and its persistent and creeping pain a worm. 

He says, And they were given power like the power which scorpions have on earth. They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those human beings who do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads once the earth had been changed and renewed. For it is said somewhere about it, “You will send forth your spirit and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth.” 

It was no longer a good thing for any adornment of the earth to be struck, neither a tree nor anything growing, except only human beings, and of these only those who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads. For those human beings who are completely holy and pure have received the place mentioned earlier on, being constantly with Christ and in sight of the divine throne. But those who are less holy but nevertheless who have been baptized, and who bear the sign of Christ on their foreheads and who have not been completely rejected, and have not gravely defiled themselves and their baptism by their unnatural deeds, but as it were are midway between good and evil, remain upon earth but escape punishment. 

For if this were not so, why would the Lord have said to those who had made good use of the pounds entrusted to them, “Have authority over ten cities,” and to another, “over five cities,” as if they were going to rule over the inferior, while their subjects went altogether unpunished? For who would choose to rule those who were being punished and constantly gnashing their teeth, and bewailing their unspeakable sufferings? I am not of course referring to the saints, nor to people like them, but simply to people deserving our sympathy. Who would choose to rule over them, unless he himself, too, were going to suffer something similar to the incurable condition of those who were being punished? 

The third part of human beings is handed over to punishment, since they are sinners and impious and have not received the faith of Christ. That is why it is said that those were struck who had not been sealed with the seal of God.
