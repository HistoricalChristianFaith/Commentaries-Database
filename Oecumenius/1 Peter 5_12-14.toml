By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I consider, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. The Church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, greets you, and Mark my son. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
"By Silvanus." This Silvanus was very faithful and eagerly motivated around the preaching. Indeed, Paul also mentions him and takes him as a helper along with Timothy in his letters, saying: "Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy." (1-2 Thess. 1:1)
Peter calls Rome Babylon, because it was so remarkable and distinguished, as it had been for a long time in Babylon.
Peter calls his son Mark according to the spirit, and not according to the flesh. To him, he entrusted the task of writing the Gospel. However, some have dared to assert that Mark was the son of the divine Peter according to the flesh, using as an argument what was said by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. (Acts 12:1) For he says that Peter was miraculously brought out of prison by the angel of God, in which Herod had kept him, and after being released from the angelic conversation, Peter came to the house of the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, as if he had come to his own house and to his lawful wife. However, when Paul writes that they should greet each other with a holy kiss (2 Cor. 14:12), Peter says here,
"With a kiss of love," saying the same as that. For Paul (1 Cor. 13:1-19) knows the love which is according to Christ and is greater than all virtues, even than martyrdom itself suffered for Christ. Therefore, he calls the holy kiss separate and defined in God, while he similarly refers to the kiss of love which is true love, which Paul has praised. Therefore, he also adds:
"Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus:" not speaking of the common peace which is among men, which is dear to men because of the affection for vain glory and the enjoyment of pleasures, to which those who are free from war surrender themselves; but Peter prays that they may attain the peace which Christ himself agreed to grant them as he proceeded to passion, saying: "My peace I leave with you;" and adding a distinction: "Not as the world gives." (Jn. 14:27) For peace is not to be sought because of affection, but that we may be united in love, in order to receive in this way the blows of adversaries. Moreover, the disciples of the Lord, adding as it were a seal, bring a prayer at the end, as a genuine sign of their holiness. (It was written from the city of Rome.)
