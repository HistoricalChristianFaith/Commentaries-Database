“Here is a call for the endurance of the saints,” it says. This will be manifested at this time of the antichrist and in this ordeal. For however great is the danger and the tribulation at that time, so great is the need for endurance. Then the passage continues as though in response to a question. And who are those, it says, whom you call holy and patient? “Those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.” For when the tribulations and death have come, such persons as these will regard all things as second in importance to faith and to the love of God.
