Therefore, he says: Here is the patience of the saints. He says that in that time of the Antichrist, and in that temptation it is shown forth. For as great as the danger and the affliction then, so great a need of perseverance. Then the discourse is shaped as if from a question. And who, he says, are those whom you call holy and patient?

He says: those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. For such people, even when trials and death are present, will set everything second to the faith and love of God.
