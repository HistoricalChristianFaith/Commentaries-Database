“Therefore, receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken.” If creation is unshakable, much more the kingdom of heaven, which you are about to receive as a reward for the sufferings here for Christ. Since the sufferings are the cause of the kingdom, let us give thanks to God for them.
“by which we may serve.” For which, with thanksgiving;for it is by giving thanks to God even for tribulations and temptations that one serves Him acceptably.
“with reverence and godly fear.” And it is not enough, Paul says, to be merely grateful, unless there is also shame, both towards all and towards God, accompanying piety.

“For our God is a consuming fire.” By saying this, Paul either wishes to frighten them not to be ungrateful, nor to complain about their tribulations, lest they suffer the wrath and punishment of God; or to comfort them; as if he were saying: let us give thanks in our tribulations; for we have a Master who is able to consume our adversaries.
