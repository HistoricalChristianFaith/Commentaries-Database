"For both he who sanctifies," that is, Christ, "and those who are sanctified," that is, humans, are all from one God and Father. But Christ, as the Son and true offspring and of the essence of the Father, we, however, are as creature ones and have been made worthy of sonship by grace. See in these words the superiority. He who sanctifies, and we are sanctified. Therefore, both unity and superiority.

"I will proclaim your name to my brothers." — [PHOTIUS] For as he united the flesh to himself, he also put on brotherhood. Saying, "He is not ashamed," He showed the distinction. For He is not a brother by nature, although He is truly a man, but by generosity [φιλανθρωπίαν], since He is also truly God.
