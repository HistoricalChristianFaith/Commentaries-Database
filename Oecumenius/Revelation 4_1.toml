quote='''
It is not that there is literally a door in heaven that opens and closes at times, but it was shown to the evangelist in this way so that he might see the things above the heavens.

For with every door opened, what lies within must inevitably be seen. And I heard a voice, which sounded like a trumpet, saying these words to me: Come up here so that you may see what is to come.
