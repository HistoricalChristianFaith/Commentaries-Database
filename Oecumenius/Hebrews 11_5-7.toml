"By faith, Enoch." From him, the abolition of death was prefigured. Indeed, through Abel, the approval of the sentence was shown, but through Enoch, it is abolition. Enoch believed that God is a rewarder of those who seek Him; therefore, he was also pleasing to God: and to such an extent was his faith that what seemed contrary also appeared. For Abel, although he had pleased God, was slain, and God did not wish to overlook his death; therefore, Enoch was pleasing to God only by faith, believing in the reward of the good. For the sake of faith, therefore, he was pleasing, and because he was pleasing, he was taken away.
"he would not see death," For he was indeed removed, and still lives: moreover, where and how, it is uncertain.
"But without faith, it is impossible to please Him." For if someone does not believe in the payment of good deeds and evils, he would not please. For who would tread the laborious path of virtue, not being convinced that there are rewards?
"For he who comes to God must believe that He is." It is not about what it is, nor about examining His essence, but one must only believe that He exists and that He rewards those who seek it.
"By faith, Noah, having been warned." Connect the "by faith" with "being cautious," so that it reads: "having been warned by faith, Noah prepared an ark concerning things not yet seen, being cautious and fearful." For it was by faith that he heard what would be the flood, to be cautious and terrified.
"having been warned." Having heard from God. Elsewhere it is said, "He was warned by the Spirit." (Luke 2:26) Do you see equality? Just as the Father calls, so also does the Holy Spirit.
"of things not yet seen." He speaks of the flood.
"By which he condemned the world." He showed them to be worthy of punishment, that even when seeing the ark being constructed, they did not believe that there would be a flood.
"of the righteousness which is according to faith." What is established through faith. For that faith justified him by which he believed in God.
