After completing the account of the end of the present age and of all that will then happen, the vision turns to something else, as it wishes to show the evangelist what will happen to Rome. 

It says, He said to me, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the harlot who is seated upon many waters,” meaning by “judgment” the way of life and society in which she has decided to live and the way in which she spends her time. He calls her a harlot, because of her fornication and rebellion against God. For this is named fornication by Holy Scripture according to the words of the prophet addressed to the God of the universe, “You have destroyed everyone that commits fornication against you.” He calls the nations over whom she rules and presides many waters, as he himself goes on to say. 

He says, With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication. They are those who had been kings over [the nations], for these are the kings of the earth who have shared in her fornication and mad idolatry. 

He says, And the dwellers on earth have become drunk with the wine of her fornication. For the rest, too, of those she was ruling had joined in the revolt from God, sometimes by her compulsion and sometimes by her example. 

He says, And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. The wilderness symbolizes her coming desolation. 

He says, And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast. By the beast he means the Devil on whom she was relying and by whom she was being controlled. The beast is scarlet because it has been made red by the blood of the saints. 

The beast was full of blasphemous names. For the Devil, dedicated only to himself, fails to render the worship due to God. 

He says, Having seven heads and ten horns. He goes on to interpret this, saying that the heads and horns are the kings who have already reigned over her and who were still going to reign. 

And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet—purple on account of her reign, scarlet because she had shed the blood of many saints. 

Bedecked with gold and jewels and pearls: the text rightly adorns her as a queen with royal adornment. 

Holding in her hand a golden cup, full of abominations—golden on account of her honored sovereignty, but nevertheless full of idolatry and pollutions by which she was being nurtured and from which she poured her libations to her demons. 

He says, The impurities of the earth’s fornication: for he attributes to her the cause of the idolatry even of the rest of the nations, as the prime worker of evils and of mad idolatry. 

There was, he says, written on her forehead, as if it were an inscription on a monument, saying who she was, that she is Babylon, the mother of harlots—Babylon because of the turmoil and confusion in her, and the persecutions of the saints (for the name “Babylon” signifies confusion, as has been mentioned), and she is the mother of fornication and of rebellion against God. For how can she not be a mother and teacher when she persecutes the gospel and those proclaiming it and persuades the nations to remain attached to their ancestral error?
