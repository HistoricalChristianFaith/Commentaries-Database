"For the law having a shadow." It is merely a type of the future good things, namely of the new covenant.Not the very image of the things themselves. These, not the very truth. Of what things? Of sacrifice, of forgiveness. For the old things were like a shadowy outline, being dim; but the new things are an image; these, in truth, as having been clearly manifested and accomplished.
It is also possible to understand in this way.

It is said by holy Gregory, who is among the saints, in the Apologeticus and in the Address to the Politicians, that the present laws are types of greater mysteries. And again in the Treatise on the Resurrection; "We will partake of the Passover," he says, "now in a typical manner, but later in a more perfect way." For I dare to say that the legal Passover was a type of a type.
Having said these things, in none of these does the Apostle refer to a shadow and an image, and the good things to come, which he also calls true things. For as concerning the presentation of a shadow and an image, the things indicate truth, and indeed they are truth. Therefore, he knows the things in the law as a shadow, the image as our own of the Christians, and the good things to come and true things that are in the coming age. For as much as the image departs from the truth, so much is the shadow of the image. For the image, even if it does not have the truth itself, is nevertheless a clear imitation of the truth, preserving the form through colors, and the proportion of the parts, and the color of the subject.
The shadow is a faint image of the reality, nothing of those things which the image reveals. And I suppose the theologian was led from these apostolic statements to speak about the topics at hand. And similar to Gregory, many other fathers have spoken likewise.

"of the things." He calls the future life things; the image of things, the evangelical life; and the shadow of the image of things, the Old Testament. For the image more clearly shows the archetypes. But the outline of the image reveals these things more faintly. For in this way, the weakness of the Old Testament is illustrated. For many, he says, offering sacrifices and the same ones year by year, can never makeperfect those who are governed by the law.

"year by year." What then? Do we not always bring forth unbloody sacrifices? But we also make memorials of one death of Christ and we always eat one body of Christ. For now we do not have one Christ, and at another time another, but always the same. The sacrifices of the Jews had various victims, such as sheep, oxen, goats. Therefore, there were many sacrifices. For ours, even if there are many in action, are one in power.
"with the same sacrifices."In the same way. For the offerings are various.
"continually." For they were offered annually without end.
"can never." The law, that is.
"make those who approach perfect." Why? Because it is a type. For the truth, that is Christ, did this, having accomplished purification through one sacrifice.
"For they would not have ceased." According to the question, read. For if they had ceased, he says, those sacrifices would certainly not have ceased to be offered, because the consciousness of sins would no longer have been taken away, because it has been once for all purified.
"But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins." In them, he says, those sacrifices are only a reminder and a proof of sins, but there is no longer any forgiveness. And the proof that there is no forgiveness is the continual existence of sacrifices.

For, he says, not only are the sacrifices offered for the sins that arise, but rather for all, as they have not been forgiven, for the sins that have already occurred.

"For it is impossible for the blood of bulls." Therefore, he shows the truth of what has been said, from the insignificance of the blood.
