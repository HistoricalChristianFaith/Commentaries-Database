he must be loosed for a little while. What sort of little while does he mean? that between the incarnation of the Lord and the end of the present age; for this sort even if it may seem to be very long, when reckoned and compared with the past and the future. For if in the "last" hour, even in 'the eleventh' hour.(Mt. 20:6,9) our Lord appeared in bodily form to us, according to the belief of Holy Scripture, the time until the end has rightly been called short, after which the Devil will be bound again with an eternal and endless bond.

The Revelation does not present to us the millenialism of the atheistic Greeks...Since I have already said that a day is reckoned 'as a 1000 years' by God (Ps. 90:4), and again that the earthly residence of the Lord has been called 'a day' (Is 49:8 ) he says this day is a 1000 years, as though there is no distinction with God between one day and a 1000 years. It was in this period of the Lord's incarnation that the Devil was bound, so that he was unable to oppose the Savior's divine miracles. This was why the destructive demons recognized these spiritual bonds and cried out, "What have you to do with us, Son of the living God? Have you come to torment us before the time?(Mt. 8:29)" The Lord also when talking of stripping off the bonds, said, "Or how can anyone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.(Mt. 12:29)" Since as was said, we have considered the incarnation of the Lord and his earthly residence to be both 'one day' and a 1000 years, such a number being used indifferently in Holy Scripture in mystical fashion,

no more suduce the nations. For the Lord's sojourn on earth had to provide rather more succor and care so that the unclean demons might be prevented from exercising the same influence on human beings as they had in the time preceding the incarnation.
