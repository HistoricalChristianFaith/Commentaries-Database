He says, that he should deceive the nations no more, until the thousand years should be fulfilled; for it was necessary that the Lord's abiding on earth should have some further element of providential oversight and guardianship, in order by this to prevent the unclean demons from working against men as they had done in the times before the Incarnation.

And after these things, he says, that he must be released for a little while. What does he mean by little while? The interval between the Lord's incarnation and the end of the present age; for this is a little while, even if it may seem great, being measured and compared with both the past and the future. For if in the "last" and on the "eleventh" hour (Matt. 20:6, 9.) the Lord our God appeared bodily according to the faith of the sacred writings, rightly is the time up to the end called a little while, after which once more the eternal and unending bond will be bound. But even when he is released, bind again, O Lord, his plotting against us; for you are our King and to you belongs the glory forever. Amen.
