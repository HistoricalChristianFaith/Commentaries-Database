he must be loosed for a little while. What sort of little while does he mean? that between the incarnation of the Lord and the end of the present age; for this sort even if it may seem to be very long, when reckoned and compared with the past and the future. For if in the "last" hour, even in 'the eleventh' hour.(Mt. 20:6,9) our Lord appeared in bodily form to us, according to the belief of Holy Scripture, the time until the end has rightly been called short, after which the Devil will be bound again with an eternal and endless bond.

no more suduce the nations. For the Lord's sojourn on earth had to provide rather more succor and care so that the unclean demons might be prevented from exercising the same influence on human beings as they had in the time preceding the incarnation.

“[The devil] must be loosed for a little while.” What does he mean by “a little while”? He means the time between the incarnation of the Lord and the consummation of the present age. When measured and compared with that which is past and that which is future, this is “little,” even though it should seem to be great. For if our Lord appears bodily at the “last” hour, indeed at the “eleventh” hour, as the faith of the holy writings claim, the time until the consummation is properly called “little.” After [this] the devil will again be bound, this time with an eternal and neverending bond. However, although he has been loosed, bind yet again, O Lord, his works of cunning against us. For you are our King, and it is proper to give you glory forever. Amen.
