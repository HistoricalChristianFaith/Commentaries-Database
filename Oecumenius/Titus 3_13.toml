I have earnestly sent Zenas the lawyer. Experienced in the Jewish laws. Yet these had not yet been entrusted to the Church. But Apollos was a certain great man, both learned and mighty in the Scriptures.

so that nothing may be lacking for them. In every abundance, provide for them, perhaps with food and clothing.
