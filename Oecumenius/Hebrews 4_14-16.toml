Therefore, let us not be subjected to those tremendous punishments, since we have a great high priest, let us hold fast our profession, that is, let us not abandon the faith which is in Him, but let us firmly hold it within ourselves. What is it, then? Who has passed through the heavens? He is not, he says, like Moses who could not enter the land of promise, nor did he introduce the people, but Christ has also passed through the heavens and sits on the throne of the Father; therefore, He can also introduce us. He calls Himself a priest because He offered Himself as a victim to God the Father. For it is proper for a priest to offer sacrifices for the people.
"For we do not have a high priest." Let us therefore hold fast our profession and faith in Him: For we do not have a high priest who cannot have compassion with the feeling of our infirmities. He knows, he says, that because of many afflictions you are weak and feeble: therefore He can sympathize with us.
For He was tempted and afflicted in all things just as we are. He suffered persecution and was mocked and spat upon, and finally was even crucified. Yet He, having suffered these things, did not sin. By saying this, He signifies that they have fallen into sin because of afflictions, in that they have been overly weakened and frail.

He proves in two ways that He has compassion with the feeling of our infirmities. In one way, because he is great and powerful, as the Son of God and God; in another way, because he himself, as a man, suffered and has experience of afflictions, and of the weakness that follows the flesh. And because of both of these, he will certainly be sympathetic to our weaknesses.

"yet without sin." Because he did not sin, he suffered, saying that he was enduring this punishment.

"Let us therefore come with confidence." Let us approach, He says, to the throne of His Father, in which He sits. With confidence, or not hesitating in faith, or because He has overcome the world. Therefore, it is evident that He will also conquer those who now afflict us. Or because the throne is not now a throne of judgment, but of grace: therefore, approach even if you are a sinner.
"to the throne of grace." The throne of grace refers to the royal throne, of which David says: "The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand.'" (Ps. 110:1)For the throne is now the throne of grace, not of judgment. Therefore, with confidence, he says.
"that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need." He rightly says: to help in time. If now, he says, you approach, you will receive grace and mercy; for you approach at the right time; but if you approach then, it will not be so, for it will be an untimely approach. For where there will be completion, then there will arise for judgment.
"to help in time." For whoever now approaches receives mercy and grace, because the approach and request for help is timely and appropriate: just as in judgment, the approach for help is demanding. For then it will not provide help out of grace as it does now, but judgment.
