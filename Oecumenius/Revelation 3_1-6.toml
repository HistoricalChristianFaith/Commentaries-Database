Concerning the seven stars, which he now also calls the spirits of God, an explanation has been given in what has gone before. But now one must hear what he says about the people in Sardis. 

He says, I know your works, that your name is like that of one who is living a godly, virtuous life, but you are dead because of sins. It is customary in Holy Scripture to call dead those who are involved in sins, as Paul in his great wisdom writes about those who have changed their course from unbelief to the faith of Christ: “And you who were dead in your transgressions he made alive together with Christ.” And the Shepherd says that some have gone down into the water of the font as dead, and have come up again living. 

But, he says, awake from the sleep of sin and strengthen what remains, which is at the point of death: you still have, he says, a few works and practices which are not entirely dead. Therefore, guard them while they are still alive, even though they are already veering towards death. For strengthen means “make strong and powerful what is feeble and ready to fall.” “Not one of your endeavors,” he says, “is full of zeal, but some are dead and others are on the point of death.” 

So he says, “Remember then how you received the faith and heard the word concerning it, and keep alive those of your works which are still living. But repent of those which are dead.” 

If therefore you will not awake, he says, “and if you will not arise from your sluggishness as one from sleep, I will come to you,” he says, “as a chastiser when you are not expecting it.” The holy apostle also says about some others, “When they say, ‘peace and safety,’ then sudden destruction” will come upon them “as travail comes upon a woman with child.” 

He says, You have a few names in Sardis who have not soiled their garments, and who walk with me in white, for they are worthy, for whose sake I am for the present deferring my displeasure and am showing patience towards you. By “unsoiled garments” he means the bodies of the saints, as the patriarch Jacob said, “He washes his garment in wine”; and Isaiah says the same thing: “Why are your garments red, like those of one who has come from the wine-press, fully trampled down?” Therefore the white garment symbolizes the purity of the body. 

He means that he who conquers his passions will be clad in white in the life to come. “For the righteous will shine like the sun and the moon,” he has himself promised in the gospels. 

He says that the pure will be written in the book of those who live out that blessed and eternal life. The Lord also mentioned this text in the gospels, saying to his disciples, “Do not rejoice that the demons are subject to you,” but “that your names are written in heaven.” 

And he says, I will confess their name before my Father and before his angels. He will confess them as faithful attendants and as willing servants. For in the gospels, too, it is written, If anyone “confesses me before men, I also will confess him before my Father who is in heaven.” To speak about his Father and his [Father’s] angels does not prevent the holy angels from being his also; at one time they are his Father’s, at another time they are his. For he says, according to Matthew, Then “the Son” of man “will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”
