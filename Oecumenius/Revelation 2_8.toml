First, meaning that the Lord calls Himself by the essence of the Godhead [τῆς θεότητος]; Last, indeed, meaning, by the incarnation and the economy with the flesh. He who is said to have died and came to life again; he who is said to have come to the experience of death, and by death has destroyed death (2 Tim. 1:10).
