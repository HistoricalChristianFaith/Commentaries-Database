Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
"do not imitate what is evil." Since there is no unity of light with darkness, nor any unity between Christ and Belial (2 Cor. 6:14), it is not appropriate for one who has been illuminated by the knowledge of Christ to mix with darkness through the imitation of the wicked, or through their lustful and shameless works. For just as he who does good is from God, and has composed the eye of his understanding in the light of that knowledge, and thus is wholly light, and sees God, who is true light, and is seen by others as a luminary in the world (Phil. 2:15), sustaining the Word of life; so also he who does evil, walking in darkness, cannot see God, that is, cannot do the things that are of God, nor can he be seen by others, if he rebukes or corrects anyone: but all hate and abominate him, according to that wise oracle: "I have hated iniquity and have abominated it." (Ps. 118:163 LXX)
