Having said above that the elementary teaching about the humanity of the Lord, and indeed the perfection of those who pertain to divinity, lest they might feel impatiently as unworthy of more perfect discourses, he also approaches to speak of more perfect matters. He speaks not in the same way as he called the perfect: (for they were not able to hear), but he skillfully approaches the discourse in another way, indeed calling baptism the elementary teaching, and the laying on of hands and the seal within it; but perfection, the idea through works. And he more clearly states what the elementary teaching is for those who have just believed, and what the perfection is.
— The following of the arrangement.

Therefore, leaving the elementary teaching of Christ, let us be carried toward perfection. And we will do this, as God permits.

“teaching about Christ." What kind of teaching? The teaching [λόγον] of the doctrine [διδαχῆς], of the necessity to lay the foundation of repentance from dead works, the teaching of the doctrine, of the necessity of faith in God; the teaching of the doctrine, of the necessity to be baptized; the teaching of the doctrine, of the necessity to be deemed worthy of the Holy Spirit; the teaching of the doctrine, that there is resurrection, that there will be judgment. For in common, according to all, both the teaching and the doctrine.

"on to perfection." Having said this, he lets go of the elementary and foundational teachings concerning Christ and is carried towards perfection, not simply referring to the ultimate perfection, but as if to that which is between the elementary teachings of the words of God and the highest perfection. For there are indeed elementary principles of the words of God, which must be put away from Satan and his works, to believe in God, to be baptized, to receive the Holy Spirit, to know the resurrection of the dead, to believe that there will be a judgment. These are the elementary teachings of the words of God. The fundamentals of the words of God, and not the elementary teachings of God, are to know that Christ suffered for us, that He took upon Himself our sins, that He accomplished salvation for us, that He became our high priest, that He offered Himself for us, and anything similar. The perfection of rejecting Satan and his associates is the progress in virtues, the patience in tribulations, persecutions, and temptations. The highest perfection is that concerning the theology of Christ, insofar as it is possible for a man to have an accurate understanding. First, therefore, we are baptized as believers, then we acknowledge all that Christ suffered and did for us according to His humanity, then we are perfected in the virtues, and afterward we are deemed worthy of the knowledge according to theology.

"Let us not lay again a foundation." Let us not lay another foundation again, as he says, being laid down in baptism, that is, the renunciation of the works of Satan. For once, he says, having repented, we were baptized upon them, and it is no longer necessary to do these things from the beginning.
“and of faith toward God.” For it is no longer necessary now to believe in God as if from the beginning; for you have already believed.

The statement is beyond dispute; for the teaching has been delivered through a medium to all that is present, and this is the agreement according to its meaning: not to overthrow the foundation of the teaching again, but thus to show in enumeration the matters concerning the foundation of the teaching.Paul wishes to say that for those who now first approach faith, we lay down as a sort of foundation the teaching concerning these things, first reasonably urging them to repent from works that lead to death; when they have repented, to believe in God; when they have believed, to be baptized; when baptized, to submit to the laying on of hands for the partaking of the Spirit; having thus partaken in this, no longer to doubt concerning the resurrection from the dead, knowing that there will be a judgment when they will be raised and live again, and that a continuous and just reward awaits them for what we have lived like here.

"of faith toward God." For it is not necessary now, as it was from the beginning, to believe in God. For you have already believed through teaching. The structure is thus. Therefore, leaving the elementary of God, what is this? The doctrine of baptisms, the laying on of hands (by which, it says, you were enlightened), and the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment, let us press on to perfection. For it is not necessary, it says, always to speak the same things; for it has been said once and has come to pass, but it is necessary, it says, also to contribute what is among you, namely, a good conduct and a faith worthy of it. For this is perfection, to be two-handed in virtue, as it were, saying; Be sober; for there is no need to live carelessly, and again to be baptized, and through the laying on of hands to receive the Holy Spirit's visitation.
“of instruction about baptism.” Not as if there were many baptisms, Paul said this in the plural; for there is one baptism (Eph. 4:5); but this follows from the context. For if he were to instruct them again, and baptize them again; and again baptize those who have fallen away; then necessarily there would be many baptisms; but this is absurd. Therefore, it is not necessary to rebaptize you; but to remain with the former baptism.

Perhaps these, still clinging to the law, thinking more in Jewish manners, because there are different and many baptisms in the law, wished also that the baptism of the New Covenant, which grants regeneration, should be administered many times, because they wished that the remission of sins should be considered worthy only once.

“the laying on of hands.” Those things that take place in baptism; or there, when the apostles laid on their hands, they gave the Spirit, which Simon the sorcerer also sought. (Acts 8:18-19)
“the resurrection of the dead.” For this also takes place in baptism through the form of rising up, and is confirmed in the confession; for we confess that we believe in the resurrection of the dead.
“and eternal judgment.” That is, of the coming judgment, which grants either eternal good or punishment. This seems to say: since it was likely that they would be shaken, although they had already believed, either that if we live deeply, or fall away from faith, we shall be baptized again, or again be able to wash away sins, and to share in the same things as before. For they err in thinking these things.
"And this we will do." Which? To be carried to perfection.
"if God permits." The phrase "if God permits" is not to indicate that God does not always permit (for God always permits the good and perfect), but as is customary for us to say, If God wills, we will do this. At the same time, it also teaches us from this that everything depends on that will, and we should not rely confidently or arrogantly on our own judgment and power, even in matters generally acknowledged. This is explicitly encouraged by the apostle James.
