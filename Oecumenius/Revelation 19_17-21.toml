I think that this holy angel who is now spoken of is a herald of the army of the divine battle-order, and that a charge has been sounded to all the holy angels in heaven, whom he figuratively calls birds because they are on high and traverse the air, to take part in the killing of the enemies. Of course, even a single angel was not incapable of destroying the whole battle-order of the enemies, as an angel clearly showed when in one night he struck one hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians. But [all the angels are given the charge] so that all may become sharers in the rejoicing over the enemy. For I think that they, too, are saying with the prophet, “Have I not hated them that hate you, Lord, and do I not pine away over your enemies? I hated them with a perfect hatred; they have become my enemies.” 

When the charge was sounded to the angels flying in midheaven, he himself stood in mid-heaven and made proclamation. The sun is firmly fixed in the middle of the seven planets, with three above it and three below it. 

It either means this, or that the proclamation was being made in the light as though in the Spirit, and that he was speaking of the result of the coming slaughter. The Spirit is a spiritual light, as the prophet teaches, when referring to God and the Father, saying, “In your light we shall see light,” that is, “We shall see the Son in the Spirit.” 

He says, that you may eat the flesh of kings: he calls the joy over the death of the enemies the food of those whom he mentions. In a similar way the Lord, too, talks of joy when he says to his disciples and apostles, “I have food to eat which you do not know,” describing in this way the gladness of those who are going to believe. 

The Devil and the Antichrist, whom he calls a false prophet of the beastly Devil, together with the kings who marched with them, made war against the Lord and his divine angels, but they were defeated more quickly than a word. What do the divine Scriptures say about them? Isaiah says, “Let the impious one be done away with, that he may not see the glory of the Lord,” meaning his sudden destruction; and the apostle says, “whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth.” What could be quicker than breathing and blowing against the enemies? 

He says, The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire, and the rest were slain by the sword: what an excellent display of justice! He did not consider the guilty protagonists of the war and their associates to deserve the same punishment. The two, that is, the Devil and the Antichrist, were condemned to the fire, in which they will remain alive forever, for this is symbolized by their being thrown into the fire alive. But the rest were put to death by the sword. To be punished by the sword is certainly far quicker than by fire. 

Once he has started to mention the kind of punishment that the Devil will suffer, to maintain the continuity of the account he goes on to describe what [the Devil] has suffered from the incarnation of the Lord.
