for this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

for this I was appointed. To which I was appointed as a testimony and a passion, and I was set apart as a preacher, so that I might make the cross revealed everywhere. And since he was about to say, "teacher of the Gentiles," it seemed unbelievable if the idolaters were called, he proclaimed beforehand: "I speak the truth, I do not lie." (Rom. 9:1)

teacher of the Gentiles. Since there is also the practice of proclaiming hastily, he called himself Teacher. For I did not only proclaim, but also, remaining, I taught. This, however, shows God's zeal concerning the Gentiles.

in faith and truth. Since he said, "in faith," so that no one might think that it is deceit, he adds, "in truth." I do not preach with persuasive words or with linguistic twists, but in faith. For this shows the power of the preaching.
