He says that all have been defeated and fallen under his feet, and there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemy. Was it given by someone? It was given by those deceived and having worshiped him; for to boast arrogantly is pride. For what is greater than this? To say, "I will ascend into heaven; I will set my throne above the stars of heaven." (Isa. 14:13) And just a little after that, he says, "I will be like the Most High," (Isa. 14:14) as Isaiah mocks him, for these are indeed blasphemies against God.

And it is said that power was given unto him to continue for forty-two months. In previous comments, the forty-two months we understood it as a brief time. For all time is brief, even if it seems to be very long, when compared to the unending ages.
