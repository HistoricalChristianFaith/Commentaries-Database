Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
"Husbands, living together in an understanding way, that is, learning through experience the triviality and folly of women in all things and their carnality in fear, be patient with them, not strictly reevaluating the accounts of what has been entrusted to them for safekeeping." However, as we said, the more freely they persist in giving to the poor, he admonishes men not to be demanding investigators. Yet, it seems to me that something deeper is suggested through this, and more charming and casual than what Paul hints at regarding the marital act. For Paul openly cries out: "Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by mutual consent," etc. (1 Corinthians 7:5) Here, however, more modestly, as we said, speaking of understanding and thereby designating the matter itself, Peter advises, since the female sex is more prone to this slippery behavior, not to drive them away with harsh criticisms, but rather to treat them gently as the weaker ones, and then to persuade them to adopt some moderation in abstaining from such things: for this is what he wants to signify (moderation, I say, or abstinence) by saying,
"showing honor"; for honor does not follow unless someone looks towards something. Therefore, as to the weaker ones or even as co-heirs of the grace of life, it is necessary to use life in the custom of such people. And that we have not misused this understanding is made clear by what follows, when he says:
"that your prayers may not be hindered." For what kind of interruption of prayers can a man's severity towards his wife bring? Indeed, this negligence brings great attention and eagerness during the time of prayer. Therefore, it seems to me that this should be said. Furthermore, if someone has indicated this better, I certainly do not envy.
