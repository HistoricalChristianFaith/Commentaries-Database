Therefore I want the men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing. Likewise, I want the women to adorn themselves in respectable clothing, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls, or costly clothing, but, as be appropriate women who profess godliness, with good works.

How then did Christ forbid praying openly? "For He says, 'Go into your room.'" (Matt. 6:6) Christ did not forbid praying in every place, but He said this to turn away from praying for show; just as in "Let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing," (Matt. 6:3) He does not speak about hands, but about doing good deeds without empty glory and not for display. It is not the place that makes the difference, but everywhere He cared that we do not show off. Furthermore, the Apostle also makes this clear: Just as it was not permitted for the Jews to offer sacrifices outside the temple, so it is also with us to pray. For He says that every place is suitable for us, only if we lift up holy hands, that is, hands cleansed from impure grasping, greed, and murder, purified through almsgiving.

without anger. Without bitterness, without cursing anyone. For true anger is not even wishing harm to befall one's brother.

or disputing. So will God hear me? Or do I pray simply and in vain? For one must be convinced that God will listen, if we ask Him for things dear to Him while being pure.

Likewise, I want the women. That is, I wish for them to raise their hands in holiness without anger or argument. Women require more than anything else to be adorned modestly.

But the phrase, respectable clothing, clearly means to be covered on all sides; he says it properly, not excessively, so as to please those who see it.

with modesty and self-control. Therefore, do not imitate those who are loved with a lustful desire, who look shamelessly and in the manner of  high-class prostitutes.

not with braided hair. For you have not come to a theater, Paul says. You have come to weep for your sins. Luxury is not the attire of one in prayer, nor is your worldly arrogance fitting for one mourning their sins. But if these things, which only display wealth, are prohibited: much more so the curious and perverse things such as the staining of the cheeks, painted eyes, renown walk, a broken voice, a wondering and curious eye, the raising of a prostitute’s garment, a more elaborate belt, ripped shoes. For all these things, in other words, say, "in respectable clothing," he cast out.

That teachers ought to be men, and not women, because of nature and the affection that arises from error.
