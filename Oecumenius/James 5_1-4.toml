Act now you rich men, weep, howling in your miseries which shall come to you. Your riches are corrupt: and your garments are eaten by moths. Your gold and silver is rusted: and their rust shall be for a testimony to you, and shall eat your flesh as fire. You have stored to yourselves wrath in the last days. Behold the hire of the workmen that have reaped your fields, which is defrauded of you, cries: and their cry has entered into the ears of the Lord of Sabbath.
"Act now." The greed and frugality of the rich are made evident by their lamentation, commanding them to weep, that is, to mourn, as those who hide their wealth for destruction and ruin, nor do they spend it on the needy: for indeed, the expenditure of wealth on these does not perish, but the one who spends it remains intact. Therefore, the author of Proverbs (Παροιμιαστής) also says: Cast your bread upon the waters, (Eccles. 11:1) that is, upon the apparent dissolution and corruption (for bread cast upon the waters is destined to be lost): yet it is by no means lost, but through its corruption it provides us with refreshment, when it would come to pass that we were pressed by thirst like a tongue tortured in flame.
"Your riches." Or your wealth. It must be understood, that is, what wealth, as the saying goes: Your riches, which you have hidden like fire as a treasure, will exceed your flesh.
"Your garments are eaten by moths." The rotting, James says, of riches and the corrosion or consumption of garments by moths, and the rust of gold and silver will bear witness against you, arguing your greed. Because of this, in the last days (the Lord says of His coming), you will find your riches hidden for you like fire for destruction: which also happened to the rich man, of whom it is told in the Gospel. (Luke 15:24)
