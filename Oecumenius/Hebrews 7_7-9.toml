It shows that there was great excellence in Melchizedek, and therefore he received tithes, and it says: Even the Levites receive; but this is not great, for they die; who, then, envies the honor of one who is about to die? However, Melchizedek, even if he received testimony that he lives, received tithes. And what it says about him receiving testimony that he lives, take according to the previously given understanding, namely because Scripture did not say the end of him, but only life, it seemed to testify only that he lived; as if to say: Abraham foresaw that the death of Melchizedek would not be revealed, nor was he moved to envy him the honor of tithes, for he knew his dignity.For he has superiority. The simpler way to accept what is said is that the priesthood of the Levites dies. For it has ceased. The truths have been revealed; but the one of Melchizedek lives.
"that he lives." How then was he testified? In saying to God, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." (Heb. 7:17) And therefore, the distinction of Melchizedek from the priests among the Jews.
"the men who die." For he says, it is not to be assumed that at any time he became greater, but after this he was established in a lesser portion. For in the law, the Levites receive tithes, and those who die pass on their value to others. So that the same ones are not always those who receive the tithe. But here, we have learned nothing of the sort. Therefore, he should always be regarded as superior, if indeed he remains always upon his own value. For he remains, as I said, an everlasting priest, having taken this from Scripture, as in the saying, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek," (Heb. 7:17) showing that he is such an everlasting priest.
"and so to speak." So that they may not say, "And what," he says, "was also tithing through Abraham?" Yes, he says. For Levi was in Abraham when he gave the tithes, even though he was not yet born. If therefore Levi was in the loins of Abraham when he gave the tithes, it is clear that Levi himself, the ancestor of the priests, gave tithes, when Abraham gave tithes. And the phrase, so to speak, means this, that, in short, or instead of saying, let me put it this way. For it seemed a bold statement to say that Levi, not yet born, was tithed by Melchizedek, and this was corrected.

Therefore, it is said that Abraham gave tithes, even Levi who receives tithes was himself tithed, that is, he gave tithes. Thus, concerning those words, "through Abraham," a distinction must be made so that the meaning becomes completely undeniable. For because of Abraham's tithing, in a certain way, Levi, who was still in his loins, was also tithing.

"For he was still in the loins." The seed that was the beginning of Levi's life was within the loins of Abraham. Indeed, Isaac was the cause and origin of Levi.
