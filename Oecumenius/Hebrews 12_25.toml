"do not deny the one speaking." This is due to disbelief or despair. Who is the one speaking and calling to his own kingdom? It is Christ, obviously. For if his blood speaks, much more he lives.
"For if they did not escape." The danger, that is, the loss. The danger, that is, the loss.

"having refused the one warning on earth," or the one who engages in earthly matters, promising the earthly and temporary, flowing with milk and honey, the dominion of enemies, good upbringing, and a long life.
"from the one from heaven," he speaks, promising the same heaven as an inheritance, granting the enjoyment of that overwhelming glory and eternity. It is possible to say: On earth, to engage in matters, since almost all of the physical purifications were found in the lawgiving through Moses. The new law given to us through Christ is a cleansing and illumination of the soul. Therefore, those things are said to be on earth, as they are humble and related to the material body. But these things are from heaven, as they are divine and lofty, purifying the soul and elevating it to the heavens.
