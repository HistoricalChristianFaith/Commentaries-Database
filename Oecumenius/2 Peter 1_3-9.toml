As all things are given to you by His divine power, which pertains to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His glory and virtue, by which precious and great promises have been granted to you, so that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust. But also for this very reason, giving all diligence, add to your faith, virtue, to virtue, knowledge, to knowledge, self-control, to self-control, perseverance, to perseverance, godliness, to godliness, brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness, love. For if these things are with you and abound, you will be neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For he who lacks these things is shortsighted, even to blindness, and has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins.
Indeed, a long series has been presented, and this is the understanding: Just as countless good things have been received through the appearance of Christ, by which we may become partakers of the divine nature and be led back to life and godliness: so we must conduct ourselves, so that we may support virtue through faith, and by this means progress towards the promotion of godliness, until we reach the perfection of diligence, which is love. Moreover, we have become partakers of the divine nature through the coming of the Lord and God, who took the first fruits of our nature upon Himself and sanctified it by assuming it. If the first fruits are holy, the mass is also holy. Furthermore, the mass of the first fruits is nothing other than those from which the first fruits come. However, Peter speaks of the corruption that comes from worldly lust, as if it were concerning the corruptible and those things that are corruptible.
The step leads to promotion: first indeed faith, which is the foundation and basis or principle of good things.
Then in the second step virtue or works, for without this faith is dead, as James (2:26) says.
After this indeed is knowledge. What is this? The knowledge of the secrets of God's mysteries, which does not happen to everyone, but to one who is exercised in the habit of better works.
After this is self-control. For this is also necessary for one who has reached the measure, lest he become wanton due to the greatness of the gift. Since it does not happen that one who uses self-control for a short time can firmly possess the gift (for they always desire afflictions to lead them to what is worse), having entered into tolerance completes the whole matter and appeases godliness, producing a more perfect assurance in God: therefore from godliness, brotherly love is sought, which does not approach unless kindness grants access to all things of godliness. And above all, the fulfillment of all good things is love, as it seems to both Paul (Rom. 13:13) and the Truth. For this has both the Son of God and His Father prevailed: indeed, that He might give Him as a beloved Son, but the Son to pour out His blood for us.
"For if these things are with you and abound." What are these? Faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, love, which must not only be present but also abound. For if presence is beneficial, much more is abundance or wealth. What, then, is the benefit that follows from these? To have security for the second coming of the Lord. For indeed, to those to whom these are not present, in the glory of the coming Judge, and in the manner of the shining sun, blindness follows. Where, even if it is strong in appearance, it cannot be gazed upon without injury by the exaggeration of those who are weak-eyed, since it was born shining in its own light in such a way that it blinds those who rely on it with feeble sight. But the word Μυωπάζειν is used to mean, ἀπὸ τῶν μυῶν, that is, from the moles living underground, who remain blind to everything.
"has forgotten that he was cleansed from his old sins." This is similar to what was said by blessed James: "For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer: he shall be compared to a man beholding his natural face in a mirror. For he saw himself, and went his way.” (James 1:23-24) For when he had known that he had been cleansed by holy baptism, because he had been washed from the multitude of sins, he ought to have known that it is necessary to be vigilant in order to maintain his purity and sanctity, without which no one will see God (Heb. 12:14): but he indeed forgot.
