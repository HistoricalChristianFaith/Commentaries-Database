He says, These are the words of the Amen: this is equivalent to The true one says these things (Rv 3.7), as has been explained earlier. For Amen is “Yea.” For in him is “Yea,” and not “No” at all, as is said about him. And the faithful witness has been mentioned earlier. So it is unduly verbose to go through the same things twice. 

He says, the beginning of God’s creation: perhaps the Arians’ anti-Christ workshop would light upon this saying, as though the Son were described by these words as a creature. But let us not take notice of their unholy words. We must examine whether any such description occurs in another text, so that one might be able to form a judgment by comparing similar terms. 

The wise apostle, writing to the Colossians, talks of the Son “who is the first-fruit” and “the first-born of all creation,” certainly not “the first-created.” And the prophet says, “From the womb before the morning-star I begot you,” certainly not “I created you.” But also Solomon: “Before all the hills he begets me.” For “the Lord created me as the beginning of his ways,” referring to the Lord’s body animated by his mind. Saint Gregory accepted this sense in his work On the Son. “He begets” refers to his divinity. 

Therefore since all have decreed to use “begetting” and not “creation” in the case of the only Word and Son, what is the meaning of the present text, the beginning of God’s creation? Nothing other than the ruler of God’s creation, and he who has the rule over all things. For since the Father has made all things through the Son, it follows that as the maker and craftsman of the universe, who brings the universe into being from nonexistence, he rules over what has been brought into being by him. 

He says, I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. The one who is aglow with the Spirit is hot—for says the divine apostle, “those who are aglow with the Spirit”—but the one who is deprived of the activity and visitation of the Holy Spirit is cold. 

But you, he says, are lukewarm: he calls lukewarm those who received a share in the Holy Spirit through baptism, but who quenched the gift through sloth and concern for temporal things. This, too, is the divine command: “Do not quench the Spirit.” I wish you were either cold or hot, because you are lukewarm. 

He means, “If only you were aglow, inflamed by the action of the Spirit, or totally cold and entirely lacking the grace of the Spirit, and unbaptized, instead of being lukewarm.” For those who have the mind of the Spirit spread fire among men, “having their senses trained for distinguishing between good and evil,” and they are spiritual; but those who have not yet received the grace of the Spirit, but still hope one day to receive it, are not numbered among the rejected. The lukewarm, on the other hand, have not only been deprived of life but have also lost the chance of ever being baptized again and being aglow. 

He says, I am going to spew you out of my mouth: he has properly used the metaphor of lukewarmness; for all that is lukewarm, as medical men say, causes nausea and leads those who partake of it to vomit. That, too, is why they give those who do not vomit easily some lukewarm water to swallow, in this way encouraging them to vomit. And he says, “I am going to reject you from my intimacy.” 

What is the cause of such a condition? He says, “You set your hope on the uncertainty of riches, and as if among thorns you choked the gift of grace.” You were not listening to him when he said, “If riches increase, do not set your heart on them.” He says that riches are worldly and temporary. 

You do not know that you are beggarly and naked, since you do not know the gifts of the Spirit, which endure. I counsel you, therefore, to buy gold refined by fire, that you may be rich. What is meant by gold refined by the spiritual fire is taught by the prophet, saying, “The promises of the Lord are pure promises, silver refined and tested in the ground, purified seven times,” referring in this way to the proclamation of the gospel. 

This then requires from me the power to instruct you and to bring you near to God. For one who has acquired this ability both shines with virtue and will be cleansed in soul and body. This is the new white garments. 

And, he says, salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see: to some of those who could see only dimly the spiritual light of the Lord, a reproachful saying of Jeremiah says, “See, neither your heart nor your eyes are sound.” Therefore, he counsels them to embrace cleansing repentance to get rid of such impairment, just as the barren fig-tree with its rather worthless existence was addressed with manure. 

He says, Those whom I love, I reprove and chasten: how surpassing is the extent of the love of Christ! For he promises to love them in spite of their being the sort of people the text describes; wherefore he both reproves and chastens them so that they may be zealous for better deeds and repent of their previous sins. 

He says, See, I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone should listen to my voice and open the door, I will come to him and have supper with him, and he with me. The Lord is showing his own meekness and peacefulness. For the Devil batters “with an axe and a chisel” the doors of those who do not receive him, according to the voice of the prophet. But even now the Lord says to the bride in the Song of Songs, “Open to me, my sister, my bride.” And if anyone will open to him, he will enter. Otherwise, he will pass by. The supper with the Lord signifies participation in the holy mysteries. 

He says, To him who conquers the enemy I will grant to sit on my throne, that is, to reign together with me. For it is said by the most wise Paul, “If we suffer with him, we shall also reign with him.” 

He says, As I, too, have conquered, and reign with my Father: for the Lord also said in the gospels, “Be of good cheer; I have overcome the world.”
