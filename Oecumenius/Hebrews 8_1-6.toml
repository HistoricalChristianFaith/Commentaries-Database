"Moreover, the main point.” He always calls that which is greatest the main point. Whenever someone intends to summarize the main points briefly, he says that the discourse is made into a point; just as the head, though small, is the most important part of the body. Therefore, the apostle also says now: "Moreover, the main point of what we say is this"—that is, to say the greatest and most comprehensive, we have a God as high priest; for the priesthood belongs to no one else but God.
“we have such a high priest.” This mixes the humble with the awe-inspiring in this place, so that through the humble it may prepare the way for the awe-inspiring. The humble are to be a priest and an administrator; the awe-inspiring is to sit at the right hand of God and in the heavens.
“of the throne of majesty.” He calls it the throne of majesty, the paternal throne, or that majesty might also be said to belong to the Father; or simply thus, the throne of majesty, the greatest throne.
"a minister of the sanctuary." The High Priest, he says, is of men who have been sanctified by him. For he is our High Priest. If he sat at the right hand of the Father, how is he a minister? For it is proper for ministers to stand and serve; but to sit is the role of God to whom the ministry is rendered. But, as has been said, the humble mingles with the awe-inspiring, so that by sitting he may show divinity, and by ministering the guardianship and humanity concerning us.

For this is the ministry and this is the priesthood, to cleanse men from sins and to make them holy. For such a minister and worker of the saints must sit at the right hand of the Father as the true God and Son.

"and of the true tabernacle." Here, he refers to the heavens as the tabernacle. For they were saying, perhaps, the believers from Judea: If he is a high priest, where is the tabernacle in which he performs his priestly duties? He indicates that there is also a tabernacle, and the difference of it compared to the Jewish tabernacle, wanting to show that it was established by the Lord and not by man.
"For every high priest." For he says, it is proper for the high priests to offer gifts and sacrifices (for this is why they are established), it is necessary for the Christ also to offer something, I mean sacrifices. Therefore, he took on his own flesh, which he also offered. He said this, so that no one would say, If he is a high priest forever, why did he die? Why? So that he might offer himself as a sacrifice. For without sacrifices, he would not even be a high priest.
"thus it is necessary for this one also to have something to offer." Such as Christ.
"For if he were on earth." This was the case, if he had not died, nor had he been taken up after rising.
“he would not be a priest at all.” For there would be others, even a rebellion would be present. But now he has died, so that he may offer the sacrifice. Rising from the dead, he was taken up, so that he might have a place in heaven, where he must serve as a priest. To serve as a priest means to intercede for us. All these humble words were said, both because of humanity and because of the childishness of those who hear.
"who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things." Those who are priests of the Jews, he says. And how do they serve as a copy and shadow of the heavenly things? For he says,
"See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain." And the things shown to him were heavenly. There were also services, and prayers, and sacrifices, and the construction of the tabernacle.
“just as Moses was instructed.” "He has heard, he knows."
"According to the pattern shown to you." Since the sight is easier to learn than hearing, for this reason God showed Moses everything, not only the construction of the tabernacle, but also concerning the sacrifices and the other worship.
"But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry." Now, he says, since it is not on earth, but in heaven, a better ministry has been attained, that is, the high priest is for a better ministry. See how he engages with the humble because of the weakness of those who are listening. But if he were to say something awe-inspiring, he would immediately be dismissed, fearing that it would not be accepted.
"inasmuch as he is also the mediator of a better covenant." Thus, he says, the ministry is better than the old, as the new covenant, of which Christ is the mediator, is new, I say, the covenant of faith in Him, in which He mediated for Himself and for the Father,
"which was established on better promises." This covenant, he says, was enacted on better promises. For the old promised the good things of the earth; but the new, the kingdom of heaven. And thus the promises from this are better, because the former has been abolished. Therefore, the new triumphs, because it is better, and is given on better promises. And the better one has the promises, for it is better, is evident everywhere.
