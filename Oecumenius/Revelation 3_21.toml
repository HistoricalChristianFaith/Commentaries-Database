To the one who overcomes, He says, I will grant to sit with Me on My throne, that is, he will reign with Me. For it has been said by the most wise Paul, "if we suffer with Him, we shall also reign with Him." (Rom. 8:17; 1 Cor. 4:8)

Just as I also conquered, He says, and I reign with My Father. For the Lord has also said in the Gospels: "Take heart, I have overcome the world." (Jn. 16:33)
