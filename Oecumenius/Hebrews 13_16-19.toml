"Do not forget the good deeds and the fellowship." Paul speaks of good deeds and fellowship as the same.
"God is pleased." That is, He is pleased; for the term “is pleased” [εὐαρεστεῖται] indicates to be well-pleased. Therefore, it is necessary not only to offer the fruit of the lips, but also such sacrifices, like those of thanksgiving and good deeds. For the grateful person, it is evident that he is also generous, knowing what he is worthy of.
"Obey your leaders." Paul speaks about bishops. Earlier, having praised them in saying that they are faithful and worthy of being rivalled, in saying: "Considering the outcome of their conduct, imitate their faith," (Heb. 13:7) he then adds, "Obey." What then? Should one obey every ruler? One should not obey the one who believes wrongly; but one should obey the one who lives poorly, yet believes well. For he says, "be careful to do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do, for they do not practice what they preach." (Matt. 23:3) And concerning those corrupted regarding the faith he says: "Do not be led astray by various and strange teachings." (Heb. 13:9) Why is that? Because the one who lives poorly would not advise others to live poorly; for even he, doing these things, is ashamed; and it is clear that he is trying in every way to hide what he does; but the one who is wicked regarding the faith will proclaim wickedness to the people.
"and submit to them." The stretched persuasion through the phrase, "and submit to them," indicates that they may also serve them through deeds, if it is necessary.
"for they are keeping watch over your souls." Let the leaders hear that, just as it is necessary for the people to be obedient, so too must the priest be keeping watch for the sins of the people; for the leaders are subject to punishment for the sins of the people.
"Let them do this with joy." They will certainly stay awake for your souls; but whether you are obedient or not will prepare them to do this either with joy or with groaning, which will be unprofitable for you, that is to say, no advantage to you, useless; for God will help.
"Pray for us." Because some were slandering the apostle, as teaching apostasy from the law, many of the Hebrews had a strong distaste toward him; therefore, Paul did not even place his name at the beginning of the letter, so that they would not find the name of Paul and then not read the letter. Therefore, he now defends himself to them. And first, he asks them to pray for him, as we are accustomed to ask from those who love us. Then he also shows himself to be innocent; for we are sure, he says, that we have a clear conscience; that is, we have done nothing with hypocrisy, but our conscience is clear, and we are not aware that we have plotted against you, or have done anything evil against you, or have slandered you.
"desiring to act honorably in all things." That is, in all things, living without offense and without causing scandal; not proclaiming a departure from the law, as some slander, but rather transitioning from the letter and the shadow to the spirit and the truth (Jn. 4:24); which is not a departure, but rather a fulfillment and promotion of the law.
"I urge you to do this more sincerely." What is this? To pray for us. This was something they greatly loved, to want to pray for them sincerely and with all diligence, so that they might quickly be restored.
"in order that I may be restored to you sooner." This was said because Paul had a good conscience, wanting to persuade them in person; which he would not have done if he were aware of any wrongdoing in himself.
