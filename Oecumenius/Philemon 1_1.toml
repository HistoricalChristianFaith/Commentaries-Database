"Paul, a prisoner". Immediately from the opening words he instructs the master not to shame the servant. For all things, even chains, are good for Christ. And that it is right for grace to be given to the prisoner for Christ.

"and Timothy our brother". He includes Timothy as a partner in the supplication.

"to Philemon our beloved". If beloved, he will grant favor; if a coworker, he will not put the servant to shame in the service of the preaching. Onesimus, having been given, will also fulfill the work of the master Philemon.
