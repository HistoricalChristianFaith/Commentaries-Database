The gates of the city, which we have interpreted to represent the apostles, “each were of a single pearl.” And so the pearl is now placed here as something new, for it was not numbered with the stones of the oracle. It is possible, then, to see that the stones just now enumerated are more precious than those listed by the Old Testament as woven in the oracle. Through this it is signified that the apostles understood the Old Testament and were well-versed in the laws and customs in it—and for that reason the wise apostle said “as to righteousness under the law blameless.” However, it also signified that they had become well-versed in the commandments of the New Testament and were rich in the knowledge of it. For it was much clearer, and as it were more precious than the knowledge of the Old Testament, since in the law there was a kind of shadow, while in the New Testament reality had come. And this is symbolized by the mingling of the jewels of the Old Testament and those of the New Testament that are in the foundations of the city, which indicate the apostles. In the Gospels the Lord also said the same thing: “Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old.” And the gates of the city, which we have interpreted as the apostles, were from a single pearl, indicating their honor, purity and splendor.

We have said that the gold and the purity and transparency of the glass signify the honor and purity of the life of the saints.
