And there were also the gates of the city, which we likewise received as the apostles, each one from a single pearl. Therefore the pearl is now set as new, not itself numbered among the stones of the list, and it is possible to see that the newly named ones are rather more valuable than those placed in the list in the old book; by which is indicated that the holy apostles have knowledge of the Old Covenant and approve of the decrees established in that, and the wise apostle could say, "having been made righteous according to the law, I am blameless" (Philip. 3:6) and also approved in the precepts of the New Covenant, and that its knowledge has been enriched, which was much clearer and somewhat more precious than the knowledge in the Old, if indeed the things in the law were a shadow, and the things in the New were truth; for this is hinted by the mingling set forth: both the precious stones of the Old and the New are in the foundations of the city, which, as has been said, testify to the apostles.

And this is what the Lord said in the Gospels: "therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure new things and old." (Matt. 13:52) And he says that the gates of the city, which we have likewise conceived in describing the apostles who arrived, each one is made of a single pearl, their preciousness being pure and bright, as they are described.

And the street of the city, he says, was pure gold, like transparent glass. It has been said that gold and the purity and transparency of glass signify the precious and refined aspect of the holy life.
