Therefore, brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble. For in this way, an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Therefore, I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, even though you know and are established in the present truth. Yet I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you, knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. Moreover, I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my departure.
Therefore, Peter says, my brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election as permanent and unchangeable, that is, the teaching you heard regarding your election and calling, so that you may be blameless: do not be judged as if you have forgotten the gift of God, but remain steadfast having your calling secure.
“For if you do these things.” What are these? Those which have been predicted, namely virtue, knowledge, temperance, and the other things that follow. Notice, however, how orderly it is that those things which were fearsome are now directed through good to the entrance of the eternal kingdom of the Lord.
"even though you know." So that they are not seen to be continually admonished about the same things, as if rebuked for living in idleness, and thus become saddened, for this reason Peter adds: even though you know and are established in the present truth. Moreover, giving a reason for the continuous admonition, he added that he knew a release from this body would soon come.
What is suggested, for example: "I will be careful to ensure that you always," some understand through a reversal of a word order in this way: I will take care and after my departure, you will always have or continuously the memory of these things: wanting to show from this that even after the death of the saints, they remembered what they accomplished here for the living. Others, however, simply treating that saying, understand it thus: I will take care and you will always have after my departure the last mention of these things: that is, do not be surprised, nor consider it burdensome that there is a constant mention made to you about these matters. For I do not do this condemning your ignorance, but by a continuous teaching about these things, I present to you this support, so that, being strengthened by these, you may also have after my death a living and permanent teaching about these matters.
