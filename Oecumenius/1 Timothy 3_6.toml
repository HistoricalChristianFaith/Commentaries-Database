He must not be a recent convert, lest, being arrogant, he fall into the judgment of the Devil.

He must not be a recent convert. It does not mean the younger person, but one recently instructed in the faith. For Timothy himself was also younger. "For no one should despise your youth," (1 Timothy 4:12) he says as he goes on. For he who is still a student ought, if anyone makes him a teacher, to be proud and confident.

he fall into the judgment of the Devil. To the same, Paul says, to the Devil, a judgment, into which he fell out of madness.
