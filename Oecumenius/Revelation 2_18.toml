The declaration of the proper title [προσηγορίας] is made clearer by the one who communicates with the evangelist.

He says, These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, symbolizing the awe-inspiring and threatening judgment against sinners.

And His feet are like gleaming bronze, symbolizing the firmness of faith in him and unwavering steadfastness, or the spiritual fragrance of the evangelical doctrines as described above.
