The altar is said to be incense [λιβανωτὸν], as it receives the incense. When Christ appeared, as a kind of first fruits and precious offering, the prayers of the saints are presented to Him by the angels who oversee us. These prayers are naturally fragrant and become even more fragrant through the cooperation of the holy angels.

Therefore, it has been said that much incense offerings was given to him. Indeed, it was given by God as a clear sign to entrust humans to the angels and to make their prayers welcome. Those who receive it grant a fragrant aroma to the prayers of the saints.
