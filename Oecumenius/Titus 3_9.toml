but avoid foolish disputes, genealogies, contentions, and strivings about the law, for they are unprofitable and vain.

but avoid foolish disputes, genealogies. Genealogies or concerning the Greeks, who were recounting the lineage of their gods. They say, 'such a one begot such a one'. Concerning the Jews, who do not assert anything, but resort to genealogies and from them hold great esteem. Abraham, they say, Isaac and Jacob are our ancestors. But they bring foolish things, that is, nothing beneficial. For what benefit is there to a sinner if Abraham is his father? Indeed, rather it will bring harm if, having come from these, they were made reprobate. Flee, and beware. How then does Paul elsewhere command that he should stop the mouths of those who contradict, if it is absolutely necessary to believe and to forsake? And we say: That it is necessary to stop the mouths of those who teach to the destruction of others: but when they contend against you not about dogma, yield and forsake.

for they are unprofitable. For, Paul says, they will have no good end.

Exhortations concerning the avoidance of heretical seekers.
