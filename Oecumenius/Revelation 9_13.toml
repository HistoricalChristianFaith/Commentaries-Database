When "the angel sounded", "I heard a voice" coming "from the horns of the altar". "The horns of the altar", he says, are those that stand out among the angels and surpass the others.

He calls the altar "golden" because of its honor and divine nature, made from precious material known to us, depicting a marvelous altar.

Just as we understood "the horns of the altar" to represent the rulers of the angels, so the altar itself symbolizes all the ministering spirits; because it offers a spiritual [λογικήν] sacrifice to God.
