By the “horns of the altar” he refers to those preeminent among the angels and who are superior to all the others. He says that the altar is “golden,” for in mentioning that element that is of great value among us, he describes the altar as precious and holy and wondrous. And since we understand “the horns of the altar” to refer to the leaders of the angels, it follows that we interpret the altar itself to refer to all the ministering spirits on account of the spiritual sacrifice they bring to God.
