By the garments that have not been soiled he means the bodies of the saints, just as the patriarch Jacob said, “He will wash his robe in wine.” And Isaiah said much the same thing: “Why is your garment red as one who treads in the wine press, as of one who has completely trodden [the wine press].” And so the white garment signifies the purity of the body.
