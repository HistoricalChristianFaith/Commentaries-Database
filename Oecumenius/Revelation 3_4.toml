He says, Nevertheless, you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy, whom I say I am now postponing and patiently enduring for you. The garments not defiled refer to the bodies of the saints according to what was said by the patriarch Jacob; he washes his robe in wine (Gen. 49:11); and Isaiah says the same: Why are your garments red, as if they were stained in a winepress? (Isa. 63:2-3) The white garment thus symbolizes the purity of the body.
