But you followed my teaching, my conduct, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance, my persecutions, my sufferings, such as happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra, what persecutions I endured; and out of them all the Lord rescued me.

Indeed, those are such, Paul said, but you know that mine are not of this kind. For you did not simply accompany me, but you followed closely, that is, you accompanied me for a long time, and you paid attention to all my teachings. Therefore, you must be steadfast in the state of moral teachings, unshakable, "followed my teaching." On the matters concerning doctrines.

my conduct. Concerning life. How I was led, Paul says, in the state.

my purpose. As to eagerness, and to the presence of the soul.

my faith. Preserved in dangers, which would not allow despair, but to believe in God that He would deliver.

my patience. Paul says, nothing of the trials was more grievous to me.

my endurance. Endurance towards persecutions.

such as happened to me. Not only was I persecuted, Paul says, but I also suffered. Then, furthermore, he goes through the trials in detail, making the disciple bolder by this. For continuous memory of the trials, he knows, encourages the soul. But he only mentions these things either because they are more recent or because they were known to Timothy, and this is more likely.

at Antioch. The trials are not listed by type. For the discourse does not see it as motivation, but as guidance for the disciple. And here Paul speaks two things suitable for encouragement. That I, he says, showed zeal, and God gave assistance. He indeed says Antioch in Pisidia.

— [OECUMENIUS] "at Lystra." I suppose that Paul said Lystra in the last place out of some misery, from which Timothy originated: as if he were to say: Surely, I suffered in frequent and populous cities what I endured; but why did I also suffer in Lystra? From there were found men who would afflict me in Lystra? [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 181v,; B f. 219r; G f. 308r] —
