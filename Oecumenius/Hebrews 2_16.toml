"but he took hold of the seed of Abraham." The term "hetook hold" [ἐπιλαμβάνεται] indicates that we, as humans, flee from him, but Christ pursues, and by pursuing, he reached and took hold. He did not take hold of the nature of angels nor did he assume it, but of human nature.
Then, wishing to signify that Christ came according to the flesh from Judah, he says, "the seed of Abraham."
