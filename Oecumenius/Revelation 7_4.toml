And he says that one hundred and forty thousand were sealed; for many were those who believed in Christ from among the Jews, who owed their salvation from the common destruction to this number. And those who spoke with Paul in Jerusalem bear witness: "Look, brother, how many myriads of Jews have believed." (Acts 21:20)

It was not only reasonable to spare the faithful but also those who, in ignorance and deception, cooperated with the crucifixion of the Lord, concerning whom He said: "Father, forgive them; for they do not know what they are doing." (Luke 23:34) Cyril, in his thirteenth book Against Julian, states that this prayer of the Lord is not found in the Gospels according to the pagans, but it is indeed present among us. And not only these individuals but also those who were not present at that time, or who were residing in Jerusalem, and therefore did not partake in the impious counsel of the accursed chief priests regarding the crucifixion, or even those who were present but did not share in the guilt of the pollution, for He blessed all under heaven, having opposed or rejected the godless council of the lawless; all of whom it was reasonable to be later sealed by the faith of Christ. For the angel would not have otherwise called them servants of God; of whom, when some were preserved, the rest, being evil, defected even to the Romans and were thoroughly corrupted, "becoming a spectacle to the world and to angels and men" (1 Cor. 4:9) in a different manner, and not as Paul spoke concerning the divine apostles. Of these, again Josephus is a witness, enumerating the greatest number, tens of thousands, due to the famine.
