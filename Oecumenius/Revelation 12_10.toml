Therefore, the holy angels, revealing their own joy which they had at the overthrow of Satan, sing a victory hymn to God, saying just now: "Now salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, for He is Almighty; for by His cooperation we have overcome the enemy.

And the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them before our God day and night, has departed from us. O the self-restraint of the holy angels; how they are imitators of their own Master. They call men their brothers.

And why is this wonderful? Even the common master did not contempt to call them this; "I will proclaim your name to my brothers; in the midst of the church, I will praise you." (Heb. 2:12; Ps. 21:23) But what do they say about Satan? He has departed. He was stripped of his rank. No longer is there room for him to stand before God and accuse men.
