When John said, "I was in the Spirit" indicates a vision not perceptible to the senses, nor seen by the flesh or eyes, but rather by prophetic insight; concerning these spiritual perceptions Isaiah said: "He gave me understanding early on, He gave me an ear to hear, and the instruction of the Lord opened my ears." (Isa. 54:4)
