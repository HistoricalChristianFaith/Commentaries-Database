I was in the spirit: These words mean that that he saw a vision that was not understandable by the senses nor seen with physical ears or eyes, but with a prophetic sense. Isaiah spoke concerning this spiritual hearing when he told “me a learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakened in the morning, in the morning he wakened my ear, that I may hear him as a master. The Lord God has opened my ear. (Is. 50:4-5)”
