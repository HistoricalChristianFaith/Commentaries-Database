There are more cities in Asia than these, but he is commanded to write to those taught by him and who had received the faith of Christ. For those who did not believe and turned away from the saving word, how could anybody even advise them?

I was in the spirit: These words mean that that he saw a vision that was not understandable by the senses nor seen with physical ears or eyes, but with a prophetic sense. Isaiah spoke concerning this spiritual hearing when he told “me a learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that is weary: he wakened in the morning, in the morning he wakened my ear, that I may hear him as a master. 5 The Lord God has opened my ear.(Is. 50:4-5)”
