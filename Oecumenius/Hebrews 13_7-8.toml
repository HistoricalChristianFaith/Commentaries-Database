"Remember your leaders." Of the teachers. This Paul also advised the Thessalonians, so that they hold them in honor exceedingly. (1 Thess. 5:13) And just as they share in the word, so if it is possible, to help them in their bodily needs. For this is hinted at by the phrase, “remember”. It also encourages them to imitate them.
“consider the outcome of their.” Reflecting, examining. This can be said both about the deceased and the living; concerning the deceased: reflecting, Paul says, on how they exited life, what kind of conduct they had in the world, imitate their faith; for a pure life is based on faith. For if they had not believed in what was to come, but had hesitated, they would not have demonstrated the best way of life. Concerning their way of life: Reflecting, he says, on how they conduct themselves well in life, become imitators of their faith.
"the outcome of their way of life." The community until the end.
"Jesus Christ yesterday and today." Some among them were saying, The crucified one, the proclaimed and expected Christ does not exist. Another, they say, will come. Therefore, Paul says, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever." By "yesterday," he indicates the past ages; by "today," the present; by "the same forever," the future. As if he said: Another Christ will not come. For this one who has come is the one who was before, and he is and will be forever.
