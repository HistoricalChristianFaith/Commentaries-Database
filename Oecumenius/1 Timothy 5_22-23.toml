Do not quickly lay hands on anyone, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. No longer drink water but use a little wine for your stomach and your frequent ailments.

And Paul discusses the matter of selecting for ordinations. For he wrote to a bishop. And he says, do not quickly, for example, not from the first or second thoughts, but after examining many times and thoroughly.

nor share in the sins of others. That is, appointing a bishop that is unworthy of the people.

Keep yourself pure. Paul commands Timothy concerning self-control. But if a man so exhausts himself with fasting and drinking water that he even falls ill from it, what ought we to do, or how should we observe this?

No longer drink water. And why did Paul not heal his stomach, who also worked physical healings, but wanted him to be healed by diet? So that it might serve as a reminder to us not to be easily offended if good men were weakened: and so that Timothy himself might be kept in office through illness, lest he become proud. Finally, so that we might know that since they were of the same nature as us, those good works were performed which they did: since Paul could have healed him with a single prayer, but it was not altogether beneficial. Chrysostom has much to say on this matter. Therefore, see the book in which he discusses Images, and you will see very beautifully what has been treated on this subject by the divine Chrysostom in that place, in the introductory verse, as I understand.

but use a little wine. That is, only as much as is necessary for health: for Paul knows that even an excess of wine can be harmful. From this, it is indicated that Timothy was ill not only in the stomach but also in other parts of the body.
