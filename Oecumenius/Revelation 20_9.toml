quote='''
And they went up over the extent of the earth, and they will surround the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.

And they will surround the beloved city, that is, the Church.

But fire brought from heaven will devour them all, and when the end has come, the prime evil Satan will be cast together with the Devil and the Antichrist into the lake of fire, that is, Gehenna.
