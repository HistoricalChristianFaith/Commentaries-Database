For the reader should recognize that the present Revelation has already told us of three adversaries, one was the dragon, the originator of evil , shown in heaven; the second was the beast coming up out of the sea, which we considered to be the second Satan, but superior to the rest of the demons; But it is said shortly before about the second one, the Devil, and the Antichrist, that ;the two of them were thrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone.' But now he is talking about Satan, or the Devil, whom earlier he called serpent.
