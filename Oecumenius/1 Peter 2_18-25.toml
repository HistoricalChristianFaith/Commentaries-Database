Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unjust. For this is grace, if anyone endures grief for the sake of conscience toward God when suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your sins, you take it patiently? But if, when you do good and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is praiseworthy before God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving us an example, that you should follow His steps: who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth; who, when He was reviled, did not revile in return; when He suffered, He did not threaten, but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously; who Himself bore our sins in His own body on the tree, that we, having died to sins, might live for righteousness; by whose stripes you were healed. For you were like sheep going astray, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
"Servants, be subject." It must be understood that it means, that is, you are, just as when he said, Wives (1 Peter 3:1). "with all fear." Fear is expressed in many ways: it is called fear and also that which is with knowledge, which is now understood through Conscience, which is also called reverence with fear; it is also called painful fear, which is experienced by some through the punishment, which even wild animals fear; it is again called initial fear which follows those approaching the Lord, because they are aware of many things that provoke punishment: therefore the harlot mentioned in the Gospel, fearing, approached Christ (Luke 7:37); but perfect fear is again said to be that which is always present with all the saints, fearing lest anything be lacking in them for what is fitting for those who have been taken up to perfect love: therefore, since fear is expressed in many ways, whether it is just for servants to be presented to their masters through all these means, he who now encourages servants to be subject to their masters with all fear would not deny: since both initial and perfect fear would be present, it would rightly affect them: there, indeed, that they might fear, lest anything happen to them because of their offenses for which there would be no remedy; here, however, that they might not even think of anything, which, if accomplished, would be ungrateful to their master. Now, therefore, he speaks of fear that is due to conscience, that is, which occurs with a right conscience of reason: when, indeed, evil masters afflict their servants who have committed nothing. Therefore, judging this fear as worthy of praise, he commands that it be received with patience. Since those who have fear because of sins, whether those they have committed or even those they have not observed to do, are indeed good servants if they endure anything because of that, and are inclined towards correction: but they are not yet endowed with such great wisdom of mind as they would be if they endured affliction with a grateful heart, even when they were not conscious of any evil. This is great, this is also fulfilled by few; it is commended before God, as responding to the afflictions of Christ; since he himself, he says, did not suffer for his own sins: for he committed no sin, but suffered for us and for our transgressions. (Is. 53:8)
From the iniquities of my people, or because of the iniquities of the people, he was led to death, the prophet says (Is. 53:5), he places fear to be praised. However, he also wishes to retain servants with other fears: which is evident from what he says: with all fear. Moreover, he rightly and skillfully placed above other fears the fear that is due to conscience towards God, and demonstrated with the truest discourse that this alone is worthy of praise, for indeed they have a cause for the wrath of their masters against them, but here there is never anything of the sort.
"but committed Himself to Him who judges righteously," namely God, who gives to each according to their works (Rom. 2:6): this is just. But perhaps someone will say: How does Peter now say that the Lord, when he was being reviled, did not return reviling, and when he was suffering evil, did not threaten? Yet we see him calling some Jews dogs (Matt. 7:16; 15:26), and blind Pharisees (Matt. 15:14; 22:16), and threatening the Jews when he said: "It would be better for that man if he had not been born;" (Matt. 26:34) and: "It will be more tolerable for Sodom than for that city;" (Matt. 10:15) and: "Where their worm does not die," (Mark 9:48) and countless other things. We will say, therefore, that he does not say the Lord did not speak reviling, or did not threaten: but, when he was being reviled, he says he did not return reviling, and when he was suffering evil, he did not threaten. But although he might have uttered some reviling, he was not opposing those who reviled him, but reproaching and rebuking those who did not convert. However, when he was affected by reproaches and heard: "You have a demon," (Jn. 7:20; 8:48) and: "By the prince of demons he casts out demons," (Matt. 7:24; 9:34) and: "Behold, a glutton and a wine-drinker," (Matt. 9:19) did he direct reviling against them, saying something reproachful against them? Not at all, but he indeed said to them: "If I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out?" (Matt. 7:27) Indeed, this man, a ravenous eater and drinker of wine, opposed the parable of the indignant children in the marketplace against those with whom they conspired, that when they played the flutes, they did not dance; when they sang lamentations, they did not weep. However, crucified and afflicted by punishments, he prayed rather than threatened the Jew before he would betray, and being affected by some evil, he threatened, restraining him from evil intent. Similarly, he showed those who would not receive the disciples that they would suffer something worse than the Sodomites: partly indeed urging them towards hospitality, partly opening a place for the preaching of the Gospel through fear. Therefore, he did not threaten these things while he was being afflicted by evils; and the word of Peter concerning the Lord's mercy is very true, saying that he did not bring any accusation against anyone while they attempted to accuse him.
"As dead to sins." For having become estranged by sins, (ταῖς ἁμαρτίαις ἀπογενόμενοι), it is taken for ἀποθάνοντες, that is, dead.
“by whose stripes you were healed.” For having been scourged by Pilate, he also bore scourges in the body.
