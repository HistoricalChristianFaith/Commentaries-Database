If any one has a mind able to understand what is being said, it says, “let him hear” what is being spoken and let him know that whoever is ready to bring others into captivity will be captured by the beast and will desert willingly to him. For having no defense from God, he will be carried away into utter evil. And should anyone be prepared for murders, he will die a spiritual death by worshiping the devil. “Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.” In this manner is one free from the servitude of the evil one. May it be that we all be found free from such servitude by the grace of God, who has called us to his knowledge. To him be glory forever. Amen.
