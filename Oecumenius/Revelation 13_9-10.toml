He means that if anyone has the sense to understand these sayings, let him hear what is said and know that he who is preparing to make prisoners of others will be taken prisoner by the beast and will desert to him of his own accord. For if he finds no support whatever from God, he will be carried away into every kind of evil. 

If anyone has been prepared for murder, he will undergo spiritual death by his worship of the Devil. 

He says, Here is the endurance and faith of the saints: This is how one escapes being enslaved by the wicked one. 

May all of us be delivered from this slavery by the grace of God who has called us to know him. To him glory is due for ever. Amen.
