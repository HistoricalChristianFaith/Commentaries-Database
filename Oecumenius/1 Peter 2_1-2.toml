Therefore, laying aside all malice and all deceit and hypocrisies and envies, and all slanders, like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation.
Where the excellence of spiritual rebirth shows above birth according to the flesh, and demonstrates the despair of mortal glory: for birth is indeed corruptible and filthy, while glory is not different from those things that germinate in springtime: it shows that the same does not occur in the Lord's word. For all human opinion soon ceases, but not so the word of God; rather, it has a perpetual duration and true promises. For that is what the addition means, "The word which by the gospel was preached to you." (1 Peter 1:25) When he had woven this in the preceding parts, taking from each what is useful and tends toward necessary use, he adapts the teaching to moral discourse, and says:
Therefore, laying aside all malice, designating so many and such things with these few words. For those who are reborn to incorruptible life, it is unworthy to be caught in the snares of malice, and to prefer what is not to what truly is. For malice is not substance, but revolves around the vice of created substance. However, there is a great distinction between the life that subsists and that which has only loyalty to what subsists. These, however, are worthy, he says, to be shown to be free from deceit and hypocrisies and from envies, and all slanders. Indeed, deceit and hypocrisies are far from "the word which by the gospel was preached to you," (1 Peter 1:25) as deceit leads to the destruction of those who are seduced, while hypocrisies proceed in variation and change of that which is: against which the valuable discourse that has instructed you seems to proceed. But what place will envy and slander have in you, who, bound by the solid bond of brotherly love, can receive harm from any discord stirring up? Moreover, he who does not know that envy and slander are the causes of discord and brotherly hatred is unaware of both Cain and the tragedy that surrounded him, who, because of envy, was torn from brotherly union, and conceived deceit, hypocrisy, and murder. (Gen. 4:1) But he is pure from slander who is envious, provided that Joseph's brothers are deemed suitable to confirm the speech, who reported this to the father about countless matters. (Gen. 37:1)
Therefore, Peter said, purifying yourselves from all these things, as newborn infants, approach (for such is the kingdom of God, as the Lord has demonstrated [Luke 17:16]) and grow up in the word of malice, until you reach the measure of the fullness of Christ's age. (Eph. 6:14)
