By great he speaks of the just, not because they are great by any physical measurement but because of their glory and the brightness of their virtue. By small he means the sinners, since they have become as nothing through their baseness and worthlessness. “And books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the Book of Life.” In the Gospels, the Lord says that the way that leads to destruction is broad and wide and that many walk on it, but that the way that leads to life is narrow and cramped and that not only are there few who are walking on it, but few who even find it. For this reason he saw many books and one book. There are many books because all of humankind is inscribed in them, and there is a great number in them. There is but one Book of Life, because in it are inscribed those who are the elect, that is, those blameless in virtue, who have trodden every rugged and steep path of virtue. Everyone in the books, it says, were judged deservedly according to their works. [Earlier] mention was also made of another book, which was called a “little scroll.” But now he speaks of a “book,” even a “scroll of life,” as if there were three different ones. He speaks of a “little scroll” in which are listed the most impious according to the thoughts there asserted. He also speaks of the “Book of Life” in which are listed the most pious and righteous. And finally he speaks of “books” in which all those are listed who are, as it were, in between evil and virtue.
