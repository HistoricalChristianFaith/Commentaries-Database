And I saw, he says, the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne. He calls the righteous great, not because of bodily size, but because of the glory and brilliance of virtue, and he calls the sinners small as nothing because of their lowliness and baseness.

And the little scrolls were opened; and another little scroll was opened, which is the book of life. The Lord in the Gospels says that the way leading to punishment is broad and spacious, and that many go on it; but that the way leading to life is narrow and compressed, and that few are not only walking on it, but also finding it (see Matt. 7:13-14). Therefore, he saw many scrolls and one scroll; many in which all men are written because of the multitude of those contained, one however of life, in which are those chosen from the others and who are as it were flawless in virtue and walking every rough and upward road of virtue.

And he says that each of those in the scrolls was judged according to his own deeds. And at the beginning of the sixth discourse he also remembers another little scroll, which he calls a tiny scroll.

Now the scroll and little scroll of life are threefold in meaning: he calls a tiny scroll in which are those very ungodly according to what is conceived there; the little scroll of life, in which are the very pious and righteous; and scrolls, in which all people are somewhat average, partaking of wickedness and virtue; and speaking of the matters concerning the resurrection:

For to say "and I saw the dead standing before the throne receiving and being judged according to their works" is to speak of the resurrection. For having risen, he saw the reward for the dead, receiving his recompense.
