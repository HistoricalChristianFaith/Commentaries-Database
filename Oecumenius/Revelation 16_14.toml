And he says that it is a kind of wonder-working of the demons to bring the kings together against one another in war at the time of the end, and he calls that day great, that is, that season; for truly that day is called great and terrible, and also by Joel it is said, before it comes, "the great and evident day of the Lord." (Joel 3:4)
