“That you might,” it says, “eat the flesh of kings.” The delight over the death of one’s enemies is called “food.” Similarly, the Lord also speaks of joy [as food] when he says to his disciples and apostles, “I have food to eat which you do not know.” In this way he calls “food” that delight that will come to those who believe.
