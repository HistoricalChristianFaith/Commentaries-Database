Therefore, my beloved brothers, let every man be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger. For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
What James says is not referred to mere hearing, but to vigorous action in work and to the one who, after hearing, proceeds to perform what he has heard. For he knows that he who listens with interest to what is said will also show himself prepared for their performance: just as, on the other hand, he who is affected by slowness in procrastinating in something, will be completely separated from all effort at work by being distracted. Therefore, in the doctrine of divine things, he prescribes speed, but in those things which have a dangerous administration, slowness. But those are speaking and being angry. For both thoughtless speech and uncontrolled anger never know how to end in good. Because of which a certain divine man once said [Xenocrates]: He often regretted having spoken, but never having remained silent. Again, that blessed David says: "Be angry and do not sin," (Ps. 4:5) that is, lest by being easily angry, you also incite the fury which anger suggests. These things are also similar to what is said here. Indeed, slowness in speaking and slow in becoming angry, preserved by hesitation in these matters, lead to what is decent and right: and either completely dissolve the impulse around these things through deliberate consideration, or teach a suitable way to respond to the occurrences that arise in their course, especially regarding anger; which, if it is induced irrationally, deprives divine justice. And therefore, James adds this reason:
For the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God. For if righteousness is a habit in the soul which divides each according to his dignity, but anger, as he says, destroys even the wise, how could this very thing which so darkens the mind with passionate affection as to destroy even the wise, constitute that which divides each according to his dignity?
"Slow to anger." He wants slowness to be exercised in us in two ways, for example in speaking and in becoming angry. For he knows that hesitation produces abstinence from committing an action.
