"Pursue peace with all." And among you mutually and among the slanderers. For there is great range when it is said, with all. Indeed, "With those," he says, "who hated peace, I was peaceful." (Ps. 120:7) For if indeed he injures, and you do not take revenge, peace will quickly be achieved.
"and the holiness." Holiness refers to purity, that is, virginity or chastity. For even one who is chaste in marriage fulfills holiness, although not properly. For marriage is not called holy, but honorable, even so, it accomplishes holiness.
"without which no one will see the Lord." For if neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor those like them will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9), how will they see the Lord who are not chaste, as it is necessary to see, without holiness?
"See to it that no one fails to obtain." Just as those walking a long road in company, considering, he says, this is diligently looking ahead and analyzing, so that nobody fails to obtain the grace of God. For it is necessary to take care both for yourselves and for your brothers, that no one lacks these things. Moreover, he calls the grace of God the future goods, whether faith or a suitable way of life. For all these things are the grace of God.
"that no root of bitterness springs up." The root of bitterness refers to sin. Therefore, he says: If there is anyone among you who is not rightly affected, let such a one be cut off, lest sin be brought forth into action (for this is what he means by "springs up"), lest it also become an occasion of sin for the others.
He says: "and by it many become defiled." Indeed, when someone sees a neighbor sinning, he will come to imitation, so that he himself may sin. He rightly called the root of bitterness, sin. For the bitter root can produce sweet fruits, but the root of bitterness is bitter to itself and to those to whom it is a root: for the root of bitterness is substance and, as it were, essence.
