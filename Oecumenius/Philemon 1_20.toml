"Yes, brother". Again, from what is pleasing it advances to what is serious. "Yes," he said, "brother." What? Accept it yourself. I will take advantage from you in things that are according to Christ.

"May I enjoy". That is, I delight in your excellent works in the Lord. May I see you growing rich in all spiritual blessings.

"refresh my heart". Paul says, Refresh my love for you for the sake of Christ.
