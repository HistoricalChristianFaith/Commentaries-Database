For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of discipline.

How then shall I rekindle the gift of God? If I stand honorable against temptations.

For God has not given us a spirit of fear. For there is a spirit or gift of fear, as it is said in the books of the Kings: And the spirit of fear fell upon them, where it was altogether necessary to fear. (2 Chron. 17:10) But to us, Paul says, a gift of power has been given.

but of power. Which is against temptations.

and of love.  Which is towards the brethren.

and of discipline. Concerning a proper life. And in all these things, we must also include our own eagerness.
