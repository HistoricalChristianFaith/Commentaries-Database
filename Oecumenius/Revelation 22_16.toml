“To testify” means to bear witness, not in private or in secret but so that the churches everywhere will hear and no one, feigning ignorance, will with evil intent do evil.

We might think that it would have been more consistent had he said, “I am the branch that has sprung from the root of David.” However, on the contrary, he has here called himself the root of David, and not only “root” but also the “offspring.” He is “root” and cause of all things, including David, insofar as he is and is known to be God, while he is “offspring” of David and has sprung from him according to the flesh, insofar as he is and is known to be man. And so he is—as the holy apostle somewhere says of his own words, “it is not irksome to me to say the same things” often, and for those who read them it is safe—and so he is the Immanuel, of divinity and of humanity, possessing both [natures] perfectly, according to the traditional language, unconfusedly, unchangeably, immutably, really. We are convinced that after the inexpressible union there is one person, one hypostasis and one energy, “even if the difference of the natures, from which we state the ineffable union has been made is not perceived,” nor the characteristic of each according to their natural quality, as our holy father, Cyril, says.

By morning star he means either the sun, since he is called the “sun of righteousness” in Malachi, and further the prophet sings, “fire has fallen upon them,” that is, upon the chief priests of the Jews, “and they did not see the sun,” that is, him who is the “sun of righteousness,” namely, Christ. Or he means the morning star. For he is also called this by Peter in his second letter: “until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.”
