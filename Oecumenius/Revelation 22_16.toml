I, Jesus, he says, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things to the churches. He says that to bear witness is not to do so in secret or in a private whisper, but before the congregations everywhere, so that no one, pretending ignorance, might be wicked through willing misconduct.

He says that I am the root and the offspring of David, although with regard to what appears it would be more accurate to say, I am the shoot sprung from the root of David. But now, on the contrary, he has called himself the root of David, and not only root but also offspring, as has been said above. Root indeed and cause of all things, among which is David, insofar as God is what he is understood to be; and offspring truly of David and having sprung from him according to the flesh, insofar as man is what he is understood to be. As to his being himself, for it is not tedious for me to say the same things often, and it is safe for those who encounter them, as the divine apostle in some of his discourses says. (see Philip. 3:1) Therefore since "Emmanuel" exists in both deity and humanity fully possessing each of the natures according to their proper principle, unconfused, unchangeably, indivisibly, incomprehensibly, and after the ineffable union we are persuaded that there is one person and one hypostasis and one operation, even if the distinction of the natures be not ignored, from which we say the ineffable union has been accomplished, not the natural property according to quality, as in the discourses of our inspired father Cyril.

The star, he says, is the morning; either he means the sun, since the sun is also called the sun of righteousness in Malachi, (Mal. 4:2) and moreover "fire fell upon them" that sang to the prophet, that is, upon the chief priests of the Jews and they "did not see the sun," (Ps. 57:9) namely the sun of righteousness Christ, or he means the morning star. For this is also called to Peter in the Second Epistle, saying, "until the day approaches and the morning star rises in your hearts." (2 Peter 1:19)
