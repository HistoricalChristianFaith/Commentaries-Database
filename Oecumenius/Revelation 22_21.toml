The worldly have already been banished from the life of the saints and from any entry into the spiritual Jerusalem. For how would the grace of Christ, our God, come upon those who had been declared excluded? Make us, O Christ, to be partakers of this grace through your goodness alone. For it is proper to give you glory now and always and forever. Amen.
