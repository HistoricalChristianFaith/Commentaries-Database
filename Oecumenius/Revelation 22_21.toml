quote='''
For the profane have already been shut out from the conduct of the holy and from entrance into the spiritual Jerusalem. But how could the grace of Christ our God come upon those who have been proclaimed? Make us partakers of it, Christ, through your goodness alone; for it befits you to be glorified now and ever and unto the ages. Amen.
