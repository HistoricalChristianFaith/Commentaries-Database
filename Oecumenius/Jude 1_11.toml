Woe to them, for they have gone the way of Cain, and for profit they have abandoned themselves to the error of Balaam, and in the contradiction of Korah they perished.
"The way of Cain": this is, through the murder of a brother: for those teaching such things also kill their brothers, or men of the same sort, with wicked doctrines. Or even by absorbing the seed, they kill the brother in virtue, whom the fruitfulness of the seed would bring forth to life.
"the error of Balaam", because they, like him, do these things for the sake of gain.
Furthermore, the way of Korah, because they, like him, seized the office of teacher, being unworthy.
