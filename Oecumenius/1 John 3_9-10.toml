Everyone who is born of God does not sin, because His seed remains in him, and he cannot sin, because he is born of God. By this, the children of God and the children of the Devil are obvious. Whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.
"Everyone who are born of God." For everyone who commits sin is of the Devil, and inasmuch as he sins, he is also called the child of the Devil; thus, blessed Paul said to Elymas: "O full of all deceit and all cunning, son of the Devil, enemy of all righteousness" (Acts 13:10); it is evident that even he who is born of God, as the Son of God, does not sin, and the reason is that his seed, namely, of God, or the Spirit that we have received as a gift, which remaining in us or being established, prevents our mind from receiving sin.
But Christ himself, as dwelling in the faithful, makes them children of God, inasmuch as all nations are blessed in the seed of Abraham, who is Christ. (Gen. 22:18; Gal. 3:9) Now, however, John proceeded in such a way in his speech, confirming what he had said before, I indeed say that the faithful are the children of God, and making that obvious, both from the same matter, namely, not to sin; and from the contrary, as we said a little earlier. For just as this contrary relates to that contrary, so again that contrary relates to this contrary according to dialectical arguments5. But consider the exact statement. For John did not first say that one is born of God or of the Devil, unless the works of either justice or iniquity are accepted beforehand. For from these indeed comes the adoption, either of God or of the Devil.
Although we have been saved by grace, this is said because of God's exceptional kindness, for although we had sinned permanently, He does not remember the evils for our salvation. (Eph. 2) Indeed, He does not give salvation to the idle. Paul confirms this by shouting: "To those who were called according to His purpose." (Rom. 8:28) Similarly, those who have been adopted by the Devil as children, although they are alienated from the womb (Ps. 58:3), since they have not yet acted according to the proposed evil: nonetheless, this is said because of their fiery hatred; for it does not happen without the operation of evil that one becomes proper and domestic to the Devil: but he who commits sin is taken by the Devil, whether as a child, so that he may further willingly commit evil, or as a servant, because he has been overcome by the wicked one, and led captive and condemned to his service.
However, it should also be noted that John did not say that he who is born of God does not sin, lest he also include infants, who from the womb have that they do not sin: but he said, "he cannot commit sin." Indeed, that: "He does not sin," corresponds totally to the denial; however, this: "He does not commit sin," signifies that he does not touch it out of affection. For this reason, John also adds that he cannot sin, not saying this according to the impossibility of nature, just as we say of irrational beings that they cannot receive knowledge: but he discusses this because of voluntary freedom or abstinence from sinning, and saying that not sinning is a sign of the children of God: just as again the children of the Devil sin.
