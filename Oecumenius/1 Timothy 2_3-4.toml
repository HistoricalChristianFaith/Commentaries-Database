For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

who desires all people to be saved. He says, if He Himself desires all to be saved, the Lord who also saves, who then needs my prayers? Yes. For you draw them and those to love, and you show affection. "Imitate," He says, "the purpose of God." (Eph. 5:1) For He Himself desires all people to be saved, and you pray for all people above all.

and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Paul said, "To the knowledge of the truth." Then he explains what the truth in doctrines is. If therefore God wills, he says, why does what He wills not happen? It does not happen because they do not want it. For God does nothing by compulsion.
