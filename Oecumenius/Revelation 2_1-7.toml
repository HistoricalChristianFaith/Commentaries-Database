By the angel of the church of Ephesus he means metaphorically the church in Ephesus. For it is not his own angel presiding over the church who has committed any sin who needs to hear Repent, since he is the most holy one and is therefore also on the right hand of the Lord, displaying the proof of his natural purity and sparkling light. 

What need could there be to say to the one giving God’s message to the evangelist, Write to him? For the divine angel was present and was listening to what was being said. The holy angel was on the right hand of the one who was speaking, and when the holy one himself finally interprets the vision seen by him, he says, He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit is saying to the churches: he did not say “to the angels of the churches,” but to the churches. So then in the same way you are to understand that, wherever you find write these things to the angel of this church, he is referring not to the angel but to the church. 

What does he command to be written to the church in Ephesus? He says, He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says this: this is the same as saying, “These are the words of him who treats with care and holds fast and embraces both the holy angels in heaven”—for these are the seven stars—”and human beings on earth.” For these are the seven lampstands, as was said earlier. He walks in the midst of those who worship him, and says through the prophet, “I shall dwell among them and I shall walk about among them.” 

He says, I know your works, your toil, and your patient endurance, and “nothing of the good things which you do has escaped me,” “who alone formed” your “hearts, and who understand all” your “deeds,” and, he says, you cannot bear evil men, since you have acquired the habit of hating evil. And you tested those who called themselves apostles, but are not, and you found them to be liars: the Ephesians were fulfilling the divine command: “Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, to see whether they are of God.” Therefore they used to test those among them who were proclaiming the gospel, and after testing them they found some false apostles who were imparting spurious beliefs. He is referring to the followers of Cerinthus, who were contemporaries of the evangelist and were preachers of profane doctrines.

He says, You have patience, and you bore up for my name’s sake, and you did not give up, and very fittingly; for it is said, “Bear one another’s burdens and so fulfill the law of God.” 

But, he says, I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first. Remember then from where you have fallen, and repent, and do what you did at first in righteousness: just as he said, “Your good actions have not escaped me,” so he says that you did not fail to show love to those in need. Return therefore to your former welldoing, now that I have taught you where you have fallen short. 

But if, he says, you will not return to where you came from, I shall come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent. I shall come to you does not indicate a movement involving a change of place of God who fills all things, but a change of attitude such as from long-suffering to punishment. By the removal of the lampstand, that is, the church, he means his abandonment of it, as a result of which sinners become involved in every kind of disturbance and tumult, so that they say, “My eye was troubled in my soul, and my heart was troubled with-in me.” 

He says, But you have this good point, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. He has placed their sin between two achievements, so that by the praises at each end he may assuage the rebuke in the middle, lest anyone be consumed by excessive distress. This Nicolaus to whom he is now referring had been a blasphemous and disgusting heresiarch. So those who were being overcome by his evil errors were rescued by the Ephesians, who were thus commended by Christ. 

Then after the divine admonition the evangelist adds his own words, saying, He who has an ear, that is, who is obedient and submissive to the divine laws, let him listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He said the Spirit either because the events of the Revelation were being carried out in the Spirit, or he calls Christ Spirit, as in fact he is and is understood to be God, just as of course he is also called the son of man, as he is and is perceived as man. For the Godhead as a whole is called Spirit, as the Lord himself says to the Samaritan woman when talking with her, “God is Spirit, and those who worship him must worship him in Spirit and truth.” 

So what does the Spirit say? To him who conquers I shall grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God: the phrase is figurative, for by the tree of life he means the blessed and eternal life, which the saints will enjoy in the kingdom of God, which he has now called Paradise. He says that those who have been victorious over the temptations of the enemy and who have exacted vengeance are worthy of this. 

But no one should take offense at the Lord’s saying of my God, for all the words denoting humility are rightly ascribed to the mystery of the incarnation. For he has also said in the gospel, “I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.” This is what he published in the church of Ephesus.
