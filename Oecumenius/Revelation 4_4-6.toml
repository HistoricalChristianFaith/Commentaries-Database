Only God, the one who knows the hidden things, and he to whom they are revealed, would know who were the twenty-four elders seated on the thrones. My guess is that they were Abel, Enoch, and Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, Melchisedek and Job, Moses and Aaron, Joshua the son of Nun, and Samuel, David, Elijah, and Elisha, the twelve minor prophets combined together as one, Isaiah and Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, Zechariah, and John, James the son of Joseph, and Stephen, the martyrs of the New Testament. 

One could have spoken of Peter, Paul, and James the brother of John, whom Herod “killed with a sword,” and the rest of the band of the holy apostles, if they had not had the promise from the Lord that they would sit, not now, but in the new age, on twelve thrones, which are clearly different from those mentioned here. For this is what the Lord said to them in the gospel according to Matthew: “Truly I say to you, that you who have followed me, in the new age when the Son of” God “shall sit on his glorious throne, you too will sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” 

The white garments are a sign of their purity in their lifetime; the crowns are the sign of their conquest of their passions and spiritual enemies; 

the issuance of lightning and sounds of thunder from the throne symbolizes once again the awesomeness of God. Delight in the divine beauty is found not in some enjoyment of merriment and pleasure, but in awe and wonder. Because he knew this the prophet said, “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice in him with trembling.” 

He says, Seven torches of fire, burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God: seven is the number of the archangels, says Clement in the sixth book of his Stromateis, perhaps under the influence of this text. He says that these seven spirits are like torches of fire. For it is said about angels somewhere, “He who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire,” the divine Scriptures meaning these whom we are now discussing. 

He says, And before the throne there is a sea of glass, like crystal: the vision of the sea is the multitude; and the glass and the crystal denote the purity and the freedom from every defilement of the holy spirits around God, who are as the sea in number; “for a thousand thousand stood before him,” says Daniel, “and ten thousand times ten thousand waited upon him”; and although there are so many, all of them are pure, resembling glass and crystal.
