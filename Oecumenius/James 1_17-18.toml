Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights, with whom there is no change or shadow due to change. In His destined will, He has begotten us by the Word of Truth, that we should be a kind of first fruits of His creatures.
"is from above, from the Father of lights." Since those things that come from us do not have perfection, but rather much imperfection, nor do they illuminate the soul, think what perfection they will have who acquire it after a joyful journey through life, and with much effort hardly cleanse the ugliness contracted from birth, and then reach divine splendor.
"With whom there is no change." For He Himself cries out through the prophet: "I am and I do not change." (Mal. 3:6) But what James says: "shadow due to change," that is, not even doubt or any shadow of doubt.
"In His destined will." He said destined will, silencing those who foolishly assert that the world was produced by chance. For since James said above: with whom there is no change, and from this he shows that God is unchanging, he adds:
“In His destined will, He has begotten us.” For if we are born, it is clear that we are also changed. For how could that which proceeds from non-being to being through change be unchangeable? Then, because James said: He has begotten us, lest anyone suspect that He has begotten the Son in the same way as us, and that He was born as a Son together with us, he adds:
“By the Word of Truth.” For all things, according to blessed John, were made through the Son. (John 1:3) Therefore, if progress has happened to us through the Word of Truth, who have our being from the Word, we are not begotten together with him from whom we were made.
"we should be a kind of first fruits." That is, the first and most honored. But κτίσματα means the visible creature itself.
