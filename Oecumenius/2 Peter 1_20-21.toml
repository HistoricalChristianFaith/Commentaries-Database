Knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
Then, in explaining, Peter adds why his words were not interpreted as private or personal: at the same time, he also distinguishes true prophecy from demonic and false prophecies, which are found to operate in heretics, and says: "that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation." That is, indeed, the prophets receive prophecy from God, but not as they wish, but as the divine Spirit works in them moving them: and they certainly knew and understood the prophetic message sent to them, yet they did not make the interpretation themselves. That the prophets, moved by the divine Spirit, knew how the Spirit was sent to them from God is evident from the fact that they spoke voluntarily and said what they wished, while they remained silent on what they did not want to say; just as the prophet Jonah, refusing to preach in Nineveh (Jonah 1:3), and Balaam (Num. 22:13), commanded to speak what was suggested to him. However, the false prophets or the oracles of the Greeks did not have this: for they did not know while they were being agitated, but, having become mad with frenzy, they were unaware of what was happening to them, as if they were drunk.
Therefore, the holy prophets, I say the ancients, although they understood, did not, however, have to interpret what they predicted, but they served these things to others, namely to us. Likewise, so that the Lord's coming might remain hidden, and that traps might not be prepared for Him by the wicked. Indeed, even if the power of God could escape from assaults, it is likely that through extraordinary means of escape, the incarnation would appear as if it were a miraculous event. And that this is true is evident from the prophets who were in the New Testament, who also interpreted themselves while prophesying, although not in all cases, as the blessed Paul says in his earlier letter to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 14:21); for there was no such suspicion in the New Testament. Furthermore, it is also clear that the prophets did not prophecy outside of themselves.
When they prophesied with one spirit, both those in the Old Testament and those in the New, Paul says: "If, however, something is revealed to another sitting there, let the first be silent." (1 Cor. 14:30) From this, it is evident that the prophets, remaining in their natural consistency, prophesied spontaneously and intelligently. Therefore, when another rises to whom inspiration has been given, the one who was speaking first is commanded to be silent; which could not be found among mad prophets. For how will he be silent who does not even know what he is doing? Paul himself says that the energy of the Holy Spirit is in the prophets, speaking thus: "To one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of prophecy." (1 Cor. 12:8)
"Knowing this first of all," etc. The prophets knew those things which were inspired in them by the prophetic spirit, and about which, however, they did not know exactly how each would be fulfilled. Therefore, understanding, they desired to see the outcome of these things: as the Lord also says.
