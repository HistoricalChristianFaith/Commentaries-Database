For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was brought to him by the majestic glory: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." We ourselves heard this very voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain. And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day approaches and the morning star rises in your hearts. Knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
When Peter had said that they should diligently attend to themselves, and that those things which had been announced to them were indeed so, and he had explained this at length, frequently: although he knew and they had heard in various ways, he now adds their confirmation and says: I do not apply a vain diligence to these matters, but since I know the truth of them to be certain and undoubted, I dwell on them. And what is this?
We made known to you the power and coming of our Lord, not by human wisdom with adorned speeches, as if deceiving your hearing with tricks, as the Greeks and heretics do: indeed, the Greeks using elaborate speech and deception; the heretics, however, with fabricated words: just as the Valentinians fleeing into profound depths and silence9. For it is likely that they were beginning to arise. Therefore, there is nothing of this kind to be found in us, but we have delivered to you the teaching in a simple and humble manner: which Paul also says to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 2:1): and those things which we have from the sight of our own eyes, we who ascended with him to the holy mountain. Peter says, however, that the Lord showed them on the holy mountain the glory of the Only Begotten (Matt. 17:1), and the voice that they heard from the Father brought down from heaven concerning the Lord. Moreover, since we have known through the things themselves and experience what was proclaimed by the prophets, he says, we judge their prophecy to be more sure through these things: for the things themselves have followed the sayings and oracles.
Therefore, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention, whether those that were foretold by the prophets: although they were then spoken obscurely by them, and as to a lamp shining in a dark place. For such is the filthy place, scorched by the heat of the sun and deprived of the air that informs it with moisture. Hence, it is necessary that the air which serves the solar ray, when it is in danger of losing its property, should render itself an illegitimate servant to the sun, and the ray, as if carried by an illegitimate vehicle, should present a darkened splendor of itself. However, by attending to those things which were thus obscurely spoken by the prophets, you will not be deceived in your hope, for things, Peter says, will come to pass in their own time: which he also aptly called day, remaining very skillfully in the figure of speech.
For Peter said, "as to a lamp shining in a dark or gloomy place, which is also night." However, day succeeds every night. Therefore, as day approaches (I speak of the presence of things), you will have the Morning Star rising in your hearts: that is, the knowledge of Christ, or his presence and coming foretold by the prophets, illuminating your hearts like true light.
Then, in explaining, Peter adds why his words were not interpreted as private or personal: at the same time, he also distinguishes true prophecy from demonic and false prophecies, which are found to operate in heretics, and says: "that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation." That is, indeed, the prophets receive prophecy from God, but not as they wish, but as the divine Spirit works in them moving them: and they certainly knew and understood the prophetic message sent to them, yet they did not make the interpretation themselves. That the prophets, moved by the divine Spirit, knew how the Spirit was sent to them from God is evident from the fact that they spoke voluntarily and said what they wished, while they remained silent on what they did not want to say; just as the prophet Jonah, refusing to preach in Nineveh (Jonah 1:3), and Balaam (Num. 22:13), commanded to speak what was suggested to him. However, the false prophets or the oracles of the Greeks did not have this: for they did not know while they were being agitated, but, having become mad with frenzy, they were unaware of what was happening to them, as if they were drunk.
Therefore, the holy prophets, I say the ancients, although they understood, did not, however, have to interpret what they predicted, but they served these things to others, namely to us. Likewise, so that the Lord's coming might remain hidden, and that traps might not be prepared for Him by the wicked. Indeed, even if the power of God could escape from assaults, it is likely that through extraordinary means of escape, the incarnation would appear as if it were a miraculous event. And that this is true is evident from the prophets who were in the New Testament, who also interpreted themselves while prophesying, although not in all cases, as the blessed Paul says in his earlier letter to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 14:21); for there was no such suspicion in the New Testament. Furthermore, it is also clear that the prophets did not prophecy outside of themselves.
When they prophesied with one spirit, both those in the Old Testament and those in the New, Paul says: "If, however, something is revealed to another sitting there, let the first be silent." (1 Cor. 14:30) From this, it is evident that the prophets, remaining in their natural consistency, prophesied spontaneously and intelligently. Therefore, when another rises to whom inspiration has been given, the one who was speaking first is commanded to be silent; which could not be found among mad prophets. For how will he be silent who does not even know what he is doing? Paul himself says that the energy of the Holy Spirit is in the prophets, speaking thus: "To one is given the word of wisdom, to another the word of prophecy." (1 Cor. 12:8)
Furthermore, here through the things that are now proposed. "For he received from God the Father." This participle λαδὼν is either placed in the position of the indicative verb ἔλαδεν, that is, he received: since according to the consequence of the participle, the discourse does not subsequently correspond. Or if this is not pleasing, but someone wishes to take λαδὼν as a proper participle, the discourse will necessarily fall into disorder: if, however, the participle is taken in place of the indicative verb, it will be consistent with what is added, for example: For he received glory from God the Father: and from this we have more firmly whatever has been announced about this by the prophets before: not that any prophecy was delivered from the voice of the Father from on high, but that we have been confirmed by the heavenly voice of the Father which testified that he is the Son, so that all the prophecy of the prophets undoubtedly carries testimony from the Father.
"Here is my beloved Son." (Matt. 3:17) Three times the Father testified to the Son: at baptism, at the passion when He said, "And I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again" (Jn. 12:28); and on the holy mountain.
"Knowing this first of all," etc. The prophets knew those things which were inspired in them by the prophetic spirit, and about which, however, they did not know exactly how each would be fulfilled. Therefore, understanding, they desired to see the outcome of these things: as the Lord also says.
