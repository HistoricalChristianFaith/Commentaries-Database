In this cause, the Gospel has also been preached to the dead: that they may be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.
The order is as follows: Those who slander you will give an account to him who judges the living and the dead (1 Peter 4:5): for the dead are also judged; this is evident from the Lord's coming to Hades. For when he went there, namely through his death on the cross, he preached, just as he did to those who were living on earth. However, he preached not by word, but by deed. And just as he came into the world to those who were ready to recognize him, for justification, but to those who wished to remain ignorant, for condemnation: so also to those who were in Hades. For he came to judgment for those who lived according to the flesh in a human manner. But for those who lived according to the spirit, that is, according to a spiritual and honorable life, he came for glory and salvation. Therefore, he can rightly be called “the judge of both the living and the dead” (1 Peter 4:5).
So they say. Indeed, the ancient Fathers interpreted this, "In this cause, the Gospel has also been preached to the dead," as a severed part, having no concern for continuity with the preceding, nor for the fact that it ought to be referred to what was said as a cause. For it must have a cause in its statement: but as we said, they interpreted it as an intersection in this way. For the sacred Scripture has said to call the dead in two ways: either those who are dead in sins, who can never see life; or those who have become conformed to the death of Christ, and are indeed dead to the world, that is, to worldly desires, but live only to Christ, as Paul also says: "And the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God." (Gal. 2:20) Therefore, they say that those who are thus dead to Christ condemn themselves in the flesh because of their negligent and slothful previous life. This, however, is to live by the spirit or life according to Christ: for the former condemnation makes them more eager regarding the present and what is at hand. And indeed, they are in this way. And although someone might say that these things are rightly so. Nevertheless, what has been said does not entirely hold. However, since it had been said above about those who were in Hades, to whom it was also preached, it is fitting to refer the present discourse to that, which is introduced by reason, and not only to consider, as has now been said. Consequently, we say that because he had said immediately before, "Who is ready to judge the living and the dead" (1 Peter 4:5): an exception could be raised against these: "And where are the living or where are the dead judged?" He adds faith to the discourse, from what he had said before, that it was also preached to those spirits who were in prison (1 Peter 3:19): and this preaching was made to them for judgment or for condemnation: indeed to those who were conscious of good life, immediately holding to the kindness of him who had appeared there; but to the wicked, filled with shame, and waiting for their own condemnation. Therefore, it confirms that the Lord is the judge of the dead. As for the living, when He came into the world according to mortal life, men had His presence as a condemnation, since the good indeed ran to Him and were instructed, while the wicked rejected Him and willingly abominated the truth: this was indeed their condemnation. Therefore, the Lord also says, "I came into the world for judgment," (Jn. 9:39) that is, for condemnation. Thus, the Lord is the “judge of both the living and the dead”: and the rendering of causes will be based on the entire discourse and not on a part.
Therefore, what is said, that they may be judged in the flesh, should be understood as when the Lord approached those who were in Hades, those who had lived carnally in the world were condemned: while those who lived spiritually were either brought to life together with the Lord (for many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised Matt. 27:52), or through good hope. Furthermore, it is said that they will be judged and live, taking time for time, namely the future for the past, which is frequent in sacred Scripture. "The end of all things is at hand," (1 Peter 4:7) he says, that is, for those who are justified in life and for those who are in Hades. For in the second coming, what is reserved for each will be fulfilled. But if anyone despises the preaching of the Lord in Hades, saying that nothing can benefit the dead, because according to the prophet David, no one confesses in Hades (Ps. 6:6); he understands the preaching in Hades totally and considers confession not as praise of God but as a manifestation: not knowing what is said: "The dead shall not praise you, O Lord” (Ps. 113:17); and it is said: “In Hades, who shall confess to you?' (Ps.4:6) Thus, it should be understood that confession is an act of thanksgiving to God when someone is freed from grave troubles. Therefore, since all things that are dealt with in this present life, where they are completed, come to an end. For the dead, all things are idle: rightly, since no one works anything for whom they would be freed to give thanks, it is said: "In Hades, who shall confess to you?" (Ps. 4:6)
