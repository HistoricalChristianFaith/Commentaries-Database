“The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet,” purple because of her sovereignty and scarlet because she had shed the blood of many saints. She was “bedecked with gold and a precious stone and pearls.” The passage appropriately describes her as a queen in royal garb. “She held in her hand a golden cup full of abominations.” It was gold because of the rank of her sovereignty but yet full of idolatries and defilements by which she was nourished and by which she offered a libation to her own demons. “And the impurities of the fornication of the earth,” it says. It ascribes to her the idolatries also of other nations, since she was the primary cause of their own evils and of the madness of their idolatry.
