“Fallen is Babylon,” it says. He openly announces the sentence of condemnation that God has rendered against it. He has decreed, it says, that it should suffer these things. “It has become a dwelling place of demons.” For as those who hate humankind and are desirous of blood, these wicked demons search out places in which the blood of people killed in warfare or in some other manner has been shed, and as though rejoicing at what has happened, they make their abode in such places. Therefore, since most will be killed in the city, as we have said, it finally becomes the “dwelling place of demons and a haunt of every foul spirit,” since the place safeguards the hedonistic lifestyle of the demons in it. “And a haunt of every foul bird and every unclean beast,” it says. For such animals flee the abode of people and take possession of abandoned places, keeping them free from those who intend them harm and hunt wild animals. The prophet Isaiah also said something like this concerning Babylon: “And sirens will rest there, and demons will dance there, and satyrs will dwell there, and hedgehogs will make their nests in their houses.”
