"Babylon," he says, "has fallen." He proclaims against her the sentence of God. He says that she is destined to suffer these things, and she became a dwelling-place of demons. For the demons hate mankind and are bloodthirsty; wherever they find places where the blood of men has been shed, whether in wars or by other deaths, they take pleasure in the occurrence and make their abodes there. And since most shall be destroyed in the city, as he said earlier, the place becomes from now a dwelling of demons and a prison of every unclean spirit and every unclean beast; for such creatures flee from company with men, and, occupying the wildernesses, preserve themselves from those who would ambush them and from the hunt of those who pursue. Such things, Isaiah the prophet likewise says concerning Babylon. He says also: "There will the sirens rest and there the demons dance; and there the one-horned centaurs will dwell and they will breed those scaly creatures in their houses." (Isa. 13:21-22)
