Since the vision outlined for the Evangelist the entire economy of the Lord’s incarnation—his birth, the temptation, his teachings, the beatings, also the cross and resurrection, the second coming and the reward of both the holy and the sinners—it had left unmentioned any information about the forerunners of his second coming. Now, as though by a sharp U-turn, [the vision] teaches him about them. When Malachi said, “Behold, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes, who will turn the heart of a father to the son and the heart of a man to his neighbor, lest I come to trample the land utterly,” the holy Scripture with great clarity foretold that Elijah the Tishbite will come. And in Matthew, the Lord spoke of the Baptist: “And if you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah who is to come.” Concerning other forerunners we have heard nothing with clarity except that Genesis said concerning Enoch that “having pleased God, he was taken,” and the wise apostle said concerning him, “By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him.” An old, traditional saying is prevalent in the church, that with Elijah the Tishbite also Enoch will come as a forerunner of the second coming of Christ and at the coming of the antichrist. This passage says that they come and proclaim beforehand that the signs performed by [the antichrist] are deceptive and that it is not necessary to believe the sinful one. Using either a figurative number or a literal description of what will be, the vision now reports of these [forerunners] that they will prophesy so many days. They will prophesy “clothed in sackcloth,” for they will lament over the disobedience of those who live at that time.
