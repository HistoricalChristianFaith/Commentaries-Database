Since everything concerning the Lord's incarnation and administration was revealed to the evangelist in the vision, namely, the birth, the temptation, the teachings, the taunts against Him, as well as the cross, the resurrection, the second coming, and in addition the retributions for both the saints and sinners; what pertains to the forerunners of His second coming was omitted. Now, however, these matters are being taught again, as if by way of correction, that Elijah the Tishbite will indeed come, as the divine Scripture clearly foretells. Malachi states, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord, who will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the hearts of the children to their fathers, lest I come and strike the earth with a curse." (Mal. 4:4-5) Furthermore, the Lord, speaking to Matthew concerning John the Baptist, says, "If you are willing to accept it, this is Elijah who is to come." (Matt. 11:14)

Regarding another forerunner, we have heard nothing clearly anywhere, except that concerning Enoch, Genesis states that "he pleased God and was taken away." (Gen. 5:22) The wise Apostle, speaking of him, affirms "by faith, Enoch was taken away so that he would not see death, and he was not found because God had taken him." (Heb. 11:5)

An ancient tradition persists in the Church: after Elijah the Tishbite, Enoch will also come, preceding the second coming of Christ and proclaiming the imminent appearance of the Antichrist. It is said that they will come first and serve as forerunners, testifying in advance that the signs performed by the Antichrist are deceptive and that one should not believe the deceiver.

Regarding these matters, the vision now speaks: that they will prophecy for a certain number of days or reveal some secret number or the entirety of what is to come. It is said that they will do this while clothed in sackcloth. For they will mourn over the disobedience of the people at that time.
