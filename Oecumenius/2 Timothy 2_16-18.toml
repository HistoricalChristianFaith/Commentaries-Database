Avoid profane and empty chatter; for they will increase in ungodliness, and their message will spread like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are among them, who have strayed concerning the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened; and they overturn the faith of some.

Avoid profane and empty chatter. If anything new in the preaching has been introduced from more recent empty chatter, it is altogether wicked and profane. As for that, either remove it or stand firmly to stop and prevent it altogether.

for they will increase in ungodliness. For if anything spurious is introduced, Paul says, it always leads to absurdity. And he receives a greater offering every day.

like gangrene. Gangrene is a infected ulcer, consuming the place, causing rotting; some say it is a creeping ulcer, or erysipelas.

— [THEODORET] saying that the resurrection. They called the succession of procreation of children to be cursed resurrection: and they enticed some to depart from apostolic teaching. [end of the excerpt from Theodoret PG 82.685A] —

saying that the resurrection has already happened. Rightly said above, for ungodliness will increase even more. For see how many evil things arise from saying that the resurrection has already happened. We would be deprived of the presence of Christ, what could be more grievous? There is no remedy, nor punishment. Christ, who promised these things, lies. And many similar things, such as, "If there is no resurrection, then Christ has not been raised," (1 Cor. 15:14) nor does a judge sit over the living and the dead. (Acts 10:42)

and they overturn the faith of some. Of those who are simpler and weaker.
