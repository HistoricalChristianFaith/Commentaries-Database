And not only, he says, it is clear from this that the priesthood and the covenant have been changed from that of another tribe, and not from Levi, that the risen priest is from, but also it is evident from this more abundantly. Of which? From that according to the order of Melchizedek, and not according to the former priest Aaron, Christ became a priest.
"if according to the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest." The "if," instead of "that," you will understand, or rather since; as if he said; And from this it is evident both the change and the transfer of the old covenant. Then according to the likeness. Since, he says, according to the likeness of Melchizedek there arises another priest, and not according to the likeness of Aaron.
"who has not become a priest according to the law of a fleshly commandment." For Christ has become a high priest, not according to the law of a commandment concerning flesh, but according to the power of an everlasting life. What is according to the law of a fleshly commandment? That the law had commandments concerning the flesh, such as circumcision, rest, this one to eat, and that one not to eat. Which was of the flesh and did not come to the purification of the soul, therefore he says, a priest according to the law of a fleshly commandments. For he knew the Levites as priests. But he says, Christ has become a priest, both by his own power and that of the Father, and by eternal life.
"For it is testified." And that, he says, Christ has not become a priest according to the law of a fleshly commandment. The testimony indicates the Father; for the Father testifies to him, saying, a priest according to the order of Melchizedek. For if he says, according to the law he was made, he ought to have been made according to the order of Aaron.But now, since it is written according to the order of Melchizedek, it is evident that he is not made according to the law, but according to a different, more divine manner.
