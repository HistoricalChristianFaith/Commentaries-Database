I saw, he says, a throne, and there was upon it God who is spirit, having the appearance of jasper and carnelian. God is not like these things—of course not!—nor is he who is invisible, incorporeal and without form like in any way to the body of any perceptible being. Even the seraphim hide their faces with their wings when they are shown his invisible nature. Similarly, when God was speaking with Moses, he said, “No one will look upon my face and live.” And the Evangelist himself, as though contradicting [what he says here], says, “No one has ever seen God.” Therefore, since God is similar to nothing in appearance, the vision of him in the Revelation is depicted on the basis of his activities. For the jasper is a green precious stone, something like an emerald and similar to the rust of a shield, from which it receives its name. The carnelian is another precious jewel and is fiery bright and blood red. And so, the jasper depicts the life-bearing and life-providing nature of God, since all food of humankind and of four-footed animals and of birds and of creeping creatures has its beginning and likewise its effective cause in vegetation. For the prophet says, “Who makes the grass to grow for cattle and plants for the service of men, to bring forth bread from the earth. And wine makes glad the heart of man, to make his face cheerful with oil.” And again at the creation of the world, God said, “Let the earth bring forth vegetation, bearing seed according to its kind.” And so, while the jasper depicts such things concerning God, the carnelian depicts the fearsomeness of God, for the holy Moses said, “Your God is a devouring fire.” And the prophet also said, “You are terrible, who will stand before your face,” and the wise apostle wrote in agreement, “It is fearful to fall into the hands of the living God.” Since the pure goodness of God is incompatible with those who love to sin and who are scornful, not moving them to repentance but giving them a sense of security for further transgression, with good reason does God desire his severity depicted along with his goodness and beneficence.… However, the carnelian is not the first jewel mentioned to describe God. Rather, the jasper is the first. For God’s nature is in itself good and beneficent and gentle. And he wishes to be our Father rather than our Lord. But, if it is proper to speak in this way, we force him to become fearsome and punishing. And therefore, often he abandons that which is according to his nature, namely, gentleness, and assumes that which is contrary to his nature, namely, severity.
