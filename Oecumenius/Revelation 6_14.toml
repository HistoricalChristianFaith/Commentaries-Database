The sky is described as departed like a scroll being rolled up. Through the sky, the heavenly powers of the angels are mentioned, who themselves were disturbed, unable to bear the insult to their master, both here and there. The sky is said to be torn apart like a scroll being unrolled and shaken.

It is also said that every mountain and island moved from their places. Mountains and islands are called the ranks [τάγματα] of the high-minded spirits, according to what is written about them; "and mountains can be moved within the hearts of the seas." (Ps. 45:3) He also says that islands themselves rise up and are lifted by the vain vanity of their intellect in the unstable and salty distractions of this life. (see Isa. 23:2-6.)
