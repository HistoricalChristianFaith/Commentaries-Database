Then, lest those who heard from Christ be believed to lie, and say one thing for another: He says not so. For God Himself bears witness to the truth along with them through signs and wonders, and various powers which He works for them.
"and various miracles." Paul said "various" to indicate the abundance of the gifts; for never were so many and so diverse signs produced. And since magicians also perform many things, he said "miracles"; for those are not powers but weakness and illusion and empty matters.
“by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed.” And through the gifts and the coming of the Holy Spirit, those things are made which are of divine testimony. It is said, however, concerning distributions, that as spiritual grace is distributed, it is according to each one's measure and according to the proportion of faith, and as it is expedient for each. (1 Cor. 12:6)
"according to His own will.” Namely, of the Paraclete. Dividing, Paul says, to each as He wishes.
“For it was not to angels that He subjected the world.” This is a consequence of the comparison with the angels that was previously stated. For it was necessary for the chief creature, namely the angelic one, by consulting Christ according to the flesh, to show Him to be greater as the Lord.
He speaks of the future world when He says the world to come.
“of which we are speaking.” That is, concerning which we said above that, When he brings in the firstborn into the world. Therefore let not your mind be led astray seeking another world. But some understood a future world, the world that will be, concerning which, he says, the whole discourse is to us. For then Christ himself will sit as judge of that world; and the angels, as ministers and servants, will stand by.
"But there is a certain one who testified somewhere, saying." Speaking to those who knew the Scriptures, Paul does not mention the names of those who say: "What is man?"

For this reason, he now cites it. What is man that you are mindful of him? Since it seemed to oppose his purpose, he indeed shows that Christ is greater than the angels, yet he says that he was made a little lower than the angels. He presents this in order to resolve the objection that seems to arise, and in resolving it, he says that he was made lower because of the passion of death. "For we saw him and he had neither form nor beauty." (Isa. 53:2)
Meanwhile, it is granted that this was also said about the Lord, since he served them as well, to comfort them, as it is said: "putting everything in subjection under his feet."

For you have not only brought him into being, but also granted him to be well, and you will continue to be mindful, and you will visit him when he is in a bad state.
"You made him a little lower than the angels.” Here he recalls the declaration after the transgression. For the mortal is made lower than the angels.

This applies both to common humanity and especially to Christ in the flesh.
“At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.” For he said: “He left nothing outside of his control,” but they suffered badly and were seized by the Jews who remained in disbelief, so that they would not hesitate about what was said, Paul says: “Do not be troubled. For not yet has all things been subjected to him, not yet has the preaching been scattered, not yet has the proclaimed king openly received power."
