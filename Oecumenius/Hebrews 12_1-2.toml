He did not say that danger is looming over us or that we are being raised above, but, what is greater, that we are inspired.
"A cloud of witnesses." Indeed, the memory of the witnesses or martyrs stirs them to similar zeal for struggles. He called them a cloud, either from the metaphor of those who are consumed by heat and enter a refreshing cloud to receive comfort. For the memory of the martyrs comforts those who have been dissolved by the heat of temptations: or because they distribute spiritual dew to us, interceding with God on our behalf.
"laying aside every burden." Deposited with the gravity of worldly matters, and with all negligence and idleness at once.
"the sin which clings so closely." Either because it easily clings to us or because it can easily undergo fall and rejection; therefore it is said.
"run with endurance." For no one casts off the weight of worldly matters except through endurance. Furthermore, he mentions endurance as a thing most suitable for them. Consider indeed that he did not say, "Let us fight with fists," or "Let us battle," but rather, "run with endurance the race." For this present life is a race: a race, I say, against sins and desires, or against those who oppose us spiritually. Therefore, let us run in this race and act with courage.
"looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith.” Then it comes to the very head of encouragement and comfort, namely Christ, and says: If we want to have patience and run rightly, let us look to Christ, and let us learn to run rightly and endure, calling Him the leader and perfecter, showing that He was the cause for our belief and will set the limit of faith, so that we may have it firm and unshakeable.
“Who for the joy set before Him.”He said, It would have been acceptable to live in this world with joy and glory: for he says, “I have the power to lay down my life and to take it up again;” (Jn. 10:18) but he did not want to, rather he willingly endured the cross.
“endured the cross.” For it was a disgraceful and accursed death inflicted by the cross.If therefore we look upon this, we too will endure, just as he endured.

Or to accept instead of the joy set before him, as Gregory says; to whom, he says, being able to remain in his own glory and divinity, he not only emptied himself to the form of a servant, but also endured the cross, despising its shame. Therefore, he says, he is able to also repay you for the sufferings endured on his account; for he was not only crucified, but also sits at the right hand of God, presenting the equality of the right hand and the throne. "and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God."

Or what is said, For the joy set before him, understand it as Gregory says. To whom, he says, when it was free for him to remain in his own glory and divinity, he not only emptied himself to the form of a servant, but also endured the cross, disregarding the shame.
"and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God." Therefore, he is worthy to reward you for the afflictions you suffer for him. For he was not only crucified, but also sits at the right hand of God. The right hand and the throne signify equality of honor.
