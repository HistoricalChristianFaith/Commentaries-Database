After the hour of Babylon's destruction; and it is clear who Babylon is understood to be, and this is further shown to the evangelist, the fall of the Antichrist and of the arch-evil Dragon, and into what relentless punishment at the time of the end and of retribution, and the destruction of the kings who will arise against the servants of Christ at that time, and see what he says.

I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness. The Lord alone I behold fighting alongside and leading in battle the saints and warring against the adversaries.

Therefore the vision also bestows upon him a military form, handing him a horse and a sword and the leadership of armies. And behold, it says a white horse on which the Lord rode, signifying by the riddle that Christ rests not with others but with the pure and with those unspotted by the filth of sin. Therefore concerning the vessel of Paul's calling it is said by the Lord, "to bear my name before the nations and the kings of the sons of Israel." (Acts 9:15) Observe then that Christ rests and rides upon those who are according to Paul.

And he who sits upon him, that is, upon the horse, is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and wages war. Faithful is the true one according to the apostle who speaks concerning him; "he remains faithful; he cannot deny himself." (2 Tim. 2:13)

Therefore Faithful and True; for of the same one it has been said, two names applied to one matter. And because he judges righteously and wars against the sensible enemies on behalf of his servants, the prophet who speaks is witness, "Give to the king your judgment, and to the son of the king your righteousness," (Ps. 72:1) that is, to Christ; for the Christ according to the flesh is the son of Solomon, to whom the Psalm is then assigned, going on "to judge your people in righteousness and your poor with judgment." (Ps. 72:2)

That the same one also wages war, he shows that he arms him militarily by saying: "tighten your sword upon your thigh, mighty one, for your beauty and your splendor, and be strong, and show kindness and reign"; then adding "your sharpened arrows, mighty one: peoples will fall under you." (Ps. 45:3-5)
