The Evangelist now receives the revelation of the fall of the antichrist and of the arch-evil dragon. He sees moreover the punishment they will receive at the time of the end and their recompense, as well as the fall of those kings who at that time will oppose the servants of Christ. And see what it says: “I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse,” and the rider is faithful and true and just. He sees the Lord as he is about to join the battle and fight for the saints and make war against his adversaries. For this reason the vision depicts him in the form of a general, giving him a horse and a sword and the leadership of armies. “And, behold, a white horse” upon which the Lord was riding. By this the vision reveals that Christ depends upon no others than those who are pure and are not tainted by any stain of sin. For this reason, the Lord also said of that “chosen instrument,” namely, Paul, that he would “carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.” You see, therefore, that Christ depends upon and rides on such persons as Paul. “He who sat upon it,” that is, upon the horse, “is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.” He who is true is also faithful, as the apostle said concerning him: “He remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself,” and so he is the “Faithful” and “True.” And about him two assertions are made which address the same matter. The prophet was witness that he judges righteously and that he makes war on behalf of his servants against their visible enemies: “O God, give your judgment to the king, and your righteousness to the king’s son,” that is, to Christ—for the son of Solomon was Christ according to the flesh, to whom the psalmist was referring—and then it continues, “that he might judge your people with righteousness and your poor with judgment.” That he also makes war [the psalmist] shows when he speaks of him arming himself as a soldier: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, in your comeliness and in your beauty, and bend [your bow] and prosper and reign.” Then he adds, “Your weapons are sharpened, O mighty one, the nations shall fall under you.”
