The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost. But for that very reason I was shown mercy, so that in me, the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his unlimited patience as an example to those who would believe in him and receive eternal life. To the King of the ages, immortal, invisible, the only wise God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.

The saying is trustworthy, that is, the spoken word is true. "You will know from me," Paul says. "of whom I am the foremost." And yet elsewhere he says, "According to the righteousness which is in the law made blameless." (Philip. 3:6)

How then does Paul call himself sinful and the foremost of sinners? And we say that righteousness from the law, when compared with that from faith, is not only not righteousness, but also the first sin. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Rom. 3:23) In this comparison, it has also been used elsewhere, where it says: "For even that which has been glorified has not been glorified in this part, because of the surpassing glory." (2 Cor. 3:10)

But for that very reason I was shown mercy. See what humble thing Paul said. He says, "Since I, the most sinful of all, have been saved, there is no longer need to doubt about salvation." For he wants to show that he was not saved as one worthy of salvation, but in order not to cause others to despair of their salvation.

unlimited patience. Oh, the humility of Paul! For every kind of evil, he says, I was in need of unlimited patience, not a part of it, as those who have sinned only in part.

as an example. For encouragement, for demonstration.

to receive eternal life. For the faith that is in Christ is for eternal life.

To the King of the ages. These things concerning the holy accepted Trinity. For such titles are common to the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. For these are found elsewhere concerning the Son, elsewhere concerning the Spirit, but now concerning the Father.

to the only wise God. Having reasoned about Christ's love, Paul also remembers the Father and sends up praise to himself, so that no one might think the Father is a sharer in the love toward us. For on account of the love toward us, the holy Trinity must be glorified, since the love is common.

Instruction concerning faithful and honorable service, which is without risk.
