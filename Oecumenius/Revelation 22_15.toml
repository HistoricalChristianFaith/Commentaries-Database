Outside are the dogs, he says. It is customary in the divine writing to call dogs those who associate with others because of their shamelessness and uncleanness. For Moses also says in Deuteronomy, the law of the advocator: "You shall not bring the hire of a prostitute or the wages of a dog into the house of the Lord your God for any vow of yours." (Deut. 23:18) And since such persons are like dogs in their shamelessness, one of the philosophers outside also testifies, saying likewise: "Flee from every murder and the beds of a woman's adultery;" and oaths of the blessed and shameless couches of youths. Therefore the dogs are outside the holy city and the conduct with the righteous, these and those. For what fellowship have they with the righteous of God?

And everyone who loves and practices falsehood, he says will be outside. Falsehood is everything contrary to nature; for since virtue is according to nature, because the Maker originally implanted in our nature the seed of virtue, wickedness is contrary to nature. Just as in bodies health is according to nature and disease contrary to nature, and sight and hearing are according to nature while blindness and deafness are contrary to nature, so in souls virtue is according to nature and wickedness contrary to nature; for health is parallel to virtue, and disease to wickedness. And in this respect wickedness is falsehood, because it often pretends to be virtue; for boldness is fashioned to appear as courage, wickedness as prudence, sloth as temperance, and baseness as justice. For all these are vices assuming the guise of virtue, and so he casts out of the divine precincts those who practice the falsehood of wickedness.
