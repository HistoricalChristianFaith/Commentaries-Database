“Outside are the dogs,” it says. It is customary in the holy Scriptures to call homosexuals “dogs” because they are shameless and impure. In Deuteronomy the law of the holy teacher Moses says, “You shall not bring the hire of a harlot or the wages of a dog into the house of the Lord your God in payment for any vow,” since indeed such persons are similar to dogs because of their shamelessness. Even a wise man outside [the church] gives witness to the same view, saying, “Flee every murder and adulterous couch of a woman, and also the oaths of the rich and shameless beds of boys.” Therefore, such dogs are outside the holy city and apart from the life with the righteous. For what do they have in common with the righteous of God? “And everyone who loves and practices falsehood” will be outside, it says. Everything against nature is false. Virtue is according to nature, since from the beginning the Creator has implanted in our makeup the seed of virtue, and so vice is against nature. For just as health is natural to our bodies and sickness is unnatural, and just as seeing and hearing are natural while blindness and deafness are unnatural, so also virtue in our souls is natural and evil is unnatural. Health is, then, analogous to virtue, and vice analogous to sickness. In a corresponding way, falsehood is evil, for it often falsely presents itself as virtue. Temerity masquerades as courage, dishonorable conduct as prudence, sloth as wisdom, and false modesty as righteousness. All of these things are evils, cloaking themselves with a mask of virtue, to those who fall in with them, and therefore he casts outside the divine walls those who pursue such lying deceit.
