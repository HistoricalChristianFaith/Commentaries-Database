Here all that happened to the Jews in the war against the Romans is clearly shown to the evangelist. These things happened to them because of the cross and their madness against the Lord. 

The four angels controlling the four corners of the land of the Jews were on guard lest any of the Jews deserving of death should escape, perhaps by making them too afraid to run away or by putting some difficulties in their way or causing an excessive longing for their country or their wives and those dearest to them. These are indicated figuratively by their control of the four corners of Judaea. 

The control of the four winds, that they should not blow on earth or sea or against any tree, indicates that the Jews found no relief in the war, nor any consolation for their disasters, whether they were fighting on foot on land, or fighting on ships at sea—for they fought many naval battles according to Josephus—or indeed whether they were busy with farming and the care of crops. Utter calamity overtook them all: their cities were being destroyed by fire, their land was being ravaged, and their crops were being cut down. All this Josephus related accurately in his account of the destruction of Jerusalem. 

And I saw an angel ascend from the rising of the sun, with a seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been charged to harm the earth and the sea, saying, “Do no harm until the servants of our God have been sealed.” The coming of the divine angel from the rising of the sun, and not from the sunset and the evening, symbolizes the gospel and the promise of good things. The present seal was foreseen by the prophet, too, in the Spirit when he said, “The light of your face, Lord, has been marked upon us.” 

He correctly commands that for the time being nobody should be harmed, until those of the Jews worthy of being saved had been sealed, lest the righteous suffer unintentionally with the sinners. 

He says that they sealed a hundred and forty-four thousand. The number of Jews who believed in Christ were many more than this, who thereby benefited by their deliverance from the general universal destruction. So those who spoke to Paul when he was in Jerusalem attested, “You see, brother, how many myriads there are of believing Jews.” 

It was reasonable that not only the believers should escape, but also those who ignorantly and through deception cooperated in crucifying the Lord, of whom he said, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” Even though Cyril in the thirteenth book Against Julian says that this prayer of the Lord is not found in the gospels, at any rate we use it. It was not only these [who should escape], but also those who were not present at that time, or who were not living in Jerusalem, and therefore had no part in the unholy council of the accursed high priests concerned with the crucifixion, or though they were actually present had certainly not acquired any taint of guilt. Even though [the Lord] himself blessed the whole earth under heaven, it turned out contrary to the wishes of those who hated God and of the council of the criminals. It is likely that all these Jews [who escaped] were later sealed in the faith of Christ. For the angel would not otherwise have called them the servants of God. 

But though these were saved, the rest were in their wickedness utterly destroyed by flight and desertion to the Romans. “They became a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men,” though in a different sense from that which Paul said about the blessed apostles. Josephus again records that he reckons tens of thousands died by famine. 

The equal number of those from each tribe who were sealed and became believers symbolizes the equally valid zeal and the same understanding of the faith [among them all], even if in fact more from one tribe and fewer from another were saved and believed in Christ, who was dishonored by the Jews, 

but is worshiped both by us and by all supernatural creation now and always, for ever and ever. Amen.
