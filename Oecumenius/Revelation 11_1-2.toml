In what went before, the vision showed blessed John the multitude of the saints who were with Christ and who were looking upon the divine throne. Among them those from the nations were many times more numerous than those from Israel. But now he shows him something else—the number of those who had been honored in the time of the old covenant, and those in the time of the new covenant. And see how cleverly this is depicted for him. 

A measuring rod is given him to measure the temple of God and the altar in the temple, obviously the one in Jerusalem, and those who worship in it. And he measured it; those who had pleased God in the times of the old covenant could be measured because of their scarcity. 

But, he says, leave out the court outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given over to the nations. When he measured the temple and the altar and those sacrificing in it, he heard that he must leave out the court outside and widen it, definitely not measure it, since it was too large to be measured. He says the court has been given to the nations; it is attached to the temple and also outside it, 

just as the new covenant is attached to the old. For [the writings of] the new covenant spiritually and truly fulfill the shadows [of the old], and yet they are different from it, as Jeremiah says, “Behold, the days are coming, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt.” 

He means that the court of the temple is the new covenant. Then the vision speaks with mystical signs, saying that the Lord was in the old covenant, too, who in the new covenant was called “Christ” and “Beginning.” This is why Paul thinks it right to say about Israel, “For they drank from the spiritual rock which followed them, and the rock was Christ.” He called the court of the old covenant the new covenant, for the court is the entrance and the way into God, and is certainly not the temple. Therefore he did not measure the court, which symbolizes both the court and those within it; for both the new [covenant] and those who have been set right in it exceed all comprehension, the people because of their untold multitude and the covenant through the subtlety and loftiness of its teachings. 

In saying, because it has been given over to the nations, he means that the good things in the new covenant were given also to Israel, but since those of the nations in it are more numerous than those honored from Israel, he has indicated the whole by the majority, by saying that the court has been given to the nations. 

He says, and they will trample over the holy city for fortytwo months—the city, not the temple—calling the church the city, about which it is said, “Glorious things have been spoken about you, the city of God,” “the heavenly Jerusalem,” “the mother” “of the first-born, those inscribed in heaven.” 

What does the period of forty-two months mean? It intimates that the time of the new dispensation on earth will be short, and then will come the end. For the number forty consists of four tens and therefore is not a perfect number, and likewise the number two. In this way the argument shows that the establishment of the new covenant will not be of long duration in the present life. That is why Scripture calls the time of the new covenant, when the only Son became incarnate, “the last” hour and also “the eleventh” hour. But in the future age it will be eternal. 

By saying that those of the nations will trample on the holy city, that is, the church, he indicates that they will dwell in it.
