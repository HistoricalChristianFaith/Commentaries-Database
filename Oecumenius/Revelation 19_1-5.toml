“I heard a voice from heaven as of a great multitude,” it says. The ranks of the holy angels are without number. As one of the fathers has said, the ninety-nine sheep who were kept safe and did not go astray represent the angels, while the one sheep who went astray represents the entirety of humankind. They said, “Hallelujah!” “Hallelujah” is a Hebrew expression that means “praise God” or “sing to God.” Therefore, they are singing a hymn of thanksgiving for the righteous judgment of the spiritual Babylon. And they cried out the same hymn a “second time,” and yet later they spoke it again. And so by this threefold offering of the Hallelujah they give glory to the holy and much to be praised Trinity, for this [Trinity] is God. “The smoke from her goes up forever and ever.” The doxology of the Hallelujah interrupted the flow of the discourse, since clearly the sequence of the narrative is this: “And he has avenged on her the blood of his servants. And the smoke from her goes up forever and ever.” He mentions “smoke” since the city of which he speaks is completely in flames. For smoke is an indication of fire.

The elders and the living creatures say “Amen,” signifying their agreement with the doxology that was proffered by the holy angels. For when rendered from the Hebrew into the Greek, “Amen” means γένοιτο [ “let it be”]. It says, “Praise our God, you small and you great.” By “small” he refers to those who are greater in holiness; by “great” he refers to those who are outstanding in holiness.
