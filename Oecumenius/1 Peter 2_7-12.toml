To you therefore who believe, honor is given. But to those who do not believe, the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner, and a stone to stumble over, and a rock to offend: namely, to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient to that which they were also appointed. But you are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people who have obtained mercy, that you may proclaim the virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light: who once were not a people, but now are the people of God: who had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained mercy. Beloved, I beg you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul: have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that in that which they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your good works which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation.
"To you therefore who believe, honor is given." To God, namely, who said, I lay, honor is given: but against the unbelievers, this is what God now says: I lay for you in Sion a stone on which you will stumble over: which is both a rock to which they will stumble, and a rock on which they will stumble if they fall: who, namely, the unbelievers, remaining in the word, stumble over it: for which, namely, they were also appointed. Therefore, the whole part must be ordered in this way: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes in Him will by no means be put to shame [Isa. 28:16]: precious to you who believe, but to the unbelievers, a stone over which they will stumble: which stone the builders rejected, but has become the head of the corner, uniting the believers into one: but to the fallen, it is for those who stumble, namely, not believing in the word of the Gospel.
"to that which they were also appointed.” not as if they are separated from God, this has been said. For no cause of destruction is administered by Him who desires all men to be saved, but those who have made themselves vessels of wrath, and unbelief has followed, and in that order they have been given to what they had prepared themselves for. For if man has been made free in will, and cannot be obligated in free will, no one could respectfully accuse him who has decreed such a fate for himself, which he has brought upon himself through his own actions.
Furthermore, Christ is called the head of the corner, as he completes the two walls of the Father’s house, joining those who were from the nations and the Jews through his own contract, and adapting them into one fitting unity: indeed removing useless sacrifices from the midst, while transferring demonic superstition to the true worship of God.
"But you are a chosen generation." After criticizing the wickedness of the morals of the unbelievers, and that they had become the cause of their own unbelief, Peter now turns to praise those who had excelled, saying: You are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood: as if to say: They, indeed, through their hardness and disobedience have stumbled upon the cornerstone, but they were not co-built; but you, on the contrary, have been built up into a royal priesthood through obedience: as a chosen generation, as a holy nation. But let them not dissolve themselves with excessive praise: and furthermore, let them not seem to have a certain inherited right as if they were a holy people and the other things that follow: and that they were considered worthy of such honor because they were of the lineage of Abraham, nor had they ever stumbled, he adds, suppressing their pride, and says: Do not be exalted because of your lineage; for you were not chosen for the royal priesthood because of Abraham: for those who descended from him had a priestly tribe distinct from the royal one: therefore, you were not chosen as a people and a lineage, separated for the royal priesthood because of Abraham: for none of these things were said about Abraham, but because of Christ, who is also called a priest according to the order of Melchizedek (Ps. 109:4), a gentle king, just and saving; (Zech. 9:9; Matt. 21:5) who also rode on the colt of an ass.
Therefore, to those who have both, by the merit of the sacred baptismal rebirth, you are called a chosen generation and a royal priesthood. This you have from Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Therefore, through your works made in the light, announce His virtues to other men. Thus, you have this from His kindness, since you are a people who once were not a people: and who have obtained mercy, you who once were not a people have now obtained mercy. Moreover, to ensure that the word is more devoid of hatred, it confirms the word of reproach from Hosea, "Therefore, announce His virtues through good works." (Hos. 2:1) But how do they announce? The Lord Himself teaches when He says: "Let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven." (Matt. 5:16)
"a people who have obtained mercy," that is, to possession or inheritance. Indeed, all are God's creation, but the possession belongs only to those who are deemed worthy of this benefit by their own deeds, "that you may announce His virtues." Therefore, He says, you are chosen, so that by obedience you may be called heralds of the virtue of Him who called you.
"Beloved, I beg you." This part must be taken in this way: Beloved, I beg you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul. It is customary for teachers to introduce moral conduct after the discourse of doctrine: this blessed one also does so now, calling them ἀγαπητοί, that is, beloved or rather lovable and friends, and not ἀγαπωμένοι, that is, somewhat beloved: for all are desirable for everything; for those who are desirable for one thing are called ἀγαπώμενοι, not άγάπητοί.
Indeed, he says that fleshly lusts wage war against the soul, since according to the blessed Paul, the flesh lusts against the spirit. (Gal. 5:17) For the desires of the flesh, concerning the enjoyment of the senses, confuse reason and make the soul servile.
I beg you, he says, to have your conversation honest among the Gentiles. However, the term ἔχειν, that is, “to have”, is taken for ἔχοντες, that is, “having”. Peter introduces the Gentiles as slanderers against us. But if anyone wishes to learn this, from what has been written by Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyons in Gaul, about the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina2, it will be possible to know precisely. And as they are proposed briefly in the middle, these are: When the Greeks had apprehended the servants of these Christians, educated in divine mysteries, they then inflicted violence, so that they might learn something secret about the Christians from them: since these servants had no way to speak to those inflicting violence for pleasure and grace, except what they had heard from their masters, that divine communion is the blood and body of Christ, believing themselves that it was truly blood and flesh, they responded to those inquiring. They, taking this as if it were actually being done by Christians, also revealed it to others among the Greeks: and the martyrs Sanctus and Blandina were compelled to confess this under torture. To whom Blandina spoke freely and wisely, saying: How could they bear this who, for the sake of divine study and meditation, do not even partake of permitted meats? Furthermore, she calls the day of visitation an inquiry of worldly matters. For when the inquiry about our life comes from them, where things are found to be contrary to what their suspicion was, they not only become ashamed, but they themselves are corrected, and God is glorified.
