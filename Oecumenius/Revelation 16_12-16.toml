The sixth angel made the river Euphrates fordable, perhaps by drying up some of its springs, so as to facilitate the passage of the kings through it. But by the work of the Devil and with the consent of God a very large number of kings were brought together for war among themselves. For the Lord said, in the testimony described a little earlier, that wars would take place about the time of the end.

And I saw, he says, issuing from the mouth of the serpent and from the mouth of the false prophet. He calls the Devil a serpent, the Devil, who is the author of all evil. But by the title of “false prophet” he refers either to a certain other who prophesies through the operation of the devil or to the antichrist. However, should he be speaking completely of the antichrist whom above he introduced as one slain by the breath of the Lord and whom now he depicts as still alive—he pours out demons through his mouth—let not the reader be amazed. For that which is seen is a vision, and the Evangelist often shows that which comes first as last, and contrariwise that which is last as first.


And, he says, I saw three spirits like frogs, for they are demonic spirits, performing signs, which go abroad to the kings. He calls the demons “frogs” because they rejoice at that life of people that is muddy and slimy. Moreover, they take pleasure in the life of sinners, which is moist and without constraint, rather than in the life of the righteous, which is steadfast and austere, being also very envious and joyful at the destruction of the living. The assembling of the kings to make war against each other at the time of the end is a form of trickery on the part of the demons. He calls the day great, which means “that moment.” For it is truly great and fearful, as Joel also calls it in the words, “before the great and indisputable day of the Lord comes.” 

“Lo, I am coming like a thief,” says the Lord. He says “like a thief” because of the suddenness and unexpectedness of his second coming. “Blessed is he who is awake and keeps his garments that he may not go naked.” He continues the image of the thief. Therefore, he said that it is necessary to preserve one’s garments that they not be lost. By the term garments he refers either to that virtuous and decent life through which we become worthy of God’s protection, or he refers to the body, that it be pure and holy. For he who does not keep [his garments] will be ashamed in front of the divine throne of the angels and of people, harried by the judgment at that time and left “naked” of divine succor.

He says, And the demons assembled the kings of the earth at the place called in Hebrew Megiddo. This is to be translated as “a cleft” or “a cleaving.” So, then, as a result of the forthcoming slaughter and butchery of those assembled in it, he named the place of war Megiddo.
