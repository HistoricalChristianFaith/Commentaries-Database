This means: “When you have pulled yourselves together and determined to obey the truth by the power of the Spirit.” For it is also possible to “obey” in evil and vicious matters, but that is not in the Spirit. And since there is a purification or preparation which must come before obedience, Peter wants to bring in as many extra helpers as possible. This is the role of brotherly love, which makes our neighbors also partakers of the good things which we have found.
