And heavenly hosts followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen; for the Lord is both the commander of the heavenly powers and has so named himself, speaking as Joshua son of Nun. (see Jos. 5:14) Saying, "I the commander-in-chief of the power of the Lord, have now appeared." (Jos. 5:14)

And the horses are white even to the holy angels; for they likewise take pleasure in those pure of men, since they are pure in nature and unmingled with any stain. And this is shown by that garment of white and fine linen.
