[[commentary]]
quote='''
Note that this verse closely resembles what is said in 1 John 2:7 and elsewhere in that letter. John’s purpose is to show that what he is saying is something which people already know in principle and have even had some past experience of. It is not something strange and unusual which they will find hard to grasp.
