The sins of certain people are obvious, leading to judgment; and for some, they also follow. Likewise, good deeds are evident; and those that are otherwise cannot be hidden.

Since he said above, "nor share in the sins of others," (1 Tim. 5:22) he resolves what was said as if in contrast. For what reason, Timothy would say, if I were to ignore the sins of the one being ordained, would I share in them? And he says: "The sins of certain people are obvious, leading to judgment." Therefore, if you diligently investigate sins, you will fully understand them.

and for some, they also follow. That is, they follow after the ordination. Therefore, you would have communicated to the former: for it would be negligence not to know what is obvious. But not so with the latter, for nothing is from you.

— [OECUMENIUS] I know that I have read an interpretation of this kind among certain saints: those whose sins go before are visible to all; therefore, let there be some for you as well, but observe those that follow with watchful eyes. If therefore you do anything besides this, you will share in sins. But Saint Basil has interpreted it in such a way as if nothing of this chapter pertains to ordination. Whoever, he says, has sinned against him alone, their sins have preceding and trailing judgment. However many, even after they have departed from the church, have left occasions for sinning to others, just as Nestorius and other heretics; these sins follow them even after they have gone: for even the sins of those who fall are attributed to them because of them.

Likewise, good deeds are evident. That is, in the same way. Whatever, he says, has been said about sins, accept also this about good deeds. For there are those who have become the occasion of salvation for others, and the righteous works of these are also attributed to those who have sown the seeds.
