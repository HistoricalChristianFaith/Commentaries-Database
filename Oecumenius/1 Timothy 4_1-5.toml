But the Spirit openly says that in later times some will abandon the faith, paying attention to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons, through the hypocrisy of liars whose consciences are seared, who forbid marriage, abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful who know the truth; that every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving. For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.

But the Spirit openly says. That is, clearly and obviously. Do not be amazed, Paul says, if some now, having fallen away from the faith, Judaize. For a time will come, he says, when the faith will be more broadly extended, in which they will do even worse things, not only in the observance of foods, but also in marriages and other matters.

paying attention to deceitful spirits. For if anyone departs from faith, everything else becomes dangerous. For it is necessary from then on that the mind be attentive to impure spirits, and to demons leading man away from the right path.

and teachings of demons. Through these he revealed every wickedness, especially the Manichaeans, the Encratites, the Marcionites.

through the hypocrisy. That is, deceitful work. However, it stands that since they know the falseness of their dogmas, they strive to speak falsely. And Paul says that liars are those whose conscience has been seared by an evil life, that is, a depraved life: and because they are aware of much filth within themselves, therefore their conscience bears stubborn marks of a sleazy life. Truly, those who are such, through fear of retribution, pervert true dogmas, persuading themselves of anything rather than that only God is the just judge, the resurrection, and the retribution of good and evil.

who forbid marriage. What then? Do Christians not hinder from marrying? By no means. “Marriage is honorable in all things, and the bed undefiled.” (Heb. 13:4) But those who do not wish to marry are urged to abstinence. And those who hinder marriage are said to hinder on account of impurity.

abstain from foods. It is not a mistake or a lapse in elegance of speech when it says, “to abstain from foods”, which seemed to some not even a matter of apostolic vision, but rightly expressed according to the Attic custom (dialect). Just as the phrase, "He prevented him from doing improper things," does not mean that he encouraged him to do improper things; and likewise, "He deterred him from offending friends," does not mean offending friends, but rather the opposite. And again, "He prevented him from stealing," does not mean that he permitted theft. And, "He prevented ceasing from speaking," instead of, "He kept away from such an action." Thus also, "They prevented abstaining from foods," instead of, "They prevented from eating." And this usage is also frequent among outsiders.

created to be received [μετάληψιν] with thanksgiving. See how Paul expelled luxury in the name of participation [μεταλήψεως]. For to be received [μετάληψιν] signifies a measured reception [μεμετρημένην]. And he did not expel luxury as something unclean, but as something obstructive due to excess and, as it were, a rupture of the soul.

To the faithful, God has created foods to be received [μετάληψιν] thankfully. But not to the unbelievers anymore. For by their own laws they shut themselves off from them.

who know the truth. The Jewish rites were indeed a shadow; now the truth has come. Many things were forbidden to them, not because they were impure, but to restrain indulgences. But the truth speaks of the faith which is in Christ.

that every creature of God is good. Paul speaks concerning things that are edible. He already anticipates the heresy of those introducing uncreated matter and said that those were foods.

and nothing is to be rejected. Therefore, neither should the idol's food be rejected, provided it is taken with prayer, if you are unaware: since by law you become guilty who are commanded not to be defiled by the food of idols; therefore, by transgressing the law, one is defiled: just as even what is entirely pure, and taken without thanksgiving, becomes defiled because of your voluntary ingratitude.

For it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer. If it is sanctified, then is it unclean? Far from it! For everything is clean; but here two points are made against those who say that some foods are unclean. First, that every creature of God is good, and nothing is unclean. But if anyone considers something to be unclean, there is also such a thing as medicine [φάρμακον], he says. For it is sanctified by the word of God, that is, by prayer. Moreover, it is stated earlier: For it is by the word and prayer made to God that it is sanctified.
