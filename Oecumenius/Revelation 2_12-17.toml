And, he says, “you shall write to the church in Pergamum: I say to you, I who carry in my mouth a sword to exact vengeance on those who transgress my commandments.” The sword in his mouth symbolizes the danger of those who are not obedient to the divine commands. He says, “you dwell at the throne of Satan.” 

All of Asia is given to idolatry, but especially Pergamum. But he also says, “although you were living in such a place, you kept my faith unsullied: you did not turn aside to follow the determination of the majority to do evil, but you even spoke against them in the days and feasts of the idols, like my faithful witness, who,” he says, “boldly spoke in my name. As far as the plotters are concerned, you kept close to me right up to death in guarding the truth. 

But since blame attaches even to the most holy, and since ‘we all often stumble,’ as Scripture says, to you in spite of your faithfulness,” he says, “I still have a complaint to make.” For you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and commit fornication. In the same way you also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans: in the words he taught Balak he explains the sort of teacher he had. The story of Balaam and Balak is clearly written down in Numbers; Numbers is a book of the very wise Moses. Josephus recounts that by the plotting of Balaam the Midianite women had been sent to Israel to lead them to fornication and to apostatize from God. [The angel] says, “you have those from Nicolaus who do such things, and you do not banish them from you.” 

Then he says, Repent: otherwise I will come to you soon and make war against them with the sword of my mouth. “O the depth of the riches and wisdom” and goodness “of God!” For he did not say, I shall come to you and make war “against you,” but I shall make war against them, that is, the Nicolaitans. For he spared those in Pergamum who were faithful and godly. 

He says, He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I shall give him some of the hidden manna of the mystery: in other words he said, “I shall grant them to be filled with the spiritual and future blessings.” 

And I shall give him a white stone; that is, one which has won the victory and is bright with glory; and on the stone a new name, which no one knows except the one who receives it: for it is said, “What eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor what has entered the human heart—all that God has prepared for those who love him.”
