He wants to show here that the New Testament is greater than the Old. And this he does by introducing a comparison from the priests. That one had priests taken from among men, but this one has Christ.

"taken from among men." That is, being presented. If the one deals gently with those who are ignorant and going astray, how much more will the one who is both man and God deal gently with those who are ignorant and going astray? If this is understood, then the term "being taken" will be more readily accepted instead of "being set apart." As one of the men, and being taken from them as a priest, he says,

"among men is appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining to God." Among men, he says, being appointed on behalf of men in things pertaining, he becomes in the things pertaining to God. And what are the things pertaining to God? He himself says, in order to offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins of the people.
"To deal gently." That is, to be sympathetic, to accommodate, and to forgive those who are ignorant, that is, those who sin out of ignorance and are misguided.
And for those going astray, he says, from the people.
"he himself is also surrounded by weakness." The simple interpretation, which I think is also the truer one, is this: that for this reason the high priest is gentle toward those who are ignorant; because he himself is subject to weakness; and knowing the measure of human weakness in himself, he also measures out mercy. Or the high priest differs from the people only in this, that he is gentle and shows sympathy toward those who go astray; since in other respects he too is perhaps subject to weakness like the many. By weakness he means sins, or afflictions and temptations.
But the phrase, "for sins," he clearly stated that he called weakness sin.
"And because of this, he is obligated," since he himself, he says, is under sin, and he must make the offering common for both his own and the sins for the people.
“To offer for sins.”The sacrifice concerning sins, he says, “And no one takes this honor upon himself.” He speaks of another characteristic of a priest, that he does not take it upon himself to approach the honor of the priesthood. This he also hinted at when he spoke of the priests of the Jews at that time, who were not priests by power, because they approached and had made the priesthood a service.
“just as Aaron.” For Aaron was often appointed high priest by God. For indeed, at the beginning, he was called by God through Moses and thus consecrated, not by himself taking the office (Ex. 28:1). And again, when the rod budded (Num. 17:8), it was shown that he was divinely appointed; and when fire consumed those who improperly intruded upon the priesthood. (Num. 16)
So also Christ did not glorify himself to become a high priest. He also says this: “Christ is the first high priest, that he did not enter into the priesthood from himself, but was ordained by the Father.” Therefore, showing in clear terms that he was a priest according to the custom of the priests, in other respects he indicates how much he ought to excel as God of men.
“but it was He who said to him.” He says, God having said this to him, ordained him as high priest,
“As he says also in another place.” The "And," as regards the sequence of the interpretation, is omitted.
"according to the order of Melchizedek." This one first offered an unbloody sacrifice to God, bread and wine.

The reason is that Christ also offered an unbloody sacrifice, for first He offered this, and then later His own body. For this reason, it is accordingly said that Christ is a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.

That Melchizedek was not anointed into the priesthood by oil, as Aaron, and that he did not offer sacrifices by blood, and that he was a high priest of the nations, and that he blessed Abraham with bread and wine.

The meaning of the word is that if Christ himself did not offer an unbloody sacrifice (for he offered his own body), then those priests who are deemed worthy by God and the high priest will offer an unbloody sacrifice from him. For this indicates, "forever." For he would not have said "forever" regarding the one-time sacrifice and offering made by God, but he refers to the present priests through whom Christ ministers and is ministered to, having also given them in the mystical supper the manner of such ministry.
