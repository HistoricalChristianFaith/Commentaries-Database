The word makes clear that if Christ himself offered a sacrifice not unstained with blood—for he offered his own blood—then in contrast the priests who derive their office from him (whomever God and the high priest deem worthy to be priests) will bring a sacrifice untainted by blood. For the phrase forever reveals this. For he did not speak to the sacrifice and offering made once and for all when he said “forever,” but he had in mind the present sacrificing priests, by means of whom Christ sacrifices and is sacrificed, who also gives to those in the mystic supper the character of such a sacrifice.
