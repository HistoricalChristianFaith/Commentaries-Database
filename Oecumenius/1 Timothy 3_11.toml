Women likewise must be honorable, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things.

Women, not just any women, but deaconesses. For what did Paul wish to mention among the clergy, women of any kind?

not slanderous.  What was said above: not to be double-tongued.

but sober-minded. For the female sex is not to be trusted. Therefore, one must be sober and watchful. For as much as they are more susceptible to deceits, so much so do they need sobriety.

faithful in all things. In faith and life.
