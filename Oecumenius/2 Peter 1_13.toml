Some think that Peter was saying this in order to ensure that even after his death his hearers would still remember what he was saying to them and go on practicing it. Others say that Peterâ€™s intention was simply to leave a record behind him, so that it could be referred to after his death, for he was not condemning their inadequacy in matters of faith but merely confirming them in the way which they were already pursuing.
