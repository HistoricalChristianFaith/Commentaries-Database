If anyone teaches otherwise and does not agree to the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and to the teaching that accords with godliness, he is inflated with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, strife, blasphamies, evil suspicions, and constant friction among people who are immoral in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Depart from such people. But godliness with gladness is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.

If anyone teaches otherwise: that is, one different from what is right.

and to the teaching that accords with godliness. Paule said, "They are sound words," and he says, "And with the teaching accords with godliness," evidently concerning faith.

he is inflated with conceit and understands nothing. For he who does not know what he ought to know, knows nothing. But he who does not know the sound things, obviously knows the demonic things. Moreover, arrogance is a matter welcoming and proper to demons.

an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels. For if you do not believe, but craving for controversy, there must be debate and conflicts of reasoning. Since Christianity promises future things, and these cannot be shown to the eyes, faith is necessary. But see that to crave controversy is to be ill.

blasphemies. For it is necessary that human reasoning permit what pertains to God, and that blasphemy arises from questioning.

evil suspicions. These are opinions and contaminated doctrines.

friction. The transmission of the disease of bad doctrines, from the contact of miserable sheep. For those who come into contact are filled with the disease, along with the healthy ones.

imagining that godliness is a means of gain. Do you know that even battles of words produce shameful profit? It is no wonder, for those who contend with words attract more students, making a profit from them, whether monetary gain. They pretend virtue in order to amass wealth through it.

Depart from such people. Paul did not say, "Join with such men and fight," but "depart," after one and then a second warning. For how will you ever be able to persuade men fighting for money? Therefore, since they are persistent, turn away from them.

But godliness with gladness is great gain. They indeed imagine godliness in such a way that it serves as a means for gain and profit. But true profit is godliness itself in its own nature, and having what is sufficient, not seeking those things that abound in earthly goods. Or rather, what profit is godliness itself if we do not seek more, but remain in sufficiency.

For we brought nothing into the world. If we have brought nothing in, and we can take nothing out, what need is there to have more than what is necessary?

But if we have food and clothing. One must eat as much as is sufficient to nourish, not as much as to create luxury; and one must have as much clothing and such as to cover nakedness, not as many as to create extravagance and folly for those who bear them. For this indicates the nature of food and clothing.
