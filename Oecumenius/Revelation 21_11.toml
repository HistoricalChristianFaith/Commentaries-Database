Her radiance, that is, the Sun of righteousness Christ (Mal. 4:2), is said to be like a jasper stone. The jasper, as was said above, being somewhat green, signifies the life-giving and life-sustaining Christ, "who opens his hand and fills every living thing with good will" (Ps. 145:16); for green is considered the source of all earthly food. But the jasper was also clear as crystal, showing the purity and holiness of Christ; "for he committed no sin, and deceit was not found in his mouth," (Isa. 53:9) according to the prophecies of Isaiah. And Christ again is the wall of the saints, that is, of his church, being our bulwark and defense and help.
