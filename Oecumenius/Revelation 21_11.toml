“Its radiance,” that is, Christ “the sun of righteousness,” was “like a jasper.” Jasper has a certain green quality and so exhibits the life-bearing and life-giving nature of Christ, who “opens his hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing.” Indeed, green plants are the chief form of earthly food. The jasper was also like crystal and so symbolizes the purity and the holiness of Christ, for he “did no sin, and there was no deceit in his mouth,” as the prophecy of Isaiah says.
