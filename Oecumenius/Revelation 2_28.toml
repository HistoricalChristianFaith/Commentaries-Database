And I will give him the morning star, says the prophet concerning the Assyrian or Satan, "How you have fallen from heaven, O morning star, son of the dawn!" (Isa. 14:12) He is still called the morning star; therefore, he says, I will give Satan into the hand of my servants. Similar to what is said by the apostle: "God will soon crush Satan under your feet." (Rom. 16:20) And, "on an asp and a basilisk you will tread, and you will trample a lion and a dragon." (Ps. 90:13)
