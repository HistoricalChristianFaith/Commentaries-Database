“And I will give him the morning star.” It speaks of the Assyrian, namely, of Satan, of whom the prophet speaks, saying, “How has the Day Star, he who rises in the morning, fallen from heaven.” And even now the Lord calls him the “Morning Star.” And so, he says, I will make Satan to be subject to my servants. The apostle also made a similar statement: “God will trample Satan quickly under your feet.” And in another place it says, “You will tread upon the lion and the asp, and you will trample upon the lion and the serpent.”
