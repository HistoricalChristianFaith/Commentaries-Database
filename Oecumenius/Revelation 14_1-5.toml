The Lord is described in the gospels as addressing the lawless people of the Jews: “Behold, your house is forsaken.” For they were no longer worthy of God’s presence after their madness with the cross. So how is it that the Lord is now shown by the vision as standing on Mount Zion, as though they had repented? The Romans clearly saw to it that their city, the temple, and their race had been completely abandoned when they burned the temple, set fire to cities, ravaged all their land, and enslaved their chief city itself. 

But now by showing the Lord as having ascended Mount Zion he indicates the return of Israel in the last days through faith, and that the Lord will claim them as his own and take them to himself. For this is the good news they were promised through Isaiah when he says, “The savior will come from Zion and will turn away impiety from Jacob, said the Lord.” Both the prophet and the apostle are in agreement with Isaiah: the former sings, “You will make them turn back, you will prepare their presence among your remnant,” and the other writes, “When the full number of the gentiles comes in, then shall all Israel be saved.” 

And with him, he says, there were a hundred and forty-four thousand with his Father’s name written on their foreheads. Earlier on he called the twelve thousand believers from each of the tribes of Israel a hundred and forty-four thousand. So is he now speaking of these? I do not think so; for he did not name them with the definite article; for he did not say the hundred and forty-four thousand, but only a hundred and forty-four thousand; and he did not assert that they had remained celibate. For celibacy was not very seriously considered by Israel, as it certainly was later by those from the gentiles. So we must consider those who have now been named to be a mixed company, coming from both Israel and the gentiles, with the majority from the gentiles. 

To have the name of the Father and of his Son written shows that they are garlanded with a certain divine glory. 

He says, And I heard a sound like harpists singing a new song before the throne and before the living creatures and the elders. That the sound which was issuing was like that of harpists indicates the sweet God-like harmony of the song. For although “praise is not appropriate in the mouth of a sinner” according to Scripture, it is wholly suitable and in harmony in the mouth of the righteous. 

He says, No one could learn the song except a hundred and forty-four thousand who have been redeemed from the earth. I think that no one was able to hear the mysteries of the new song except those who had been made worthy of singing them, for knowledge is given to each in proportion to their purity. “There are many mansions” (or rewards for the good), says the Lord, “in my Father’s house.” 

He calls those who were bought by the blood of Christ redeemed. For the precious blood of Christ has been shed on behalf of all people, but unprofitably on behalf of some, that is, those who willingly deprived themselves of the offered salvation. These are they whom the Lord reproaches when he says through the prophet, “What profit is there in my blood, if I go down to destruction?” But, for those who were saved and justified, of whom these who are now mentioned are the firstfruits and forerunners, it is so profitable as to be past description. 

These are they, he says, who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are celibate, these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among human beings as first-fruits for God and the Lamb, and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are spotless. The account of the vision bears witness to those in Christ as being excellent and surpassing human nature.
