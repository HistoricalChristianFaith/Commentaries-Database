And when can we receive the promise? Do not become sluggish, he says: he who repays is near. “For yet a very little while, and he who is coming will come and will not delay.” For what he says,"a very little while, [ὅσον ὅσον], signifies a very short time.
"But the righteous shall live by faith." Therefore, it is necessary to believe that He will come, for the righteous shall live by faith.
But if he becomes sluggish, he says, and withdraws himself, either from faith or from afflictions, he will not be approved in my soul: As from Christ, receive all this.
"But we are not of those who withdraw to destruction." Since he astonished them by saying, "and if he becomes sluggish," he says, "my soul shall have no pleasure in him." He corrects it and says: We are not those who withdraw ourselves or are sluggish, which leads to destruction: but we pertain to faith, to possess and save our souls.
