If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task. Therefore, a bishop must be blameless, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach; not a drunkard, not violent, not greedy for gain, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money; one who manages his own household well, with children in submission with all reverence.

Writing to Timothy, Paul shows in general what kind of person a bishop must be. "he desires a noble task." He says, "I do not accuse him." An honest man is needed, certainly for service and leadership; provided that he desires it for helping many, and not for glory. For a bishop is said to be one who oversees all. Even Moses desired it, but not for glory, rather for the benefit of many.

be blameless. So that he is aware of no evil in himself. For if he is aware, he acts badly desiring oversight, from which through his actions he has alienated himself.

A bishop must be the husband of one wife. This does not legislate that a bishop must necessarily have a wife, but rather, if he is married, he says, he must not be a second husband. Or that he should know only one lawful wife for marriage; but, when called to the office of bishop, he must fulfill that condition. "So that those who have wives may be as though they had none." (1 Cor. 7:29) And, "I wish that all were as I am," says Paul. (1 Cor. 7:7) And, "He who is married cares about worldly things." (1 Cor. 7:33) How then can a bishop rightly care for worldly matters? Some say that he said this concerning the Church, so that he would not transfer from one to another; for the matter is adultery.

Sober-minded. Awake, discerning, fervent in spirit.

self-controlled. For one ought to have restraint, good manners, and hospitality according to those who lead. Therefore, Paul added the teacher's own characteristic, saying self-controlled:

not a drunkard. Paul says this, not meaning the intoxicated (for that was often the case), but the brazen and arrogant.

Again, not violent, not one who strikes with hands, but one who strikes the conscience of the brothers.

one who manages his own household well. For he who does not know how to rule a single household, or who could not properly govern two or three children by nature, how will he be able to suitably preside over the Church and so great a people? For he must bear examples from his own household.
