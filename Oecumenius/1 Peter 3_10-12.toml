For whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil.
For whoever desires to love life? Life, I say, not in which even irrational beings exist, but in which man lives according to God, and days that are not bad, but good. For the days of this age, according to the patriarch Jacob, are few and evil. (Gen. 47:9) But where the prophetic oracle concludes, because it was placed therein:
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil: Peter adds to these: If you live in this way, you will have God as gracious and obedient. Therefore, who, with Him standing by you, will boldly attack you? For all things are in His hand; death and life are in the hand of the Lord. Nevertheless, since the afflictions imposed for the sake of faith seemed to some to be evil, the blessed Peter correcting this said: not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead blessing. For the fear awaiting from men should not be regarded, but it lasts only for a very short time, as it comes from those who themselves pass away very quickly.
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, threatening destruction to the wicked. Indeed, if these evils were present, surely the distributor of good things would not allow His beloved ones to be afflicted by evils: for He sends evils upon the wicked. Therefore, these are not evils, but afflictions inflicted for the sake of devotion.
