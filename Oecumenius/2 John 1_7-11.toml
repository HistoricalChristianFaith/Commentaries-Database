This is the seducer and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we do not lose those things we worked for, but that we may receive a full reward. Whoever transgresses and does not abide in the doctrine of Christ does not have God. He who abides in the doctrine of Christ has both the Father and the Son. If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor greet him. For he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
"This is the seducer and an antichrist." With this, it must be understood for a more perfect explanation, therefore “who do not confess that,” as it should be properly added, “This is the seducer and an antichrist." Without this, the discourse will be disordered and independent, namely passing from the plural to the singular.
This is, John says, an antichrist and seducer. However, by saying, "Those who do not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh," he reveals that he is speaking of those who reject the Lord's coming: since the Lord himself, saying, "Many will come in my name," (Matt. 24:5) does not speak of the first coming, but of the second: Nevertheless, in truth, those who reject the second also reject the first. For if he who came in the flesh also promised a second coming, certainly he who rejects the second also rejects the first: for if he believes that he has come, he would also consider the promise of the one who has come to be certain: but if he despises the promise, it cannot be said in any way that he believes even in the first. Therefore, I believe the beloved disciple used the word "to come," not "to have come," so that he might comprehend those denying both of the Lord's coming in the flesh. Therefore, John instructed them to beware of these: and he adds the reason: "Lest by adhering to them, you lose what you have previously worked for, but receive your full reward without any weakness." But perhaps someone might say in such matters: "What if I do not believe in Christ's coming in the flesh, yet I lead a life in good works, can I not be counted among the pious and religious through these works, nor receive a reward for them?"
The Apostle first removes this objection by saying: Let no one think that by rejecting the coming of the Lord in the flesh, one can either achieve the perfect justice owed to the faithful through works or be regarded as a worshiper of God at all. But whoever transgresses this commandment of His, namely of Christ who has come, and does not remain in His doctrine, does not have God.” For if He came to teach men the perfect knowledge of God, He would seem to be rejected; how then could He be a worshiper of God who disapproves of the interpreter of divine contemplations? Therefore, he would be ἄθεος, that is, “without God”, just as on the other hand, ἔνθεος, that is, divine and “a friend of God”, having all the fullness of divinity within himself, namely the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, who is firm and solid in the doctrine of Christ.
For Jesus teaches about the Father, saying: "All things that the Father has are mine." (Jn. 16:15) He often teaches both about the Father and about Himself, that indeed He is the Father, but He is the Son; and concerning the Holy Spirit, when He says: "The Spirit who proceeds from the Father." (Jn. 15:26) However, when he says: "Baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." (Matt. 28:19) And although in this place the mention is made only of the Father and the Son by the Lord's disciple, and not of the Holy Spirit, do not be offended. For it was only concerning this that he was compelled and desired to speak, about the Father, I say, and the Son. And indeed, these things have been said in the present context, lest we be more lengthy. However, John remains in the teaching of Christ or the Gospel, who according to it feels and acts, living by contemplating and working together; but whoever separates himself from this, is godless. For just as one who has a perfect way of life makes himself familiar with God, as Abraham did, according to what he heard from God Himself: "I am your God," (Gen. 17:1) so too, whoever lives outside the command of the Gospel, is godless, separating himself so that he may not have God.
But since here he is godless, namely, who has alienated himself from divine discipline, certainly he who remains in it has both the Father and the Son, for the Son said of such: "We will come to him, I and the Father, and we will make our dwelling with him." (Jn. 14:23) For by observing the commandments, he has made himself a temple and dwelling place of God, and he has God dwelling within him: since God is said to be had in two ways. For all creatures are also said to have God, according to what Paul said: "For in him we live and move and have our being." (Acts 17:28) This, however, has been said according to the manner of existence. In another way, through the good operation of one who worships God, for example, it is said to “have God”; according to which it is signified that God is called the God of Abraham and Isaac, and universally the God of the friends of the Hebrews. (Ex. 30) And this must be attributed to what is now to be said: He who has the Son has the Father. (1 Jn. 2:23) For "he who has seen the Son," as the Son himself says, "has seen the Father." (Jn. 14:9) And again: "I am in the Father, and the Father is in me," (Jn. 14:11) says the same Savior, so that even from this the consubstantiality (ὁμοούσιον) of the Father and the Son may be known. And if anyone says that he who receives the disciples also has the Son and the Father: For the Savior says of these: "He who receives you receives me; and he who receives me receives him who sent me," let him know that he is speaking wrongly in this way, nor does he understand as he ought. Since these things have been said about doctrine, seeing that he who received the apostles, by confessing their doctrine, received through them both the Son and the Father teaching. — Likewise in another way.
Since he who abides in doctrine has both the Son and the Father, the apostles also remained in doctrine, so that they preached it as well. Therefore, whoever receives those who are temples of God, by that very act of receiving them, has the Son and the Father who are in them.
"If anyone comes to you" (2 Jn. 10) confirms those to whom he writes. If anyone, he says, comes to you without this confession, not only will he not receive protection from you, but he will also not receive the prayer for salvation from you, rightly and cautiously saying this, as if this prayer for salvation is owed only to those who agree with us in morals and faith. For whom do we pray for salvation, except for those who are of similar morals and faith? Therefore, if such a prayer for salvation is offered by us to the wicked, it is certainly presented as if it were offered to the faithful and those of similar morals, and thus they have been accepted as companions by us, and they have dragged us down to their abyss.
