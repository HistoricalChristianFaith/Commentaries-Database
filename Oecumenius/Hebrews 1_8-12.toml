Since the Son is not a creature, but a true offspring, He is no longer referred to as "who makes," (Heb. 1:13) as is said of the angels, but rather, "Your throne, O God, is forever." The throne, however, is a sign of royalty, but the scepter is of righteousness.
“The scepter of righteousness.” Behold, there is another symbol of royalty, the royal scepter, and the staff.
“You have loved righteousness.” These humble things are appropriate after the incarnation, as they are able to receive the lowly nature of the flesh.
"therefore God, your God, has anointed you." O God, your God has anointed you. The "you" is through the flesh. For humanity is anointed with the Holy Spirit. It does not operate as it does with mere men, such as prophets and patriarchs. Anointing is, as it were, the entire presence of the anointer. Thus, holy Cyril observed. But see how Eusebius said that Symmachus refers to and rejects this anointing. “Therefore,” he says, “God,your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy [χαρᾶς] over your companions.”
"With the oil of gladness [ἀγαλλιάσεως]." Indeed, the oil of gladness is the Holy Spirit; the people are partakers of Christ. What he means by this is: Not as ordinary men are anointed, so Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit to a measure, but all was anointed with the Spirit.
"And you, O Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning.” For when he again brings in the Firstborn; that is, when the Father was pleased to reveal His Firstborn Son in the flesh to those who dwell in the world. For it says: And the angels came and ministered to him (Matt. 4:11); and you will see the angels descending upon the Son of Man (Jn. 1:51) from now on.
"they will perish." Something greater than creation has been revealed, the transformation of the world. For all that is seen will be transformed, and they will come to incorruption. Therefore, it is said, "they will perish" from the present sight.
“like a robe you will roll them up.” He indicated the ease of their change. For everything will change from decay to incorruption; and thus easily, as if one were to wrap a cloak. But if he works so easily towards the better transformation and creation, would he need to focus on the lesser creation of another?
"but you are the same." He says that you will change and renew all things, and make the corruptible into incorruptible. You will truly live forever and will always remain. And there is no small comfort for those suffering here, to know that things will not always be this way, but will undergo a change; and that the one who is being cared for by them remains for eternity and lives forever.
