Do not quickly lay hands on anyone, nor share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.

And Paul discusses the matter of selecting for ordinations. For he wrote to a bishop. And he says, do not quickly, for example, not from the first or second thoughts, but after examining many times and thoroughly.

nor share in the sins of others. That is, appointing a bishop that is unworthy of the people.

Keep yourself pure. Paul commands Timothy concerning self-control. But if a man so exhausts himself with fasting and drinking water that he even falls ill from it, what ought we to do, or how should we observe this?
