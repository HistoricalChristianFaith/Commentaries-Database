And it says the nations will walk by its light. Not only the nations, but also the saints from Israel who have believed. But since those from the Gentiles are more numerous, it indicated these as well as those from the greater number.

And the kings of the earth will bring their glory and honor into it. He calls all the saints kings of the earth, concerning whom it is written in the passage appointing "the heavenly kings over it, they shall be whitened in Selmon," (Ps. 67:15) as was said before. These therefore have even glorious and honorable status. And he says: the boastings borne of virtue will be laid up in that holy city, as he said that the goods of virtue dwell together with the saints.
