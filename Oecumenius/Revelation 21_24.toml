[By the nations] it speaks not only of the Gentiles but also of the saints from Israel who came to faith. For since the saints from the Gentiles are more numerous by far, it indicates also those [from Israel] in speaking of those who are more numerous.… By “kings of the earth” he means all the saints, of whom it is written, “When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they shall be made white as snow in Selmon.” … Therefore, since these possess a certain glory and honor—he speaks of that honor that comes from virtue—they shall carry it into that holy city. This is as though he said, the blessings arising from virtue shall dwell with the saints.
