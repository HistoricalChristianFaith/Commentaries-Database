The third angel forbids people to worship the beast and to receive its mark. For to worship any other as God rather than he who really and truly is God is most unholy. “And he also shall drink the wine of God’s wrath poured unmixed into the cup of his anger.” The holy David mentioned this cup and this wine when he said, “There is a cup in the hand of the Lord, full of unmixed wine; and he has turned it from side to side, but its dregs have not been wholly poured out; all the sinners of the earth shall drink [them].” He calls the wrath of God “wine,” not using this metaphor because of the gladness elicited by wine but because of the darkness and the derangement that oppress those brought under the wrath of God. And, it says, it is “poured out unmixed,” that is, utterly poured out. For the wrath of God is poured out along with his benevolence and goodness, wholly poured out. For there is not an equal measure of wrath and goodness, but the benevolence of God is many times greater. Indeed, were the righteous anger and the goodness of God in equal measure, no one would be able to withstand it. Aware of this, the prophet said, “If you, O Lord, should mark iniquities, Lord, who could stand?” And the same writer indicated that goodness is much greater in the cup of God than is his righteous anger, when he said, “Merciful is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.” In this passage he placed God’s righteousness in the middle, so that hemmed in by mercy on either side, his righteousness would not work its way without constraint. For it is characteristic of justice to meet each according to his merit. Having mentioned wine, and by this referring to God’s wrath, he continues the metaphor and calls the “cup” what is given from the hand of God to sinners.
