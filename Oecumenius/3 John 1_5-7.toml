Dearly beloved, you faithfully do whatever you work for the brothers and for the guests, who have borne witness to your love in the sight of the Church; if you have led them to God worthily, you will benefit. For they went forth for His name, taking nothing from the Gentiles.
"you faithfully do," this is what befits a faithful man.
