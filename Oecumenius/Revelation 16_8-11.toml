It is not difficult to interpret this passage according to the figures of speech. That the sun scorches people could be the drought, affliction and distresses of those remaining in war. Although they are pressed by evils and find it needful to petition God, who is powerful, for help and release from those who are oppressing them with sorrows, yet they cursed [God] and did not repent. It is clear that the plagues are for this purpose, to bring those to acknowledge God through torments, who did not acknowledge their Master through his beneficent work.

The bowl of the fifth angel was poured out, it says, “on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was in darkness.” The apostle wrote concerning the antichrist: “whom the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth,” and Isaiah said, “Let the ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord.” By glory Isaiah is referring to the coming of the Lord in glory. Therefore when it says here that the bowl was poured out “on the throne of the beast,” it shows that the impious tyranny of the antichrist will receive its end and that he will be mercifully taken away, while by the unexpected retribution of the accursed, darkness will seize all those who allowed themselves to become his subjects. For they will endure a darkness of their reason, becoming befuddled by what is happening. “And they gnawed their tongues in anguish,” it says. This often happens in the most serious of afflictions when people are wont to cut off their tongues or some other part of the body with their teeth, thinking that this will bring the tribulation to naught. And it is necessary that these themselves repent, if for no other reason than because of the destruction of the antichrist whom they chose to be their king and god. But they continue to blaspheme the true God because of the destruction of the wicked one.
