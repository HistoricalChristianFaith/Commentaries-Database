“The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.” He calls those “dead” who remained in unbelief. The Lord also spoke of these when he said, “Let the dead bury their own dead.” To be sure, the unbelievers did not live the reasonable life until the time of the incarnation, which is the thousand years, was completed. But after this they lived. How so? By the visitation and presence of the Holy Spirit. For then most of the Jews believed in Christ, as many as did not believe in him when he was living among them in the flesh. This was accomplished in a most divine manner, not as the human mind might have expected. For while in the Old Testament the Son was proclaimed and was made known through his incarnation and his many signs and wonders, the Holy Spirit was not yet clearly revealed to humankind. In the Old Testament there was only talk concerning him, as there was of the Son, but there was no manifest and perceptible activity, which especially leads people to faith. He was, however, perceived by those who progressed into the depths of the divine purpose, For to be sure, everything which is done and accomplished is produced by the Holy Trinity. The Lord establishes this clearly when he says somewhere, “The Father has given me commandment what to say and what to speak” and again, “I am able to do nothing from myself,” referring to whatever happens in the Trinity; and again from John, “The Son of man can do nothing from himself, unless he sees his Father doing it,” and somewhere he vigorously claims, “If I by the Spirit of God cast out demons.” Since, as we said, there was no perceptible activity of the Holy Spirit among humankind, it was determined by plan that virtually all people would receive faith in Christ by the presence and power of the Paraclete and of God the Father, so that it might be clearly evident to all that he also is of the same substance and of equal power with the Father and the Son. To be sure, we are given no information that during the time of the incarnation any more than 120 had come to faith. The Acts [of the Apostles] numbers those who had gathered together in the upper room to have been so many. But since the power of the Lord’s teaching had reached many, certainly the conviction concerning this coming of the Spirit would have been preserved [among them]. Just as when seed is scattered upon the ground and the rains come and the sun shines upon it, all the seeds that had remained hidden and concealed in the ground until this time now start to spring up and become visible, for they had been simply kept in the earth, so also did it happen at the visitation of the Holy Spirit. All those to whom the teaching of the Lord had been thrown [as seed] began to spring up unto faith. Therefore, it is said with greater accuracy in the Revelation, “the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended.”

“This is,” it says, “the first resurrection,” clearly that of faith. For the second resurrection will be the universal resurrection of the body. Therefore, “blessed is he who shares in the first resurrection!” For we will all take part in the second resurrection, even those who are unwilling. Upon those who share in the first resurrection, that is, upon the faithful, “the second death has no power.” What sort of death is this second death? Clearly it is that of sin and of the subsequent punishment. For just as he spoke of a first and a second resurrection, so also is there a first and a second death. The first death is physical and results in the separation of the soul and the body. The second death … is spiritual and is caused by sin. Of this death also the Lord spoke: “Do not fear those who kill the body; rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell.”
