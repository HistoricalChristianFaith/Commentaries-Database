If therefore you are partakers and companions of the heavenly calling, seek those things which are above, and let no one speak to you of the things here below; there is the reward, there is the recompense.
"The Apostle and High Priest." Coming into the administration [οἰκονομίαν], he speaks all the humble things freely. He calls him an Apostle because he is sent by the Father as a man. And of the confession of faith, "was faithful." He says that he has a favorable faith preserved towards the Father, and that he thinks the same about saving the people.
He says that he was made an Apostle and High Priest by the one who appointed him, that is, by his Father. There is nothing remarkable here if he speaks thus, once he takes hold of the administration.
"to the one who appointed him." What did he appoint? An Apostle and High Priest. Here he speaks not about essence, nor about divinity, but about human dignities [ἀξιωμάτων].
"just as Moses was faithful in all his house." He is about to set forth Christ according to the flesh, preferring Moses; but since these were also faithful towards whom the word was addressed, they still had great honors concerning Moses, so that they might not immediately close their ears, he does not immediately set forth Christ over Moses, but first equalizes, and then he proceeds to set forth. He called his people to his house. And he said to the people of Moses, because they are set against them. For God also says to him, "Your people have sinned." (Ex. 33:7)

"just as Moses;" so that it is in vain that those who are in rebellion against me say to you that he teaches from Moses, and that he is hostile towards him. But this is introduced secretly and not according to the previous discourse, in order to persuade more. For that which is prepared for defense is more suspicious.
"For this one has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses." Saying the equality of Christ with Moses, he now gently speaks of the superiority, "this one has been counted worthy of more." Who? The Christ understood according to the flesh, is deemed to have greater glory than Moses, insofar as he has greater honor than the house,
"For this one has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses, inasmuch as he who built the house has more honor than the house itself." Now he speaks of the ultimate superiority, and how great it is from God to man, and he says: Moses was faithful in all his house, that is, the people. But he himself was also of the house, and of the people. Therefore, the Christ according to the flesh is deemed worthy of so much greater glory than Moses, as much as, he says, he who built the house has more honor than the house itself. For he refers to the house here as the people along with Moses, since Moses was also one of the people; but Christ is the creator of the house.
