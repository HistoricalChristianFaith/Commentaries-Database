In an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance, and that does not fade away, reserved in heaven for you who are kept by the power of God through faith for salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time. In which you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials, that the genuineness of your faith, being much more precious than gold that perishes, though it is tested by fire, may be found in praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ, whom having not seen, you love. Though now you do not see Him, yet believing, you rejoice with joy, inexpressible and full of glory, receiving the end of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
If there is an inheritance in heaven, the restoration of things is magnificent in a thousand years.
"In which you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary." This is the order: affected by sorrow now, if necessary, that is, if this also should be (for not all saints are afflicted) at the end of time you will rejoice, for the present is accepted for the future. Or even through the present, as is declared in the following.
"In praise, honor." It signifies the reason why the righteous are afflicted through these things, while also comforting them, because through afflictions they become more manifest: and making them more diligent by adding:
at the revelation of Jesus Christ, at that time, through the demonstration of sufferings, a great nobility will be added to those who have competed. Moreover, he adds another thing that attracts to the endurance of afflictions. What is that?
"whom having not seen, you love." For if, when you do not see him with bodily eyes, you love him solely by hearing, he says, consider how great a love you will show when you see him, and that when he is manifested in glory: for if his passion has so attracted you, how much will his manifestation affect you with incredible splendor, when he will even grant you the salvation of souls as a reward? Therefore, in order that you may be known in such a way, also receiving such glory, show the briefest endurance in time, and you will have the highest goal of your purpose.
