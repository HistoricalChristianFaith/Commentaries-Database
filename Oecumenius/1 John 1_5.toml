And this is the promise that we have heard from Him; and we announce to you that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all.
Having said this, John resumes the conversation, explaining what the announcement he heard is: and he says that this is that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. And where did John hear it? From Christ Himself, who said: "I am the light of the world (Jn. 8:12);" and: "I came as light into the world." (Jn. 13:46) Light therefore is, and darkness is not in it. Spiritual light, however, stirs the eyes of our soul to its reception, turning away from all these material things, and urging solely towards its desire with loving affection. However, darkness signifies either ignorance or sin. In God, indeed, neither ignorance nor sin can be found. For these refer to material things and the structure that is found among us. If it has been said elsewhere: "Darkness has been placed as a hiding place for Him," (Ps. 17:12) it was nonetheless said "has been placed;" not, however, "he is darkness," as it was said, "God is light." For it is one thing that is placed by Him who places. Here, then, darkness signifies ignorance, which consists in the fact that God cannot be comprehended: and this is ours, not God's. Therefore, something is placed among those things that do not belong to anyone, nor for his own sake, but for someone else that concerns him. That he also calls darkness sin is evident from what has been said by the same in the Gospel. For what does John say there? "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it (Jn. 1:5);" by calling darkness our substance, which is subject to sins, in which he was made or by which he was assumed, he did not contract impurities from it: for he did no sin, etc.
