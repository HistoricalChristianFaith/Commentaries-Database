So the fifth salvation of the Lord given to the human race, the one which broke the fifth seal of the Lord and effected the removal of our sins and the restoration of our intimacy with God, was found in the bonds and wounds with which the Lord was held when he was brought before Pilate, and which he suffered at the hands of Pilate himself who showed a halfhearted reverence. Isaiah spoke about these wounds and said that when the Lord was asked by the divine messengers, “What are these wounds in the middle of your hands?” he said, “Those with which I was struck in the house by my beloved friend.” For these wounds healed our wounds, with which we were struck as we were going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when we fell among robbers, who stripped and wounded us, leaving us halfdead, according to Luke’s parable. 

But he has also undone our bonds, the cords of sin with which we were fast bound. For the prophet says, “The cords of sinners have ensnared me.” The Devil, then, was not aware that his wicked action was directed against himself, and that in his drunken violence against the Lord he was thrusting the sword into himself, as he fell out of his evilly created domain. 

After this, God’s people in the old covenant who had earlier on given their witness were as yet silent and recalled nothing as being of concern to them. All these things had not yet been done to Christ; for even though he had been spat upon and slapped and hit, these things were done in a corner in the illegitimate council of the high priests, where the only witnesses were the servants and those summoned to the council. But when they saw the Lord bound and publicly scourged by Pilate in the presence of all the people of the Jews, they rose up together and recalled the intolerable treatment of their master and of themselves. 

For, he says, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God, and for the church which they had. He says, “I saw the souls of the martyrs in the highest place, for they were under the altar which is above the heavens.” 

Then he says who these martyrs are—those who had been slain, he says, on behalf of the godly word of the old covenant and of the church, or synagogue, which they had. For martyrs do not die only for their own sakes, but they bring about a benefit for the whole community. For their courage becomes an encouragement for others, and the knowledge of God is built up by the blood of God’s people. 

And they were crying out, he says, with a loud voice saying, “How long, Master, holy and true, how long before you judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell upon earth?” They made their prayer not against human beings, but against the demons who make their home with mortal beings. For it was not the loving purpose of God’s people to rise up against their own kind, but against those who were urging human beings on to their destruction. 

After saying this they first receive white robes. This was the symbol of their cleansing by their own blood, and the removal of all pollution. 

Next they hear, Rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been: for it was not right that those who had shown the same courage as they had should be thwarted and lose their crowns of martyrdom by the premature destruction of the demons who were drilling them.
