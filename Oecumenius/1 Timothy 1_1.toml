HYPOTHESIS ON THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

Paul sends this letter from Laodicea; the motive of the letter is this: in Ephesus, some who were Judaizing attempted to teach different doctrines and deceive the more sincere ones under the pretext of the law. Having learned this, the apostle urges Timothy to remain there to correct them, and he writes the letter. First of all, he reminds Timothy, knowing the faith in Christ, teaching him about the law, to prevent those who speak contrary to the correct doctrine and to rebuke them. For he himself also handed over Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan so that they might be disciplined and not blaspheme, who had shipwrecked concerning the faith, to Satan so that they might be disciplined and not blaspheme. Having reminded Timothy of these things, Paul then ordains apostolic rules for him. First, concerning prayer, how, where, and for whom one ought to pray. Second, concerning the silence of women in the church, and that they should rather learn, and not teach. Third, concerning bishops, elders, and deacons, how and what kind those appointed ought to be. Fourth, concerning the widows in the church, from what age they should be counted, what kind they ought to be, and how they ought to be cared for. Fifth, concerning the moderation of the younger ones, and to marry rather, and not to live shamefully. Sixth, concerning commanding the rich not to be arrogant, nor to put their hope in wealth. Having arranged these matters, Paul is encouraged to teach them; and to not drink water, but to pay attention to himself and to the teaching, knowing that there will be times when some will depart from the faith. Having taught that foods are clean, and having commanded him to avoid quarrelsome disputes, as they are profane, on account of which some, boasting, have broken the faith; and finally, the manner in which one must rule and order, he completes the letter.

Although Paul had other disciples as well, such as Silas, Luke, and others, why does he write only to Timothy and Titus by name? And we might say that he had already entrusted these churches to their leadership but still kept the others with him. Paul writes to Timothy about what is proper for a teacher.

Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the command of God our Savior, and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope.

Paul still shows modesty now at the beginning when he says, I did not come on my own initiative, but was commissioned by God. But where was he commissioned? In the Acts of the Apostles, where the Spirit says, "Set apart for me Saul and Barnabas," (Acts 13:2) and there the Lord says to him, "I am sending you far to the Gentiles." (Acts 22:21) But whatever the Son or the Spirit commanded, he says the Father commanded these things. For it is the will of the Holy Trinity.

and of the Lord Jesus Christ, our hope. The apostles say that we suffer much, but we have God as our Savior, and Christ as the Savior of our hope. For the term "Savior" is to be understood commonly. For He Himself provides, they say, the hope that we will be saved.
