"Who in the days of his flesh." Therefore, he did not he say the days of the flesh, in which the Lord visibly lived on earth, as if he had now left the flesh itself. Far from it! For he has it, although incorruptible: but he calls the days of the flesh, that is, the days in which his life, which was in the flesh, lived.

"prayers and supplications." Not only prayers and supplications, but also he offered them with cries and tears. However, Paul said that he was lowering himself to save them.
"and he was heard." So much was he heard that he even rose again: this he said because of the weakness of the listeners, who had not yet conceived a glorious opinion of Christ.
"because of his reverent submission." He said that he was heard not only out of the grace of the Father but also because of his own reverence. For his reverence was so great, he said, that the Father also revered him. However, there is a double reason for these humble words, namely the flesh and the weakness of the listeners.
"Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered." Therefore, he says, He was so obedient (and He obeyed as is fitting for a Son to the Father) that after He was incarnate, He even endured the cross to death. "And He learned from what He suffered." He indeed says, What is death, being God? For what has God not known? But also from what he suffered, he learned. Not only, he says, as he was God, but also as he was man, having experienced death.
In another way.

Two things are sought here, one, how it is said that he was heard, and yet he himself needed to pass by death, but he did not pass by. For he was indeed crucified and died. Secondly, from what kind of reverence does he say he was heard? And thirdly, although being the Son, to whom is he to be joined? To the one who was heard from reverence, or to those that follow, so that he may learn obedience from what he suffered, although being the Son. For there is not a small difference between these. As for the first, it is clear that the request was not one, but a certain double one: one rejecting death, the other requesting it. For he also says in the same prayer and supplication: "But let not my will be done, but yours." (Luke 22:42)
And to clarify this more clearly, John says that the Son asks, saying, "Father, glorify Your Son, that Your Son may also glorify You," (Jn. 17:1) referring to the glory of the cross and death as he indicates. Thus, the divine Paul rightly says, "He was heard." And this, from reverence, has come close to what has been said about being made clear. For we have mentioned two requests, one for the avoidance of death, the other for the acceptance of what was truly a matter of great reverence; "But not my will, but Yours." (Luke 22:42) Therefore, Christ was heard, not from the avoidance, but from the reverence, that is, that request of His came forth, not according to the avoidance, but according to the reverence.
For this reason, he says, and having been made perfect, that is, having been fully recognized through sufferings and the cross and death, he is exceedingly good and generous. This was also indicated above; speaking of prayers and supplications, he hinted at the duality of the request. Then, having spoken of prayers and supplications, he did not bring about the passing of death, but rather, towards the one who was able to save him from death, adding this well and wisely, so that when you contemplate him being crucified and buried, you should not think that he was held back by the power of the Father, but that it was a common will for Christ to suffer these things for the salvation of the world. This can also be said in relation to the resurrection. For in many places, the divine Paul, speaking, says that the Father raised Christ. Therefore, having raised him, he delivered him from death and saved him. But thus, in my opinion, these things are.
As for the statement, "Although he was a Son," if anyone were to take it in an extraordinary way (for the use of this is infinite to the divine Paul), the thought would be naturally advanced as follows: that in the days of his flesh, although he was a Son, he offered prayers and supplications, and moreover, that is, though having the greatest privilege as a Son, to do all things without supplication and request by the sovereign will, as the Father does, nevertheless, since he was in the days of the flesh, he offered prayers and supplications. It can also be accordingly connected with, "and he was heard because of his reverent submission," as if he were saying, "He was heard," although he was a Son, and did not need to be heard, having a will in harmony with the Father's will, and being fulfilled without any request.
If you connect it with what follows, the mind will benefit. But first, what does it mean to consider that He learned obedience from what He suffered? For He learned to obey the Father from what He suffered, and through experience, He gained knowledge of being subject to Him; or rather, He learned through experience the extent of obedience, how much He obeyed the Father, such as being crucified and dying, and rising again, and lifting up the human nature at the right hand of the Father, and saving humanity? For these things are from that obedience which was generated in saying, "Father, glorify Your Son." (Jn. 17:1) For this obedience, however great and however much, before obeying the Father, Christ knew as Son and God, just as the Father did; and having been heard, He learned it through what He suffered and experienced. Therefore, as someone might grasp, my second interpretation seems more likely. Thus, it has no uncertainty in saying, "Although He was a Son."

“And having been made perfected.” This then is perfection among men, to attain perfection through sufferings. And he has spoken all things becoming of a man, behold, also becoming of God;
“he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him.” That is, not only was he himself saved, but he also brought salvation to others; and not temporary, derived from wars, but eternal. To whom is this? To those who obey. How then do you disobey and risk falling away from the grace? Do you see that the whole argument is thus shaped because of the faint-heartedness of the hearers? But look here, how exalted it is! For he says he became the cause of salvation; which belongs to divinity; for no one else is the cause of such salvation except God.
“being designated by God a High Priest.” And having been made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him." Therefore, this is perfection in humans, that through sufferings they attain completeness. And He has said everything fitting for a human. "the source of eternal salvation."

Behold also that which responds to divinity.
