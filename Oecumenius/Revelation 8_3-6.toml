He calls the altar a censer as being receptive of incense. When Christ appears, the prayers of the saints, like some firstfruit and honored primal offering, are brought to him by our guardian angels, prayers which are naturally sweet-smelling, but which become sweeter-smelling with the cooperation of the holy angels. That is why it is said, He was given much incense. It was clearly God’s gift to the angels to protect human beings and to make their prayers acceptable. Those who received the incense give the sweet odor for the prayers of the saints. 

He says, And the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel. You see that it is by the angel that the prayers of the saints became sweeter-smelling and worthy to be carried up before God. 

Then he says that the divine angel took the censer and filled it with divine fire and threw it on the earth; and there were loud noises, peals of thunder, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake. Perhaps one of the angels threw some of this divine fire onto Mount Sinai, “and there were thunders and loud noises and trumpets and lightnings, and the mountain was wrapped in smoke” when God visited it. Just as the thunders and the terrors went forth then, so now these things preceded the glorious coming of the Lord. 

Then the angels, too, blew their trumpets, signifying the coming of God. For at that time, too, the trumpets sounded loudly.
