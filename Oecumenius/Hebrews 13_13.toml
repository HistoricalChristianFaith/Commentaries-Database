"Let us then go to him outside." Since Christ suffered outside the gate, let us go out to Him outside the camp, that is, outside the world, bearing nothing worldly, neither earthly nor carrying the filth of the earth. This, outside the gate, that is, outside the world, bearing His reproach, that is, suffering the same things as He did, if He should ask; for this indicates, bearing the reproach he endured, which He Himself endured through both the mockeries and the scorn.

It seems that the divine Paul, outside the camp, outside the world, speaks; for he takes us out of worldly life.
