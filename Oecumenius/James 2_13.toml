If we forgive others the sins which they have committed against us and give alms to the poor and needy among us, then God’s mercy will deliver us from judgment. But if, on the other hand, we are not well-disposed toward those around us, we shall receive the condemnation handed out to the wicked servant, along with the retribution which is mentioned in the Lord’s Prayer. For there we ask God to forgive us as we forgive those who have sinned against us, but if we do not forgive them, we shall not be forgiven either.
