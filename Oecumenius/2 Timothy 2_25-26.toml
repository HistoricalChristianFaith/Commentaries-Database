Correcting challengers with gentleness, in the hope that God may grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth, and that they may come to their senses and escape the Devil's snare, having been captured by him to do his will.

correcting challengers with gentleness. For this is most necessary. For often he who has been given advice ten times and has not listened will obey another who gives advice once, clearly the first ten counselors are working against their own interest.

that God may grant them repentance. And if it happens, Paul says, it is the work of God, not only of your gentleness. He suppresses the mindset of the teachers, leading the matter up to God.

and that they may come to their senses and escape the Devil's snare. But what is the knowledge of the truth? It is to recover from the Devil and from false doctrines, toward the truth of faith. See how, as from drunkenness or madness, Paul said they recover from the Devil's snare. For just as a little bird, even if caught by the tip of its foot, is still under the snare beneath it; so also we, even if we stray slightly from the doctrine, are caught under the Devil's snare.

having been captured by him. Being revived while captured, that is, being seized and confined by error to the will of the Devil. For those who are led astray by evil doctrines, having been seized to the Devil's own will, are held by the Devil.

Prophecy of abundant human wickedness, through reprehensible deceit.
