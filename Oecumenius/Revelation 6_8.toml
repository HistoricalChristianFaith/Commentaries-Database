When this happened, at the summons of the fourth holy creature a pale horse came out and its rider’s name was Death, and hades followed him. And there was given to them authority over a fourth of the earth. The pale horse is symbolic of wrath, for pale is the color of gall and is so named by physicians. Death and hades were sent to wage spiritual warfare against the wicked demons and to exact vengeance for the destruction of humankind. But since, according to the logic of the vision, the salvific passion of Christ through which he paid for all our sins had not yet happened, the complete destruction of the demons had not yet been effected, but at that time only a fourth part. And this destruction he figuratively calls a “slaughter” and a “famine” brought on those who long ago worshiped them, and “death,” revealing the end of their tyranny through death, and “destruction” by the beasts of the earth. For he calls the passions of arrogance and vainglory among the demons “beasts of the earth,” which, as they are cast out of their dominion over people, consume and devour them, since they are earthly and as it were revel in the muddied passions of the earth, although they had received incorporeal natures.
