"Therefore, strengthen your limp hands." Limp, loosened. He spoke of the whole by mentioning a part. For not only the hands and knees were loosened by afflictions, but together with the whole body, both mind and soul. Indeed, this is caused by deep sadness and sorrow.

However, he did not speak of the knees and hands, but of the thoughts that limp and are loosened by a multitude of afflictions and temptations.

"and make straight paths for your feet," or "and make straight paths for your footprints": as if speaking to the runners and boxers themselves. He indicates, however, that it is necessary for thoughts to be confirmed (which arise not from hatred, but from God's governance, corrections, and afflictions) and thoughts about faith and doctrines. For when they were still infants, they clung to certain Jewish matters in life and conduct. Let not the initiated evil (for this he calls a limp) become incurable, but rather let it be corrected. Behold, he has clearly admitted repentance, and take note of this because of the Novatians.
"Pursue peace with all." And among you mutually and among the slanderers. For there is great range when it is said, with all. Indeed, "With those," he says, "who hated peace, I was peaceful." (Ps. 120:7) For if indeed he injures, and you do not take revenge, peace will quickly be achieved.
"and the holiness." Holiness refers to purity, that is, virginity or chastity. For even one who is chaste in marriage fulfills holiness, although not properly. For marriage is not called holy, but honorable, even so, it accomplishes holiness.
"without which no one will see the Lord." For if neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor those like them will inherit the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 6:9), how will they see the Lord who are not chaste, as it is necessary to see, without holiness?
"See to it that no one fails to obtain." Just as those walking a long road in company, considering, he says, this is diligently looking ahead and analyzing, so that nobody fails to obtain the grace of God. For it is necessary to take care both for yourselves and for your brothers, that no one lacks these things. Moreover, he calls the grace of God the future goods, whether faith or a suitable way of life. For all these things are the grace of God.
"that no root of bitterness springs up." The root of bitterness refers to sin. Therefore, he says: If there is anyone among you who is not rightly affected, let such a one be cut off, lest sin be brought forth into action (for this is what he means by “springs up”), lest it also become an occasion of sin for the others.
He says: "and by it many become defiled." Indeed, when someone sees a neighbor sinning, he will come to imitation, so that he himself may sin. He rightly called the root of bitterness, sin. For the bitter root can produce sweet fruits, but the root of bitterness is bitter to itself and to those to whom it is a root: for the root of bitterness is substance and, as it were, essence.
"that no one is sexually immoral." He did not say sexually immoral, referring to Esau, but it is placed in opposition to what preceded, "Pursue holiness." The defiled is indeed placed as if it refers to Esau; however, he called him a glutton, because he had sold away God's gift, namely the birthright, for a single meal. For it is written in the book of Genesis: "And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field: but Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob. And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came from the field, and he was faint: and Esau said to Jacob, 'Feed me, I beg you, with that same red pottage; for I am weak.' Therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said, 'Sell me this day your birthright.' And Esau said, 'Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?' And Jacob said, 'Swear to me this day.' And he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob." (Gen. 25:26-33) Therefore, at that time, the right of the firstborn is ours, and not that of the Jews. For we are descended from Isaac and Jacob.
"he was rejected." He was rejected by God. For God is the cause of Isaac being deceived, to bless Jacob.

"though he sought it with tears." Some interpret it this way: Although he had sought it with tears, namely the blessing: and what is said: and there was no place found by means of repentance for him.

"though he sought it." Does he therefore reject repentance? Certainly not. How then, if he sought repentance with tears, did he not attain it? He did seek it, but he did not find it; for he did not seek it rightly. How so? Because he was not properly repentant. For what kind of words of repentance did he speak? "The days of mourning for my father are approaching, and I will kill my brother Jacob." (Gen. 27:41) Therefore, for this reason, he does not find repentance, because he did not seek it as he ought. Either this is the case, or Paul terrifies those who have not yet fallen so that they do not fall, as if the greatest sins do not deserve repentance: and to those who have not yet sinned, he speaks in such a way, preserving them from falling by fear. But when he sees that some have completely fallen, consider how he changes his speech. For Paul says: "My little children, for whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you." (Gal. 4:19) For that he writes this to those who have already fallen is evident. For he says: "You who are justified by the law have fallen from grace." (Gal. 5:4) You see that when he testifies with them that they have fallen, lest they come to despair, he says: "Of whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you?" (Gal. 4:19) Do you not recognize that he does not reject this holy repentance, but is speaking in an economical manner [οἰκονομικῶς]?
