And whosoever shall keep the whole Law, but offends in one: is made guilty of all. For he that said, You shall not commit adultery, said also, You shall not kill. And if you do not commit adultery, but shall kill: you are made a transgressor of the Law. So speak, and so do, as beginning to be judged by the law of liberty. For judgment without mercy to him that has not done mercy. And mercy exalts itself above judgment.
"but offends in one." James said this concerning love, for the sake of which he also discussed all the preceding discourse at greater length for the sake of proof. But he said, "You shall not commit adultery, you shall not kill," for example. Consider, however, that the examples are from the law, insofar as it contributed to love. For he who loves his neighbor perfectly will neither commit adultery nor kill. For these are his who is affected with a hostile spirit towards his neighbor. Since it would not be said in this way, no one among men would be saved, since no one keeps the integrity of the commandments in all things. For he who has preserved chastity for the sake of the word has sometimes been overcome by anger; and he who is adorned with almsgiving has perhaps been obscured by envy. Therefore, it is not said of anyone who has no defect in virtues, but of love, that it should not be attained with defect due to respect for persons, but wholly. However, we also speak of these virtues. For one who has not perfectly adhered to modest or just matters, for example, but has used them with a deficiency, here, staggering in dealing with virtues, has been corrupted in the whole body of virtue. The law must therefore be understood as dealing with love, which is its chief aim. But the law of freedom says that it is without regard to persons: this is the law of Christ. For he who respects persons is not free, but a slave: “For by whom anyone is overcome, to him he is also enslaved." (2 Peter 2:19)
"For judgment without mercy to him that has not done mercy." If we have forgiven our neighbors the sins they have committed against us, and have made the needy among us sharers in our alms, then God’s mercy will deliver us from judgment. God will also welcome the merciful. Indeed, it is a remarkable deed, just as on the other hand, a serious condemnation will be for those who have not been well and piously disposed towards the people of their own class. For those who remain unmoved by any feeling of sympathy towards their neighbors who have wronged them, the condemnation of the evil servant will embrace them, together with the retribution that the Lord's Prayer designates. For there we ask God to forgive us as we forgive those who have sinned against us. And those who are hard-hearted, moved by no feeling of mercy towards those who lack bodily comfort, will also receive judgment without mercy according to the present discourse.
“mercy exalts itself above judgment.” For the merciful shall obtain mercy, according to the judgment of the Lord. (Matt. 5:7) Furthermore, if in an idolater's mercy towards the poor he can erase sins, as we learned in Daniel (Dan. 4:24), what would he not do in faithful men? But this mercy seems to me to accomplish something like this oil from the manna trees, anointed on athletes. For this enables them to escape, lest they be held by their adversaries: and so also in the universal judgment our mercy towards the needy will enable them to escape the attacks and dangers which will threaten us from the demons who accuse us. In another way.
“judgment without mercy.” The cause of restitution is against those who have shown pride and arrogance with great cruelty towards the lower classes with respect to persons. Therefore, it softens their cruelty and hardness, with this terrifying sentence, as if it were saying: The law commands you to love your neighbor as yourself: just as no one regards a person with respect to themselves (for that would be insane), so neither should you regard a person. But if, out of arrogance and hardness, you deviate towards respect for persons, fear that in some way you too might receive similar treatment from a just judge, and exclude from yourself that mercy: for judgment without mercy, etc.
“And mercy exalts itself above judgment.” That is, it conquers, subdues, dulls, or blunts.
