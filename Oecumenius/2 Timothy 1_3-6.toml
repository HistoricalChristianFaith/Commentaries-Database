I give thanks to God, whom I have served from my ancestors with a pure conscience, that I unceasingly remember you in my prayers day and night, longing to see you, mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy; taking reminder of the sincere faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am persuaded that it is also in you. For this reason, I remind you to rekindle the gift of God that is in you through the laying on of my hands.

Do you see the excess of love? Paul says, I thank God that I remember you. This is love, when someone takes pride in loving someone.

with a pure conscience. How is it in a pure conscience? Where Paul originally was ignorant of Christ? They show that he was conscious of nothing evil in himself. For even if he persecuted, he persecuted out of zeal, and not according to human reasoning, like many who do so for glory, forming heresy; those who are conscious know great corruption. And he presents himself well, so that he may also show that his love for Timothy is genuine, and not receive the reputation of being unloving, not having gone to him, and promising these things.

unceasingly remember you. Not just unceasingly remember you, but “In my prayers." Not in a common way, Paul says, as I remember, but in prayers, both night and day.

longing to see you. Therefore, I did not voluntarily deprive myself of such great pleasure. You are truly worthy to be loved, both because of your tears and because of your faith and that of your ancestors. But notice that at the beginning Paul does not want to sadden Timothy as if he were not coming, but rather gives hope of seeing him: near the end, however, he implies that he will no longer see him in the flesh, saying: "For I am already being sacrificed, or offered." (2 Tim. 4:6) But here is the order: I have grace from God because I remember you, desiring to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. Then what is left in the middle: "mindful of your tears." Afterwards, lest it seem rash to love, Paul also adds the reason.

mindful, Paul says, of your tears. For perhaps, being separated from Paul, Timothy was so distressed as even to weep. But the exceeding, "longing to see you so that I may be filled with joy," as if the mere sight alone were sufficient to fill me with joy.

reminder of the sincere faith. I remembered you, Paul says, in my prayers, recalling both your tears and your sincere faith.

first in your grandmother. Another praise: that the lineage on the grandmother's side was not from Greeks, but from Jews who believed in Christ. And his father, being a Greek, was circumcised because of the fear of the Jews.

and your mother. The praises of our ancestors, when we also partake in them, come to our glory: but if we are alienated from them, they condemn us more: however, this one was a partaker.

and I am persuaded that it is also in you. Therefore, you rightly have this as sincere, since it is established from above and cannot be shaken.

For this reason. Since I am conscious of these things, Paul says.

you to rekindle the gift of God.  Timothy had received the spiritual gift, and Paul urges that it be carried out with readiness of mind, attention, and vigilance more vehemently and effectively. For the opposites of these make it relaxed, as it is said elsewhere: "Do not extinguish the Spirit." (1 Thess. 5:19)

through the laying on of my hands. For as soon as Paul laid his hands on Timothy, appointing him bishop, a gift also came upon Timothy for the working of signs, for teaching, and for presiding over the Church.
