Speaking of the bare Word [λόγου] of God, He came into humanity, lest they be overwhelmed by the sublimity of what has been said. By Himself, Paul says, that is, He did not send another minister, but worked the purification by Himself, through His cross and death, when He had freed us from sins in baptism.
"of majesty”, that is, of the Father. For after the remission of sins was first made, He sat down at the right hand of God with His flesh.
"on high." Above all, he says, he ascends to the paternal throne. However, these signify consubstantiality [ὁμοούσιον].
"having become so much superior to the angels." The discourse is about the privilege itself. For His flesh was made: for the Word of God is not made, but begotten. Therefore, His flesh is so much more excellent than the angels, as can be known from the excellence of the names.

Or what is said to be Generated [Γενόμενος], do not take it concerning the flesh, lest you think it to be divided from this: but concerning Christ, who is worshiped in one essence [ὑποστάσει] even with His flesh. For where it has once touched what pertains to the privilege, it speaks of humble things without fear.

"he has inherited a more excellent name." For the Son, having a name from the beginning, the Word, and after the flesh, He possessed it. Therefore, it is rightly said, "he has inherited," as through the incarnation. He has been called Christ. To say of Christ that he has acquired it by hereditary right means that he has obtained that which he had already possessed long ago.

The inheritance primarily belongs to those who are entitled, but not to those who are alienated. Thus, what was fitting for the heavenly Word was received below through the flesh that was also assumed. But what is that? The Son, of the God of all, who is also the Father of that flesh, is to say, "I have begotten you." (Ps. 2:7) What he says: "today" is not a sign of time, but that the Father has never been separated from the legitimate paternal relationship that He has with the Son.
But if he were to say: I have always been affected towards you in this way: not as if a generation has come, but that it may always persist and continuously derive a beginning, with no end. Indeed, consider whether it may be adapted in such a way that both are indeed said of Christ, namely, "You are my Son," and "Today I have begotten you" (Ps. 2:7): but that, "You are my Son," insofar as He is the Word: for it signifies His eternal birth; whereas "Today I have begotten you" refers to the flesh: for it designates a recent birth. For He was born by the good pleasure of the Father."The Holy Spirit,” said the angel, “will come upon you”; and then also: “The power of the Most High will overshadow you." (Luke 1:35)
