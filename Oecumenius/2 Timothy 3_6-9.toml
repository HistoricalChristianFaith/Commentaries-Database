For from these are those who enter into households and lead captive young women burdened with sins, who are driven by various lusts: always learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth. Just as Jannes and Jambres resisted Moses, so do these also resist the truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, but they will progress no further. For their folly will be evident to all, as was that of those men.

Behold, all their secret and shameless plotting was revealed by the saying, those who enter into households and lead captive young women burdened with sins. Do you see that they have been deceived by the Serpent's deceit, which he used against Adam? For it was likely that he also deceived these men through the women. But by calling them mere women, he only revealed what is easily deceived. Therefore, the one being deceived, even if he is a man, differs in no way from a woman in this respect. But the multitude, accumulated with sins, also shows the confusion of sins. For it is not simply, Paul says, that women deceive (for there are also women of a courageous nature, just as there are men of a weak nature), but the sins accumulated, for from these come also the acts of deceit.

who are driven by various lusts. Paul did not blame nature, but such a woman. Here he encountered many lusts. Both bodily and mental. And see also the phrase "driven," as if towards irrational beings.

always learning. Not excusing them for these things, but rather strongly blaming them. For since they have heaped up sins for themselves, their mind has naturally become hardened because of them.

Jannes and Jambres. These were the magicians of Pharaoh. But how does one know their names when Scripture does not say? We say that it was from unwritten tradition; it was likely from the Holy Spirit that Paul knew.

so do these also resist the truth. To the true faith.

men corrupted in mind, reprobate concerning the faith, but they will progress no further. When someone's mind is corrupted by passions, then they become unreliable regarding faith. How could they advance in wickedness without saying "they will advance"? Here it says, "they will progress no further." There it says that once they begin to wander, they will not stand anywhere, but will always devise something worse; here, however, it says that they will neither deceive nor seize many of the prudent.

— [OECUMENIUS] For Paul said beforehand, "Wandering and being led astray." (2 Tim. 3:13) Therefore, the power lies with those who are not easily deceived. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 181r; B f. 219r; G f. 308r] —

For their folly will be evident to all. Where does this come from? "From ancient times," Paul says, "be assured. For wickedness is easily exposed."

In another way. If you are unbelieving, learn from what happened to those magicians (Jannes and Jambres). For even they were exposed as performing illusions and deceiving, when Moses truly performed wonders, so that all things of deceit flourish only for a time.

Encouragement to imitate them in opposition to the wicked, in the patience of God.
