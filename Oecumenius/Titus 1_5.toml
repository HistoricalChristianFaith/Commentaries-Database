For this reason I left you in Crete, that you might put in order what was left unfinished, and appoint elders in every city as I directed you.

You see them as distributing the inhabited world like one house, and each doing something; but look at the athlete of Christ. Where there was danger, Paul himself was present; but when some honor was about to come, he sent the disciples. For Paul had left Titus to appoint bishops in each city, since he had first made him a bishop. And see, he is not ashamed to write to the disciple, saying, "put in order what was left unfinished." For Paul was looking to this one thing alone, namely the salvation of all.
