I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments.

I have sent Tychicus. See the unity through all things.

Bring the cloak that I left. Here Paul mentions a certain garment. However, he seeks to ensure that he is not a burden to anyone in need. For this is of the greatest concern to him everywhere.

— [CHRYSOSTOM] In another way. Here the type of clothing is mentioned. Some indeed want it to signify a case in which little books were kept. But what necessity was there for the little books themselves, for one who was soon to depart to God? Certainly, then it was especially necessary to entrust them to the faithful, and for them to have those as their own teaching. Indeed, he was seeking a case so that he would not need to receive it from others. [end of the excerpt by Chrysostom] —

— [THEODORET] especially the parchments. The term "parchments," more commonly known in Roman usage as "scrolls" [εἶλητα], was used moderately according to the custom in Rome, from which Paul was indeed writing the Epistle.  For the ancient Scriptures were contained in scrolls, just as the Jews still mostly possess them up to the present day. [end of the excerpt by Theodoret] —

He referred to books [βιβλία] in a general sense, so that Paul might also have books in another form or format.

especially the parchments. Perhaps, however, these contained certain more useful things within themselves. Nevertheless, those worthy of laughter are those who think that the Apostle here meant a cloak rather than a type of booklet, who did not pay attention to the sequence of letters. For it would have been needless to say: "And books," even if that had been a type of booklet, since it could have been indicated together with others.
