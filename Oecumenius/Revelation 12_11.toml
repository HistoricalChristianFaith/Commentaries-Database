And they say that they resisted him on equal terms, having overcome the one who seemed invincible, as if daring even against God. They triumphed by employing a collaborator and helper in the precious blood of Christ, and by the word of the testimony given for Him, which they preferred over their own lives. Having therefore prevailed, all the angels of God rejoice, having been freed from the bitter region of Satan.
