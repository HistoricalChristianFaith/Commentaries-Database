"But He, having offered one sacrifice," Christ evidently.
"for sins." For our sins, for which he suffered.
"for all time." Christ, clearly, offered one sacrifice, namely, His own body, for our sins, sufficient for us forever, so that there would be no need for a second.
"sat down at the right hand of God."He is not only a high priest, but also God. After completing the work, through which He also became a high priest and stewarded the administration, He sat down as God and awaits.
"from that time onward." And for what reason were his enemies not immediately placed under his feet? For the sake of those who are to become and give birth to believers. For not only demons are enemies, but also unbelievers.But now Paul especially calls the unbelieving Hebrews enemies, comforting the faithful from the Jews who have suffered countless terrible things at their hands.
"until His enemies be made." He did not say "they will be subjected," but signifying the greatest of subjection, he said "they be made," a footstool for his feet. For their being made as a footstool is a proof of his sitting at the right hand of the Father.
"For by one offering," which Christ offered, he perfected, having made perfect, he completely freed from sins.
"those who are being sanctified."That is, the faithful. For they are sanctified by the aforementioned offering.
"And the Holy Spirit also testifies to us." What does it bear witness to? That our sins have been forgiven.
"And their sins." He added, he says, "And their sins I will remember no more." Do you see that he testified to the forgiveness of sins? Then he forgave when he established the new covenant. And the new covenant was given through the sacrifice of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.
"Now where there is forgiveness of these things." Of sins, obviously.
"there is no longer an offering for sin." For who, he says, has need of many offerings, when the one that Christ presented is sufficient to take away sins?
