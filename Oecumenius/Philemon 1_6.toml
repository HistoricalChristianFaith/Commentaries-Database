"that the fellowship of your faith". It unites him to himself, just as if he said: Fellowship of faith is that which makes one and common. But why do you give thanks to God? So "that the" "fellowship of your faith", he says, "may become effective". But how will it be effective? If it proceeds to every work of virtue. Blessed Paul interprets himself. But how will it be "effective"? By this, that you have "the knowledge" and accomplish "every good thing".

"that is in us". He says that which is now also in us. (Matt. 25:40)

"for Christ Jesus". For whoever does good to someone, does it to Christ, especially to the saints.
