"By faith they passed through the Red Sea." Indeed, they believed that they would pass through, and they did pass through. Such is the power of faith, that it makes possible even those things that are impossible.
"but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same." For perhaps they suspected that the sea was land, and they also tried to pass through, but their destruction showed that it was truly the sea, and not some kind of illusion.
