Until now the vision has explained to us how and by what manner of plagues that upon the earth and in heaven and humankind together with them shall be brought to completion or will be changed. But now, since the consummation has already occurred and the resurrection has been effected, the vision indicates the punishment of sinners. “I saw a star fallen from heaven to the earth,” calling an angel of God a “star” because it descends to the earth with brightness. For the judgment of sinners will be on the earth, which was called the “valley of Jehoshaphat” by one of the holy prophets. “And he was given,” it says, “the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit.” He calls Gehenna “the shaft of the bottomless pit.”
