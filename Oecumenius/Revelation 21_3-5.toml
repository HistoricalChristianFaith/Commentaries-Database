Was I not right in saying earlier on that the vision figuratively calls the lot of the saints and their residence there the spiritual Jerusalem? See, it has now disclosed the symbolism, saying, See, the dwelling of God is with human beings. He will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. The apostle made this clearer when he said, “Then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and we shall always be with the Lord.” 

He says, He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. Isaiah the prophet said something like this, saying, “In his might he has swallowed up death for ever, and God has again removed every tear from every face.” For if, according to the divine apostle, “pain and grief and sighing have gone away” in that blessed life of the saints, what will be left to cry over, once these have gone? 

He says, The former things have passed away: he means that the suffering of the saints has come to an end. Now they are receiving the reward of their labors. 

He says, See, I am making all things new: for if the heaven and earth and sea are new, human beings also are new, and their joy and glory are new, now no longer afflicted by tears or grief or disgrace, since everything will be new. 

“Do not think, John,” he says, “that what has been said and shown to you is imaginary or false because of its exceedingly wide scope. Everything is trustworthy and true. So write them down.”
