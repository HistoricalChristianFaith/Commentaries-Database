The very thing which Paul said—“I am already on the point of being sacrificed, the time of my departure is at hand” —he himself is now saying: “I who am teaching these things,” he says, “and who solemnly testify to them, am henceforth at the end of this present life, so that no one should be left with any suspicion of the truth of the account.” 

For who would ever choose, and certainly not the great John, to fabricate words as coming from God, as though he was not to undergo the death common to us all and to depart into God’s hands more evidently than those who are still among the living? Therefore, he says, “I am writing these things,” all but saying to Christ, who calls me to be transformed, Yes, I am coming soon. 

Since, earlier on, the prophetic Spirit said to him, Let him who hears say to the Lord, “Come,” in obedience to his command he says, Amen. Come, Lord Jesus, as if he said, “Yes, master, Christ, hasten for us the salvation of your second coming.”
