[John] says here what Paul also said, “For I am already on the point of being sacrificed, and the time of my departure has come.” I am he who teaches these things, he says, and I who am finally at the end of this life bears witness to them so that no one will forsake the word through doubt.… I write these things all but speaking to Christ who is calling me to a change of place, “I am coming soon!”
