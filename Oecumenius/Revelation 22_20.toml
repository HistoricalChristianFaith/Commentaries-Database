Which Paul made when he said, "for I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure has come" (2 Tim. 4:6); this he himself now says also, he who teaches these things, I say and bear witness in them, and so I am from now at the ends of the present life, that the word may be left in suspicion by no one.

For who would choose among those who happen to be, if not then John so great, to devise words as from God, insofar as he was not yet about to undergo common death, and to depart into the hands of God more obviously than those who were formerly still living? I therefore write these things, saying alone to the one who calls me Christ regarding my departure, Yes: I come quickly.

Since in the cases that have occurred the prophetic Spirit said to him, and the hearer says, "Tell the Lord, 'Come,'" obeying the things revealed to him, he says, "Amen: Come, Lord Jesus"; therefore he used to say, "Yes, Master Christ, hasten for us your salvation and your second coming."
