He says, I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?" No one, he says, is worthy, O most divine angel, to speak to it, except the God who became man, who took away sin, "having wiped out the handwriting that was against us," (Col. 2:14) and by his own obedience healed our disobedience (Rom. 5:19).
