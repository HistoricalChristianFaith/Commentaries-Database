He says, but I have this against you, that you have abandoned your first love. Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent, and do the works you did at first in righteousness. As he says, "your good deeds have not escaped me," (Job. 34:21) likewise, you have not ceased your love for those in need. Therefore, return to the previous kindness taught by me, which you have neglected. He said, "See that you do not turn back from where you have gone out."

The coming to you does not indicate a transitional movement, since God fills all things, but rather a turning as if from patience to punishment. The removal of the lampstand, or rather the church, he says is its own abandonment which occurs against those who sin; in everything, they are thrown into confusion and turmoil, as it is also said: "My eye has been troubled in my anger; and my heart within me was troubled." (Ps. 30:10; 54:4)
