From there, the seven angels, he says, came out. For where else should the heavenly ministers of God be seen as coming forth but from the heavenly temple?

And he says they had in their hands seven plagues which they would pour out upon the earth. For many signs will occur on the earth in the time of the end; of these even Christ recalled in the Gospels, teaching concerning the end (Mark 13).

But that the angels are clothed in a bright, pure stone turns out to be a sign of their honor and of a nature that is pure and luminous and steadfastly inclined toward the good, if indeed they were clothed with Christ. For the Lord is called a stone by divine Scripture, as by Isaiah: "Behold, I lay in Zion a precious, chosen stone in the foundations" (Isa. 28:16); and by the prophet: "The stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner." (Ps. 118:22) That the stone be put on, and the wisest Paul exhorts us likewise: to "put on our" stone "Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the desires of the flesh" (Rom. 13:14); for he who has put this on is outside all soul-destroying desires. And as for those living, their practical matters and stability are hinted at; for it has been said concerning them that, "they are mighty, doing His word with strength."
