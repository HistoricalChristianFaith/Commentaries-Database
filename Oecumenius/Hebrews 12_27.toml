"as of things that are made," that is, those suffering according to nature. For since it takes a beginning and reaches an end, he says, as of things that are made. For since it has been made, and it began from motion, that which comes from non-being to being will reasonably be shaken and moved again in the change.
"so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain." The creation shakes and alternates, so that the unshakable may remain; that is, those that will no longer be shaken or changed; as if it were saying: Therefore, it shakes and alternates the creation, so that in the future the unshakable may remain in its place, no longer subject to shaking or changing. The unchanging, therefore, rightly will no longer be subject to shaking. For once it has received the first change, it will be incorruptible.
