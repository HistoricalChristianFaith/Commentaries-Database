Knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience; but let patience have its perfect work, that your work may be perfect and complete, lacking nothing.
Testing, James says, that which is searched, that which is received, that which is pure: as it is written: “tried in the fire, purified in the earth." (Ps. 11:7) But how does testing produce patience? Because that faith is proven to be pure, which is perfected through patience and endurance of the conditions inflicted. For it is the work of a truly faithful person to receive such desires with patience and thanksgiving: just as Job behaved, who gave thanks in all things (Job 1:1).
"that your work may be perfect." James did not definitively say patience, that it has a perfect work, but imperatively, let [patience] have. For he does not preach that virtue which preceded it, but that which comes next, and he has determined how it should be done.
