And He made them kings and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth. Therefore, you are able also to understand the Scripture, for you are faithful servants of Christ, both kings and leaders of the churches; you are able to govern the passions rather than be governed by them; and as priests, you bring your own bodies "as a living, holy, and acceptable sacrifice to God," according to what is written. (Rom. 12:1)
