So, therefore, all those who are still living and who have heard or even beheld the punishments of sinners, and have not repented but remained in their wickedness, as was said earlier, he says against these, I saw an angel who had come down from heaven, bearing different forms of punishments. 

He says that the look of him and his appearance was like this: He was wrapped in a cloud. The cloud symbolizes the incorporeality and invisibility of the holy angels, for the cloud is a type of what cannot be seen. For the prophet, indicating clearly the invisibility of God, says, “Clouds and darkness are round about him.” 

And there is a rainbow over his head, just as if he were saying that the sum and excellence of the angels’ good qualities is their brilliance. For they are angels of light. 

He says, And his face was like the sun. And this is the proof of their original pure brilliance. But the rainbow has a created brilliance, indicating the brilliance that comes from the angelic virtues. So the brilliance of the rainbow is not of a single form, but is variegated, indicating all the virtues of angels. The sun symbolizes their sparkling nature. Wherefore he was wrapped in the rainbow, for their virtues are wrapped around us. But his face was like the sun, for among us the sun is a wholly natural boon. 

And his feet were like pillars of fire. The fire indicates the retribution which he came to bring upon the impious. 

He says, He had in his hand a miniature open scroll. Daniel mentioned such little scrolls, saying, “The court sat in judgment before him, and the scrolls were opened.” It was the miniature scroll in which were written both the names and the iniquities of the exceedingly impious who were to be punished. Wherefore he spoke of the miniature scroll, using a diminutive, since a scroll, or little scroll—for both descriptions occur in Holy Scripture—is that in which the names of all human beings have been written, as I have already said—but the miniature scroll is that in which are the names of the exceedingly impious. For those who worshiped images and were guilty of murder and witchcraft and were sick with the other evils that he recounted are unlikely to be numerous enough to fill a whole little scroll. 

He says, And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land: this indicates the huge size of the holy ones; but it also shows that he was bringing retribution both to those who had sinned on land and to those on the sea, such as pirates or those who had harmed others at sea. 

And he called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring: that the holy angel should roar like lions is a symbol of his wrath against the impious. 

He says, And when he called out, the seven thunders made their own voices heard. By the seven thunders he means the seven ministering spirits, which have been mentioned earlier. That is why the definite article is used. He means that the seven thunders are analogous to those seven spirits. 

What does the cry of the seven spirits mean? It means that they give their entire support to the punishment of the sinners, offering a thanksgiving hymn to God, because he has done everything justly. At the same time also as they cried out, they disclosed the different forms of punishment. 

He says, I was about to write what was said by the seven spirits. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down. For seal means, “Have the recollection engraved in your mind,” but being prevented from committing it to writing implies a purpose the reason for which is known to God. Perhaps the punishments were lighter than those normally considered appropriate and reflect the goodness of the one inflicting the penalty, and so tended to make them contemptible for people. 

What do blessed Gregory and all-knowledgeable Evagrius say about these things? The former says, “The retribution” for Adam and his kind “is compassion for humankind; for this is how I believe God punishes.” And in another place he says, “Neither is mercy without judgment, nor is judgment without mercy.” Evagrius says, “The deeper account of judgment may well escape the notice of the youth and the worldly; for they do not know” distress, “since their rational soul has been condemned to ignorance.”
