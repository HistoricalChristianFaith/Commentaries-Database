"prepare a lodging for me". Paul says that he did not write only because of Onesimus (for Philemon would have said, if not for himself, that I was not worthy of even a word), but also for this reason, he says, that you might "prepare a lodging for me". And Philemon was even afraid that if he did not receive Onesimus, the Apostle would come and it would be known that he had been disobedient.

"for I hope that through your prayers". Great indeed is the power of prayers, and great also is the humility of Paul, because he was in need of those prayers.
