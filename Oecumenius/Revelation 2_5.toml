By the words “I will come to you,” he does not suggest any movement that involves a change of position, since God fills all things. Rather, he indicates, as it were, a change from his longsuffering to punishment. He speaks of the removal of the lampstands, that is, of the churches as his own abandonment [of them], which, when it comes against the sinners, brings them into every kind of distress and trouble, so that they might also say, “My eye was troubled with anger,” and “My heart was troubled within me.”
