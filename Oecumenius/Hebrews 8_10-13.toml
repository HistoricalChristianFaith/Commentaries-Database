"For this is the covenant." Which one? The New one.
That is to say, "after those days." Which days? Some say, those of the Exodus, in which the Mosaic law was given; but it seems to me that it speaks of those days mentioned above: “Behold, the days are coming.” After those days have passed, I will make such a covenant as you will hear next.
"I will put my laws." I will establish, giving my laws,
"on their hearts." For neither in letters was the new established, but through the Holy Spirit. And this is indicated by Christ speaking to the apostles. "He (that is, the Comforter) coming, will remind you and teach you all things." (Jn. 14:26) Do you see that the new is not in letters, but through the Holy Spirit? Therefore, consider how much greater the New Covenant is.
"And I will be their God." This was accomplished through the gospel. For those who formerly worshiped idols, now having known the true God, have become His people.

For this is evident. Who easily persuades someone in the ancient times to turn away from their own superstition? On the contrary, Israel was turning from the knowledge of God into error.

"And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor." Here it speaks of a teaching that is more laborious. For behold, we see that there is no need for more words for those whose minds are healthy, to persuade them to believe in Christ. For all men are taught by God; for Christ has written His laws upon our hearts.
"for they shall all know me." For the Jewish knowledge and faith were confined to one corner of the world, Palestine. And few knew it; but the voice of the apostles went out to all the earth. Moreover, since God dwelt on earth in the flesh, and by taking on our nature made it divine, the light of true knowledge of God shone in all souls, and a certain ability was granted to human nature by grace to truly know God.
"For I will be merciful toward their iniquities." To those who have gone before. Mercy is granted, having been left to us in baptism.
"and I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” For those forgiven in baptism are no longer remembered.
“In speaking of a new covenant.” For to call it altogether new has made the first covenant old.
"And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away." Now, having taken boldness from the prophet, he himself declares. This, he says, is new, but that one is old. The old is being abolished, he says. Therefore, it has been cast out and dissolved because of old age; as if he were saying: The new has not suddenly ceased the old, but because of its old age and antiquity, that is, because of its weakness and uselessness. "what the law could not do." he says elsewhere, in that part where it “was weakened by the flesh”. (Rom. 8:3)
