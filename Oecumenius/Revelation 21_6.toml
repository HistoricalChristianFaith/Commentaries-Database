“They are done!” he says. What is done? These things, namely, that which is here spoken, and nothing in them is false. He has written “they are done,” instead of “they shall be done.” “I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end,” he says. Since he repeats what he had earlier said, also we, as it were following in his footsteps, repeat what we have said in previous passages. The phrase “Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end” signifies that God is without any beginning and without any end.

In the Gospels the Lord says, “Blessed are they who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.” Therefore, to one who thirsts after such a thirst, I shall give life without payment. But how is it that he said “without payment,” since the saints attain to the future life with very great hardships? Why, therefore, does he say that he gives it “without payment”? He says this to indicate that one never bears anything worthy of the blessings of that [future] time, no matter how much one might labor. And the apostle made the same point when he said, “For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.”
