He says: It has been done! What has been done? These things, that is the things said, and nothing false about them. He put "have been done" instead of "they will happen."

He says: I am the Alpha and the Omega; the beginning and the end. Since he again takes up what was said earlier about him, we too, following him step by step, may again take up what we said before. The Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end, indicate God's lack of beginning and endlessness; for since nothing in this life among us is without a beginning, he used "beginning" and "end" in place of "without beginning" and "without end."

He says: To the thirsty I will give freely from the spring of the water of life. In the Gospels the Lord says: "blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be filled." (Matt. 5:6) To the thirsty I will give freely from the spring of the water of life. And how, he says, freely, when the saints attain the coming life after many labors? Why then does he say to give freely? This signifies that nothing comparable to the goods of that time can ever be brought by a man, even if he labors ever so much; this is what the apostle suggesting said: "For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory about to be revealed to us." (Rom. 8:18)
