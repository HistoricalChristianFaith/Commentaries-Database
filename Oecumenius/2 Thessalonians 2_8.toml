The Devil and the Antichrist, together with the kings who march with them, will make war against the Lord and His divine angels, but will be defeated more quickly than a word. Isaiah says, "Let the impious one be done away with, that he may not see the glory of the Lord." (Is. 26:10) What could be quicker than breathing and blowing a breath against His enemies?
