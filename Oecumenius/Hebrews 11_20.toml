"By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come." From where were such good things promised to his sons, if he did not believe that God would give the promises? And what is it, concerning things to come? Or concerning what is to happen to them, or concerning what is to be given to their offspring. For neither did they themselves enjoy the promise. Jacob, however, is first named because of his virtue.
