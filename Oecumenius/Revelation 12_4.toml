And it is said that by his tail he drags a third of the stars of the sky and casts them down to the earth. For he conspired with himself to withdraw the greatest portion of the angels, persuading and causing those heavenly beings to become earthly, and darkness to overshadow the bright ones like stars. The tail, however, reveals the nature of his final and backward failings; for previously, having perceived folly and rebellion himself, and having sufficiently nurtured this in his proud mind, he therefore came to corrupt the rest as well.

And he said that the Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth, he might devour her child. From the events concerning the Lord, it was carefully observed that the One who would break his dominion would be born, and the Dragon vigilantly awaited that when the Virgin gave birth, the newborn would perish. Therefore, he was not indifferent, but incited Herod to destroy the male child, who was both strong and brave; one who had no softness nor feminine qualities. For before the child could call a father or mother, Isaiah proclaims to us that "he will take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria against the king of Assyria." (Isa. 8:4)
