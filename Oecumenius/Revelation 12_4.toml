“And his tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth.” Along with himself, [the devil] cast down a very great number of angels. For he had persuaded them to apostatize from God and so made those who were heavenly to become earthly and those who were bright as stars to become dark. “By his tail” is as though to say “by his rear parts and his hindermost transgressions,” for at first devising rebellion and apostasy, he thoroughly reviewed this in the arrogance of his mind and so came also to the corruption of the others.

“And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bear a child, that he might devour her child when she brought it forth.” He is speaking of events in the Lord’s life. Since he who was to destroy his [i.e., Satan’s] dominion was going to be born, [Satan] watched with close attention, so that when the Virgin gave birth, he might kill the child. And so, too, he took no chances but incited Herod, a lascivious man with a harem of women, to destroy the male and manly child. For Isaiah proclaims to us, “Before the child knows how to cry ‘father’ or ‘mother,’ he will take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of Assyria.”
