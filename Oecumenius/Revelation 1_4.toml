This is just like saying, “Grace to you from the God of all of us.” For the Father calls Himself “Being/ONTA” when he talked to the most wise Moses at the bush, saying, “I am The One Who Is,(Ex. 3:14)” and this evangelist said “He was” concerning the Son, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,(Jn. 1:1)” and again in the first of the Catholic Epistles, “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life.(1Jn. 1:1)” 

And by that is to come he means the Holy Spirit. For the Spirit was not only there on the day of Pentecost, according to the account in Acts, but He is always present, too, to the souls who are worthy to receive Him.

The seven spirits are seven angels. However, they are not to be regarded as of equal honor or co-eternal with the Holy Trinity, by no means, but as true assistants and faithful servants. For the prophet says to God, “All things are your servants,” and among “all things” are included also the angels. And in another place he says concerning them, “Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will.” And the apostle uses this manner of speaking in his first letter to Timothy: “I urge you before God and Jesus Christ and the elect angels.” And so when he says, “which are before his throne,” he is giving added witness to their order as servants and ministers, but in no way to any equality in honor.
