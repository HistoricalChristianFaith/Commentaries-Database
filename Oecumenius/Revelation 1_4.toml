The seven spirits are seven angels, but they are neither equal in honor nor coeternal as to be included to the Holy Trinity, but as genuine and faithful slaves. For the prophet says to God, “For all things are slaves of yours.(Ps. 118:91)” In all things the angels are included too. Also the same prophet says concerning them, “Bless the Lord, all his host, his ministers doing his will.(Ps. 102:21)” Likewise, the apostle mentions to Timothy when writing the first letter, “I charge you before God, and Christ Jesus, and the elect angels.(1Tim. 5:21)” 

Further, by saying which are before his throne John gives more testimony to their position as servants and ministers, and not as having the same honor.

This is just like saying, “Grace to you from the God of all of us.” For the Father calls Himself “Being/ONTA” when he talked to the most wise Moses at the bush, saying, “I am The One Who Is,(Ex. 3:14)” and this evangelist said “He was” concerning the Son, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,(Jn. 1:1)” and again in the first of the Catholic Epistles, “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life.(1Jn. 1:1)” 

And by that is to come he means the Holy Spirit. For the Spirit was not only there on the day of Pentecost, according to the account in Acts, but He is always present, too, to the souls who are worthy to receive Him.
