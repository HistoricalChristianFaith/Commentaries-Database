This is just like saying, “Grace to you from the God of all of us.” For the Father calls Himself “Being/ONTA” when he talked to the most wise Moses at the bush, saying, “I am The One Who Is,(Ex. 3:14)” and this evangelist said “He was” concerning the Son, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,(Jn. 1:1)” and again in the first of the Catholic Epistles, “That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled, of the word of life.(1Jn. 1:1)” 

And by that is to come he means the Holy Spirit. For the Spirit was not only there on the day of Pentecost, according to the account in Acts, but He is always present, too, to the souls who are worthy to receive Him...

The seven spirits are seven angels; but not as being equally honored or coeternal were they included with the Holy Trinity — far from it — but as genuine servants and faithful slaves. For the prophet says to God, “For all things are your slaves.” In all things the angels are also comprised. And again the same prophet says about them, “Bless the Lord, all his hosts, his ministers that do his will.” In this fashion, too, the apostle addressed Timothy when writing the first letter: “I charge you,” he says, “before God and Jesus Christ and the elect angels.” Further, by saying who are before his throne John gave added testimony to their rank as servants and ministers, and certainly not as having equal dignity.
