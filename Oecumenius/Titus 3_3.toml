For we were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various desires and pleasures, living in hatred and envy, hated by one another.

Do not reproach anyone, Paul says. For we too were evil, not that we still are. Therefore, since you were once such, and were saved by the grace of Christ, and not by your own works, how do you dare to reproach another? When were we such? When, he says, we were in error, when we worshipped idols. For it is clear how the Greeks live irreverently. For among them are adultery, fornication, murders, and shameful all-night partying [παννυχίδες]. And these they commit as if in honor of the gods.
