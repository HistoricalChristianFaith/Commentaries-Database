To which an angel likewise sends up thanksgiving and those who circle the heavenly altar. For I heard the altar say this, indicating those who minister at the altar. May it be that we all, delivered from all the hardships spoken of, send up a thankful hymn to Christ, to whom be glory unto the ages. Amen.
