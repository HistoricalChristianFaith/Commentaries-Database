Those who stand around the heavenly altar send up a thanksgiving in agreement with that of the angel, for when he says, “I heard the altar saying” something, it signifies thereby those who minister at the altar. May it be that, being delivered from all the sufferings described above, we send up to Christ a hymn of thanksgiving, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
