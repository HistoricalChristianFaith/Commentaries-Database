Jude writes this in order to counter the heresies of the Nicolaitans, the Valentinians and the Marcionites. He shows that the author of the Old and of the New Testaments is one and the same God. It is not, as those heretics claimed, that there was one God of the Old Testament, who was cruel and vindictive, and another God of the New Testament, who is mild and forgiving. At the same time he reminds us that those who sin nowadays cannot expect anything better than the fate which befell those who fled Egypt so long ago. For at that time God, in his great power and because of the oath which he had sworn to their ancestors, delivered Israel from slavery in Egypt. But those among them who disobeyed did not go unpunished. The fact that God had blessed their ancestors was of no benefit to them at that point.
