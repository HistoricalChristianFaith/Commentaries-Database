Together with the holy living creatures, he says, the elders give glory to God. Their casting their crowns before God indicates this: the crown is a symbol of victory and kingship. So when they cast them before the throne of God, they ascribe to God, the ruler of all people, his real and true kingship and universal victory, saying, “To you, Lord, glory is due in the sight of all people, because you brought all things from non-being into being, and by your will you gave substance to things which had no previous existence.”
