When God originally made it, creation was good, and this was not by accident but by his design. However, human beings sinned and subjected the creation to their own vanity, which is why it is no longer firm but subject to many ups and downs. Then during the flood, because there were a few people who had maintained the pure worship of God, the world was refounded through Noah and those who were with him in the ark, along with the animals and seeds required to make a new beginning.
