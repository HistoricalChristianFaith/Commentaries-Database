And of the river he says that on this side and on that side there was a tree of life bearing fruit each month. The Lord calls the tree of life, according to what is written by the Proverbs writer concerning wisdom; he says "the tree of life is for all who hold fast to it." (Prov. 3:18) But Paul handed over to us "Christ as God's power and God's wisdom." (1 Cor. 1:24) And he says that not only do the saints possess the riches of Christ's gifts, but they also have and share in him dwelling within them; which is the head of the highest blessedness. But the tree of life is continuous, Christ, and unceasingly brings to completion fruits and gifts to the saints, as if to overtake zeal with zeal and lest they ever be deprived of divine flow.

And he says the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations. Leaves of life are the patriarchs attached to Christ and holding him, prophets, apostles, evangelists, martyrs and confessors, and those who in due times officiate at the gospel and pastors of the church, and every righteous soul; who even now heal souls, and to the saints will be an addition of good things.
