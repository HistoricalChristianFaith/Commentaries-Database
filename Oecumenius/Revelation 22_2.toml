The Lord is the “tree of life” according to what the author of the Proverbs writes concerning wisdom. He says, “She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her.” And the wise Paul has taught us that “Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.” He says that the saints are not only rich in the gracious gifts of Christ but also that they have him as one who lives in them and among them, and this is the pinnacle of the highest blessedness. Continuously and without cessation the “tree of life,” namely, Christ, produces ripe fruit and gifts for the saints, as though he were heaping generosity on generosity, and so they never become bereft of God’s benefits.

The leaves of life are those who hang from Christ and cling to him: patriarchs, prophets, apostles, evangelists, martyrs and also confessors, those who perform the rites of the gospel at the proper time, the shepherds of the church and every righteous person, those who even now heal souls and will be for the saints the source of additional blessings.
