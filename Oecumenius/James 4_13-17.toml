But you, what are you that judges another? Whoever says, Today or tomorrow we will go to that city, and we will spend a year there, and we will trade and make a profit. Who are ignorant what shall be tomorrow. For what is your life? It is a vapor appearing for a little while, and afterward it shall vanish away; for that you should say, If the Lord wills, and if we live, we will do this or that. But now you glory in your arrogance. All such rejoicing is wicked. To one therefore knowing to do good, and not doing it: to him it is sin.
"Whoever says, Today." It does not take away power or free will but shows that not everything is in his hands: for even the heavenly needs grace. For although one may strive, run, engage in business, and do all things necessary for life, one should not attribute these to one's own efforts, but to divine kindness. For Jeremiah says: "Lord, life is not in man himself." (Jer. 10:33) And the author of Proverbs (Παροιμιαστής) says: "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring." (Prov. 27:1)
"For what is your life?" This says, pointing out the vanity and wretchedness of our life: and shaming us for the fact that throughout all the time of our life we consume ourselves in temporary evils, and in those things that arise and vanish simultaneously, all our labor is fulfilled. This is also echoed by David, saying: "Yet man passes away like a shadow; yet he is in vain troubled," (Ps. 38:7) that is, about that which is not, but exists only in a mere illusion: for such are the things and the image; or about that which does not exist, but insofar as it has a resemblance and image with life that truly proceeds.
"It is a vapor." Vapor is a condensation of air expiring from the moisture due to the heat of fire, having minimal existence. For due to its extreme low density, it easily yields to the surrounding body and vanishes and dissolves, like a moderate moisture when water is added. Thus, it has similarity to our life: and that very cleverly. Furthermore, having intercepted such speech by this example, it again returns from the perspective to what was following. For the whole particle is to be ordered in this way: Now you who say,
"Today or tomorrow we will go to that city, and we will spend a year there, and we will trade and make a profit," for what you ought to say. If the Lord wills, and if we live, we will do this or that. "But now you glory in your arrogance." Since this was truly a consequence of the discourse, it does not do this, but after it interrupts the continuity of the discourse with an example, it subsequently adds what it intended, by portraying the thing and proving the vanity that lies beneath what distracts us regarding this world. It is to be understood in this way:
"Glory in your arrogance." Who are you that do not know what will happen the next day? What is your life? etc. By saying, "What is your life?" it despises life, and by this, it paves the way with an example set against brittleness, thus it also adds an example, rendering this most solid.
"Glory in your arrogance." The arrogant and arrogance are affections for non-sustaining things. Therefore, it is also called ἁλαζών, which means "living with the sea," that is, living with something unstable and lacking permanence.
"All such rejoicing is wicked." James repeats the empty boasting that desires to arise from pride, and as if concluding his speech, he supposes that it is evil: if it is evil, it is certainly also from the Evil One. However, those who have been consecrated to the Lord through baptism should not receive any corruptions from the Evil One. He also infers this: Therefore, he who knows how to do right and does not do it is held by sin; he also rebukes false teachers. Do you dare to rebuke these things when you have not first acted rightly in them? "For blessed," he says, "is not he who has taught, but he who has both done and taught." (Matt. 5:17) For it is necessary that works precede the word, since the righteous proclaim the faith they have exhibited. "For whoever breaks one of these least commandments," says the Lord, "and teaches men so, that is, in vain, namely in those things in which he has not labored, shall be called least; but he who has both done and taught shall be called great." (Matt. 3:19) Since both God and man taught this doctrine which He had begun to practice first. It also seems to be the case that Paul says: "Let him who boasts, boast in the Lord;" (2 Cor. 10:17) that is, according to the Lord, using His example long before, and thus doing and teaching. For when David says: "My soul shall make its boast in the Lord," (Ps. 33:3) he says nothing other than that by walking according to the Lord's commandments, he is praised.
