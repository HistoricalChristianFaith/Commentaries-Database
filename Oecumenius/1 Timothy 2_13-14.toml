For Adam was formed first, then Eve; and Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.

For Adam was formed first. Since Adam was formed first, the woman should not have authority over the man, but should be in submission to him.

Adam was not deceived. As to the comparison with the deceit with which the woman was deceived, the behavior of Adam is neither deceit nor trickery. For it is much more reasonable to be deceived by the serpent than to accept the fruit from the woman and eat it. Therefore, in his defense, Paul says that he was not deceived, but that "The woman whom you gave to be my helper, she gave to me and I ate." (Gen. 3:12) Calmly showing that Adam did not even err after listening to his helper. "He was not deceived." Note that what precedes is to be understood as implied.

In another way also. How was Adam not deceived? Because neither does Scripture say this, but the woman indeed: "The serpent deceived me." (Gen. 3:13) But Adam does not say; "The woman deceived me," but, "She gave me." She gave to me: For it is not the same to be persuaded by a fellow and companion, and to be persuaded by a beast, slave, and one who is subordinated. Therefore, that was the deception. But neither did Adam see the tree that it was beautiful to eat, but the woman.

but the woman being deceived. And Paul brings this forward to prevent a woman from teaching. For once a woman has taught, Paul says, she overturns everything and makes the man subject to disobedience: for she was the author herself and advised him to eat. Therefore, he does not say: Eve was deceived; but the woman was deceived, indicating a nature that is easily deceived.

but the woman being deceived fell into transgression. Not only Eve became accountable to transgression, but also the whole sisterhood of women. For as in Adam we all die, so in Eve all have sinned.
