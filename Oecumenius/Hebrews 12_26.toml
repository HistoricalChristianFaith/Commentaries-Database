For on earth, it is said that Moses speaks. He says, This is the case: If the Jews, having rejected the message of Moses, did not escape destruction, how shall we escape if we reject the one who speaks from heaven, that is, Christ? Is it not because, while the law was given by another long ago, now another speaks, and calls to his kingdom and faith, but because he is more fearful now, speaking from heaven and by himself, than he was before, when he spoke from the earth through Moses, from whom he is more justly to be heard?
That the former lawgiver is not different from the one speaking now, he himself makes clear by saying, "whose voice then shook the earth." When? He says, when he gave the law on Mount Sinai.
"but now has promised, saying." Do you see that the same one is both then and now? But the difference is in the manner of his preaching. For then he proclaimed from the earth and through Moses, but now from heaven and through himself.
"who turn away from the one from heaven." In common, that which is speaking, as in proclaiming.

"Yet once more I shake," that is, "once more," clearly, that which comes after the second, is added another once. For previously the world was shaken at the lawgiving in Sinai. "Indeed, the earth shook," says David (Ps. 68:8). Again, during the presence in the flesh; the world will be shaken; for "all Jerusalem was shaken." (Matt. 21:10)
"And the handmade things of Egypt shall be shaken." (Isa. 19:16) By "shaking," it is said to be the renowned nature of the preaching, by which they were shaken from their former state of wandering and the people were transformed. Therefore, speaks holy Cyril: But the "yet once more," he says, will be at his second glorious coming, when he will transform and renew creation; for then creation will be shaken most truly, the true shaking and uproar or the transformation from evil to good of those then being saved. Refer also to the commentary of the blessed Cyril on the Song of Songs.
