Naomi long ago was given the name “bitter” because of her great distress over her children and other calamities. Bitterness then is a sign of extraordinary plagues. We sinners may some time suffer such bitterness, if we become embittered at the glory of the saints, seeing that when such good things had been prepared for human beings, we ourselves exchanged the pleasures of the present for those in the future. I think this is what the falling of the star means—a display of God’s wrath which made the waters bitter. 

Figuratively he calls human beings waters, according to the prophet’s saying, “from the sounds of many waters, amazing are the surgings of the sea,” and again, “The rivers have lifted up, Lord, the rivers have lifted up their voices, the rivers will lift up what has been worn away.” 

These, then, are figurative expressions. But we must not reject the possibility that these and other such things were actually taking place then.
