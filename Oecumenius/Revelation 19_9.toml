And he says to me, "Write: Blessed are those who are called to the marriage supper of the Lamb," and indeed go forth as is proper; for we know many who are called in the Gospels, but who have renounced the spiritual banquet or even, though they have gone away, are cast out as not having wedding garments, (Matt. 22:11-12) as is shortly shown. But the divine apostle also said, "many are called, but few are chosen." (Matt. 22:14)
