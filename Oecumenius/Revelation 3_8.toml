He says, I know your works, that you are godly; and I have set before you an open door. And he said beforehand: The one who opens, and no one shuts, so also the door which I have given opened, and no one can shut it. Because, he says, you have a little power, and have kept My word, and have not denied My name. Philadelphia is a small city, therefore its strength is also small. But in guarding the faith of Christ beyond her own strength, she rose as unyielding, to remain among those who trouble the faithful. Then, as a recompense for her genuine loyalty to Him, he promises that many from the Jewish census will run to join her and receive the faith of Christ. For this act of worshiping at her feet signifies that even in the last times, to be chosen and appointed as a member of the church is to be part of the church. The prophet, embracing this, said: "I chose to be cast down in the house of my God rather than to dwell in the tents of sinners." (Ps. 83:11)
