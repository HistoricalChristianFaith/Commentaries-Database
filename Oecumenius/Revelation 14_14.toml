He sees the Lord who was worthy to become the Son of man and who is riding upon a cloud. This is either in reality a cloud, for the Gospel also speaks of this, whose witness we have referred to in an earlier discussion, or the cloud is a certain angelic power, for it is written, “He mounted on cherubim and flew, he flew on the wings of the winds.” He calls the angels a “cloud” on account of their sublimity and their exalted nature and rank. Or rather, he calls the mother of God a “cloud” on whom he rode, honoring her who is his mother according to the flesh. For, indeed, Isaiah foresaw her in this manner, saying, “Behold, the Lord is seated on a swift cloud, and he will come to Egypt, and the idols of Egypt will tremble at his presence.” Interpreting this saying, Aquila says that the cloud is a “light material.” “Material,” as I think, because she was a human being and flesh, and “light” because of her purity and blamelessness and because not even one sin weighed her down, yet also because of the excellence and heavenward character of her soul. You will consider the “cloud” in this manner. It is white because of the purity and radiance of those things that are here seen. To be sure, the crown signifies the kingdom of our Lord, Jesus Christ. For Christ is king of things both unseen and seen. The crown is of gold to depict the glory of the kingdom by means of that which among us has great value. That he has a sickle in his hand signifies that the consummation of the age rests in his power.
