He sees the Lord who was worthy to become the Son of man, riding a cloud. It was truly a cloud, since the Gospel also says this, that which I have offered as demonstration above is of some angelic power; or it is written, "and he mounted upon the cherubim and flew; he sped upon the wings of the wind." (Ps. 18:10) He calls the angels a cloud, because of the loftiness and exalted nature and worth of their being; or at least he calls the Mother of God a cloud upon whom honor rests, and this mother according to the flesh; for so Isaiah likewise foresees her, saying, "Behold, the Lord sits upon a swift cloud, and he will come into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall tremble before his face." (Isa. 19:1) Interpreting this statement, Aquila says that the cloud is of light thickness; thick, as I think, because it is human and flesh, but light because it is pure and blameless and not burdened by any sin, and also because of the exalted and heaven-reaching nature of the soul. Therefore, you should understand the cloud; white because of the purity and the luminous appearance of the things perceived.

But the crown signifies the kingdom of our Lord Jesus Christ; for Christ is King of both the spiritual and the sensible, and the crown of gold, from the precious things among us, sets forth the splendor of the kingdom.

And the sickle shown in his hand plainly indicates that in his power he sits over the end of the age.
