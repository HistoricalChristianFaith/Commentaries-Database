From out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be done. Does the fountain give forth out of one hole sweet and sour water? Can, my brethren, the fig tree yield grapes: or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet. Who is wise and has knowledge among you? Let him show by good conversation his working in mildness of wisdom. But if you have bitter zeal, and there be disputes in your hearts: glory not and be not liars against the truth. For this is not wisdom descending from above: but earthly, sensual, devilish. For where zeal and contention is: there is inconstancy, and every perverse work. But the wisdom that is from above, first certainly is faithful: then peaceable, modest, vulnerable, consenting to the good, full of mercy and good fruits, not judging, without distinction. 18 And the fruit of justice, in peace is sowed to them that make peace.
"From out of the same mouth." This kind of sacred discipline has received nothing bitter to be emitted, nothing ungrateful.
"Who is wise and has knowledge among you?" When men were ambitious and boasted of the wisdom of this world, they preached from disagreement and rivalry of the rulers, openly inciting the people to agitation, and besides, they were wasting away with envy and allowing human things to mingle with divine, so that the examiners were drawn in by the novelty of what was being said; hence also heresies arose. Therefore, after completing the discourse on the slander and intemperance of the tongue, he then transitions to envy, which arises in men from similar recklessness: and he says that these doctrines are not established and firm, as they are not from divine wisdom, but rather demonic. However, he said this to encourage the good teacher, saying that he should show his wisdom through good works with his gentleness. Moreover, since the name of zeal, that is passion, is neutral and indifferent in itself to good and evil. (For zeal, or passion, is a movement of the heart stirred up towards something with some similarity to that which is the object of study or affection) therefore he added bitter zeal, showing what passion leads to. Indeed, contentiousness is a blameworthy contention and obstinacy.
"first certainly is faithful." That is, pure and without stain, adhering to no fleshly thing.
"without distinction." Not discerning the observance of foods and various washings. Paul discusses these matters in detail in the Epistle to the Colossians. (Col. 2:1)
