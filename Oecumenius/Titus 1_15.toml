Things are always pure to the pure; but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled.

— [OECUMENIUS] What then was the law given to the Jews concerning uncleanness? And we say, not because they were unclean did God legislate accordingly, but by this law cutting off much luxury and indifference among the Jews. For what is clean and unclean depends chiefly on the character of those receiving it. Since by nature all things are clean to those who do not examine too closely; but to those who are not such, all things are unclean, though not actually unclean. For only sin is truly unclean. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 185v; B f. 224v; G f. 314v] —

but to the defiled. Therefore, impure things come from a defiled mind: just as for a person suffering from an illness, all things are unpleasant because of the disease.

but both their mind and conscience are defiled. No food is indeed impure, Paul says, but the mind and conscience of those people are impure, and their skepticism makes foods impure and useless.
