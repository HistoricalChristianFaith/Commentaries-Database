Peter, Apostle of Jesus Christ, to the chosen sojourners of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ, grace to you and peace be multiplied.
The series and order are now collected: Peter, Apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ. The rest, however, will be placed by interjection: for they signify to whom the letter is written. However, that particle is used according to the foreknowledge of God, to signify that there is no prophet who is inferior in anything, except in time. That they were sent, says Isaiah: "He has sent me to announce good news to the poor." (Isa. 61:1) But although later times have brought this to pass, it is not, however, the foreknowledge of God; rather, in this, he shows himself equal to Jeremiah, who was known and sanctified before he was formed in the womb and designated as a prophet to the nations. And since the prophets, among other things, had foretold the coming of Christ (for this reason they were sent), he adds the necessity of his apostleship, saying:
"I was sent in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ," signifying through what is proposed: "This is the manner of my apostleship, to be set apart." The name signifies through sanctification: as it is said, "And you shall be to me a peculiar people sanctified," (Deut. 14:2) that is, separated from other nations. Therefore, the manner of his apostleship was to separate through spiritual gifts obedient nations, sprinkled with the passion and blood of Christ, not with the ashes of a heifer, when it must be purified, taken from the pollution of the Gentiles: but with the blood received from the passion of Christ. At the same time, it also touches upon a certain prolog to martyrdom of blood for Christ suffered by those who believe in him: for he who follows the footsteps of the teacher through obedience, when it is absolutely necessary, will not refuse to shed his own blood for him who poured out his for the whole world.
"Peter, Apostle of Jesus Christ." Here Peter writes to those who were of the circumcision, as does blessed James, but he indeed addresses all Jews who inhabited the world, wherever they were; however, this one specifically addresses the regions of Pontus in Galatia. He also added Pontus to Galatia. For there is another Galatia near the Celts which is also truly Galatia, from which those he is now discussing had migrated. Therefore, he directs his speech to these and other nations which are mentioned in the preface, using this letter universally or generally. The series of letters is therefore this, with the addition of those things that have been said through deficiency for the sake of manifestation, for this reason also he employs rearrangement and the alteration of figures to the word.
Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ… receiving the end of your faith1, and what is that? Salvation of the soul: concerning which salvation even the prophets searched and inquired,
"To the chosen sojourners." Sojourners, either because of dispersion he said, or also because all who live according to God are sojourners on earth, as David also says: "I am a sojourner with you and a pilgrim as all my fathers were." (Ps. 38:13) The name “sojourner” [παρεπίδηµος] signifies something different from a “newcomer” προσήλυτος. The former indicates someone who has come from elsewhere or from abroad, while the latter παρεπίδηµος denotes something more shameful. For just as a πάρεργον, that is, something incidental, is less valuable than an ἔργον, that is, a work, and a πάροδος, that is, a passage, is less than a ὁδός, that is, a way: Indeed, work and way are proper and are pursued with intention, while passage and what is done incidentally are like those things that intrude upon these. Thus, the term παρεπίδῃηµος, as it intrudes upon existence, seems indeed to signify more abjectly than ἔπίδημος.
"grace to you and peace be multiplied." Grace, because you are saved freely, having contributed nothing to it, "And peace”, for this is necessary for those who have offended their Lord and have become His enemies.
