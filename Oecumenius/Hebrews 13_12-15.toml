This is addressed to those who would wonder, How do you say you have an altar? For what was offered upon it? And indeed, Christ himself, whom you claim was offered above and below, that he became a sacrifice for the world and an offering, was not himself sacrificed upon your altar; for it is evident that he suffered outside the city of Jerusalem. Therefore, to these, Paul says, Yes, he suffered outside, but through this it is rather established that we have an altar. For even among them, the Jews, the bodies of those being sacrificed are not burned on their altars, but outside the camp. And again, for this reason he suffered outside the gate, so that he might sanctify all, and not only the priests. If he became a sacrifice for all, how is it not also an altar?
The phrase, in order to sanctify the people, gives another meaning. Paul says that those who serve at the tabernacle have no authority to eat from our altar, not because it is impossible for them, but because they consider themselves unworthy in their own opinion; since from the love of Christ, they are not only not hindered, but also have suffered for this very reason. For he says, in order to sanctify the people, not this one, or that one, but the whole people, and make them have authority to eat from his altar, he suffered outside the gate.

"Let us then go to him outside." Since Christ suffered outside the gate, let us go out to Him outside the camp, that is, outside the world, bearing nothing worldly, neither earthly nor carrying the filth of the earth. This, outside the gate, that is, outside the world, bearing His reproach, that is, suffering the same things as He did, if He should ask; for this indicates, bearing the reproach he endured, which He Himself endured through both the mockeries and the scorn.

It seems that the divine Paul, outside the camp, outside the world, speaks; for he takes us out of worldly life.

"for we have no lasting city here." Therefore, we must willingly choose the death for Christ; and especially because these cities are not ours, but we must seek another, the one that remains; for these are perishing.
"Through him then." As for the high priest according to the flesh, let us offer up to the Father a sacrifice of praise, that is, thanksgiving. For we give thanks to the Father, as he has given his Son to sanctify us. This is for the weak. Since the grace of the Son, it is clear that the honor is equal; for he says, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. (Jn. 5:23)
"that is, the fruit of lips." What then is the fruit of lips? Prayers, hymns, requests to God. For when he said, “sacrifice,” let them not think that he is speaking of sacrifices made through animals, Paul explained himself. He says, I mean the sacrifices that are without blood, those made through lips, those in prayers and hymns and supplications.
"that acknowledge his name." Acknowledge with the lipsHis name, that is, giving thanks knowing that He died for our sins. That is, confessing with our lips His name.
