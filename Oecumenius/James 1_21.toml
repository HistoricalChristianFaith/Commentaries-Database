Therefore, putting away all filthiness and excess of wickedness, receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
James also adds to impurity the excess of nastiness, wishing to demonstrate this: Although someone frequently falls into some impurity, he should quickly depart from it, and not by remaining and lingering in it, through habit do they make the evil stronger and more difficult to cleanse: since those things are born which continually and abundantly find their way into us, to reduce to nature that which is done, or to acquire the habit of nature itself.
"with meekness." For discipline is conveyed through meekness and not through uproar and disturbance.
"implanted word." It is called implanted word that which better distinguishes the good from the bad: by which we are also said to be natural.
