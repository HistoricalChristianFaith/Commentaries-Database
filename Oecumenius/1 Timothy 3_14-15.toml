These things I write to you, hoping to come to you soon; but if I am delayed, I write so that you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.

These things I write to you. In order that the arrangement concerning these matters may not throw Timothy into gloom because Paul is no longer present, see what Paul says: "But if I am delayed." Since he was led by the Spirit, and did not know where the Spirit was ordering him to go, therefore he always hesitates.

which is the Church of the living God. Whoever is a house, is the Church of the living God; not like the Jewish temple, but a pillar and foundation, that is, a confirmation of the truth. For the temple, he says, was a foundation of the types of truth. And rightly so, "of the living God." For do you not notice, he said, that it is filled with men: for it excels through God, and is built by Him, and has Him as its inhabitant.
