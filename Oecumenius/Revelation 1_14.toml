“His head,” it says, “and his hairs were like white wool, like snow,” for the mystery in Christ was new at its appearance, although to be sure eternal according to good pleasure. The holy apostle has written concerning this: “the mystery which was hidden from the ages and generations, which has now been revealed to his saints, to those whom he willed.” Therefore, the whiteness of his head, which is compared with wool and with snow, represents the antiquity of the mystery, such as relates to the good pleasure of God.
