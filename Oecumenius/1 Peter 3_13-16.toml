And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. And always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear: having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.
Furthermore, God commands "to sanctify Him in the hearts," as Isaiah says (Is. 8:13): this means, do not glory in those things that appear, but in the hidden treasury of your hearts, working the sanctification of the Lord, which consists in the separation of the nations from their abominations or wicked customs;
thus sanctify Him. However, being sanctified, while others glorify Him through your good conduct, just as God and man Himself commands when He says: "Let your light shine before men," etc. (Matt. 5:16) What is said about being ready is connected to the previous part, for example,
"all of you, be united." The word "be" is also attributed to the common understanding, so the meaning is: "May you always be ready." He wants to command that a faithful person should always be prepared regarding the discourse of faith, so that at any time when a reason concerning it is sought from us, we may easily respond;
moreover, in responding, let us do so with meekness, as if God Himself were present: no diligent servant would be arrogant in the presence of his master. It also adds the profit that follows from this, namely, the inquiry of the unbelievers and the kindness of the mind towards us. However, it should be noted that these are not contrary to what has been said by the Lord, for He indeed commands not to be anxious about what we should answer when we are brought before rulers and authorities. (Matt. 10:19) Indeed, the Lord's words about martyrdom were spoken, as He also says that virtue and a more powerful discourse should be given than any human wisdom, and that one who despises the surrounding fears: however, Peter's opinion speaks of doctrine. For without understanding and inquiry, it is worthy of reproach to think one knows something. For the knowledge of the foolish is an unprofitable discourse. (Eccles. 21:21) Moreover, since we were accused of various wicked things, and they also showed that our hope was vain, he says that we should bring forth considered responses about these things, having at the same time a proven life, which he certainly calls conscience.
Therefore, sanctify God in your hearts, and do not be afraid of human fear nor be troubled. But always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you. And do this with the demonstration of good actions. For by doing so gently and with kindness, you will confirm that you are well aware of yourselves, and you will shame those who have evil suspicions about you.
"Having a good conscience." That is, while you are well aware of yourselves and not evil, as those who slander you are.
"that when they defame you." That is, those who create trouble with words, harshly investigating.
