The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.

The saying is trustworthy, that is, the spoken word is true. "You will know from me," Paul says. "of whom I am the foremost." And yet elsewhere he says, "According to the righteousness which is in the law made blameless." (Philip. 3:6)

How then does Paul call himself sinful and the foremost of sinners? And we say that righteousness from the law, when compared with that from faith, is not only not righteousness, but also the first sin. "For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God." (Rom. 3:23) In this comparison, it has also been used elsewhere, where it says: "For even that which has been glorified has not been glorified in this part, because of the surpassing glory." (2 Cor. 3:10)
