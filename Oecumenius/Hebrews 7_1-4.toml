It now also wishes to show the great excellence of the New Testament over the Old: and it demonstrates this through the priests. Saying, "According to the order of Melchizedek," (Heb. 7:17) he indicates that Melchizedek himself, the type of Christ (for he calls him a type of Christ), He surpassed the legal priests who were among the Jews: asserting this, he said that if the type of Christ was superior to those that were among the Jews, how much more the truth, that is, Christ himself.
“king of Salem.” Name of a city.
"from the slaughter of the kings." When he returned after defeating the kings who had captured Lot. You know the history. (Gen. 14:1)
"and having blessed him [εὐλογήσας]." Instead of "he blessed him [εὐλόγησεν]."
"gave a tenth." That is, to Melchizedek, Abraham gave a tenth, he says.
"first being interpreted.” Therefore, he wants to show how Melchizedek is a type of Christ, and first he does this from the name. For, he says, his name is interpreted, king of righteousness; Melchizedek, king; Salem, peace. Of whom else could he be a type, except of Christ the true King of Righteousness?
Then he also mentions the other interpretation from the city. Salem is peace. Therefore, he is not only a king of righteousness, but also of peace, as from the city of which he reigned; both of these Christ is, being both King of Righteousness and King of Peace.
“without father, without mother.” Therefore, is it possible that this Melchizedek, being a man, is without father and without mother, and having neither beginning of days nor end of life? No. How then did he say this? Observe. For it could be objected to him: How is Christ according to the order of Melchizedek, who died and was not made a priest forever? See what he says: “We do not know,” he says, “who he has as father or mother, or what lineage Melchizedek is, nor when he was born, or when he died.” And what does this matter? Someone might say: “although we do not know these things, since they are not mentioned in Scripture, nevertheless he had both a father and lineage, and birth and death.”
How then is such a one without father and mother, and having no beginning or end of life? And he says: Just as Melchizedek, because he is not genealogically recorded in Scripture, appears to us who are ignorant to have no parents, nor beginning or end of life, so Christ truly is. For just as we do not know the beginning and end of Melchizedek, so neither truly do we know those of Christ; but the former because it is not written, the latter because of the truth; for the type is not equal in all things to the truth (since he himself is found to be truth, and identity rather than type); but he has certain images and likenesses; for example, Melchizedek is without father according to our ignorance, Christ is without father in his earthly birth; for according to the flesh he was born only of the Virgin Mary; Melchizedek is without mother, Christ is without mother in his heavenly birth, in which he had neither beginning of days; for how could the maker of time have a beginning? For he was begotten from the Father alone before all ages, ineffably and unthinkably. And thus understand all things that Melchizedek had, which we are ignorant of concerning him, these things Christ truly has. For Melchizedek is a king of peace and righteousness even to the bare names; but Christ truly is so.

"without genealogy." Melchizedek is without genealogy, as he is neither from the seed of Abraham nor is he traced through Moses, but his lineage is said to be unknown, and he is believed to spring from that cursed seed. It is just that he is declared righteous in himself, and not derived from righteous ancestors, nor from any righteous seed.It was therefore not right to uncover his genealogy, who in this way had reached the peak of righteousness.The lineage of Melchizedek was indeed of the Canaanites, as is shown. And it is indeed possible to demonstrate from those very things of which he held power and ruled over regions, and to which he drew near. For he was a neighbor of Sodom, and closer to Abraham who was dwelling near the oak of Mamre. You should think that there was also a king of Salem, which is Jerusalem.

"but made like the Son of God." And where is the similarity? That both Melchizedek and Christ, the end is unknown and the beginning. But for Melchizedek, it is because it has not been written, and for Christ, it is because it does not exist.
"abides a priest forever." In this way, accept the eternal, as well as the others. For he says, as far as it relates to us who are ignorant of when he died, he has set aside the priesthood, he is a priest forever. For the type of indistinct images preserves the original; or that the manner of the priesthood of Melchizedek (you know what I mean) remains forever.
"Consider how great this man was." Since he applied the type to the truth, he wishes to show that the type of Christ himself, namely Melchizedek, was greater than those priests among the Jews. And what do I say about the priests? He was indeed greater than the patriarch Abraham himself. If the type of Christ, he says, is greater than the patriarch himself, what then could anyone say about Christ? In one way, Abraham was greater than Melchizedek, but the type was the one who conquers. Thus, Cyril among the saints in the second book concerning On Adoration in Spirit and Truth…
"‘to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth.’ It is not to be said, he says, that he gave him tithes, as one who has shared in the war; (for this is why he said above, ‘who met Abraham returning from the slaughter), but according to reverence and honor, just as giving first fruits. ‘gave a tenth of the spoils.’ From the loot and plunder. And if he is greater than the patriarch (and this is indicated by the giving of tithes), much more than those among the Jewish priests. For the patriarch is not brought forth without reason: but to show that if the patriarch, he says, has given, what is to be said about the priests?"
