Therefore, we ought to receive such as these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
"we ought to receive." ᾽Απολαμδάνειν is taken for ἀναλαμδάνεσθαι, that is, to receive as when it is said: "They received me like a lion ready for prey." (Ps. 17:12) Moreover, this instructs us not to wait for the needy until they come to us, but rather to run to and follow them: like Abraham and Lot. (Gen. 8)
