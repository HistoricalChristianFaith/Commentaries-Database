He was indeed predetermined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you, who through him believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
Peter connected the death of Christ with the resurrection. For he fears the easy change of beginners in faith to skepticism, due to the disgrace of Christ's afflictions, but he says there is no recent mystery about Christ: since this also disturbs the foolish; but in former times and before the foundation of the world, it had been hidden by divine providence until the opportune time, indeed it was revealed to the prophets who inquired about these things, as he had said a little earlier, now, however, he says, it is more manifest, because what had been foreknown before the foundation of the world, namely by God, is now revealed, whether completed or perfected. And he adds because of whom it may be perfect, namely because of you. For because of you, he says, he raised him from the dead. But why because of you? So that when you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth through the Spirit, you may have faith and hope in God. And how have you purified yourselves? Because by believing in Him who has proclaimed to you the resurrection from the dead to an incorruptible life, you are debtors to Him who, being incorruptible, called you to walk in newness of life.
But if both Peter and Paul say that the Father raised the Lord from the dead, do not be disturbed: for now they are using introductory teachings to say these things. For listen to Christ saying that he raised himself, when he says: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." (Jn. 2:19) But also Luke: "To whom he also showed himself alive, after he had suffered." (Acts 1:3) And again Christ himself: "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again." (Jn. 10:18) Therefore, in a certain dispensation, the Son's resurrection is sometimes referred to the Father, to show the unity of the operation of the Father and the Son.
The sequence of the letters is as follows: He was indeed predetermined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you, who through him believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory: so that you may purify your souls (in fact, ὥστε is taken for 'so that') in obeying the truth, having faith and hope in God. For it is accepted that εἶναι means "to have", because of the preceding. For if ὥστε is left in its meaning as stated, the sentence will be incoherent and unintelligible.
