To the rich, in this present age, command not to be arrogant, nor to hope in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.

For there are also other rich men, but not in this age. The truly rich are the righteous ones, that is.

not to be arrogant, Paul says. For nothing so much inflates and exalts the mind as money and possessions.

nor to hope in uncertain riches. See how he insults them, and how foolish they are. For who hopes for something uncertain?

but in the living God. For Paul says that he who hopes in God is not disappointed.

who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. For he, to whom all things common belong, has given abundantly and freely: heaven, earth, air, life, food. But greed, having taken tyranny as a partner, has seized many of the common things and made them private.
