By islands he speaks of the Gentile churches, as the prophet says, “The Lord has reigned; let the earth be glad, and let the many islands rejoice.” He calls them “islands” because they lifted their heads and rose above their bitter and distasteful idolatry. Someone might also think otherwise and interpret the “islands” to refer to the impure orders of the demons, since they wallow in this briny and turbulent life. But that he refers to demons when he mentions the “mountains,” even the holy psalmist shows, singing, “The mountains melt like wax before the Lord, for he is coming,” Therefore, this passage transmits to us that the ranks of the demons at that time will be wiped out and obliterated. And, where might the wretched flee from God, in whose hand are the corners of the earth and who measured the heaven with a span and the earth with his hand—unless those who are smitten by these events should attempt a futile flight and escape? When these things take place and there is a violent hailstorm, it is necessary that people at that time turn to prayers and entreaties—for these signs against them might have ceased, but they rather cursed God and therefore these evils even intensified against them.
