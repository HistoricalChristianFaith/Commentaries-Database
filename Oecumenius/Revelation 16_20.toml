And he says that every island fled and no mountains were found.

Islands are said to be the churches from the nations, as the prophet says: "The Lord has reigned; let the earth rejoice; let many islands be glad." (Ps. 97:1) Islands are also said, as those that have emerged and overcome the bitter and salty idolatry. But one might also understand islands as the impure hordes of demons, signifying something different, as being entangled in this salt and fickle life.

About the mountains, he says that they are demons, and the great singer, singing, shows that "the mountains melted like wax before the face of the Lord because he is coming." (Ps. 96:5) The account therefore hands down to us that the ranks of the demons at that time will be destroyed and vanish. But where could the wretched ones flee from the presence of God, "in whose hand are the ends of the earth," (Ps. 4:4) who measured the heaven by a span and the earth with a handful? (Isa. 40:12) except that those who suffer will attempt a useless flight and escape.
