But godliness with gladness is great gain.

But godliness with gladness is great gain. They indeed imagine godliness in such a way that it serves as a means for gain and profit. But true profit is godliness itself in its own nature, and having what is sufficient, not seeking those things that abound in earthly goods. Or rather, what profit is godliness itself if we do not seek more, but remain in sufficiency.
