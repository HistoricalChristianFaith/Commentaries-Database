The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and, "The worker deserves his wages." Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful. I seriously charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels to keep these instructions without bias, and to do nothing out of favoritism.

Who then are the ones who lead well, Christ declared. "The good Shepherd," he says, "lays down his life for the sheep." (Jn. 10:11)

are to be considered worthy of double honor. Paul calls the necessary provision an honor, or rather a contribution. "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and, "The worker deserves his wages."

double. But truly, with a double comparison made to widows, not to elders who do not rule well. For they do not even deserve simple honor, but rather must be expelled. Or he says double means much.

those who labor in preaching. Preach, not the boastful kind, but that which has the power to nourish spiritually. But where now are those who say that the leader does not need words or teaching, but life? Let them now hear how Paul honors the word [λόγον], especially preaching. For even this, if from some other. For when the word is about doctrines, where then does life have power? And see the contrast to, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." For indeed, one who is threshing must be muzzled.

The worker deserves his wages. Even Christ speaks in accordance with the law. By wages, he means food, and by worker, he means the one who labors, namely that one who does not labor is unworthy of food. This, however, Paul says to teachers who do not labor in teaching.

Do not receive an accusation against an elder. What then? Should such an accusation be admitted against the younger? By no means! But as if he were saying: Against no one, and especially not against the elder; for they have, even from their very age, a certain restraint; therefore he calls him an elder [πρεσβύτερον] who is old in age.

Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all. For he seeks carefully, Paul says, and when he finds, he reproaches with severity. For this is the rebuke. Before all, so that the rest may also be admonished. This, God did, both upon Pharaoh (Ex. 19) and upon Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 4).

I seriously charge you before God. Paul warns of severity. For Timothy did not simply resign, but protested, securing himself in case anything improper should happen. But why did Paul call the Father and the Son as witnesses, and also angels together? Because they, along with their Lord who is to come in judgment, are present and will bear witness to the discourse. It is also our custom to call both superiors and inferiors as witnesses. And Jacob also took God and the mountain as witnesses. (Gen. 31:46)

and the elect angels. He said "elect angels," because angels and demons alike are cast away.

— [OECUMENIUS] Either he spoke what was truly the case, or he brought them to the brink of ruin. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 173v; B f. 209τ; G f. 297r] —

to keep these instructions without bias. This, for example, is what he said: Without haste in judgment, that is, so that you do nothing rashly or recklessly from what has been said, and not without preceding judgment or counsel.

and to do nothing out of favoritism. Indeed, presumptions are often devoid of truth. For favoritism [πρόσκλησις] is an affectation that incites someone to do something without judgment.

without bias. That is, without falling into the judgment and punishment of disobedience for someone who has erred in something. Thus Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes. And Basil, in his interpretation of the Proverbs, says, According to inclination, that is, not leaning towards what is wrong, but bringing forth straight judgment. For he says thus: Doing nothing according to inclination, but bringing forth judgments straight and unaltered.
