Behold the order! He said that the covenant according to Christ is superior to the old one. And how is this evident? Because, he says, it is established on better promises. For if the promises and the recompenses are better, it is clear that the covenant is also better, and the commandments more divine. But how is it evident that the promises are better? From this, he says, that the former was set aside, but this one has taken its place. For this reason, the New covenant prevails, because it is better and more perfect. For if the former had been faultless, that is, if it had nothing lacking, if it made people blameless—then no second covenant would have been introduced.
If he had nothing lacking, he says, if he made men without fault, how then was he so disturbed? "For finding fault with them." To whom? The Jews who received and were governed by the laws in the Old Testament.
"Behold, the days are coming." "After having made the new covenant better than the old in many ways above, now clearly he also mocks the removal of the old, but he does not do this of his own accord, lest he become burdensome, and he brings forth Jeremiah saying, “in the day when I took them by the hand." (Jer. 31:32)
"in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt.” So that they do not suppose that the exodus is according to the covenant with Abraham; for it has occurred in Christ, “For to your seed,” he says, “who is Christ;” (Gal. 3:16) it brings forth what kind of covenant the exodus has become. That of the Exodus, he says, made through Moses. For to say, “not according to that covenant,” he shows it to be cast away, as if he were saying, “I will give another covenant, not such as I have already given. For that one, because of its weakness, has been cast away from me."
"because they did not continue." As if the statement serves as a defense for God's negligence; for He says, they did not continue My covenant. For from them began the disobedience, and thus God's negligence followed.
