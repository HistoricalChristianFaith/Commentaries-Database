Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. And we have known and believed the love that God has for us. God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and God in him. In this, love is made perfect with us, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, because as he is, so are we in this world.
This refers to what has been said a little earlier, namely that every spirit that confesses Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. (1 Jn. 4:2) For John has sufficiently demonstrated that they are children of God and that God abides in them: this has been demonstrated through great love, which confirms that the Holy Spirit or spiritual gifts have been given to them: again, he refers to those words and says: "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him;" saying something of this kind: John said above, Everyone who confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God (1 Jn. 4:2): furthermore, in the course of the conversation, something else was revealed, and therefore he proposed this: that those who confess these things also have the Spirit abiding in themselves, or God and his spiritual gifts, and they themselves abide in God. And this we do not say lightly, but with firm knowledge and faith through mutual love.
But having mentioned love, John also refers to all that he has said about love, attributing great faith to the discourse on love. "In this, love is made perfect." He wishes, he says, for us to be perfect in love, so that we may have confidence on the day of judgment, towards Him who was incarnate: for He himself will be the judge, according to his own statement, where he says: "The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son." (Jn. 5:22) And that there will be confidence towards him who was incarnate, John signified through what he said in the following, that just as he is, we are in this world, saying this: Since it has been shown before that God abides in us, and we are in God, he says, we attest to the perfection of love for ourselves. Just as he was blameless and pure in the world, he also said: "The ruler of this world is coming, and he has nothing in me (Jn. 14:30):" so also we, John says, will be in the world. For there is and we are placed through άντιχρονιαν (where one time is taken for another time), as is the custom of Scripture. Or it signifies something deeper through this. For John has often said that God is in us and we are in God. If this is indeed the case, He is holy in us, that is, the Leader and Prince of holiness: so we should also refer to him in this world sacredly and purely, dead to the world, always bearing his mortification in the body. (1 Cor. 4:10) Furthermore, he says, living this way, we will have confidence towards him, and we will be without fear then. For the “perfect love6”, (1 Jn. 4:18) through good works, will be far from fear. And he adds this confirmation, namely that “perfect love casts out fear”. What fear? He himself says it is the “fear has torment”: for it happens that someone loves because of fear, lest he be punished: but this fear is not perfect, that is, it is not of perfect love. Having said these things about “perfect love”, he completely convinces that we should love God, for John himself first, he says, “loved us”. However, we must, since he has been the first good beginning for us, strive to repay, as has been said more broadly by us above. However, some have asked how, when David says: "Fear the Lord, all his saints, for nothing is lacking to those who fear him," (Ps. 34:9) he does not say: "perfect love casts out fear." Are the saints of God not perfect in love, to whom it is commanded to “fear”? And we say that there are two kinds of “fear”: one is indeed initial, which also brings with it “torment”, because of the evils perpetrated by oneself: fearing him because he approaches God, and therefore approaching lest he be punished, and this is indeed initial. “Perfect”, freed from such fear, is therefore called holy and endures forever: for "The fear of the Lord is holy," David says, "and endures forever." (Ps. 19:9) Since initial fear is neither holy nor enduring, but ceases to exist in “perfect love”. Who then and for what reason is fear called perfect? It is because, having been perfectly taken into love, it strives and fears that it may lack those things which are fitting for them to do towards the beloved, whom they love intensely.
