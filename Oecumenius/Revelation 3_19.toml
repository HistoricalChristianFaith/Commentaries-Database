He says, as many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. Oh, the surpassing greatness of the love of Christ! For the reason that they are such as these, whom the word has written, it promises to love, therefore it both rebukes and disciplines and envies what is better in works, and to repent for those things in which one has sinned.
