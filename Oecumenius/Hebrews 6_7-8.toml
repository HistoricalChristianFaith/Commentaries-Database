“For the earth, which produces.” In the parable, he speaks of the land and the people, he rain, however, is called the teaching, as elsewhere, "I command the clouds," says God, "not to rain upon the vineyard;" (Isa. 5:2) and again, "the river of God was filled with waters;" (Ps. 144:10) these, he who, having been graced by God to teach, was filled with the waters from above, that is, with gifts. those who have often heard and have been metaphorically watered by the saving word of faith, and either have benefited or gained nothing from it.
"suitable vegetation." What is a suitable vegetation? The proper constitution, the virtuous life; for nothing is so well-placed, that is, appropriate and agreeable, as the purity of life.
"for those for whom it is cultivated." Since he spoke about land and fruits, he remained in the metaphor. The good life is produced by the teachers (for these are the ones who cultivate), as those who partake of the virtue of the students.

It is indeed cultivated for the salvation and benefit of those who bear fruit. If it is so, as the Lord says (Jn. 15:1), the Father is the farmer, and the Son is the sower, sowing the precious seed (Matt. 13:3); if the plant is suitable for them, that is, if the farming appears (for we owe it to God to bear fruit, as it is said somewhere (Rom. 6:22): "But now, having been enslaved to God, you have your fruit to holiness"). If therefore we cultivate this, namely for God, in order to please Him with a virtuous life, we are also deemed worthy of His blessing.

"receives a blessing from God." For the fruitful land is blessed by God. Who is the fruitful land? The virtuous man.
"producing thorns." He did not say "bearing [Τίκτουσα]," but "producing [Ἐκφέρουσα]," hinting at the unnaturalness of the production, as if he said, "spitting out [ἐκβράσσουσα]." And "producing" indicates the production until the end and death. For he did not say "carrying out [Ἐξενεγκοῦσα]," but "producing [Ἐκφέρουσα]"; note this.
And by thorns and thistles, he speaks of sin, because it strikes from all sides and corrupts the one who holds it.
"and near to a curse."He spoke of the greatest comfort. For he did not say, "It is a self-curse," but rather, "and near to a curse." And one who is near to a curse can also become far away through repentance. For if he had said, "And it is a curse," he would have had to despair. But now, he says, "and near to a curse," speaking in fear and with caution; "Behold, you have become near to the curse; be afraid lest you fall into it, and flee from it." For one who is near can also flee; for he has not yet been seized.
"whose end is for burning." See again how securely he speaks, lest it be thought that the greatest remedy among men casts out repentance. For he did not say, "He who has accepted thorns and thistles is burned," but rather, "whose end is for burning." If we endure until the end, he says, and carry out the thorns until the very end, then we will be burned, indicating by contrast that if we do not endure the thorns until the end, but change our minds, we will not be burned.
