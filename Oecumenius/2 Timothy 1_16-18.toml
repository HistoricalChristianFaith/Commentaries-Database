May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus; for he often restored me, and was not ashamed of my chains. But when he was in Rome, he diligently sought me out and found me; (may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that day); and you yourself know how many things he ministered to me at Ephesus better than I do.

May the Lord grant mercy. Notice Paul's eagerness. He did not curse those who abandoned him, but only recounted what they did against him; but he prays much for the one who helped him, and not only for him alone, but also for his household. Therefore, they were virtuous, and so Onesiphorus educated them.

of the household of Onesiphorus. O blessed Onesiphorus! who was deemed worthy to restore Paul, may a part of you be with us also.

for he often restored me. Just like an athlete seized by the hardship of the struggle. And he was not ashamed of my chains. Leaving aside the dangers, he put forward the shame, persuading the student to be courageous. As if shame alone arises from the matter, and not danger approaching; although indeed danger was also present. For Nero raged against Paul as if one of his own household had instructed him.

he diligently sought me out. Not only, Paul says, did he not avoid my presence, although there was danger and he encountered me after being imprisoned, but he also sought me more earnestly than he owed until he found me. And those who share in the sufferings with the saints will also share in the crowns, as Paul himself says. "Well done, having shared my suffering." (Philip. 4:14)

may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord. Those who hold the opinions of Marcion leap over [ἐπιπηδῶσι]3 the Scripture, as if there were two Lords, but it says the Lord elsewhere. "But for us there is one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom all things." (1 Cor. 8:6) What then shall we say? This construction is common in the divine Scripture. Just as it is said, Abraham said, "Abraham shall not enter," as if he said, "May the Lord grant him to find mercy with him." And if both the Father and the Son are indicated here, accept it, it is not even inappropriate. For both the Father and the Son are Lord, and the Spirit is Lord, but the one Lord is revealed in the three persons. "The Lord said to my Lord." (Ps. 110:1) That is, it is clarified to say thus the holy substances, as there: "The Lord rained fire and brimstone from the Lord." (Gen. 19:24)

to find mercy. But if Onesiphorus needs mercy in order to be saved, how much more do we?

he ministered to me at Ephesus. He always served, in Ephesus, in Rome. For the earnest man must always be an example in works.
