And we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully, understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the righteous but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, for manslayers, for sexually immoral persons, for men who practice homosexuality, for enslavers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing contrary to sound doctrine, according to the Gospel of the glory of the blessed God, which was committed to me.

that the law is good. If it's anything other than this [that is, using it lawfully], it's not good. But who is the one who lawfully uses it? The one who is sent to faith through it. For the law does not have the power to justify, but it leads to Christ who is able to justify. For the one who fulfills it, not the one who interprets it, lawfully uses it.

understanding this. And Paul says that the one who knows has used the law legitimately, knowing that he does not need it for living rightly. But who is this? The one who lives morally through virtue, and not through fear of the law.

for the lawless and disobedient. This is also said elsewhere; "The law was added because of transgressions." (Gal. 3:19) So for the righteous and not transgressing, there will be no law, but for those who do not have virtue from themselves, but are in need of the threat of the law. And then he specifies them, hinting that the Jews possess these things.

to the ungodly and sinners. For those who continuously worship idols, those who sacrifice their children to demons, those who stone Moses (Num. 14:10), and Jews who are defiled by civil murders, would they not be all these things?

and if there is any other thing contrary to sound doctrine. For all these are passions of a corrupted soul. But such a soul acts contrary to sound and good teaching.

according to the Gospel of glory. But what is sound doctrine? It is that which is according to the Gospel of God. That Gospel is called the Gospel of glory, because through it Christ, who chose the cross, is most glorified.

Concerning Paul’s own calling to be an evangelist, by grace of God, from being a persecutor.
