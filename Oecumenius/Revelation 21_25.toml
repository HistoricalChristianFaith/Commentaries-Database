This has two possible meanings. It may mean that there will be peace and security so that there will be no need for the city to set a sentry for itself or to ever close its gates and make them secure with bars. Or the words may say that the apostolic teachings—for we have noted that the gates are the apostles—will never fall silent there but rather that even there the apostles will be teachers of new and more divine teachings for the saints. For being “sons of day and of light,” the righteous shall revel in the divine illumination of the praises and the mysteries, since the day and the light of divine illumination are perpetually around them. “For there shall be no night,” it says. For were the divine illumination ever to be interrupted, there would be also night. But since it is impious to say this, for the divine light shines without interruption, how shall there be night for the saints?
