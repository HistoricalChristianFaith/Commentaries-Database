And its gates he says shall not be shut by day. The meaning is twofold: for either this says that there will be peace and absence of fear, such that there will be no need to keep watch over the city by day or to bar the doors ever, or that the apostolic teachings, for we called the apostles gates, will not be silenced even there, but the apostles will be present there as teachers of new doctrines and of more divine things to the saints; for the righteous are "children of day and light," (1 Thess. 5:5) they will delight in divine and illuminating praises and mysteries, light ever being about them and a divine shining of light.

For he says there will be no night there. For if the divine radiance were ever interrupted, then there would be night; but if it is impious to say this, that the divine light ever ceases, how could there be night for the saints?
