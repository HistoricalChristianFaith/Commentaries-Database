Honor widows who are truly widows. But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to manage their own household properly and to repay their elders. For this is acceptable in the sight of God. But the widow who is truly alone has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living. And these things command, so that they may be blameless. But if anyone does not provide for his own, especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

Why does Paul say nothing about virgins? Perhaps they were not in their prime. And who is the truly widowed woman, he goes on to say. He ordered that she herself be honored, because they have no husbands nor children, and the matter seems to be a curse for many. Therefore, he says, she should enjoy much honor from the priest, as if restoring the reproaches from others. Or Paul calls the honor the condition of necessities.

if any widow has children. These are not truly widows. For truly they are those who are isolated on all sides.

— [OECUMENIUS] to manage their own household properly. That is, to arrange well. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius] —

and to repay their elders. See the wisdom of the blessed Paul. Often he also urges from human reasoning. For he says, since those before you were not able to give back the recompenses (for they died), through the descendants of those, your children, you should repay them the favors which you owed to those.

— And furthermore. That children and grandchildren should first learn to revere their own household; that is, that children and grandchildren should learn to honor their own mother and to nourish and treat her well. For this is what it means to revere. And also the ancestors, that is, the grandmother. Add also to the account that this is acceptable to God.

But the widow who is truly alone. Since Paul ordered that those who are truly widows to be honored, he now says what kind of women are truly widows, characterizing them in an explanation. He says she is isolated, both from children and from descendants.

has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers. Therefore, this is the true widow, who hopes in God and waits with prayers. For since she is abandoned of human help, it is reasonable that she turns to God.

But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living. For many choose widowhood in order to act with greater authority in things that are not proper, Paul says: "But the one who lives in luxury," that is, the one living in indulgence, "though living, has died." How? For life seems to be the life now. The eternal life has been lost. Therefore, she has died through sin, as far as eternal life is concerned.

And these things command. Do you see that Paul wants the matter to be as a law? For it does not permit abstaining from luxury as an achievement, but forbids it as a sin.

But if anyone does not provide for his own. For personal virtue alone would not be sufficient for salvation, unless one also cares for others. Concerning the widow, Paul says these things. He calls those related by family "own." For some are personal, like friends, but not necessarily family. Therefore, one must care for their own, especially for family members. Which the extravagant does not do, attending only to luxury.

especially for those of his household. He takes care of both his own and those close to him, not only attending to what is appropriate but also to himself, by cutting off passions. Thus Clement says in the seventh Hypotyposes: “He speaks of providence both concerning the soul and concerning the body.”

he has denied the faith. And how does the one who wastes, and does not provide for both his own and his household, deny the faith? Because, it is said: "And from your own seed you shall not be despised." (Isa. 58:7) But if you see God and do not deny Him, yet transgress His laws, you have denied God Himself. For it is said that they acknowledge God in words, but deny Him by their deeds. (Titus 1:16) How then is he worse than an unbeliever? Because although the unbelievers do not provide for everybody, at least they do so for their relatives, being led by the law of nature.
