For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. For he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was brought to him by the majestic glory: "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." We ourselves heard this very voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
When Peter had said that they should diligently attend to themselves, and that those things which had been announced to them were indeed so, and he had explained this at length, frequently: although he knew and they had heard in various ways, he now adds their confirmation and says: I do not apply a vain diligence to these matters, but since I know the truth of them to be certain and undoubted, I dwell on them. And what is this?
We made known to you the power and coming of our Lord, not by human wisdom with adorned speeches, as if deceiving your hearing with tricks, as the Greeks and heretics do: indeed, the Greeks using elaborate speech and deception; the heretics, however, with fabricated words: just as the Valentinians fleeing into profound depths and silence9. For it is likely that they were beginning to arise. Therefore, there is nothing of this kind to be found in us, but we have delivered to you the teaching in a simple and humble manner: which Paul also says to the Corinthians (1 Cor. 2:1): and those things which we have from the sight of our own eyes, we who ascended with him to the holy mountain. Peter says, however, that the Lord showed them on the holy mountain the glory of the Only Begotten (Matt. 17:1), and the voice that they heard from the Father brought down from heaven concerning the Lord. Moreover, since we have known through the things themselves and experience what was proclaimed by the prophets, he says, we judge their prophecy to be more sure through these things: for the things themselves have followed the sayings and oracles.
Furthermore, here through the things that are now proposed. "For he received from God the Father." This participle λαδὼν is either placed in the position of the indicative verb ἔλαδεν, that is, he received: since according to the consequence of the participle, the discourse does not subsequently correspond. Or if this is not pleasing, but someone wishes to take λαδὼν as a proper participle, the discourse will necessarily fall into disorder: if, however, the participle is taken in place of the indicative verb, it will be consistent with what is added, for example: For he received glory from God the Father: and from this we have more firmly whatever has been announced about this by the prophets before: not that any prophecy was delivered from the voice of the Father from on high, but that we have been confirmed by the heavenly voice of the Father which testified that he is the Son, so that all the prophecy of the prophets undoubtedly carries testimony from the Father.
"Here is my beloved Son." (Matt. 3:17) Three times the Father testified to the Son: at baptism, at the passion when He said, "And I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again" (Jn. 12:28); and on the holy mountain.
