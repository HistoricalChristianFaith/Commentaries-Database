See what kind of love the Father has given us, that we should be called children of God. For this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him. Beloved, we are now children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him; for we shall see Him as He is. And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself just as He is pure.
After John spoke about the assembly of antichrists and their perverse doctrine, by which they have made themselves revealed as if by a certain mark [χαρακτηρί]: and he sufficiently strengthened them, so that they would persist immovably in those things in which they had been instructed, he then adds the reward also set aside because of these things, making them stronger through the clarity of the rewards, and says: "abide in Him." (1 Jn. 2:27) Why? “So that when He appears we may have confidence.” (1 Jn. 2:28) For what is clearer or more desirable than the confidence with which we will present our labors completed in life to Christ, doing this with confidence and not experiencing shame at his coming? And since it was likely that some would ask by what works they could become pleasing to Him, John teaches this also and says: If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness is born of Him: (1 Jn. 2:29) for the righteous produces righteous ones. Furthermore, no one is unaware of how this relates to our glory and confidence: just as no one is ignorant of the greatness and quality of the love and kindness he has shown towards you.
For see what he has given us, that we should be called his children. And if this is hidden from those who are in the world, that we are the children of God, do not marvel at this: for this reason the world does not know us, because it did not know Him who adopted us as children. That the world is called a chaotic multitude, we have demonstrated in many places. Then, after John confirmed the adoption, he clearly says after this the glory and confidence or freedom that is reserved for those who have been adopted, and he says:
"Beloved, now we are children of God." But if he were to say: Indeed, Beloved, from the preceding you know that we are adopted as children of God: and if this has not yet been revealed, do not be troubled: for what is now uncertain will be revealed when He is revealed. Indeed, we will display the glory of adoption appearing as His likeness; for children are altogether like their father.
But having confidence toward Him as children, we shall see Him as He is: not certainly according to His nature; for this is impossible for created nature: but what? the righteous of the righteous, the pure of the pure. For like follows the like. For this reason, I said a little earlier that we shall be like Him: not according to nature; for otherwise He would have said not "like," but "the same," but now because this will not happen, He said "like," according to the quality of glory, indeed. It should be noted, however, that he did not say previously, "Everyone who has done or will do righteousness," but "He who does." For virtues always operate: and while they are being done, they have being; but those that cease or are to come, do not even have being.
