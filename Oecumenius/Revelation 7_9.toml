These things, which the discourse has narrated, have been demonstrated to the divine evangelist concerning those sealed from Israel by blood and therefore saved, and also those who have believed. But so that nothing may be lacking in his vision, the prophecy reveals to him the countless myriads of the nations, who after these things run to faith, being present both around the Lord and at the divine throne. For since the Lord is said to arrive at the second coming, which has not yet been announced in the vision, the saints are then "caught up in clouds" to meet the Savior, as the divine apostle has previously described them being caught up. (1 Thess. 4:17)

The vision also shows that they have attained the blessedness reserved for them. For what could be more worthy than to be with Christ and to behold the divine throne?

The countless myriads of the nations, therefore, who have received the faith of Christ and have attained the blessed end, have inherited the glorious place, standing before the Lord and His Father's throne, as was said before.

It is necessary for them to be clothed in white robes, a sign of the purity existing in their life.

The palm branches, being symbols of victory, are said to boast of the victory of Christ both over the invisible enemies and the visible ones.
