The rod, with which he measured the holy city, was for measuring the earth; it was gold because of the worth both of the angel who was doing the measuring and of the city which was being measured. 

He says, And the city lies foursquare, its length the same as its breadth, and its height is the same: the foursquare structure, as those who know about these things hold, is a cube and is so named. It is also foursquare at ground level, but since it is also foursquare and equilateral in all its dimensions, they say that the cube signifies stability. Stable and immutable are the awards for the saints, whose blessedness cannot be effaced by any kind of change. 

He describes the size of the city on a par with the great honor due to the saints, and shows that even if they were far fewer than the multitude of the sinners, they were not so few in number as not to fill so great a city. 

He says, He also measured its wall, a hundred and forty-four cubits by a man’s measure, that is, an angel’s: in many passages according to the custom of Holy Scripture, the angels are called men. This is clear from the interpretation of the archangel Gabriel as “man of God.” And the prophet said, “Lord, you will save men and beasts,” calling the angels “men,” and men “beasts.” For compared with the intelligence of the angels, we men are irrational beasts. For by “men” and “beasts” he did not mean, as one might think, real men and actual beasts. The apostle said about the beasts, “Is it for the oxen that God is concerned?” So according to the prophet, men are to be considered as “beasts,” and angels as “men.” According to Luke, the Lord also called the angels “men” when he said, “Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and you yourselves be like men who are waiting for their master’s return from the marriage feast.” 

Therefore, in many passages angels have been called “men” according to the above evidence, and they have their gaze directed to God. This is why he says, a man’s measure, that is, an angel’s. The saying symbolizes that although the divine is in every way incomprehensible (for we have concluded earlier that Christ is the wall of the city), yet in the judgment of the majesty of God human beings become angels. On account of this the wall of the city has been measured by an angel’s cubit and not a human one. The hundred and forty-four cubits are a sort of mystical number determined by the wisdom of the angels, by which the exact measurement was made. 

He says, The wall was built of jasper: we have already taken jasper to be the quickening and vivifying [power] of Christ. 

And the city, he says, was pure gold, like clear glass: gold, being put alongside brilliance and transparency, is compared with the worth and purity of the saints in their works and words. 

And the foundations, he says, of the wall of the city itself were adorned with every kind of precious stone: as for the foundation of the wall, the Lord is the wall, as has often been said. We spoke earlier of the holy apostles, as though Christ relied on their teaching and depended on them according to the promise he gave, in which he says, “And see, I am with you always, to the close of the age.” These foundations, that is, the apostles, have therefore been adorned with every virtue—for the precious stones express virtue —since they have in fact become pure by the preaching of the gospel, by their struggles on behalf of Christ, and by their love for him even to death. 

But if anyone would wish to quibble about the stones—for one may argue about such a vision—let us be content to say a little more: according to the law of Moses the high-priests were clothed in embroidered garments, invested with a full-length robe, an ephod, a turban, a sash, a girdle, and other things. By their dress they communicated in mystical symbolism awe and dread. They also had the “breast-piece of judgment,” which was attached to the ephod by embroidered cords. 

The design of the breast-piece was “a doubled piece of cloth, a span long and square,” in which were set twelve stones with the names of the sons of Israel, in four rows. Some of these stones were placed here in the foundations of the wall; others were given another name and not included with these. Eight stones in the breast-piece of judgment were like those in the foundations here: jasper, sapphire, emerald, carnelian, chrysolite, beryl, topaz, and amethyst. Four of the stones in the foundations were not included in the breast-piece of judgment. They were chalcedony, sardonyx, chrysoprase, and jacinth. 

And there were also the gates of the city, which we took to be the apostles, each formed from a single pearl. The pearl, too, has now been shown to be new since it was not included with the stones of the breast-piece, so that one may see those who were recently named to be more precious than those set in the breastpiece in the old covenant, by which the holy apostles are shown to have had a knowledge of the old covenant and were well acquainted with the injunctions prescribed in it—so the wise apostle could say, “As to righteousness under the law, I am blameless”—and they are well acquainted with the commandments of the new covenant, too, and have come to a rich understanding of it, which is far clearer and more precious than the knowledge of the old covenant. The requirements of the law were a kind of shadow, but truth is found in the requirements of the new covenant. This is symbolized by the mixture of stones of the old covenant and the new precious stones in the foundations of the city, which, as was said, represent the apostles. 

And this is what the Lord said in the gospels: “Therefore, every teacher of the Law who has become a disciple in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings out of his treasure things new and old.” 

There were, too, he says, the gates of the city, which again we took earlier to be the apostles, each formed from a single pearl, signifying their worth, purity, and brilliance. 

He says, And the street of the city was pure gold, like clear glass: it has already been said that gold and the purity and transparency of glass suggest the worth and purity of the life of the saints. 

He says, And I saw no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God, the sovereign of all, and the Lamb: what is the need of a temple when God is present with the saints and in a way sharing his life with them, and is seen by them face to face, insofar as he may be approached? For the divine apostle has called the knowledge of God in the present life as being “in a mirror” and “dimly,” but that in the future it will be “face to face.” 

One might reasonably ask, “Why did he mention God the sovereign Lord, and the Father, the Lord, and the Lamb, the Son of God, without making mention of the Holy Spirit?” 

To such a questioner one must reply, “My good man, by saying the Lord and God he has named the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit—for this is God—and by saying further, the Lord God, the sovereign of all, he indicated the Holy Trinity by the three titles.” 

But one might go on to ask: “Why, therefore, after mentioning the venerable Trinity in the words The Lord God, the sovereign of all, is its temple, does he separately specify for us the Lamb, who is Christ, so that we no longer think of the Trinity?” 

“This is nonsense,” I would tell him. This is not what we are being taught. By mentioning both the Holy Trinity and the Lamb, the account indicates both that the incarnate Son is one person of the Holy Trinity, and that the Son completes the Holy Trinity in his humanity and is not now apart from his humanity in heaven. He indicated, somewhat obscurely, the incarnate Son by the word God, who is the Son, and by the Lamb he again meant the same Christ, incarnate and of the same essence as we are, animated by a rational soul, in the flesh with which the Word is hypostatically united.
