Everything in the vision was shaped by the evangelist in connection with the design of the Lord in his incarnation—his birth, his temptation, his teachings, the insults to him, and indeed the cross and the resurrection, and the second coming, and in addition to these the rewards and punishments of the saints and the sinners. But nothing had been said about the accounts of the heralds of his second coming, so, as though by a turnabout, these matters are now explained. 

It is clear to everyone that the divine Scripture predicted that Elijah the Tishbite would come, because Malachi says, “See, I will send you Elijah the Tishbite before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes, who will turn the heart of the father to his son, and the heart of a man to his neighbor, lest I come and smite the land with might.” And in Matthew’s gospel the Lord says of the Baptist, “and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.” 

We have not heard anything at all clear about any other herald, except that Genesis said about Enoch, “because he was well-pleasing to God he was taken up,” and the wise apostle said about him, “By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him.” 

An old tradition holds sway in the church: with Elijah the Tishbite, Enoch will also come as the precursor of the second coming of Christ, as he prepares to take his stand against the Antichrist; for they say that they came first and testified that the signs which the Antichrist would perform were deception and that one should not believe the wretch. 

It is about these that the vision now says that they will prophesy for so many days, meaning either some mystical number or one which will actually be the truth. 

They will do this, he says, clothed in sackcloth. For they will mourn over the disobedience of humankind at that time. 

He says, These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord on the earth. The blessed prophet Zechariah saw a lampstand supporting seven lamps, and two olive branches, but the branches were set in two pipes of the lamps, as he said, “What are these two olive branches, which are in the two golden pipes?” And he heard the angel responding, “They are the anointed ones, who stand by the Lord of all the earth.” 

Surely he is not speaking about them now? For it is with the definite article that he says, these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, explaining this by reference to an accepted symbolism, except that he here called the two pipes two lampstands. That the two olive branches were interpreted as referring to the two peoples, those of the Jews and those from the nations, was not unknown to the saints. Nevertheless, he can also mean the two prophets who are now under discussion. 

He says that if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouths and protects them, and they have the authority to close the sky, so that no rain should fall during the days of their prophesying. This is very plausible, for if one of them, Elijah the Tishbite, had such authority even before the ministry of Christ, why should it be incredible that he should be seen as heralding Christ? 

He says, And they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to smite the earth with every plague, as often as they wish. For since “the coming” of the Antichrist will take place “by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,” as Paul says in writing the second epistle to the Thessalonians, the signs are [Satan’s] instrument to draw [people] to agree and believe [in them]. That is why the two prophets who say that the Antichrist is a deceiver and a cheat will use all sorts of signs to draw their hearers to faith.
