“But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels.” Paul endeavors to show that what was said applies to Christ, and he says that even if he subjected all things, it does not yet seem to fit him; and yet we showed that ultimately even this will occur; but then that he was made a little lower than the angels, this fits Him rather than us. For he indeed, having been three days in Hades as a man, was a little inferior to the angels, since he was in no way subject to death there; but we, being destroyed for a long time, are not briefly but far more greatly made inferior to the angels. And that to be crowned with glory and honor because of the passion suits Him more than it does us.
“because of the suffering of death.” Having spoken of the suffering of death, he revealed true death. For it was not an illusion of death, but an active suffering.
"crowned with glory and honor." He calls the cross glory and honor. For to make heaven and earth and man and the powers above is not as worthy of God and exceedingly glorious as to deem it worthy to be crucified for us. This he says also comforting them, as if he were saying, "If Christ endured these things for us, what great thing is it if you also endure trials for him?"
"so that by the grace of God." For it is by the grace of the Holy Trinity that the Son suffered. For the Father did not give the Son according to obligation, nor did the Son accept it, nor did the Spirit cooperate in the Cross, but everything happened by grace.
It is rightly said, "he might taste." For He did not remain in death, but only in a certain manner did He taste it.

It should be noted that the Nestorians distort the Scripture, and thus they read it in such a way that He tasted death apart from God, constructing this by asserting that Christ had the indwelling of the Word of God and not a union, claiming that His divinity did not accompany Him while He was crucified.
Indeed, it has been said, they argue, "Without God he would taste death." But see how a certain orthodox one has responded. First of all, it is stated, χάριτι Θεοῦ, that is, grace or through the grace of God; yet even if it is said as you wish, χωρὶς Θεοῦ, that is, “without God”, it must be understood that Christ died without God or except for God for everyone. For he did not die only for men, but also for the heavenly powers, to break down the barrier of separation and unite the lower with the higher. (Eph. 2:14)This is similar to what has been said elsewhere. But when it is said that all things are subjected, it is evident that it is outside of the one who subjected all things to Himself. (1 Cor. 15:28)

"taste death for everyone." Not only for the faithful, but for the whole world. For even if not all were saved because of their own unbelief, he himself bore his own on behalf of all and for all. And rightly so, "he might taste"; for he did not remain in death, but only in a certain way tasted it; for he immediately rose again. Therefore, in this respect, he is greater than the angels, because he proved to be superior to death.
"For it was fitting that he." It was fitting, Paul says, for God and the Father for whom are all things; he is indeed the beginning of all things.
"by whom all things exist." For if all things are indeed through him, the Father is the one who created all things, who begot the Creator.
"through whom all things exist." See the phrase "through whom," which is placed with the Father. For if there were a decrease, it would belong only to the Son, and it would be added to the Father. But what does the phrase "through whom" mean? Understand this: since he said "through whom all things," so that no one might conceive anything absurd, that he is needed by all; (for the preposition "by" also means something like this, as when we say, "through the man the creation came into being"); he introduced "through whom," explaining that "through" means in this way, "through him," that is, all things having been made by him. Therefore, also concerning the Son, when the phrase "through whom" is said, accept it thus, instead of "by whom."
"in bringing many sons." He says that the one who brought them in, in the glory of the only-begotten, through the gift of adoption, the Author of their salvation, their sons, that is, Christ, was perfected through sufferings, in order to show perfect and glorious, as through the cross.And he is a Son, and we are sons; but he is genuine; we, however, are adopted; he saves; we are being saved; we are united with him, and again we are separated; through him, who has brought many sons to glory, we share; through him, the author of their salvation, we are separated.
perfected through sufferings; that is, to complete what was lacking in Him. But what was lacking in Christ, as one might think of a man? The immortal part, namely, so that He might have the image continuously. Therefore, the Father fulfilled what was lacking to Him through the resurrection; for having risen, His death no longer has dominion; and through Him, filling all men,(Rom. 6:9) just as the same apostle says elsewhere: "And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him." (Heb. 5:9) Thus, the holy Cyril and in the one hundred sixty-fourth chapter of Philalethes.
