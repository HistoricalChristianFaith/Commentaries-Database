"who have come out." This is what it says: Although in all other respects they were equal in condition and honor, yet from the fact that these indeed gave tithes, while those received them, great excellence is shown. If this is so, it is clear that even in Abraham and Melchizedek, when Abraham gave tithes, Melchizedek received them. Therefore, he who was a type and figure of Christ was greater than the patriarch Abraham: and if Abraham himself, much more the priests. But if the type was greater, what can anyone say about Christ?
