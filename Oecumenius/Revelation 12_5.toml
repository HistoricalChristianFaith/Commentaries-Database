And who is this one born, the male, reveal to us more clearly, O John, who says he will shepherd all the nations with an iron rod? You have plainly told us, O divine one, that our Savior and Lord is Jesus Christ; for it has been promised to him by the Father that "he shall ask from me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance, and the ends of the earth as your possession; you will shepherd them with an iron rod, and like a potter's vessel, you will break them." (Ps. 2:8-9)

And it is said that her child was caught up to God and to His throne. The venomous Dragon plotted, and he persuaded Herod to destroy the children in Bethlehem, so that he might find the Lord among them. But by the providence of the Father, the child escaped the plot; for Joseph heard a divine warning to take the child and his mother and flee into Egypt, because Herod was about to seek the child's life. (Matt. 2:13-23)
