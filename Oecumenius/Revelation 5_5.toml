That the Lord according to his humanity arose from Judah, the divine apostle is witness when he said, “For it is evident that our Lord Jesus Christ has risen from Judah (Heb. 7:14).” One might be surprised that he did not say of him, “A shoot from the root of Jesse,” or “A flower sprung up from the root,” as Isaiah said (Isa. 11:1), but he called him a root of David. He says this to show that according to his human nature he was a shoot sprung from the root of Jesse and David; but according to his divine nature, he himself is the root, not only of David but of all visible and invisible creation, since he is the cause of the universe.

For he said to me, “Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open its seven seals.” He who has conquered our conqueror, the devil, it says, that is the one who has opened the scroll and its seals. And who was this “Lion from the tribe of Judah”? Obviously, the Christ, concerning whom the patriarch Jacob spoke: “He lay down and couched as a lion and as a lion’s whelp. Who will arouse him?” For the holy apostle is witness that the Lord was from Judah according to the flesh: “It is evident that our Lord Jesus Christ was descended from Judah.” Someone might wonder why he was not called “a rod from the root of Jesse” or “flower coming out of the root,” as Isaiah said, but rather the “root of David.” He says this to show that although according to his humanity he was a rod coming forth from the root of Jesse and David, according to his deity he was the root not only of David but of every visible and invisible creature, since he was the source of them all.
