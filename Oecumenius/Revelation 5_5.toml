Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep! Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed to open the seven seals of the little scroll." He said, He who has overcome our conqueror (the Devil), this one who opened the little scroll and the seals.

Who is the lion of the tribe of Judah, but certainly Christ, concerning whom the patriarch Jacob said: "He crouched like a lion and like a young lion; who will rouse him?" (Gen. 49:9) And that the Lord arose according to the flesh from Judah, the divine apostle testified, saying it is evident that our Lord Jesus Christ arose from Judah (Heb. 7:14); and one might marvel why he did not say "a rod from the root of Jesse," nor "a flower from the root," as Isaiah said (Isa. 11:1), but rather "the Root of David." He says this, showing that according to the human aspect, the rod was from the root of Jesse and David sprouting forth; but according to the divine aspect, the root itself is not only David, but of all visible and invisible creation, being the cause of all things, as has been stated before.
