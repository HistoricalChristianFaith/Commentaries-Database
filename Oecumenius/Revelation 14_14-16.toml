While he sees the Lord dignified to be the son of man, he also sees him riding on a cloud. It is either really a cloud, since this is what the gospel says whose witness I described earlier, or he refers to an angelic power. Scripture says, “He rode on cherubim and flew, he flew upon the wings of the winds.” He calls the angels a cloud, on account of the height and loftiness of their nature and worth, or perhaps he calls the God-bearer a cloud on which he is riding, so giving honor to his human mother. For this is how Isaiah foresees it when he says, “Behold, the Lord is seated on a light cloud and will come to Egypt, and the idols of Egypt will be shaken at his presence.” 

Interpreting this text, Aquila says that the cloud is a “light thickness,” thick, as I imagine, because it is a human being and flesh, and light because it is pure, blameless, and not weighed down by a single sin, and also because it is a high pathway to heaven for the soul. This is then how you should consider the cloud. And it is white because of the purity and luminosity of the beings in the vision. 

And the crown symbolizes the kingship of our Lord Jesus Christ; for Christ is the king both of spiritual and material things, and the crown is golden since it connotes the glory of his kingship in terms of value as we understand it. 

That he has a sickle in his hand intimates his being seated with authority [to bring in] the end of the age. 

Why does the angel also say to him, Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour for reaping has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe; and he threw his sickle, he says, and the earth was reaped? The harvest is described in the gospels as abundant, “but the laborers are few”; but there the harvest meant the assembling of the faithful; but here it means the finale of human beings, so that if there were any chaff among them or unfulfilled work or something deserving to be burned, it would be handed over to fire.
