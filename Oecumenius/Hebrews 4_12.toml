"For the word of God is living." It gradually shows that Christ alone was the one who acted in what happened concerning the children of Israel. For it is living, he says, and will live forever. But lest they think that those who sin and provoke Christ are only frustrated by the earth as the ancients were, he adds a more terrible deed.
"sharper than any two-edged sword." As those who did not hear the speech might fear something more terrible, it expresses what has been said, adapting examples that are among us: for it could not be understood in any other way than what is said, cutting from both sides with any sword.
"piercing to the division of soul and spirit." He says something fearful: either that the spirit separates from the soul, and leaves it desolate of the holiness that the Lord in the gospel called division; (for just as a king, when a ruler sins, is stripped of his belt and his office beforehand, and then punished; so here too the spiritual dignity is first taken away from the person, then he is punished;) or that it even reaches the incorporeal themselves.
The holy Cyril certainly received in a certain place: piercing to the division of soul and spirit: He says that the preaching concerning God divides and distinguishes the parts of the soul, making them receptive and capable of the things heard. That it also reaches them, he says, of the incorporeal beings, and punishes the soul. That it works a division of soul and spirit. It is indeed fearful.
In another way.

The division that the Gospels threaten, the Fathers understood as the complete abandonment of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I think it is now a day that causes the separation of the Holy Spirit, and it removes itself from the soul, after which all good things will subsequently follow and be taken away.

"of joints and marrow." So that, having heard the things of the soul, they do not become careless, as if the punishment were unclear, having spoken of the incorporeal, he also speaks of the corporeal; for the more visible things strike with greater fear.
"and discerning the thoughts." To distinguish and examine the very thoughts themselves, and the invisible concepts of the heart. Here the divinity of the Word is shown; for it is God who examines, that is, who tests and knows the thoughts; he says "God searches the hearts and kidneys." (Jer. 17:10).
