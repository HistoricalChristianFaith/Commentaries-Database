"By faith Jacob, as he was dying." — Here, he says not only this, but also therefore he encouraged those to come, as he would also demonstrate in the work itself. For he was about to rise another king from Ephraim.
Therefore, he says, And he adored at the top of his staff, that is, even being old, he worships Joseph, indicating the worship of all, that which was to come to him. And this because he knew that his brothers had adored [προσεκύνησεν] him.It was about to be revealed later, through the ten tribes.

"and he adored at the top of the staff." For he signified the kingdom of Ephraim and the overthrow of the ten tribes. Therefore, he himself prefigures their adoration.

For he believed so much, he says, in what was to come, that he also adored with the staff, thinking he was seeing what was to come. For from the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, kings were to arise from the seed of Ephraim. Therefore, revealing the kingdom to his seed, he adored at the top of the staff of Manasseh. It is written in the book of Genesis thus: "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years." (Gen. 47:28)And the days of Jacob's life were one hundred and forty-seven years. And the days of Israel drew near to die, and he called his son Joseph and said to him: "If I have found grace in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; do not bury me in Egypt, but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said. And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed." (Gen. 47:29-31) —
By faith, Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning his bones. For he believed so much that they would come out of Egypt, that he also swore that his bones would be carried away. What then? So that always remembering the oaths of Joseph, they might see also the matters concerning the exodus. For who would have sworn that his bones would be carried away, if he did not strongly believe that they would go out?
