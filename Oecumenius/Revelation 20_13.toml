And the sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and each was judged according to their works.

Those who disbelieve in the resurrection of bodies mock both us and our doctrine that these bodies will be raised again, as if this were not only difficult but wholly impossible. And they say that each of the bodies on earth is composed of the four basic elements, fire, water, earth, air, and that bodies dissolved by death return to those elements from which they were originally formed. Therefore, the fiery element in us returns to its kindred universal fire; the watery element to water; and the other components to their proper counterparts. If then these are dissolved and mingled with their own substances, how can that which has become indiscernible by composition be restored again to every one of the bodies which you call bodies, unless you would say that some arise from others rather than from their own? To these one might reply with the words of the divine Scripture: "You are mistaken, O men, not knowing the power of God," (Matt. 22:20) by whose will all things were constituted, whose will alone accomplishes the work intended, as has also been said before.

For what is easier than for what is not to bring into being the substances, or having been produced and mingled either with themselves or with others to separate them again, and to assign to each its own? For the last indeed we perform too, often separating artfully the wine that has been mixed with water. Moreover the sun draws from the sea the drinkable and sweet by means of the vapors and exhalations, and lets go the heavy and earthy and salty and bitter. And first this belongs to God alone, who is able to do all things whatever He wishes. If then God brought the non-being into being, how would it not be easy for him to separate again for himself the things mixed according to the elements, and to distribute the same to each body, even if this is impossible for men? For just as it is impossible for you and for me to separate the illuminating from the burning aspect of fire, but possible for God, for "the voice of the Lord has been said to cut off the flame of fire," (Ps. 29:7) so also the things that have been mingled are impossible for you and for me, but easy and effortless for God.

Now this marvelous assertion is presented to us by the present account of the Revelation, saying, "The sea gave up the dead that were in it from the sea." And this element of water signified every moist substance. The moist substance, then, he says, gave as much as was contained in it from the watery parts of human bodies.

And Death and Hades, he says, gave up the dead who were in them. Calling the earth "death" because our bodies are dissolved in it, therefore also the inspired prophet, by indirectness, calls death "earth of death," saying "and brought me down into the earth of death." (Ps. 21:16) Therefore the whole earth gave what in it was our earthly part. In addition, Hades gave up the dead who were in it, calling Hades the air and the fire because of their invisibility and imperceptibility. For the air, by its thinness, happens to be invisible unless it were thickened; and the fire that once dwelt in the woods is invisible, unless it were applied outwardly. Moreover, the element of fire, the ether, is invisible to us because it is darkened by the superaddition of much air. Or rather, he calls fire Hades because it imparts invisibility and imperceptibility to whatever it seizes; therefore many of the learned designate it as "invisible." When therefore each of the elements had given up as much as of the human composition was in them, the resurrection was affected.

When this had taken place, he says, each was judged according to their deeds.
