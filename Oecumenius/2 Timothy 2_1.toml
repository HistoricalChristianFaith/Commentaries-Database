You therefore, my child, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus.

Paul indicates great kindness by what is added, "my child." "If you are my child," he says, "imitate your father." For the teacher's rebuke is accustomed to add boldness to the student.

Therefore, Paul says: "be strong." If anything of this kind happens to you, do not fall, but look to the reward.

be strong in the grace. But be strengthened, Paul says, not only by my example, but also through the grace given through Christ. For if he did not justify by his own blood, the grace of the Spirit would not have come. Therefore, he says, have the Spirit as an ally.
