And they cry out, “Salvation belongs to our God and to the Lamb,” confessing that salvation is with them, since, having been sealed as servants of God, they were rescued from the universal destruction of the world. And when they rendered their thanksgiving, all the heavenly hosts, together with the elders, respond with “Amen,” adding their own approval to that which had been said. Then the holy angels add their own praise to God, giving him honor with a sevenfold praise, which, as was earlier noted, signifies the neverending praise of the angels, for the number seven suggests perfection.
