"the God of peace." First, asking for their prayers and honoring them even in this way, Paul himself also prays for them. Since, he says, God is peace, you ought not to be stirred up against me from mere gossip and to have hostility.
"who brought up from the dead the great Shepherd of the sheep." Which one? Our Lord, he says, Jesus. He affirms to them a certain word about the resurrection, taking the use from the prophecy of Isaiah (Isa. 40:11). And while there were also other shepherds, minor ones, he said the great one. For many are the prophets and teachers, but one is the instructor, Christ.
“by the blood of the eternal covenant.” That is to say, He raised him from the dead who had died, and having poured out his blood, that this might be for us an eternal covenant, that is, not to be cancelled, as the legal one, but everlasting. Thus: He raised him from the dead by the blood of an eternal covenant. For when he was raised, his blood was granted to us for an eternal covenant. For if he had not been raised, his blood would not have been for us a covenant.
"equip you in every good work." That is, to fulfill, to perfect. It shows, therefore, that they have begun the good works; they needed to be perfected in them; Paul who also prays for them. But see, that we must begin first, and then ask from God for the end.
"That you do His will." For he who is equipped and filled for every good work, he has the strength to do the will of God. And he says every work, work and faith.
"working in us that which is pleasing in his sight." When He equips us for every good work, to do His will, then He produces in us what is pleasing to Him. And what is pleasing to Him? It is to do His will. And when He said, which is pleasing, He added, in His sight. For we are truly pleasing when we appear good before God, not when we appear so only before men.
"through Jesus Christ." He says, He does what is pleasing to Him, through us as go-betweens. Do you see that everything is of God? This He will do and accomplish for us, what is pleasing to Him, through Christ. For if He wished to be a mediator between God and us, it is fitting that the Father will accomplish what is pleasing to Himself for us through Him.
"bear with the word of encouragement." Gladly accept the encouragement sent to you through the letters from me. Paul does not say, of counsel or exhortation, but, because of the tribulations in which they were, he speaks of encouragement, that is, of consolation, of the call to endure.
"for I have written to you briefly." Briefly, as it relates to what is to be said in the future, there are indeed many things, if everything has been said.
"You should know that our brother Timothy has been released." Rather, they did not have a grudge against Timothy, which is why Paul writes about him. What does it mean, “released”? Either that he was in prison and was released; or that he was being released from Athens, because he was there.
"with whom I shall see you if he comes soon." Timothy was released; but if he comes to me soon, I will see you together with him, coming to you. For it was likely that he had been released, but had not yet gone to Paul.
"Greet all your leaders." See how Paul honors them, for he addresses the leaders through them; for it was more fitting to command the leaders and to address the ones being led through them; but he wisely heals the weaker ones.
"Those from Italy greet you." Therefore, I am so filled with you that not only do I greet you myself, but I also establish such a longing towards you in others, that even from such a distance they desire you, and for this reason, they greet you.
"Grace be with all of you." Since grace is something common, it is prayed for mutually for all, both leaders and those being led. But what is grace? It is the forgiveness of sins, the cleansing, the participation in the Spirit. How can it be with you all? If you do not insult the support of God, sinning and being negligent, if you do not live unworthily of it. For grace remains when we have good works; it departs when we do not live according to the command of the one who gives it to us. But let it be, knowing this, and all that we have received through it, not to conduct ourselves in arrogance towards such great goods bestowed upon us; but through good works glorifying Him, and showing that this grace was not given to ungrateful and thankless people, to have it unyielding in our souls, in Christ Himself, the supporter of our souls. With whom be glory to the Father, together with the Holy Spirit, now and always, and until forever and ever. Amen.
The end, with the aid of divine favor, of the Epistle to the Hebrews.
It was written from Italy by Timothy.
