If those of us who have received the incarnate Word say that he is someone other than the one who was with the Father from all eternity and in the last days was born of Mary, are we not denying that he is our one Lord and master? For there is but one Lord Jesus according to the union of divinity and humanity. He was the Word of God and God before all ages, and from the beginning of his conception in the womb of the holy virgin he added human flesh to the glory of his divinity.
