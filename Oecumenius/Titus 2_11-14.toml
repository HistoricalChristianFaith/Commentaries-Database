For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age, waiting for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ; who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a peculiar people for his own possession, eager to do good works.

Then Paul also gives a reason why slaves ought to be such toward their masters. For he says that the grace of God has appeared, educating us. Therefore, since we have become pupils of God’s discipline, how could we not owe it to act in a manner worthy of His teaching?

training us to renounce. The appearance of our Savior God, that is, the revealing in the flesh, not only freed from former sins, but also made us safer for the future. For, as it says, denying signifies great abstinence.

ungodliness and worldly passions. Paul speaks of ungodliness as the doctrines of the wicked, and of worldly desires as those both of the soul and of the flesh, and all those that simply do not lead us to heaven. And the term "self-controlled" does not only signify abstinence from bodily pleasures and their love, but also from every passion.

in the present age. For this age has the struggle, but the age that is to come has the rewards.

waiting for the blessed hope. Behold also the rewards. For nothing is truly more blessed than His revealing.

of the glory. For the second coming of Jesus will be with glory, unlike the first which was in humility.

of our great God. Where now are the inventors of impious doctrines, who assert that Christ is not God, or is lesser than the Father? For in this place the Apostle openly professes that Christ is even the great God. Truly great, he does not distinguish against some lesser god: by no means! but absolutely so great that no one greater can be understood by it.

a peculiar people. This is, different from others, abundantly beloved, having nothing in common with the remaining peoples.

eager to do good works. Do you see that even in our needs? Eager, Paul says, that is, going towards virtue with much excitement. For it was solely out of his own kindness that he freed us from the sins of old. And he accomplished virtue both for himself and for us.

Obedience to authority should be shown as applies to the meekness of Christ.
