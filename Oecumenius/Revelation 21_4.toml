And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And Isaiah the prophet said a similar thing, saying "death was swallowed up in victory, and again God took away every tear from every face." (Isa. 25:8) For if according to the divine apostle in that blessed Life of the Saints "pain and sorrow and groaning have fled away," (Isa. 51:11) what kind of tear will remain for those who have escaped these things?

He says the former things are passed away. He says the suffering of the saints has reached an end. Now the mutual exchanges of pains are provided.
