“And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes,” it says. The prophet Isaiah says something similar to this: “Death has prevailed and swallowed [people] up, but again God has taken every tear away from every face.” For if, as the holy apostle says, “pain and sorrow and sighing have fled away” in that blissful life of the saints, how would any tears remain in the absence of those things? “The former things have passed away,” it says. By this he means that the suffering of the saints has come to an end. Now the rewards for their toils have come.
