And it says that he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. That is, he becomes the successor of the power of the Devil, and prepares all to worship him, whose deadly wound was healed. This has been said among the preceding. Now it must only be marked. For since he said that he has all the authority of the first beast before him, and first of all he named the Dragon the fiery one, whom the vision shown in heaven revealed, so that no one might think to say now that he received the authority as that of the first beast, I am not speaking about that first of all of all, but of him who comes after that one, yet before the Antichrist, whom the vision showed rising from the sea like a leopard (Rev. 13:1-2). For the wound of this one's death was healed, as stated above.
