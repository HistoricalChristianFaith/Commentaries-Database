quote='''
And he was cast down to the earth, either suffering this visibly, or because having been deprived of his angelic and heavenly rank, he was cast down to an earthly mindset. Then, just as one defending himself, he blames God for his downfall, since it was not possible for him to harm God himself, he harms God's servants, the people, and tries to deceive and turn them away from God, thinking that by doing this he is harming the same Master.
