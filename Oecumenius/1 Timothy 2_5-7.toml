For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, who gave himself as a ransom for all, the testimony given at the proper time; for this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth in Christ, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.

For there is one God, and one mediator. Note that he did not say, Two, but, One and one, thus avoiding the multiplication of gods. Since the one who was to mediate was absent, to partake of both so that He could also mediate, the Son of God, the eternal Logos [ὁ προαιώνιος Λόγος], having become incarnate, came forth, existing from two natures, namely from divinity and humanity, and is understood and worshiped in one person after the union. For if the Only Begotten had appeared to us in bare divinity, creation would not have shown Him, where the sons of Israel were not able to see the face of Moses. But the phrase "One God" is not placed in opposition to the Son or the Spirit—far from it!—but against those who are not, called gods. It is asked why the Spirit is not mentioned. Because the discussion was about the Greeks. For concerning them is the phrase, "and to come to the knowledge of the truth." (1 Tim. 2:4) Among them there was polytheism, and he carefully guarded the economy of remembering the "Spirit," lest somehow he introduce the appearance of polytheism. Since he converses there with the faithful, he continually remembers Him, often even alone, not bringing to mind the Father and the Son.

the man Christ Jesus. As He was man, so He was also God, indivisibly, inseparably.

who gave himself as a ransom for all, and of the Greeks. Therefore, he died for all, but you do not endure to pray? Note then the phrase, "who gave himself." For this is against the Arians, who say that he was delivered up unwillingly. But what is the price of redemption? Nature was unwilling to perish, but Jesus gave Himself for it.

the testimony. That is, through the testimony the Son became a ransom. The interpreter now says this means that the testimony is called a ransom, that is, the passion. For He came to bear witness to the truth. He testified by what He did, that He Himself is Christ, the Son of God, even to death. For He also revealed the Father, and introduced the true doctrine and the true and angelic life, given at the proper time, He says. That is, when people were suitably disposed toward faith. Thus Clement of Alexandria in the seventh “Hypotyposes.”

at the proper time. Through the testimony, he gave himself, he says, as a ransom. Through the testimony, that is, through the passion (for in it he bears witness to the goodness of the Father that he gave both himself and the Son. But they did not cease their hostility toward him, but even crucified the Son. And that he wishes to fulfill the promises to them, but they do not want it), in proper time, he says, having been prefigured and predestined by the holy and blessed Trinity.

for this I was appointed. To which I was appointed as a testimony and a passion, and I was set apart as a preacher, so that I might make the cross revealed everywhere. And since he was about to say, "teacher of the Gentiles," it seemed unbelievable if the idolaters were called, he proclaimed beforehand: "I speak the truth, I do not lie." (Rom. 9:1)

teacher of the Gentiles. Since there is also the practice of proclaiming hastily, he called himself Teacher. For I did not only proclaim, but also, remaining, I taught. This, however, shows God's zeal concerning the Gentiles.

in faith and truth. Since he said, "in faith," so that no one might think that it is deceit, he adds, "in truth." I do not preach with persuasive words or with linguistic twists, but in faith. For this shows the power of the preaching.
