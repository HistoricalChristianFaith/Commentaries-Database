To Timothy, a genuine child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.

a genuine child. Wow! The faith that Timothy demonstrated, that even through it he became a genuine child of Paul! For nothing changed according to the faith.

Grace, mercy. Here mercy is prayed for, not as usual, showing both the desire towards it, and that teachers need more mercy.

On the guidance into the love of God, which is not required by legal necessity.
