To you therefore who believe, honor is given. But to those who do not believe, the stone which the builders rejected has become the head of the corner, and a stone to stumble over, and a rock to offend: namely, to those who stumble at the word, being disobedient to that which they were also appointed.
"To you therefore who believe, honor is given." To God, namely, who said, I lay, honor is given: but against the unbelievers, this is what God now says: I lay for you in Sion a stone on which you will stumble over: which is both a rock to which they will stumble, and a rock on which they will stumble if they fall: who, namely, the unbelievers, remaining in the word, stumble over it: for which, namely, they were also appointed. Therefore, the whole part must be ordered in this way: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes in Him will by no means be put to shame [Isa. 28:16]: precious to you who believe, but to the unbelievers, a stone over which they will stumble: which stone the builders rejected, but has become the head of the corner, uniting the believers into one: but to the fallen, it is for those who stumble, namely, not believing in the word of the Gospel.
"to that which they were also appointed." not as if they are separated from God, this has been said. For no cause of destruction is administered by Him who desires all men to be saved, but those who have made themselves vessels of wrath, and unbelief has followed, and in that order they have been given to what they had prepared themselves for. For if man has been made free in will, and cannot be obligated in free will, no one could respectfully accuse him who has decreed such a fate for himself, which he has brought upon himself through his own actions.
Furthermore, Christ is called the head of the corner, as he completes the two walls of the Father's house, joining those who were from the nations and the Jews through his own contract, and adapting them into one fitting unity: indeed removing useless sacrifices from the midst, while transferring demonic superstition to the true worship of God.
