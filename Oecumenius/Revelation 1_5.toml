Having previously written about the incorporeal Word of God, and having spoken about Him as "He who was"; now John speaks about His incarnation, saying,

"and from Jesus Christ," not dividing Him into two, but testifying both this and that about Him, that He is both the Word of the Father and that He was incarnate.

Who is a "faithful witness"; for according to the apostle, he bore witness before Pontius Pilate to the good confession. (1 Tim. 6:13)

which "He was," that he is God and Lord of all, even though he was incarnate.

And such "witness" is indeed true; for he speaks the truth and is worthy of faith.

"the firstborn of the dead." This also Paul bears witness to, saying that "He is the first fruits, the firstborn from the dead." (Col. 1:18) He is called "the firstborn from the dead" as the one who has superiority in the common resurrection, and who has initiated for us a new and living way, the resurrection from the dead, through the veil, that is, his flesh according to what is written. For all who rose from the dead before the Lord again fell under death; for that was not the true resurrection, but a temporary release from death. Therefore, none of them was called "firstborn from the dead." But the Lord is called this, as having become the beginning and cause of the true resurrection. And just as having become a kind of first fruits of the resurrection of mankind, having become like one who also went before, as if from a certain threshing floor, from death to life. For concerning the Lord alone, the divine Paul wrote in his Epistle to the Romans, saying: "knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies no more; death no longer has dominion over him. For he who has died, has died once for sin; but he who lives, lives for God." (Rom. 6:9-10)

"and the ruler of the kings of the earth," Daniel also said this to the Babylonian: he says. "Until he says you will know that the Most High rules over the kingdom of heaven; and to whomsoever he will, he gives it." (Dan. 5:22) Therefore, Christ reigns over all those things in Heaven. But now John speaks concerning those on earth; and going forward, he shows Him also reigning over the holy orders in Heaven.
