Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds. Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our words. In my first defense, no one came to my support, but all deserted me (may it not be counted against them). But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the preaching might be fully accomplished and all the Gentiles might hear it. I was rescued from the lion’s mouth, and the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

Paul also showed Timothy to endure bravely the troubles from common people. For it is painful to be wronged, especially by common people.

the Lord will repay him. Not because Paul was pleased with the punishment, but because for the sake of the weaker among the believers, those who were excessively opposing had to suffer badly, so that they would not despise the weakness of the preaching.

according to his deeds. Or that it is a prophecy of things to come, not a curse.

Beware of him yourself. Paul did not say, Punish, punish (for it was also permitted for Timothy to do this through the spirit), but, Beware. Do you see that he does not allow punishment? But the "Beware" is like a warning.

opposed our words. That is, to those of the preaching.

In my first defense. Paul already appeared before Nero and escaped. But when he instructed his cupbearer, then he was beheaded. For Nero did not have such zeal towards idols; he was thus relentless in all things.

but all deserted me. The Jews, Paul says, the brothers.

may it not be counted against them. Do you see that Paul not only does not wish to be avenged, but also prays for their forgiveness? And yet he suffered terrible things. For it is not the same to be betrayed by strangers as by one's own people.

But the Lord stood by me. For the Lord does not abandon the one forsaken by men. He strengthened me, Paul says; that is, the Lord granted boldness and did not allow me to fall. Do you see a counsel to the disciple, and again another comfort?

so that through me the preaching. See the humility. For I was helped not as worthy of assistance, but because of the preaching, so that it might be fully accomplished and come to an end.

and all the Gentiles might hear it, Paul says. "So that the power of the preaching and the care concerning me may become evident to all."

from the lion’s mouth. It refers to the lion, that is Nero, because of his cruelty and beastliness.

and the Lord will rescue me. If He will deliver, how does He say, "I am already being poured out"? But see. Then indeed the Lord delivered Paul from Nero, but now no longer from Nero, (for enough has happened according to the Gospel,) but from every sin, that is, the Lord will not allow one who has been condemned in anything to perish.

will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. Paul says, "He will snatch me from there, and will keep me." For this means, "He will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom." Therefore, this is the true salvation, when we shine there.

To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. See the doxology for the Son as well as for the Father elsewhere, and for the Spirit; here indeed is the Lord, namely the Son.
