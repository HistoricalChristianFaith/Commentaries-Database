Above the ark there was, so to speak, a certain golden, rectangular table, which was called “seat of propitiation,” signifying Christ, who is called our “propitiation” and “redemption.” … In Exodus, in the passages concerning these things he says that the high priest enters the Holy of Holies twice during the day, as he sacrifices. For it is written as follows: “And Aaron will burn an offering of pleasant mixture of incense on it”—that is, on top of the golden altar which was in the Holy of Holies—“early in the morning. Whenever he trims the lamps, he will burn incense on it, and whenever he lights the lamps in the evening, he will offer a perpetual burning of incense.” How then does the blessed apostle say, “the high priest alone enters and that but once a year”? And we say that he enters only once a year with “blood,” as he says in the same passage of Exodus, making sacrifice twice that day. For also he says, “Not without taking blood,” that is, with blood, in order that it might be so. For once a year the high priest alone enters with blood, not with the fragrant offering of incense.
