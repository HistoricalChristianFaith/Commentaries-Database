And it happened that the Jews neither saw the things that were happening, as the veil was being torn. So it was not more for them than for those who were prefigured, that is, for us,
"once a year, the high priest alone." Since he approached them while they were still infants, how could one sacrifice of Christ cleanse the sins of the world? This is also shown in the old, which is a type of the new.

In Exodus, in the places concerning these things, it says that on the day the high priest entered the Holy of Holies with the holy incense. And it is written thus; "And he shall burn incense upon it.” (that is, upon the golden altar that was in the Holy of Holies); Aaron shall burn a finely blended incense in the morning when he tends to the lamps, he shall burn incense upon it. And when Aaron lights the lamps in the evening, he shall burn incense, a continual incense. (Ex. 30:10)

How then does the divine Paul say in this place, "once a year, the high priest alone?" And we say that he indeed entered with blood once a year: as is also said in the aforementioned place of Exodus; but to offer, on these days every day.
Indeed, he also adds here: "not without blood," that is, with blood; so that this is the sense: Once a year the high priest with blood, not with incense.
"without blood." After sacrifices, he says. So also the blood was a type of Christ.
"which he offers for himself." He adds everywhere, For himself, showing Christ's excellence above the high priest of the Jews.For the legal high priest offered for himself; but Christ did not offer for himself; for how could he, who is separate from sinners? Thus there is a great difference between the two.
"and of the ignorance of the people”, he says. And from this, he shows the difference, that the sacrifices according to the law were offered for ignorance. For those in ignorance were allowed sins, indeed, the sacrifice of Christ, even those sins whom we knowingly have committed.
