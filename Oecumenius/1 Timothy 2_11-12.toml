Not only does he require women to be modest, but also silent and submissive; for through silence, they signify submission.

I do not permit a woman to teach. He removed every opportunity for a woman to speak. For since he commanded them to be silent, so that they would not speak under the grounds of a reasonable excuse for teaching, he says, "Nor let them teach," not only human things but also spiritual ones. And he forbade teaching in the assembly. For he did not entirely remove teaching from them; for he allows them to teach their own children for a time, as he says later on.

or to exercise authority over a man. For to teach is indeed to assume authority over a man.
