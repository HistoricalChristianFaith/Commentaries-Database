Was it not the case that certain fathers deduced the [idea] of restoration from this passage, saying that sinners are punished until now but afterward no longer, since they had been purified through punishment? But what is to be done when the majority of the other fathers and the received Scriptures claim that the torments of those suffering at that time will be everlasting? What should one say, and how should one decide between these two options? One must combine these two opinions. I say this as a kind of exercise and not as an outright assertion. For I agree with the teaching of the church that the punishments in the future age will be everlasting, for this is also what the Lord asserted according to the Gospel of Matthew: “And they will go away into eternal punishment.” And Isaiah also said, “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched.” But by way of an exercise this must be said, taking a sort of middle path between the two opinions, that until a certain time, which this Revelation says is “five months,” using a certain mystical number, the sinners will be punished with greatest severity as though a scorpion were biting them. But after this, [they will be punished] less severely—for we will not be altogether without punishment—yet to such an extent that they seek death but do not attain it.
