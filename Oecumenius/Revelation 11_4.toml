These, he says, are the two olive trees and the two lampstands standing before the Lord of the whole earth. Zechariah, the inspired prophet, saw a lampstand with seven lamps above it and two olive branches, but the branches stood beside two golden oil dispensers, therefore saying: "What are these two olive branches on the sides of the two golden oil dispensers?" And he heard from the angel who was speaking that "they are the two sons of oil, who stand before the Lord of all the earth." (Zech. 4:11-14) And that from this the prophet's use of the articles in the phrase "these are the two olive trees and the two lampstands" is confirmed; for this serves to indicate an agreed upon symbolism, except that here Zechariah called them "two dispensers" John called them "two lampstands." That the two branches of the olive tree, one from the Jews and the other from the Gentiles, have been interpreted as the two peoples is not unknown to the saints. Nevertheless, it is also possible that the two prophets mentioned in the current discourse are meant.
