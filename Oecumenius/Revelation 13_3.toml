And I see, he says, one of his heads as if it were wounded unto death; and his deadly wound was healed. This meaning might have been known to the Spirit-bearing evangelist himself; but as it appears to me, he indicates something of this sort: for the deadly blow which was inflicted upon the Devil that was struck against one of the heads through the devotion of Israel, was healed through their subsequent idolatry.
