And if any man think himself to be religious not controlling his tongue, but seducing his heart: this man's religion is useless. Religion pure and undefiled before God and the Father is this, to visit orphans and widows in their affliction: and to keep himself pure from the world.
Religion (Θρησκεία) seems to have something more than faith (πίστεως). For the name itself promises knowledge of certain hidden things and the firmness of those things that are perceived by faith. Therefore, the blessed James also used this expression, saying: Religion, as if he had said: You think you know and precisely observe the secrets that are in the law. How can this happen when you do not know how to restrain your tongue, slandering your neighbor: and living proudly, you do not show mercy to any needy person: when the law neither receives the slanderer (Ps. 100:5) nor commands you to have mercy on your enemies, and even commands that you should be a help to the enemy occupied in lifting up what has fallen under the burden? (Ex. 23:5) If, therefore, you wish to be religious, do not show yourself to be religious from knowledge of the law, but from action, and that by showing mercy to your neighbor: for mercy towards your neighbor is a certain likeness to God. For he says: "Be merciful, just as your heavenly Father is merciful." (Luke 6:36) But mercy should not be with respect to persons: for neither does God distribute His benefits (Matt. 5:45) to this one or that one, but involves all with benefit, rich and poor, evil and good, without distinction. However, this is restraint, and not out of arrogance as if it were expressing a law through actions, deceiving one's own conscience: for this signifies the heart, as it is written: "A broken and humbled heart God will not despise." (Ps. 50:19)
"Religion pure." Perhaps someone will say: If James is the teacher of the covenant which Christ established, how is it that he does not now repeal the things of the law, but rather exalts them, welcoming those who are engaged in its observance, and not rebuking or resisting them from the observance of the law? To that which we say, that in the manner of introducing, James rather now discusses with them, and lowers himself to their weakness, lest by immediately overturning the law from the beginning, he causes them to retreat, becoming weary of the novelty of the doctrines and leaning towards disbelief. However, addressing the matter more conveniently and yielding to the law, regarding those things in which he did not bring harm to the new covenant with the legalistic fallacies (for what harms the faith that is in Christ, such as the observance of sabbaths or fasting or abstaining from certain foods), and making them more attentive to his discourse, he gradually encourages them to indeed depart from the observances of the law, as if they were laborious and yet useless, and as if they were calling to servitude, not to the freedom that is in Christ. Therefore, having wisely used brief exchanges and alternations, when he found that they were no longer seriously bearing what was being said, he then presents those things that were suitable for Christians.
"to keep himself pure from the world." By "world" here we must understand the popular and common crowd, which is corrupted by the desires of its own error.
