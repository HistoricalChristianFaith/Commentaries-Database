"Marriage is honorable in all things." How much indeed is the discourse about moderation! For also earlier, recalling sanctification, Paul spoke about this, and again after this he will speak about prostitutes and adulterers. Therefore, in all things, that is, not honorable in this part and not in another, but entirely throughout honorable and unblemished, let it be. In all ways and at all times; not in distress, but in ease let it not be.
"but God will judge fornicators and adulterers." And here, along with punishments, is the prohibition of fornication and adultery. For God will judge, or rather condemn. And rightly so. For if marriage is permitted, and it is lawful to fulfill desire without sin, what excuse will there be for adulterers and fornicators?
