“And they sing,” it says, “the song of Moses,” clearly indicating that song that Moses sang when Pharoah was drowned along with his entire army: “Let us sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and the rider he has thrown into the sea. He has become for me a helper and protector for salvation.” This present song of triumph is because of the punishment of the wicked and the victory over the devil and the son of lawlessness, the antichrist. “And the song of the Lamb,” it says, referring to the agreement [of Moses] with the Lord and his just judgment against the wicked. And therefore, indeed, they marvel at the truth and righteousness of the Lord. It says, “the king of the nations.” To be sure, Christ is the king of everyone. However, since it is said by Isaiah, “And there will be a root of Jesse, and he who arises to rule over the nations, upon him shall the nations hope,” the prophecy [of the Revelation] says that he is “the king of the nations” and that all the nations will come and worship him and in this way [this passage] fittingly foretells the call of the nations and the faith which they will have in the Lord.
