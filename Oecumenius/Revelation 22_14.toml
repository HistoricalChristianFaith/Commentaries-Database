Blessed, he says, are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life. By robes he means the bodies. Blessed therefore are those who live well and cleanse themselves from every filth of sin; for those who so live will have authority to recline upon the tree of life and to rest upon it, the Lord is the tree of life, as was said before.

And they may enter the city through the gates. And through the gates, that is, through the apostolic dogmas and teachings, they become partakers of the conduct and blessedness of the saints.
