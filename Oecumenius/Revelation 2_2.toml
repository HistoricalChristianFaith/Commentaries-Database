He says, I know your works and your labor and your patience, "and nothing of the good things you do has escaped my notice." (Job 34:21) The one who formed the hearts of you all, who understands all your works (Ps. 32:15), and who says that you cannot bear evil men, has given you a spirit of perseverance.

The believers in Ephesus fulfilled the divine command: "not to trust every spirit, but to test the spirits to see whether they are from God." (1 Jn. 4:1) Therefore, they tested those who were preaching the Gospel among them and put them to the test; they found some false apostles who were delivering spurious doctrines, and he says that those around Cerinthus, who were contemporaries of the evangelist, were proclaimers of profane doctrines.
