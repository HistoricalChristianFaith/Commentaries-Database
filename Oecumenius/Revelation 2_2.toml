And he says, “You are not able to bear evil men,” for you have acquired the habit of hating evil, and “you have tested those who have called themselves apostles but are not, and you have found them to be false.” Those in Ephesus fulfilled the divine command that they should not believe every spirit but test the spirits to see whether they are from God. Therefore, they tested those who preached the gospel among them, and through this testing they found some to be false apostles who were proclaiming counterfeit doctrines. He speaks of those who were disciples of Cerinthus, who were contemporary with the Evangelist and were proclaiming profane teachings.
