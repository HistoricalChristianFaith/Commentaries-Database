“an evil heart.” There are many wicked hearts of unbelief. For there is a wicked heart of unbelief, which does not believe, but is greedy for gain, is arrogant, is drunken, and many other things. Moreover, and incomparably, a heart is a wicked heart of unbelief, which departs from the faith in God.
Therefore, see," he says, "that there never be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief.” And of unbelief, I say, he means the departure from the living God.
And he says well. An evil heart of unbelief. For there is also a good heart of unbelief, as in, “Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are of God.” (1 Jn. 4:1)

In the departing, that is, through unbelief,
from the living God. For otherwise unbelief does not find a way unless one departs from God. For as long as one holds on to God and trusts in Him, as the Almighty, he considers nothing impossible.
"But encourage one another.” Build each other up, and spur one another on.
“As long as it is called ‘today’.” Until the end, he says; for until the end, today is called. For he said, “Today, if you hear his voice,” he says, until that which is spoken of as today.
“so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.” So that it does not happen, he says, as it occurred with our ancestors, and that their hearts may become hard and unyielding, deceived by unbelief, which now calls sin.
“For we have become partakers of Christ.” One, he says, we have become partakers with Christ, since He has deemed it worthy to be our head and to make us His members.
“if we hold the beginning of our confidence." The beginning of confidence is faith towards Christ. For by it we have endured and have become partakers of Christ.
“to the end.” The 'to the end' clearly indicates that they had begun.
“As in the rebellion.” Hyperbaton [ὑπερβατὸν] is: for we must understand it as "Let us fear."
The surpassing thing; in what is said: Today, if you hear the voice, and the things following, let us fear, lest, a promise being left behind, and the things following.
