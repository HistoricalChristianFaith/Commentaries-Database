Therefore, brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election. For if you do these things, you will never stumble. For in this way, an entrance will be supplied to you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
Therefore, Peter says, my brothers, make every effort to confirm your calling and election as permanent and unchangeable, that is, the teaching you heard regarding your election and calling, so that you may be blameless: do not be judged as if you have forgotten the gift of God, but remain steadfast having your calling secure.
"For if you do these things." What are these? Those which have been predicted, namely virtue, knowledge, temperance, and the other things that follow. Notice, however, how orderly it is that those things which were fearsome are now directed through good to the entrance of the eternal kingdom of the Lord.
