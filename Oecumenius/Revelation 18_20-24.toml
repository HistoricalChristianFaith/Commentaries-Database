While the merchants and the kings of the earth and all with whom the city did commerce while she yet stood and was prosperous will weep bitterly for her, the heavens will rejoice, that is, the angels in heaven and the souls of the righteous. The souls will rejoice because their vindication from God has happened, while the angels will rejoice as those who are glad for the vindicated. Moreover, through the description of the behavior [of the kings and merchants] in the narrative, the suffering of the spiritual Babylon is highlighted. As all this is clear, there is no need to spend time on what is generally agreed.
