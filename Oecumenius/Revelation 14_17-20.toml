The angel with the sickle, who had come out of the heavenly temple, is himself the servant and minister of the coming consummation. And being the heavenly minister of God, he is described as coming out of the heavenly temple. He says, 

And another angel came out from the altar, with power over the fire. And to me it seems that this one has been put in charge of the punishment of the ungodly. 

Next he says, Send and gather the clusters of the vine of the earth. So the harvest mentioned earlier represented the righteous and the sinners together at the consummation, whom he will separate, as is said in the gospels—“The winnowing fork of the Lord with which he will clear his threshing-floor and gather the wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire.” The vintage of the grapes symbolizes those who are exceedingly sinful, whom the vision depicts in their drunkenness and madness. 

From this it is clear that the Lord did not consider it proper that he should gather them as he gathered the first, but that one of the angels should do this. They were immediately thrown outside into the wine-press of the wrath of God, without being considered worthy of making any defense, nor of being questioned, or being brought before a lawcourt, just as in the gospels sinners were introduced who were punished because of their failure to give and share with others. It was of these, I think, that the prophet said, “The wicked will not stand in the judgment.” He has called their punishment a wine-press, cleverly using the metaphor of the grapes and of the vintage. 

He says, And the wine-press was trodden outside the city, for it was not right for those who were being punished to receive the recompense for their evil deeds in the heavenly Jerusalem, which had been allotted to the saints, and to impair the joy of the saints through sympathy with those who were being justly punished—to say nothing of the great chasm which separates the pious from the impious, according to the words of the patriarch Abraham, which were addressed to the rich man in the gospels. 

He says, And blood flowed from the wine-press. He rightly spoke of blood, to show that in talking of bunches of grapes he spoke metaphorically, since they were human beings who were being trampled together and mangled, as high, he says, as the horses’ bridles, for one thousand six hundred stades. 

Some of God’s horses have been handed down to us in Holy Scripture, symbolizing angelic powers with God mounted on them. For the heavenly bridegroom says to his bride in the Song of Songs, “I compare you, my nearest love, to my mare in Pharaoh’s chariot,” and the prophet Habakkuk sings to God, “You will come mounted on your horses, and your horsemanship is deliverance.” 

Revelation says that the bridles of these horses are soaked in the blood of the ungodly, who are standing not nearby but at a distance. The whole passage is metaphorical, the symbolism showing the extent of the blood. For those traveling on the broad highway are many times more numerous than those on “the narrow and hard way,” so that they soak even the bridles of the horses, that is, angels, mounted on them ready to inflict punishment.
