And a second time they raised the same hymn, and again he uttered it even more softly, that with the three times repeated alleluia the holy and much-praised Trinity might be glorified by them (see Rev 19:1, 3, 4); for this is God.

He says, And the smoke of her torment goes up for ever and ever. In the midst the alleluia being praised interrupted the sequence of the discourse, since this indeed is the course of the arrangement; and has avenged the blood of his servants at her hand; And the smoke of her torment goes up for ever and ever. For smoke it says as of the city being utterly burned about which these things are said; for smoke is a sign of fire.
