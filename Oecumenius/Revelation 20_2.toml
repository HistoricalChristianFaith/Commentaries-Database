The Revelation does not present to us the millenialism of the atheistic Greeks and the transmigration of souls and the Lethian water and I do not know what other idle talk and nonsense when it says that the devil will be bound for a thousand years and will again be loosed to deceive the nations. Stay away from such destructive teachings, which are suitable to the silliness of the Greeks. What, however, does it say? The prophet says, “For a thousand years in your sight, O Lord, are as yesterday which is past, and as a watch in the night.” Therefore, a thousand years in the sight of God is regarded as one day. And in his second letter, the holy Peter says the same thing when he writes, “But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” And this is so. Moreover, the holy Isaiah speaks of the entire incarnation of the Lord as a “day,” saying, “In the time of favor I have answered you, in a day of salvation I have helped you.” And, not only this, the psalmist calls this same “day” also a “morning.” For somewhere it says, “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it,” speaking of the joy of our salvation. And somewhere else the psalmist says, “In the morning you will hear my voice; in the morning I will wait upon you and you will see me.” For our prayers have become worthy in the sight of God the Father and become acceptable through the mediation and reconciliation of the Lord. And moreover, it says concerning Jerusalem, “God will help her right early.” And so, the incarnation of the Lord was a “day” and a “morning,” since, as it were, the “sun of righteousness”—for Malachi speaks of him in this way—shone upon us, providing us with the “light of knowledge.” And Zechariah foretold of this divine light when he said, “Whereby the dayspring will visit us from on high, to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.” And in agreement with this, the prophet said, “God is the Lord, and he has shined upon us; celebrate the feast with thick branches, even to the horns of the altar.” …Since it says that the day is reckoned by God “as a thousand years,” and moreover since the sojourn of the Lord on the earth is called a “day,” it calls this day a “thousand years,” as though with God there were no distinction between one day and a thousand years. At this time, the time of the incarnation of the Lord, the devil was bound, not being able to resist the marks of the Savior’s deity. And, therefore, when they sensed that they were spiritually bound, the wicked demons cried out, “What have you to do with us, O Son of the living God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?” And the Lord also made clear their bondage when he said, “Or how can one enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.” Hence, therefore, as it was indicated, we understand the incarnation of the Lord and his sojourn upon earth to be called “one day” and a “thousand years” without distinction in the holy Scriptures, such a number is used figuratively. Note, therefore, what the Revelation says. “I saw another angel coming down from heaven holding the key of the bottomless pit and a chain.” And it says, when he seized the devil, “he bound him and threw him into the bottomless pit.” That which is accomplished spiritually by the Lord is shown to the Evangelist as though on a painted tablet. For since John was a human being and could not see spiritual realities, that which occurred is depicted for him in material terms.… “That he should deceive the nations no more,” it says, “till the thousand years were ended.” It was necessary that the sojourn of the Lord on the earth have a somewhat greater support and protection, to prohibit the unclean demons from attacking it in the same way as they did against humankind before the time of the incarnation.
