Could it not be that the thousand years of the atheistic Greeks and the transmigrations of souls and the water of Lethe, and I do not know what foolish confusions the Revelation hands over to us, saying that the Devil will be bound for a thousand years and then will be released and will deceive the nations? Away with such destructive doctrines and with the silliness fitting for the Greeks. What then does it say has been spoken to the prophet? "That a thousand years are in your sight, O Lord, as yesterday that is past, and as a watch in the night." (Ps. 90:4) Therefore the thousand years are reckoned as one day in the sight of God. The same is said in the second epistle of Peter the inspired, who wrote: "But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day." (2 Peter 3:8)

Moreover the inspired Isaiah says that all the human life of the Lord is one day, saying: "In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you." (Isa. 49:8) Not only that, but the Psalmist also calls that day both "day" and "morning," saying on the one hand, "This is the day which the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it," (Ps. 118:24) the joy of our salvation; and on the other hand singing, "In the morning you will hear my voice; in the morning I will present myself to you," (Ps. 5:4) and I will look upon you; for our prayers are well-received when deemed worthy of the vision of God and the Father, through the Lord's mediation and reconciliation. And again concerning Jerusalem he says: "God will help her with the dawn of the morning." (Ps. 46:5) And the day and the morning became the indicator of the Lord's incarnation, as "the Sun of righteousness" shone upon us. For therefore Malachi speaks of him, (Mal. 4:2) and bringing us "the light of knowledge," (Hos. 10:12) concerning which the divine light Zachariah preannounced, saying: "a rising to us from on high has visited those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death"; (Luke 1:78-79; see Zech. 14:6-7) to which the prophet also added, "God said, the Lord, and he appeared to us to appoint a feast among those who burn incense up to the horns of the altar." (Ps. 117:27)

Having therefore prefaced these matters, proceed to the point in hand. Since it has been said that a day is reckoned by God as a thousand years, and conversely the day is called the Lord's sojourn on earth, he declares this day to be a thousand years, as if there is no distinction before God between a single day and a thousand years; in which day, that of the Lord's incarnation, the Devil was bound, being unable to resist the Savior's divine signs.

Wherefore, perceiving this bondage of the spiritual realm, the true demons cried out, "What have we to do with you and with us, Son of the living God? Have you come before the appointed time to torment us?" (Matt. 8:29) But the Lord, while loosing their bonds, said: "Or how can one enter the house of the strong man and plunder his goods, unless he first bind the strong man? and then he will plunder his house." (Matt. 12:29) Since, therefore, as has been said, we have conceived of the Incarnation of the Lord and his sojourn on earth as lasting one day and a thousand years, this same number being mystically called in the divine Scripture without distinction, see what the Revelation says.
