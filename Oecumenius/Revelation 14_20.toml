And he says the winepress was trodden outside of the city; for it was not lawful that those being punished should receive the returns of evils and defile the joy of the holy ones in the heavenly Jerusalem, which has been called out, through sympathy for those rightly punished, not that a great chasm does not separate the pious from the impious according to the words of the patriarch Abraham, which he made toward the rich in the Gospels. (Luke 16:26)

And blood, it says, flowed from the winepress. He rightly said blood, to show that having spoken of a cluster of grapes he had spoken metaphorically, since indeed the sufferers and the thrashers were people, and they thresh with the bridles of horses for a thousand six hundred stadia, he says. Certain horses of God are handed over to us in the divine Scripture, signifying angelic power that holds God's dominion; for he says in the Song of Songs to the bride, "The heavenly bridegroom I likened to my horse in Pharaoh's chariot, the near one, my near one." (Song 1:9) And the prophet Habakkuk sings to God that he will "mount upon your horses, and your cavalry is salvation." (Hab. 3:8) The Revelation says that the bridles of these horses are wet with the blood of sinners, not nearby but standing apart by length; and the whole statement is figurative, the riddle showing that the blood is so great. For those who travel the broad way are far more numerous than those on the narrow and pressed path (Matt. 7:14), just as those bridles might well be soaked from the horses set over punishment, whether of angels or whatever else.
