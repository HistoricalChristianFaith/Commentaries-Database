The mid-heaven symbolizes the high and exalted nature of the blessed angel. 

He had an eternal gospel; for from of old the teaching “Fear the Lord” brought salvation, since “The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom,” but “love is the end.” 

He says one must not fear the formidable and soul-destroying beast, the Antichrist, even if he threatens and does dreadful things. For, he says, the hour of his judgment has come, and the very one who terrifies those on earth will be punished as never before. 

He says, and worship him who made all creation, and not the wretched and abominable Devil.
