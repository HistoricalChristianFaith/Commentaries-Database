"And the ten horns which you saw", he says, "are ten kings, who have not yet received a kingdom." Concerning these "ten kings" or "horns" the most wise prophet Daniel explained from the dominion of the Romans, saying: "they will arise in the last times, in the midst of which the Antichrist will be raised." (see Dan 7:7-12) Therefore he says they have not yet received a kingdom but will "receive authority as kings." He calls them "as kings" because of the brief and shadowy nature of their kingdom.

Then he adds that they "receive one hour" together "with the beast." He calls here the beast the Antichrist. For in the preceding passages he also called him accordingly, saying, "And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb." (Rev. 13:11)

The expression that they would reign "for one hour", or the brief duration of their kingdom, is an allegory, or an indication of one year's time and change.
