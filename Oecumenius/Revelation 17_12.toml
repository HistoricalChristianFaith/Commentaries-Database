The all-wise prophet, Daniel, remarked concerning these ten kings or horns that they would arise in the last times out of the Roman rule. And the antichrist will rise up in the middle of them. And for this reason it says that “they have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings.” It rightly says “as kings” because of the rapid demise and fleeting nature of their reign. Then it continues, “they receive it for one hour, together with the beast.” Here it calls the antichrist “beast” as it had also in earlier passages, saying, “I saw another beast coming up from the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb.” That they rule for one hour signifies either the short duration of their rule, or it is a figure of speech indicating by one hour one year.
