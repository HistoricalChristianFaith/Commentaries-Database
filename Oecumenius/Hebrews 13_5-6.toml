"Let your conversation be without greed." Paul did not say, "Do not possess anything"; (and it is clear from what he leads to: Being content with what is present, whatever it may be.) but rather, "You have a philosophical and ungreedy opinion." For he himself has said:
"for he has said, 'I will never leave you, nor forsake you.'" Since your possessions have been seized; for Paul said: And you have received the confiscation of your possessions with joy (Heb. 10:34); he advises them to be content with what is present; lest they say: With what present things shall we be content? We have been seized, and we have nothing; he says: but even if you have been seized, you can be content with what remains, even if it is very little, because of the one who says, God: 'I will not forsake you,' that is, I will not leave you, nor will I abandon you.
"So that we may boldly say." If he does not allow it, God does not abandon either, therefore, he says, we must speak boldly the words of David: "The Lord is my helper." (Ps. 118:6-7) For if God helps, one should not be afraid of those who seize or threaten."
