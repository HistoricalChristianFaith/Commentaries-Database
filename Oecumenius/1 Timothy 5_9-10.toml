Let a widow be counted as not less than sixty years old, the wife of one man, well attested for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has hosted strangers, if she has washed the feet of the saints, if she has comforted the afflicted, if she has devoted herself to every good work.

Here, Paul also considers age along with other factors, and previously he states the reason, saying that even if the age were sixty years old, without the other conditions being met, it should not be counted.

— [OECUMENIUS] They also say that Paul is referring to those designated for widowhood. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 172v, B f. 207v; G J. 295v] —

— [OECUMENIUS] well attested for good works. Having said generally, "well attested for good works," Paul then proceeds to each particular thing. And he said that the care of children is above. What then, if he has no children? Let him do the rest. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius] —

— [OECUMENIUS] He does not say "if she had children," but "if she has brought them up according to the will of God, if she has led them properly," for this is exceptional. One must understand that this is said concerning widows. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius G f. 295v] —

if she has hosted strangers. Do you see that even here Paul places the benefits to one's own people before those to foreigners? For having said this first.

if she has brought up children. Thus it suggests, "She has hosted strangers."

if she has washed the feet of the saints. But he will say: I am very poor, and I do not have the means to be host or to assist the afflicted. Does he not say, "Can you not wash the feet of the saints?" Is the ability lacking to pursue good works? For Paul spoke of each of these according to what was available.

if she washed the feet of the saints; that is, if she performed the lowest services to the saints without shame. Thus, Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes.

if she has devoted herself to every good work, that is, she has shared, supplied. For although the ability to act may be lacking, the ability to provide is nevertheless present.
