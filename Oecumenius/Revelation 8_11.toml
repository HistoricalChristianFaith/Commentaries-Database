Naomi, who lived long ago, was called “Bitter” because of the many troubles she had with her children and with other circumstances of her life. A sample of the extraordinary plagues is that bitterness that we sinners suffer at that time when we are embittered at the glory of the saints. For although such good things have been prepared for humankind, we ourselves have exchanged the things of the present for those which are to come. I think the falling star refers to a certain wrath of God that makes the waters bitter. He speaks figuratively of people as “waters,” according to that spoken by the prophet, “From the voice of many waters, wonderful are the waves of the sea,” and again, “The floods have lifted up, O Lord, the floods have lifted up their voice, the floods lift up their roaring.” Although these things are spoken in figurative speech, it is not impossible that these things and things like them will occur at that time.
