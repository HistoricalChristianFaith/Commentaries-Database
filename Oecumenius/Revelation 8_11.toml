Naomi, who long ago suffered many afflictions concerning her children and other misfortunes, was called Bitter. (Ruth 1:20) Bitterness serves as a symbol of the remaining extraordinary hardships. This bitterness is what we sinners experienced at that time, becoming bitter over the glory of the saints, because, indeed, although such good things were prepared for humanity, we ourselves exchanged the present for what was to come.
