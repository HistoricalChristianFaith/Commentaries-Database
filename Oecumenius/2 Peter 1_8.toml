For if these things are with you and abound, you will be neither idle nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
"For if these things are with you and abound." What are these? Faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness, love, which must not only be present but also abound. For if presence is beneficial, much more is abundance or wealth. What, then, is the benefit that follows from these? To have security for the second coming of the Lord. For indeed, to those to whom these are not present, in the glory of the coming Judge, and in the manner of the shining sun, blindness follows. Where, even if it is strong in appearance, it cannot be gazed upon without injury by the exaggeration of those who are weak-eyed, since it was born shining in its own light in such a way that it blinds those who rely on it with feeble sight. But the word Μυωπάζειν is used to mean, ἀπὸ τῶν μυῶν, that is, from the moles living underground, who remain blind to everything.
