Spots and blemishes party in their errors against you, having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having hearts exercised with covetous practices, accursed children, who have forsaken the right way and gone astray, following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness; but was rebuked for his iniquity [Num. 22:6]: the dumb beast speaking with a man's voice restrained the madness of the prophet.
“Spots and blemishes.” The order is taken as follows: Spots and blemishes (Σπίλοι καὶ μῶμοι) are the heart of those who are exercised in plunder, that is, exercised through plunder, accursed children, assaulting you, having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin: they entice unstable souls, which Paul also called women burdened with sins. (2 Tim. 3:6) Furthermore, these have forsaken the right way, and have gone astray following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, and the rest. These are wells without water, clouds carried with a tempest, etc. (2 Peter 2:17) And why is darkness reserved for them in the future world? Because of their immense vanity, by which they entice those who had previously walked in error, and had truly fled from it: so that through filthiness and the desires of the flesh, they return like a dog to its vomit. (Prov. 26:11) But those who are placed in the middle declare and confirm this vanity.
"Spots and blemishes." They have nothing that is fixed in purity, but like stains on a clean garment, they cling to long-standing conversation and defile everything: when they have drawn some away and have been able to make them shameless, those who are together, men and women, they consider this act a delight, satisfying their own lust: but also, they say, those who are dining with you do this not out of love, or because they share (as they say) in salt11, but to find this time suitable for deception among women. For these, having eyes, look at nothing but adulteresses, and in this, they sin continually, like children of abomination or abominable ones, ensnaring unstable souls.
Having hearts exercised with covetous practices, whether of filthiness or even of possessions, for which both, abandoning the way that would lead them to salvation, have strayed from it: and the same happened to them as to Balaam the son of Beor, since he also loved the wages of unrighteousness for the sake of the gifts offered: but he was rebuked for his iniquity, namely by a dumb beast of burden, which speaking with a man’s voice restrained the madness of the prophet. And from this, therefore, we learn that Balaam, because of the affection of his desire, which he nourished with his insane prophecy, once prohibited by God, was again hastening to go to Balak steadfastly: but hindered by the fear of God, and by the terrors that met him on the way, he did not change the word of blessing, which was not of divination (for we have said that divination is uttered by a raging mind, and those things are said by one who is ignorant), but of prophecy. Indeed, the prophets speak knowing what they say. Hence, he called the prophet himself, as one who knows what he should say. For he certainly did not choose better while ignorant of what he was saying: therefore, the blessing was not of divination, but of the power of God.
