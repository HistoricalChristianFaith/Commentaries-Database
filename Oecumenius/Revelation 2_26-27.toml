And to the one who overcomes the evil one, I will give authority over the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father. This is what is spoken of in the Gospels by those who have well managed the trusts and the talents entrusted to them. "Be in charge of ten cities"; and there will "be another in charge of five cities." (see Luke 19:17,19) And to Daniel, "and the kingdom shall be given to the saints of God." (Dan. 7:22) For it indicates a certain beginning and authority given to the saints over those who are inferior and in need of guidance. Therefore, he says that he shepherds them with strict authority, but the disobedient he will crush like earthenware vessels.
