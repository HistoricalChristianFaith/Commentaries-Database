But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves. For if a man be a hearer of the word, and not a doer: he shall be compared to a man beholding his natural face in a mirror. For he saw himself, and went his way, and immediately forgot what manner of a man he was. But he that has looked in the law of perfect liberty, and has remained in it, not made a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work: this man shall be blessed in his deed.
Since James knows that some who listen to the word with diligence often extinguish their fervor even at the very time they are listening, therefore, he now adds this, commanding it in effect: Do not show diligence only in hearing, but much more in doing.
"deceiving yourselves." That is, seducing. Furthermore, James says that the natural face is to know oneself through the law. Therefore, with "face," he added "natural." For by saying through the law what kind of things we have become, we consider that such things are made by the spiritual law to perfect us through the washing of regeneration. May we not, by remaining in such consideration through action, forget the grace and gift of God. For he who exposes himself to wicked actions does not even remember that he has been favored by God. For if he had remembered that he had been adopted as a son of God and justified and sanctified, which are spiritual gifts, he would never have given himself over to works that repel grace.
"in a mirror." From this common mirror James speaks figuratively for an intellectual mirror, without going into detail: for example, he might say in this way: If anyone hears the discourse and does not express it in actions, he is like a man looking at the face of his action in a mirror. For just as he considered himself and went away, immediately forgetting what he was like: so also this one who, through the law of Moses, considered for what purpose he had been made, namely that he had been made for the glory of God and in the image of the Creator God, after he had considered, expressed none of those things that had been considered in actions, but was inclined to go back to the same way he as before. It is not therefore a matter of how it should be used. But James, the disciple of the Lord, does not do this vainly or rashly, but speaks everything briefly, as if he were a disciple of the abbreviated word, and at the same time gathering and restraining the listener, lest he should listen to these things idly.
"But he that has looked in." Consider what it says: Who has looked in, and not, Who entered. The spiritual law indeed has something magnificent and desirable everywhere, from which it also knows how to attract and render perfect, even from those in wrongful pursuit of it: and since it has perfection and lacks defect in all things, it leaves no one who has attained it in doubt regarding anything that is connected to it; and it persuades those who have even merely looked upon it to remain in it.
"in the law of perfect." Because the Jews were exalted because of the observances of the law, and thought that by these they showed themselves the highest devotion towards God; and applying themselves to these alone, they claimed perfection for themselves, but towards other men, being moved by a proud and reproachful spirit, they erred. As is evident from the Pharisee, of whom it is written in the Gospel (Luke 18:10), and from those who were scornful against the Publican: repressing this fear, blessed James speaks of the things that are proposed. For indeed, by mentioning his works, which express speech through actions, where he proclaimed him blessed, he immediately corrects the evil that arises from many actions, and says: Do not think that you derive blessedness from the works of the law, as if mere action could render one acceptable before God: not at all; but he is blessed who both acts and is not affected by a scornful or inhumane spirit towards others of his kind.
"of liberty." Where he had said the perfect Law, he added: of liberty, making liberty his official sign. For the law of Christ, freeing from the servitude of all fleshly things, such as the Sabbaths, circumcision, and ceremonies regarding other purifications, established a liberty and rest for those approaching it: and because of the freedom and sweetness that proceeds from this freedom, it also makes one attentive and liberates from oblivion, which corrupts all good things. For indeed, nothing persuades one to adhere to something as much as that which seems to offer rest from business and freedom. Moreover, he has also demonstrated this to be blessed.
"a forgetful hearer." James linked forgetfulness to hearing, because hearing requires action, but no action follows forgetfulness: as if hearing were unessential, which has the ability of action.
