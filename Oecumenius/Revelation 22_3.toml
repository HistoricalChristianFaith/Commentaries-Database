Even were now curses especially put to flight, we are nonetheless tossed about by them, with thousands of allegations brought up against us with our knowledge and even without our knowledge. But then the saints will be clean and untainted of any stain of the soul as well as of the body. And the rule of God will exist in the city, for this is the meaning of “the throne.” The saints “shall worship him,” it says, not with a worship that is laborious but that done with joy and spiritual gladness. [Such worship] comes from the vision of his face.
