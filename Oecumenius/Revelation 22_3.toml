[[commentary]]
quote='''
And he says there will be no more curse. For although the anathemas now may flee vehemently, nevertheless we are comforted in them, with myriad excuses sprouting up in us in knowledge and indeed in ignorance; but then the saints will be free from every stain of the soul, just as they are from physical stain.

And he says that in the city will be the kingdom of God. For this is the throne. And he says the saints will serve him with worship not burdensome, but with spiritual pleasure and joy.
