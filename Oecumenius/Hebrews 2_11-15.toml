"For both he who sanctifies," that is, Christ, "and those who are sanctified," that is, humans, are all from one God and Father. But Christ, as the Son and true offspring and of the essence of the Father, we, however, are as creature ones and have been made worthy of sonship by grace. See in these words the superiority. He who sanctifies, and we are sanctified. Therefore, both unity and superiority.
"I will proclaim your name to my brothers."

For as he united the flesh to himself, he also put on brotherhood. Saying, "He is not ashamed," He showed the distinction. For He is not a brother by nature, although He is truly a man, but by generosity [φιλανθρωπίαν], since He is also truly God.

"I will put my trust in him." Since he previously called Him brother and internally father, he signifies that these indeed are names of kindness and grace, but by nature and truth, God is, he says. For who trusts in anyone else except in God alone? And if he were to say: Do not think that hearing Him being called brother and father refers to someone among the common people, God is, he says, in whom it is written that one must trust.
"Here I am, and the children." Here our Father made Christ. But he says: He gave, on account of humanity, just as it is said: "Afterward I will give you the nations as your inheritance." (Ps. 2:8) "Since, therefore, the sons," that is, men, "have communion with flesh and blood; in the same way," that is, similarly and truly, not according to some fantasy, as certain heretics say, He Himself became a partaker of flesh and blood: so that in this also He might demonstrate the love He has for the sons.
The Father made Christ our own. And He gave, for the sake of humanity. Similar to that, "Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance." (Ps. 2:8)
"Therefore”, therefore, he says, “the children," that is, the humans, "share in flesh and blood, he likewise," that is, truly and not according to some fantasy, as certain heretics say, He Himself shared in flesh and blood, so that in this also He might demonstrate the love He has for the sons.

We who are numbered among the children have partaken of the blood and flesh of God, that is, we are in blood and flesh, and in perishable and earthly bodies. For this reason, the only-begotten Word of God, being life by nature, partook of the same, and not in any other way, but similarly to us.
"that through death." Then he also speaks of the reason for the Incarnation.
"The," Paul says, "the Devil”, who has the power of death, might be destroyed; and he will be destroyed through death, as it is said, O Wisdom of God! Through death, the Devil had the power; through death, he will be abolished. Christ used against the Devil those arms which He himself was powerful with. How then does He rule over death? Because He is the ruler of sin, from which death comes, and He rules over death, that is, sin is the power of death. Therefore, having sin and being its possessor, He has the power of death (for we say that sin is the power of death). So that it might be thus: through His own death, He abolished sin, having the Devil as a servant, which is the strength of the power of death. For if this had not prevailed over man, death would not have entered into the world.

Before, he says, death was abolished, throughout their lives, humans were exposed and subjected to the fear of slavery: for they feared death which had not yet been abolished: and nothing of worldly pleasures could delight the courageous, and this was due to the fear of death, in the manner of a cruel and savage master always pressing and terrifying those who were on the earth.
"were held in slavery." The people were bound to death, as they were guilty of this slavery. The slavery of death is to be held and subjected to sin, for sin is the power and sting of death. (1 Cor. 15:56) Therefore, since Christ through death abolished the one who has the power of death, that is,the Devil, the inventor and leader of sin, sin has become weak, and we have been freed from the slavery according to its dominion; we have been liberated from the fear of death. And this is clearly seen in their very actions. For those who before feared and shunned death as the greatest evil and overwhelming, now approach it joyfully as a change of life and a prelude, when they are brought forth for Christ and His laws by those who persecute them. Therefore, is it not evident that the Savior has freed us from the fear of death and from the slavery that comes from it?
