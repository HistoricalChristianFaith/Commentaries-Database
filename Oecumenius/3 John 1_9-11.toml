I wrote to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us. Therefore, if I come, I will bring to light the works he is doing, gossiping wickedly about us. And not content with that, he not only does not receive the brothers himself, but also forbids those who want to receive them and expels them from the congregation. Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
"I will bring to light the works he is doing." If it is commanded that evil should not be repaid with evil (Rom. 12:17), what is it that he now threatens? Therefore, we say that this command is so that we do not repay evil to him who has sinned only against ourselves: For if it is a sin against us, and it brings an obstacle to faith, it should be referred to such, as Paul did to Elymas who was perverting the ways of the Lord. (Acts 13:10)
"gossiping wickedly." That is, throwing insults and cursing.
"do not imitate what is evil." Since there is no unity of light with darkness, nor any unity between Christ and Belial (2 Cor. 6:14), it is not appropriate for one who has been illuminated by the knowledge of Christ to mix with darkness through the imitation of the wicked, or through their lustful and shameless works. For just as he who does good is from God, and has composed the eye of his understanding in the light of that knowledge, and thus is wholly light, and sees God, who is true light, and is seen by others as a luminary in the world (Phil. 2:15), sustaining the Word of life; so also he who does evil, walking in darkness, cannot see God, that is, cannot do the things that are of God, nor can he be seen by others, if he rebukes or corrects anyone: but all hate and abominate him, according to that wise oracle: "I have hated iniquity and have abominated it." (Ps. 118:163 LXX)
