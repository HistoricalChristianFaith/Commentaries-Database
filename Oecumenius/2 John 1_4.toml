It is always a cause for the greatest joy when we find someone making progress in the faith of Christ without any drawbacks. The Father’s command to which John refers is what Christ said in the Gospel: “Whoever loves me will keep my commandments.” Here John calls Christ a father, because he really is the father of all the children who have been given to him by the Father’s dispensation, as it is said: “Behold, I and the children whom God has given me.”
