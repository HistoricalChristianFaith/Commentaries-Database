I was very glad to find some of your children walking in truth, as we received a command from the Father.
"I was very glad." For certainly, the greatest cause of joy is to find someone who walks without offense in the straight path of faith in Christ according to His command. But what is that command? It is what Christ says in the Gospels: "Whoever loves me will keep my commandments." (Jn. 14:21) But now John calls Christ Father: since He Himself is also the Father of the children who have been given to Him by a certain privilege from His Father: according to what has been said: "Behold, I and the children whom God has given me." (Isa. 8:18) Moreover, notice the genuine wording of this epistle, which confirms what has been said previously: "And we know that whoever loves God keeps His commandments." (1 Jn. 5:3)
