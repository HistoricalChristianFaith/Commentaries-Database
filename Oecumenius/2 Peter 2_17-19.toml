These are the springs lacking water, the clouds carried by the storm, by which the darkness of gloom has been preserved for eternity. Indeed, where the proud words of vanity have sounded, they ensnare through the lusts of the flesh in their desires, those who have truly fled, who were wandering in error, while promising them freedom, when they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone is overcome, to him he is also enslaved.
While Peter was saying many things, among which he also brought up the example of Balaam, he again took up the discourse about the impure Gnostics, and compared them to sources lacking water, as those who have lost the water of life, that is, the purity of preaching and drinkable water: which when the Lord had, he promised that he would satisfy many who came to it. (Jn. 1:6) But he also compared them to clouds carried by the wind, in a contrary manner: for this reason, he also called the wind a storm, as one that turns and disturbs what is agitated: for this is what a storm usually does. Therefore, they are not radiant clouds like the saints, but mists full of darkness. (Isa. 60:2)
"by which the darkness of gloom has been preserved for eternity" (but it is said to be eternal judgment); and for what reason? Peter added the cause, that through proud words stemming from vanity, they ensnare those who have truly fled and who once wandered in error through fleshly desire in corruption. Therefore, those who commit these acts are subject to impurities, arrogance, and impiety. But also, Peter says, since they are of the aforementioned filth, which he rightly calls corruption, they promise freedom to those who are deceived, not indeed of true life, but of that which is according to indulgence. Therefore, he also adds a reason why they are slaves of sin, saying something remarkable, that whoever is led astray by any passion is also bound to this in slavery. Then Peter again confirms this with another example, showing how one who is overcome by someone else is also a slave to him, and he makes an argument based on this assumption.
