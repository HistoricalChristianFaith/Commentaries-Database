He says that he was about to write what was spoken to the seven spirits. And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken, and do not write it down." The act of sealing, in one sense, involved impressing the memory firmly upon your mind; but the prohibition against writing it down was a matter of divine economy, for which God knows the reason. Perhaps the punishments that are glorified are actually lighter, and worthy of the goodness of the one who punishes, making them shameful to humans.

What do Gregory the Divine and Evagrius, the great authority on Gnostic matters, say about these things? Gregory asserts that "the punishment surrounding Adam is an act of generosity, for therefore I believe God punishes." And in another context, "neither mercy is indiscriminate nor is judgment merciless." Evagrius, however, declares that "the more recent and worldly thinkers should be forgotten regarding the superior discourse on judgment; for they do not understand the suffering of the rational soul condemned to ignorance."
