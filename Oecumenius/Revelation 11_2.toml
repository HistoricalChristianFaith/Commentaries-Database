And he says that the outer court of the temple was cast out and should not be measured, because it was given to the Gentiles. Having measured the temple and the altar and those who were sacrificing within it, he heard that the court should be cast out to the outside and made wider, but not to be measured, as it was considered to have a superior measure.

He says that the court is given to the Gentiles, and it is held both within the temple and outside of it; and the New Covenant is held in place of the Old. For what is contained in it is fulfilled spiritually and truly in a shadowy manner, and it is different from the old one, according to the words of Jeremiah: "Behold, the days are coming," says the Lord, "when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah, not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day I took hold of their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt." (Jer. 31:31-32)

He therefore speaks of the new covenant as the court of the temple. Then, the vision subtly implies that the Lord of the Old Covenant has also been established, the one who in the New Covenant has appeared as Christ and Ruler, just as it seems to Paul when speaking about Israel, "for they drank from a spiritual rock that followed them; and that rock was Christ." (1 Cor. 10:4)

He called the New one the court of the old; for the court is the beginning and entrance of God, but not the temple. Therefore, he did not measure the court through which both it and those within it are revealed; for both the New one and those who have succeeded within it extend beyond the limit, the former due to their countless multitude, and the latter because of the elusiveness and height of the doctrines.

That it is said to have been given to the Gentiles, it was indeed also given to Israel the new blessings; but since those among the Gentiles were superior in number to the distinguished ones from Israel, it demonstrated that the whole was from the greater number, saying that the court was given to the Gentiles.

And he says that they will trample the holy city for forty-two months, the city (not the temple), calling the church a city, concerning which it has been said with glory about you: the city of God (Ps. 86:3), the heavenly Jerusalem (Heb. 12:22), the mother of the firstborn (Ps. 86:5), whose names are written in heaven. (Heb. 12:23)

What then does the measure of the forty-two months signify? It clearly indicates that the time of the new order on earth will be brief, and that the end will soon come. The number forty, composed of four tens, is not perfect, nor is the number two. From this, the argument shows that the new state will not endure long in the present life; therefore, the Scripture calls the final hour, and again the eleventh hour (Matt. 20:6, 9.), the time of the new era, during which the Only-Begotten came into the world; and in the future, it will be eternal.

To say that those from the Gentiles will trample the holy city, that is, the church, means that those dwelling within it will be persecuted.
