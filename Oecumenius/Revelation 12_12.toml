Woe, he says, to the earth and the sea, because the Devil has come down to you with great wrath, knowing that he has little time. And if the descent of Satan were harmful to the earth and the sea, who would say why he came down? For to those who are sober and have hope in God, it has not only resulted in no harm but also in benefit, training them like a trainer [παιδοτρίβης] and making them more tested through trials, tempering them as iron is tempered. But he harms the sluggish and lazy, who perhaps even without the frustration of the one stirring them up, were by nature evil toward themselves, changing their passions.

And they say woe to the earth and the sea; they do not mean this, but woe to those who inhabit the earth and sail the sea among men, but to those who are of the earth and dust according to what is written (see Gen. 18:27), and who have earthly minds (see Rom. 8:7). Moreover, to those who are fickle, wavering, and unstable in their understanding. For against these, the common enemy wages war and enslaves the weak, those who are willing, bowing to his tyranny.

He says that he knows that he has little time. For the time from the fall of the Devil until his judgment and repayment to the eternal ages is indeed short.

For this reason, even Jacob the patriarch, although he lived one hundred and thirty years, said when asking Pharaoh, "The days of the years of my life have been few and evil." (Gen. 47:9)
