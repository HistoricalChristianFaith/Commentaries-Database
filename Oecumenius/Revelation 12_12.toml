When these events occurred, it says, “Rejoice all you angels of God, for you have been delivered from the bitter association with Satan.” But “woe to the earth and to the sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, for he knows that his time is short.” Someone might ask, “If by his coming down Satan was intending to do evil upon the earth and sea, why [was he allowed] to come down?” Because, for those who are sober and have hope in God, this did not occur for their harm but rather for their benefit. It trained them, as though by a gymnastics instructor, so that by these trials they might be made more approved and hardened to be like iron. But this does harm the slothful and the weak, who, since the one urging them on is himself without foundation, would quickly become evil out of themselves and exchange any hardship for what they are by nature. When he says “woe to the earth and to the sea,” he is not saying “woe to those who live upon the earth and sail upon the sea.” Rather, he calls those “earth” and “dust” who are earthly in thought and, moreover, fickle, without direction and unstable in mind. Against such as these, our common enemy makes war and enslaves the weak who are willing to submit to his tyranny. “Knowing,” it says, “that his time is short.” The time from the downfall of Satan until his judgment and condemnation, when he will be thrown aside into unending ages, is short.
