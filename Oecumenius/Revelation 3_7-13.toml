To those in Philadelphia he says: Write: these things says the holy one, the true one. The holy one is the Son of God. So also he receives witness from the seraphim, who combine the three acclamations of “holy” in the one lordship, since the Word possesses nothing earthly or prone to sin, even if he has become flesh. For “he did not commit sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth,” according to the word of Isaiah the prophet. 

Because he is and is called the true one, he truly is and is so called. He is called God, and the address is not false. For he is truly God, Emmanuel, even if the accursed Nestorius does not accept this. He has become a human being, without discarding his divinity, and he is truly a human being, even if Eutyches, the man hated by God, chafes at this. What he is, he truly is. This has nothing to do with analogy, as Nestorians say, nor with semblance or appearance, as Eutychianists say and the accursed and disgusting tribe of the Manichaeans. 

He says, he who has the key of David: he calls authority a key. For he who has been entrusted with the key of the house has been entrusted with the authority to open and shut. And he more clearly states this in the gospels in the promises to Peter. For when he said, “I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven,” he immediately adds, “and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” 

Since therefore the key symbolizes authority, by saying he who has the key of David he intimates that just as David was king of the perceptible Israel, so am I king over the spiritual Israel as well as over the perceptible Israel, even if the superiority of his authority differs by incomparable excess. For what kind of equal honor can a human being have in comparison with God? This was also the message that the divine angel Gabriel brought to the Virgin about the Lord, saying, “And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob for ever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Since, therefore, Christ introduced an image of the kingdom of David, he rightly says, he who has the key of David. 

Then continuing with the figure of the key, he adds, who opens and no one shuts, who shuts and no one opens. For “God is the one who acquits; who is the one who condemns?” God is the one who condemns; who is the one who acquits? He means that opening and shutting is acquitting and condemning. 

He says, I know your works, that they are God-fearing, and I have given you the open door to well being. Earlier he had said, he who opens and no one shuts. Therefore neither will anyone shut the door which I have caused to be opened. 

He says, you have little power, but you kept my word and did not deny my name: Philadelphia is a little city; consequently, her power is also little. But in guarding the faith of Christ beyond her own strength she arose as it were undaunted, standing fast against those who harried the faithful. 

Then as a recompense for her loyalty to him, he promises that many of the Jewish persuasion will run up to her and receive the faith of Christ. For this is what worshiping her feet symbolizes, to be chosen in the last days to be brought into the church—simply to be part of the church. This is also what the prophet said in welcome, “I chose to be admitted in the house of my God rather than dwell in the abodes of sinners.” 

Since, therefore, you kept my faith in patient endurance, I, too, will keep you safe in the hour of evil trial. He means the persecution of Christians that took place in the time of the emperor Domitian, who was “the second persecutor after Nero,” as Eusebius narrates in the Ecclesiastical History and in the Canonical Chronicle. This, too, was when the blessed evangelist was condemned to live on Patmos, a small and desolate island. 

I am coming soon, he says, to support you. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown. What are you to hold fast? Clearly, true love for the Lord; if you strive in this until the end you will have the crown of life. For the prize of victory is for those who endure. 

He says, “I shall make him who conquers temptations to rejoice for ever in the vision of God.” For this is to be a pillar of the divine temple. For surely the pillar would never move for any good purpose from the place where it had been secured. 

And I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, of the heavenly Jerusalem, and the new name. He is describing their enjoyment of God for ever and their dwelling in good quarters and the bliss, which, he says, they will have in the age to come. The new name, he says, is that which until now has nowhere been heard, which the saints who reign together with Christ will receive, who are named friends, brothers, and servants. But the new name exceeds even these. For these have not only been mentioned in Holy Scripture but have also come into the hearing of men. But the new name is nowhere named. 

His saying of my God does not imply that God disowns as unworthy the condition of self-emptying or the humility of the humanity. For if he disowned this, who was it who compelled him to be hypostatically united with flesh and thus to weave together our salvation? 

To him be the glory for ever and ever. Amen.
