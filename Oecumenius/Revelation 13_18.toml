“This calls for wisdom.” Let anyone search for the name of the beast and through this search let him find it. For it says, I will not speak of a reckoning that is strange and unusual, nor will I present a name that is secret and unclear, but I will give a calculation that is oft-used and known to people, which adds up to 666. While to be sure this number signifies also many other names, both proper names as well as titles, it signifies also these following. Among the proper names it can render “Lampetis,” and “Benedict” and “Titan.” “Titan” is written with an iota, but it can be written with a diphthong. For if “Teitan” is derived from τεῖσις [stretching]—the verb is τείνω and the future is τενῶ—then it is correctly written with the diphthong, even as φθείρω is from φθερῶ and φθείρω is from φθερῶ. Among the titles, the number can render ὁ νικητής [the Conqueror]—for perhaps he named himself this when he warred against the three horns or three kings and rooted them out. See what Daniel says about them in his eighth vision: “I considered his horns (that is, those of the fourth beast) and behold, there came up among them another little horn, and three of the former horns were rooted out before it; and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking haughty things.” And then there are also these titles, ὁ ἐπίσαλος [Unstable], κακὸς ὁδηγός [Evil Guide], ἀληθὴς βλαβερός [Truly Harmful], πάλαι βάσκανος [Ancient Slanderer], ἀμνὸς ἄδικος [Unjust Lamb]. Perhaps he was called these names by those who opposed him. But this one will not be at all ashamed to be called these things; he will rather even rejoice in such appellations, since he is not ashamed even to call himself such things. Rebuking such wicked and vile choices, the wise apostle says, “Whose glory is in their shame.” Therefore, since many names have been found, anyone who wishes has the right to bestow a more suitable name on the accursed.
