Here it says is wisdom: let him calculate the number of the beast and through the calculation let him find it. For I will not say, it says, a foreign and unusual calculation, nor one named with concealment and doubling, but a calculation well-worn and known to men, which sums to the number six hundred sixty-six. This number also signifies many other proper and common names, and it also signifies these: as principal names Lampetis [Λαμπέτις], Benedictus [Βενέδικτος], Titan [Τιτάν]. For Titan is written with the letter iota, and in some cases it is written as a diphthong.

For if Teitan [Τειτάν] is from teísis [τείσεως - tension], and the verb is teinō [τείνω], and the future tense will be tenô [τενῶ], it is reasonable to write it with a diphthong, as phteírō [φθείρω] from phthérō [φθερῶ], and speírō [σπείρω] from sperō [σπερῶ]. By form of address, however, the Victor [ὁ νικητής], for perhaps he so named himself, from whom the three horns, that is, having waged war against the kings, he will uproot. See what Daniel says about these things in his eighth vision: "He says that attention was paid to its horns, that is, of the fourth beast; and behold, another little horn came up among them, and three of the horns that were before it were uprooted from its presence; and behold, eyes like the eyes of a man were in that horn, and a mouth speaking great things." (Dan. 7:8)

Then the unstable one [ὁ ἐπίσαλος], a wicked guide [κακὸς ὁδηγός], truly harmful [ἀληθὴς βλαβερός], ancient slanderer [πάλαι βάσκανος], an unjust lamb [ἀμνὸς ἄδικος]; for perhaps by these names he would be called by those opposing him. But he will not only not be ashamed to be called these things, he will also take pleasure in such labels, so as not to be embarrassed to call himself accordingly. Stitching such wicked and God-hating choices together, the wise apostle says: "whose glory is in their shame." (Philip. 3:19) Therefore, with many names having been found, the authority to attach the more fitting one rests with the one who wills it to the accursed one.
