Perhaps someone who has been exceedingly attentive would consider what has been said and would say to me as follows: “You there, what are you doing? Have you forgotten what was said in the introduction to the present Revelation? For it was there said, And the first voice which I had heard was like a trumpet speaking to me, saying, Come up hither, and I will show you what must take place after this. But you have been explaining to us not future events but things which have already taken place, in your account of the Lord’s birth, his temptation, his teachings, his miracles, his beatings and bonds and the blows he suffered before Pilate, his cross and death, and his resurrection and ascension or return to heaven.” 

To such a one I would reply: “You have certainly heard, my friend, some of the future events, too, when we were describing the righteous from among the nations who were with Israel around the divine throne, and present with the Lord. But now you will hear more at the breaking of the seventh seal. For when the divine oracle said to the evangelist, Come up hither, and I will show you what must take place after this, this did not invalidate his vision of past events, but with them he indicated future events, too.” 

Therefore, listen. The breaking of the seventh seal accomplished for us the final glory; for no longer as before was it the forgiveness of sins and our turning to God and God’s turning to us, but the inexpressible benefits—being called sons of God, “heirs of God and fellow heirs of Christ,” brothers and friends and children of Christ, reigning with him and being glorified together with him, and benefits “which no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived.” 

What is the breaking of the seventh seal? The second coming of the Lord and the consequent gift of his benefits. For even if some of those who have sinned are handed over for punishment, the aim of Christ and the plan of the incarnation is that all should become heirs of his kingdom. 

So when the seventh seal was broken, he says, there was silence for about half an hour, in anticipation of the coming of the king of creation, when every angelic and supermundane power had been filled with the exceeding glory of his presence; this is why they fell silent. 

Then he says, seven trumpets were given to the seven angels so that they might sound their trumpets as at the institution of a king. By the same trumpets they were going to wake the dead from sleep. For the wise apostle, too, writing to the Thessalonians about God’s works, says in his first epistle, that “the Lord himself will come down, with a shout of command, an archangel’s voice, and a trumpet of God,” and again, “For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable.”
