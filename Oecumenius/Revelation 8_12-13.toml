We have been taught by Joel the prophet that “the sun” shall be turned “to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord comes,” meaning that on that day all these things will take place. Peter, too, said in his second epistle, “The day of the Lord will come as a thief, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire.” The Lord himself, too, in the hundredand-ninth section of Matthew says, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven.” We are now being taught through the Revelation that these things will come about at the consummation of the present age. 

What is the meaning that not everything on the earth, in the sea, and in the rivers, as well as also the elements in the heavens, will experience the afore-mentioned sufferings, but only a third of them? This is also a sure proof of God’s love of humankind. He was calling to repentance those of an earlier time by means of a partial and not a total onslaught against the elements. Those who do not turn to him he leads to total destruction in the future. 

The prophet also says something similar: “He made a path for his anger; he did not spare their souls from death.” For to go partly forward as on a road and to send forth part of God’s wrath is the mark of one who opens a door to repentance by calling human beings to a change of purpose through fear of what is taking place [around them]. But if those among them do not go forward and make progress, “he did not spare their souls from death.” 

The eagle in midheaven, looking sadly at the misfortunes of those on earth, you will understand is a kind of divine angel sympathizing with the plight of human beings.
