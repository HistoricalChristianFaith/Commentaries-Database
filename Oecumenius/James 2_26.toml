James is talking here about faith after baptism, for a faith without works can only make us more guilty of sin, seeing that we have received a talent but are not using it profitably. The Lord himself demonstrated the need for works after baptism by going into the desert to do battle with the devil. Paul also exhorts those who have entered into the mystery of faith to “strive to enter his peace,” as if faith by itself were not enough. Holiness of life is also necessary, and for that great efforts are required.
