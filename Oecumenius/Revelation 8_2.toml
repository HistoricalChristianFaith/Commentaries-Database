Then it is said that seven trumpets were given to the seven angels so that they might sound them as a king takes his place. With these same trumpets, the dead were also about to be awakened; for the wise apostle to the Thessalonians, writing about divine matters, says in the first epistle that "the Lord Himself will descend with a command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the trumpet of God." (1 Thess. 4:16)

And again, he says, "for the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible." (1 Cor. 15:52)
