And seven trumpets were given to the seven angels, so that they might sound the signal that the king was arriving. But the sound of these very trumpets will also awaken those who are dead. For, the apostle, who is wise in divine things, wrote in his first letter to the Thessalonians that “the Lord himself will descend at a command, at the call of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God.” And again, “The trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible.”
