Do not receive an accusation against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all, so that the rest also may be fearful.

Do not receive an accusation against an elder. What then? Should such an accusation be admitted against the younger? By no means! But as if he were saying: Against no one, and especially not against the elder; for they have, even from their very age, a certain restraint; therefore he calls him an elder [πρεσβύτερον] who is old in age.

Rebuke those who sin in the presence of all. For he seeks carefully, Paul says, and when he finds, he reproaches with severity. For this is the rebuke. Before all, so that the rest may also be admonished. This, God did, both upon Pharaoh (Ex. 19) and upon Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 4).
