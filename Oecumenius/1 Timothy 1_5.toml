The goal of the command is love from a pure heart and of a good conscience and sincere faith.

For since this was the case, the practice of teaching others also ceased. How so? Because from not loving, envy entered some against the teachers due to their desire to be teachers themselves. Therefore, the practice of teaching others ceased.

For he says, from a pure heart. For it is also possible to love from an impure heart, like the friendships of thieves toward thieves. From a pure heart, as well as perfect love, he says, you yourself command. Indeed, those things which are the chief parts of speeches, are repeated at the beginning and at the end by those who give commands, because these are easier to remember.

and of a good conscience. I do not seek, Paul said, that which is extended merely to words, which can also be in hypocrisy, but that which proceeds from the heart, and is pure in that way: which comes from conscience and from the thought that arises from it, which alone has no hypocrisy. For who would be the one to deceive himself, or try to conceal it?
