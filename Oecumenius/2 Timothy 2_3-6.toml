Therefore, endure hardship as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No one engaged in warfare gets entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one who joined him. And if anyone competes as an athlete, he is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. The hardworking farmer must be the first to receive a share of the crops.

Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel! Is it so great a thing to be a soldier of Christ? But the mark of a soldier is to endure hardship.

No one engaged in warfare. Paul remembered the soldier, showing that the servant of Christ must be eager and bold; and as an athlete, showing that he needs continuous training. If, therefore, he says, the one serving the earthly king is not entangled in matters that distract him from his weapons, how much more the one who has committed himself to the heavenly king and recruited.

unless he competes according to the rules. For it is not enough merely to be anointed, or to enter the place of combat, or to engage in hand-to-hand fighting with the enemy, but it is also necessary to endure and to win: for this is the law of combat.

The hardworking farmer. Not careless: but one who works. For indeed, the teacher who also works with the students will receive rewards from God for the benefit and advantage of the students.

— [GREGORY OF NYSSA]1 As teachers must first be perfected in themselves in what they teach. For this is necessary, to partake first of the fruits, which they cultivate in themselves through virtues before others. [end of the excerpt by Gregory of Nyssa] —

The example of the soldier and the wanderer suits the students, but that of the farmer suits only the teachers. For just as, it is said, the farmer takes care of the land and the fruits, so must you take care of the students and your preaching. And see to the return. The benefit, it is said, of the students is first enjoyed by the teacher from God, just as the farmer enjoys the fruits.
