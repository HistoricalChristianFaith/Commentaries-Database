The testimony also judges from which it makes that apparent. And see how it establishes that. In any case, he says, it is necessary that some enter into the rest of God, lest the promise be made in vain and rashly. Therefore, since they did not enter (for he swore that they shall not enter), it is necessary for us, as long as we wish, to enter, not now into a figurative rest, but into the true kingdom of heaven. For although their children entered the promised land, now another rest is defined through David. For what else does it mean: "Today, if you hear his voice"? (Heb. 3:15)
As I swore in my wrath. But this testimony is not meant for those of us who have believed, who enter into the rest of God, but for those who do not enter: indeed, he says, since they did not enter, we must enter. For he speaks more openly in this progression. Now, indeed, besides this, he wishes to show that just as the rest of the Sabbath does not prevent another rest of the promised land from being called rest, so neither does the rest of the promised land prevent the kingdom of heaven from being called rest.
Therefore, he also adds: although his works were finished from the foundation of the world, from which God rested, did not prevent the land of promise from being called rest.
"from all his works.” Then, since he had called it rest (it was said, however, to be the rest of the Sabbath), he himself resolves that and says: Now that the rest of the works is made, he also calls this rest, namely the land of promise.
“And God rested.” You see, he says, that there are two rests? One on the seventh day, in which God rested from his works: and one of the land of promise, about which David is now speaking. Therefore, he says: Just as the first rest did not prevent the second from being called rest: so neither will the second prevent the third, namely the kingdom of heaven. This, however, he asserts, because he will say that we can enter into his rest. Let him not hear: But they have entered: and finally, he says that there is another rest.
Indeed, he says, "the third rest is the kingdom of heaven. And there again, “If they shall enter into my rest.” Behold, therefore, two works, the other indeed of which David said: “If they shall enter into my rest."
