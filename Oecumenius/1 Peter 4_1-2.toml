Since Christ suffered in the flesh for you, arm yourselves with the same thought: for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.
The order is as follows: Therefore, since Christ has died in the flesh, you also should arrange yourselves according to the same thought: for you have died, namely, to the world: moreover, he who has died has ceased from sin, etc.
"the same thought." That is, according to the same intention and the same purpose. For due to the lack of intention, it is said κατὰ, that is, "according to".
"he who has suffered in the flesh:" that is, He has died, saying similar things with Paul: "If we have died with Christ, we shall also live with Him. And indeed we will be dead to sin, but we will live to God." (Rom. 6:8-10)
