quote='''
He says you hope in uncertain wealth (1 Tim. 6:17), and you have suffocated the gift of grace as if among thorns (Matt. 13:22), not listening to the one speaking: "if wealth increases, do you not set your heart on them?" (Ps. 61:11) And he says that wealth is earthly and temporary. And do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked, lacking the spiritual and enduring things.
