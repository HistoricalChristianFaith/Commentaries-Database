For you have some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and commit sexual immorality. So you also have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way. Balak, therefore, taught him in the manner of a teacher who became guide to Balaam. According to both Balaam and Balak, the story is clearly established in the book of Numbers, which is the book of Numbers written by the wisest Moses. Josephus records that by the counsel of Balaam, the Midianites were sent against Israel into fornication, calling them to apostasy from God. He says that those who come from Nicolaus do such things and you do not drive them away from yourself.
