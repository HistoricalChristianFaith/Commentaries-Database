John calls Jesus our advocate because it is he who prays to the Father for us. In saying this he is speaking in a human way and within a human context, just as elsewhere he says: “The Son can do nothing by himself.” He puts it this way so that the Son will not appear to be the Father’s opponent. For that the Son has the power to forgive sins is clear from the case of the paralytic, and by giving his disciples the power to forgive sins, he shows that he can also share his power with others.
