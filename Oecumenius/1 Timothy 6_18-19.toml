to do good, to be rich in good works. If you seek wealth, seek true wealth, not uncertain. What are these? Goods, Paul says, are easy to distribute; for this is the nature of money.

to be generous. That is, gentle, friendly, modest, and humble.

storing up for themselves. That is, laying down, Paul says, a good foundation. Where the foundation is good, all is safe and secure.

so that they may obtain eternal life. Therefore, for this life, one must lay up the foundation. But how could this be? If by doing good here, we lay up for ourselves the foundation and security of this life.
