We heard, and we who are men, are true sons through grace. The angels, however, did not hear this, lest their sublimity be thought to be from nature rather than from grace. Christ, however, is not from grace, but from nature.
"I have begotten You." The Father relates the birth of the Son according to the flesh, therefore he said: “today”; Thus says the holy Athanasius.
"I will be to Him a Father."

Again, accept this as the Son's birth according to the flesh, belonging to the Father; for it is clearly said, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son according to the flesh."

"But when He again brings." Indeed, he brings, is as if “hands over.” For then He obtained the world which was voluntarily governed by Him, when He tasted death for the whole world, and when He was believed to be God.
However, in order that the speech may be easily received, he said that the Father introduces the Son. By introducing, he understands not that He was previously located outside the created world: (for how could he fill all things?), But that He had nothing in common with the created world since He was God. Furthermore, when He assumed flesh, then He communicated with the created world; when He united to Himself that which was created. Thus, the holy Cyril, in his work, "Christ is God." And blessed Gregory of Nyssa in his books against Eunomius. What he says: The Firstborn, does not refer to the second, but of the one and only begotten from the Father.

"But when He again brings the firstborn into the world." That is, when it was His good pleasure for His Firstborn to appear in flesh to those who populated the world. For He says: "And the angels came and ministered to Him (Matt. 4:11);" and: "From now on you will see angels descending upon the Son of Man." (Jn. 1:51)

"Let all the angels of God worship Him," That is, in the flesh. It shows here that he is so much greater than them, as a master is greater than servants; just as if someone were to bring someone into a house, he would immediately command those in charge of them to worship [προσκυνεῖν] him. Thus appearing in the flesh: that is, the angels worship the Son in the flesh.
"Who makes His angels spirits." For they are created beings, therefore he says, "Who makes." Behold the greatest difference: that some are created, while the One is uncreated; for the act of creating denotes the production from non-being into being. It is not only to angels that the exceptional pertains, but also to every functional power. He did not say, "Having created," but "Creating," that is, sustaining by the Word, according to which they came into being.
