All those who remained in sins and were not accounted worthy to be in the Book of Life suffered the same fate. Do not marvel that it says that even those who had sinned moderately were thrown into the lake of fire together with the devil and the antichrist. For even there, there is a distinction of punishments. Just as in a fire there is a part that is continuously very hot and a part that is not so hot and is somewhat temperate, yet every part is called fire, so you might, as I do, consider this also to be like that.
