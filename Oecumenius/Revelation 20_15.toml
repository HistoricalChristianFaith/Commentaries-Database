And if anyone was not found written in the little scroll of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.

But those who are said to have been in sins and are not worthy of the inscription in life have suffered equally. And if he said that those who are in the middle of the sinners are cast into the lake of fire together with the Devil and the Antichrist, for he said this above, do not be surprised, for there too there is a varied punishment, just as with fever: one kind is burning and continuous, another is lesser and mild, even if all are called fevers; so likewise there you will perceive.
