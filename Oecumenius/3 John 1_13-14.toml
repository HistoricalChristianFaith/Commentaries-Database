I had many things to write, but I do not want to write to you with ink and pen. However, I hope to see you soon, and we will speak in person. Peace be with you. Your friends greet you. Greet your friends by name.
Similar things have been said and interpreted at the end of the preceding letter; therefore, it would be unnecessary to repeat the same things again.
The end, with divine assistance favoring, of the third Catholic letter of John.
on the Epistle of Jude
This letter is written to those who have already believed. The occasion was this: when some had come in who taught that sin is something common and indifferent and denied the Lord, it was necessary to write to them and confirm the brothers. And first, Jude urges them to resist and remain in the faith that was entrusted to them. Then he reveals such seducers and warns them to have no relationship with such people: knowing that it is not enough to be simply called, unless they also walk worthily of the calling. For although the Lord had previously brought the people out of Egypt, He did not spare those who did not remain in the faith; nor did He spare the angels who did not keep their own order. Therefore, it is necessary to depart from such things. Indeed, even Michael the archangel did not tolerate the blasphemy of the Devil. Therefore, he teaches about their future destruction like that of Sodom, then he urges them to have good morals, and having prayed for them to the Lord for the firmness of their faith, he concludes the letter.
