You are able to understand it in this way. It has been said by Gregory in his sacred writings, in his Apologetics and in his To the Governors, that the present divine mysteries are antitypes of even greater mysteries. And again in his treatise Concerning the Resurrection he says, “Let us receive the Passover, now in a typological fashion, but hereafter in a more complete manner. For the Passover under Mosaic law, I dare to say and in fact say it, was a prefigurement of a prefigurement.” Gregory said these things in the following sense. The apostle knew among these things “the shadow” and “the image” and “the coming good things,” which he also calls “the substance,” that is, the true things. For inasmuch as he makes clear what are the true matters—for that is also the truth—by comparing it with the shadow and the image, he first knows the things in the law as the shadow and second our things (those of Christians) as an image, but “the coming good things” and the true “substance” the things in the coming age. For just as the image is not entirely in accord with the truth, so also the shadow is not entirely in accord with the image. For even if the image does not have the very truth, except that it exists as a visible imitation of the truth by preserving the shape through its surfaces and the proportion of its members and the complexion of the substrate. But the “shadow” is an indistinct appearance of the image, showing none of the things of which it is the image. And I believe that Gregory in his sacred writings has been led forth by these apostolic writings to say what is most likely. And many other fathers say things similar to Gregory.
