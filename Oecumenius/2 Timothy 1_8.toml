Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but share in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God.

Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord. Many miserable people, examining the mystery according to human reasoning, say it is a shame to preach the Son of God crucified, not knowing what was accomplished through the cross and the death of the Lord. You, therefore, Paul says, do not be ashamed of the testimony, that is, the cross of Christ, but proclaim it boldly.

nor of me His prisoner. Nor should you be ashamed that you have as a teacher one who is bound. For if Christ did not find shame to be crucified, neither do I for the chains.

but share in the sufferings. And do not only be unashamed, but also endure hardship with me; that is, if it is necessary for you to suffer such things for the sake of the Gospel, do not have fear. For this is what he also indicated above where Paul says, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power." For do you say that you have suffered by your own power? God gave and will give such power; you only introduced the willingness.
