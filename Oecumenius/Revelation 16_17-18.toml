He poured out the bowl in the air, and the voice said, “It is done!” What is done? To be sure, the commandment of God and his will. And when from the air the voice said, “It is done,” there were flashes of lightning and voices, lightning from on high and voices from those on the earth who were alarmed by the lightning. “And peals of thunder and an earthquake.” By “earthquake” he means either the turmoil of the earth, since this also is included in the signs of the end, or he means the transformation of the visible world, as it is said in Haggai: “Once again I will shake not only the heaven but also the earth and the sea and the dry land; and I will shake all nations.” Therefore, he also indicated that there had never been such an earthquake.
