He says a white throne, bright and flashing as with lightning. By the flight of heaven and earth the account symbolizes their change and transformation. For “the heavens will pass away with a loud noise,” according to blessed Peter and according to the prophet who says, “In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of your earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you endure; they will all wear out like a garment. You will wrap them up like a cloth, and they will be changed,” presumably referring to their passing and destruction. What these sayings describe as their “change,” the Revelation called “flight,” so that no place was found for them. For where could they be found when they had been cast down in destruction? Although he has here spoken of their change, a little further on he says that they will be new. 

He says, And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne: by great he means the righteous, calling them great not in virtue of their physical size, but because of the glory and brightness of their goodness, and by small he means the sinners as being worthless on account of their baseness and meanness. 

And scrolls were opened. Also another little scroll was opened, which is the little scroll of life. The Lord says in the gospels that the way leading to destruction is broad and spacious, and many travel on it, while the way that leads to life is narrow and constricted, and there are few not only who walk along it but who even find it. This is why he saw many scrolls and a single scroll: the many are those in which all human beings are written, because of the multitude of those involved, but there is one scroll of life, in which are those chosen from the rest who are blameless in virtue and travel along the entire length of the steep and rugged path of virtue. 

And all of those written in the scrolls, he says, were judged in accordance with their own individual works. In the beginning of the sixth chapter he mentioned another little scroll, too, which he called a miniature scroll. But now he talks of a scroll and a little scroll of life, so that there are three different scrolls. By a miniature scroll he means that in which are the exceedingly impious, as we considered there: the little scroll of life is that in which are the exceedingly righteous and just, and the scrolls are those which contain all human beings who are somehow midway between evil and goodness. 

He is talking about the resurrection. For to say, And I saw the dead before the throne receiving their rewards and being judged according to their works, is to speak of the resurrection. For he saw the dead rise up and receive their just recompense, and he goes on to describe how the resurrection took place.
