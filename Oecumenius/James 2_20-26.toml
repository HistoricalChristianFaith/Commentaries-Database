But will you know O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Abraham our father was he not justified by works, offering Isaac his son upon the altar? see that faith did work with his works: and by the works the faith was complete? And the Scripture was fulfilled, saying, Abraham believed God, and it was reputed him to righteousness, and he was called the friend of God. Do you see that by works a man is justified: and not by faith only? And in like manner also Rahab the harlot, was not she justified by works, receiving the messengers, and putting them forth another way? For even as the body without the spirit is dead: so also faith without works is dead.
James called a man vain who boasts of a bare faith, when he has obtained nothing of substance for completion through works.
“Abraham our father.” Both Paul (Rom. 4:12) and James take Abraham as an example in their discourse on faith: Paul, indeed to show that faith is superior to works, while James, on the other hand, asserts that works are more excellent than faith through the same Abraham. And indeed, it has been said above that concerning the dual meaning of faith, each one brings forth what is beneficial to the explanation of their own purpose. Some of the Fathers, however, understood this matter in this way. For they say that the same Abraham bore the image of both faiths at various distinct times, and that the faith which is before baptism does not require works, but only faith and the confession of salvation and the word by which we are justified, believing in Christ; and that which follows baptism is connected with works. Thus, it does not appear that the spirit who spoke in the apostles is different; but that this faith indeed justifies the one who approaches by confession alone, if he immediately departs from a sinful life (for to him there are no works, but purification through baptism is a sufficient remedy), while that which is required from one who has already been baptized also demands the display of good works. With this sense, Paul also agrees in another place, saying and teaching that faith after baptism requires perfection through works, when he says: "Neither circumcision benefits anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith which works by love.” (Gal. 5:6) And love needs lengthy practice to be perfected.
In another way. Abraham was indeed an image of the justification which is by faith alone, when it was imputed to him for righteousness that he believed (Gen. 15:6); but of that which is by works, when he offered his son upon the altar. (Gen. 22:10) If anything, he not only completed the work but also remained in faith that through Isaac his seed would be multiplied like the stars, considering that God could even raise the dead. (Heb. 11:17-19) Yet Paul also brings David as a witness (Rom. 6:6), wisely confirming his own. For he knew through the Spirit that faith which was to come in future times through Christ: therefore he said: "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin." (Ps. 31:2)
“faith without works is dead.” James says faith which is after baptism. For faith without works profits nothing, except that it makes us liable to a still greater punishment, who indeed have received the talent, yet have not returned the gain. From which the Lord also teaches us that after baptism good works are necessary for us, since after being baptized by John he went to the desert and undertook struggles against the Devil. (Matt. 4:1) Paul also exhorts those who had already received the mysteries, saying: “Let us strive to enter into that rest.” (Heb. 4:4) As if faith were not enough, but purity of life should also be added, and great diligence should be applied to this.
