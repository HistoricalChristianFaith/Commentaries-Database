He poured out the bowl in the air, and the voice said, It is done. What was done? The command, that is, of God, and his will. 

When It is done had been spoken, there came from the air, flashes of lightning and voices—flashes of lightning from on high, and voices from those on earth in fear of the lightning. And peals of thunder and an earthquake. 

By the earthquake he either means the tumult of the earth, since this also is included in the signs of the end, or he calls the changing of the visible order an earthquake, as Haggai said, “Once again I will shake” not only “the heaven” but also “the earth and the sea and the dry land, and I will shake all the nations together.” This is why he says that such [an earthquake] has never occurred before. 

He says, The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell down (Rv 16.19). By the great city he means Jerusalem, and he clearly contrasts with this the cities of the nations. For apart from Israel it is the custom in Holy Scripture to call the rest of humankind nations. He calls it great because of its renown. All the cities fell down, 

for when the earth was being changed and had become new, how could the cities on it remain standing since they had been defiled by the residence of sinners? 

He says, And great Babylon was remembered before God, to be given the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. It was said earlier, A second angel followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great” (Rv 14.8). In the present passage he is speaking to us about another Babylon, and he gives us to understand that he means not that one, but some other one. And I fancy he is talking about Rome and all the calamities that will later overtake it, as the account will proceed to describe. Therefore he says, And great Babylon was remembered before God. That is, the memory of her sins of old, when they persecuted and murdered God’s people, came into God’s mind. 

The cup of the wine of the wrath of God has already been interpreted. So there is no need to spend any more time on this. 

He says, And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found. The churches of the nations are said to be islands, as the prophet says, “The Lord has become king; let the earth rejoice; let the many islands be glad.” They have been called islands as having sprung up and as having overcome the bitterness and brackishness of idolatry. According to another meaning, one might also understand islands to be the unclean brigades of demons, as wallowing in this brackish and turbulent life. 

In referring to the mountains as demons he is supported by the blessed poet, singing, “The mountains melted away like wax from before the Lord because he is coming.” 

Therefore, the account tells us that the present brigades of demons will be clean gone and will disappear. But where would the wretched ones flee from the face of God, who holds “in his hand the ends of the earth,” who “has measured heaven in a span and the earth with the palm of his hand”? In vain will those who have been struck by the plagues attempt flight and escape. 

After these events, and in the face of the violent hail, human beings should have turned to prayers and entreaties. For then all these signs against them would have ceased. But they even went on to curse God, and that is why their troubles were in fact increased.
