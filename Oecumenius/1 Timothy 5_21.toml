I seriously charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels to keep these instructions without bias, and to do nothing out of favoritism.

I seriously charge you before God. Paul warns of severity. For Timothy did not simply resign, but protested, securing himself in case anything improper should happen. But why did Paul call the Father and the Son as witnesses, and also angels together? Because they, along with their Lord who is to come in judgment, are present and will bear witness to the discourse. It is also our custom to call both superiors and inferiors as witnesses. And Jacob also took God and the mountain as witnesses. (Gen. 31:46)

and the elect angels. He said "elect angels," because angels and demons alike are cast away.

— [OECUMENIUS] Either he spoke what was truly the case, or he brought them to the brink of ruin. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 173v; B f. 209τ; G f. 297r] —

to keep these instructions without bias. This, for example, is what he said: Without haste in judgment, that is, so that you do nothing rashly or recklessly from what has been said, and not without preceding judgment or counsel.

and to do nothing out of favoritism. Indeed, presumptions are often devoid of truth. For favoritism [πρόσκλησις] is an affectation that incites someone to do something without judgment.

without bias. That is, without falling into the judgment and punishment of disobedience for someone who has erred in something. Thus Clement in the seventh book of Hypotyposes. And Basil, in his interpretation of the Proverbs, says, According to inclination, that is, not leaning towards what is wrong, but bringing forth straight judgment. For he says thus: Doing nothing according to inclination, but bringing forth judgments straight and unaltered.
