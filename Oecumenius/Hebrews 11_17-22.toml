"By faith, Abraham offered up Isaac." By what faith? That God is able to raise him even from the dead.
"being tested." God tested Abraham, not because he himself wanted to learn about Abraham (for how could He who searches our hearts be alone in this?); (Ps. 7:10) but rather, he would make it evident to us.
"his only begotten." For in case anyone say that he still had a child, and was expecting the promise to be fulfilled through him, he willingly offered Isaac, for he says, he was not the only begotten; he was only begotten in terms of the promise, since he also had Ishmael.
"to whom it was said." Thus, it is said, as to the apparent, God seems to command the opposite of what He promised. And yet Abraham did not waver. For how could Isaac be called his seed, when he was commanded to sacrifice Isaac? Nevertheless, he did not hesitate even then.
"considering that God was able even to raise him from the dead." Do you see how by faith Abraham did everything? For he believed that God could even raise him from the dead after he was sacrificed.
"from which, figuratively speaking." And Abraham himself and Isaac himself. For it is fitting concerning the two. But see this, "figuratively." Abraham was a type of God the Father, and Isaac, of the Son of God. For since God was about to provide us with something great, the sacrifice of His Son, being very compassionate, so that we might not think that we are saved by grace alone, He made it necessary to deliver Christ. And the necessity is thus: "Just as," he says, "Abraham was willing to deliver his only-begotten for me to death, so also I," he says, "must deliver my Only-begotten to death for the sake of men." And the "figuratively," we can also understand this way, connecting it to the person of Isaac: He brought Isaac, and made him a figure and a type and an example of Christ, so that just as Isaac was sacrificed according to Abraham's intention, so also Christ was sacrificed, in truth. And thus, the "figuratively," understand; that is, he says, he brought Isaac in a figure, that is, instead of the type and the example. For he indicated the ram, and having given it instead of him, he received Isaac. But the first interpretation, as I think, is much better.

That is, "from which, figuratively speaking," it is possible to understand it this way: From where Abraham also brought Isaac in a figure. For he says, he demonstrated some overwhelming obedience, and faith that overcame even the laws of nature, he again receives the son, not as one who offered him, but with a great addition and value of his own faith. For he brought him bearing a figure and a likeness to the Son of God and God. Such things faith is able to accomplish. If, however, you take the common point in the figure from both Abraham and Isaac, that one served as a type of the Father and as a figure and likeness through the offering of the child, while Isaac served as a type of the Son, thus the aforementioned understanding is fulfilled. So great a gain, he says, faith brought to Abraham, that having offered his son, he received him back with the greatest addition.
Of which addition was this? The one in the figure, both in relation to the Father and in relation to the Son to be brought forth. That is to say, He brought forth the Son for such a gain, in which the Father willed for both to be made a type of approach to be accomplished upon the Son. In the figure, God brought forth Isaac; that is, because of the faith and willingness of Abraham, although a ram was presented, and then not brought forth by Abraham, but by God Himself, who also brought forth. Thus, God accepted the sacrifice, as if bringing forth Isaac Himself through the figure and the substitution of the ram. Therefore, it is said, from where He brought him forth, as Isaac, in the parable and substitution of the ram, that is, as the purpose was fulfilled, and the willingness of his faith, therefore, God accepted the sacrifice of Abraham.

"By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come." From where were such good things promised to his sons, if he did not believe that God would give the promises? And what is it, concerning things to come? Or concerning what is to happen to them, or concerning what is to be given to their offspring. For neither did they themselves enjoy the promise. Jacob, however, is first named because of his virtue.

"By faith Jacob, as he was dying." — Here, he says not only this, but also therefore he encouraged those to come, as he would also demonstrate in the work itself. For he was about to rise another king from Ephraim.
Therefore, he says, And he adored at the top of his staff, that is, even being old, he worships Joseph, indicating the worship of all, that which was to come to him. And this because he knew that his brothers had adored [προσεκύνησεν] him.It was about to be revealed later, through the ten tribes.

"and he adored at the top of the staff." For he signified the kingdom of Ephraim and the overthrow of the ten tribes. Therefore, he himself prefigures their adoration.

For he believed so much, he says, in what was to come, that he also adored with the staff, thinking he was seeing what was to come. For from the two sons of Joseph, Ephraim and Manasseh, kings were to arise from the seed of Ephraim. Therefore, revealing the kingdom to his seed, he adored at the top of the staff of Manasseh. It is written in the book of Genesis thus: "And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years." (Gen. 47:28)And the days of Jacob’s life were one hundred and forty-seven years. And the days of Israel drew near to die, and he called his son Joseph and said to him: “If I have found grace in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; do not bury me in Egypt, but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place. And he said, I will do as you have said. And he said, Swear to me. And he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.” (Gen. 47:29-31) —
By faith, Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites from Egypt and gave instructions concerning his bones. For he believed so much that they would come out of Egypt, that he also swore that his bones would be carried away. What then? So that always remembering the oaths of Joseph, they might see also the matters concerning the exodus. For who would have sworn that his bones would be carried away, if he did not strongly believe that they would go out?
