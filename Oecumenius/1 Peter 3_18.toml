The righteous person suffers for the salvation of others, just as Christ did. This is why Peter mentions our Lord’s example, since Christ did not die for his own sins but for ours. This is the point he makes by adding “the righteous for the unrighteous.” For as the prophet long ago foretold, Christ did not sin at all. Furthermore, in order to emphasize the effectiveness and completeness of Christ’s sacrifice, Peter adds the key word once. So great was his passion that however often human beings may sin, that one act of suffering is sufficient to take away all our transgressions.
