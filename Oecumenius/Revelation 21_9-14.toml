He says, Then one of the seven angels came: what seven are these? They are those of whom I have had much to say earlier on. 

Come, he says, I will show you the wife of the Lamb: he means to signify “the church of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven,” which he also calls the heavenly Jerusalem. Paul spoke about this when writing to the Hebrews, “For you have not come to a mountain that may be touched, with blazing fire, and darkness, and gloom, and a tempest, and the sound of a trumpet, and the words of a voice; those who heard it implored that nothing further should be spoken to them. For they could not endure the order that was given, ‘If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.’ Indeed, so terrifying was the sight” that [Moses] said, “‘I am filled with fear and trembling.’ But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the church of the first-born who are enrolled in heaven, and to a judge who is God of all.” 

By speaking of the assembly of all the holy people as a unity, namely, the church, and of the heavenly Jerusalem, the text depicts the blessedness of the saints, and their life which will be in God and with God, as is meant by describing it in material and grandiose terms, so leading our mind to consider its spiritual glory and brightness in this present setting. 

He says, And in the Spirit he carried me away to a high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God, having the glory of God: for it is not without spiritual grace that the human mind can ever be so exalted as to comprehend the glory of the saints. This is naturally the church, as though the life of the righteous and their situation, both here and in the future, is a great, high mountain. For there is nothing on ground-level or abject with them, but everything is high and lifted up. For Scripture says of them, “The rulers of the earth who belong to God were highly exalted.” 

He says, Its radiance, that is, Christ, the “sun of righteousness,” is like jasper: jasper, as was also said earlier, is green, and so exhibits the life-giving and quickening gift of Christ, who “opens his hand and fills every living thing with satisfaction.” For green is the origin of all earthly nourishment. But the jasper was also as clear as crystal, exhibiting the purity and holiness of Christ, “for he had committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth,” according to the prophecy of Isaiah. 

Again, Christ is himself a wall of the saints, that is, of the church, since he is our defense and shelter and succor. 

He says it has twelve gates, symbolizing the divine apostles who proclaimed to us the entrance into faith in Christ. 

And at the gates twelve angels: I am convinced that the divine angels worked with the holy apostles to bring the world to faith; for if the law of Moses was spoken by means of angels—as the apostle says, “For if the message declared by means of angels was valid” —surely the preaching of the gospel even more so had the cooperation of angels? 

He says, And names were written on them which are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel: historically Israel is those who were born from Jacob the patriarch, but spiritually it means those who walk by the faith of our father Abraham. The apostle witnesses to this when he says, “And he is the father of the circumcised, not only of those who are circumcised but also of those who follow in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham.” Israel is interpreted as “the mind seeing God,” or being clear-sighted. Who rather than the believers have had a vision of God in their mind or have become clear-sighted by the abundant operation of the Spirit? So the names of these have been engraved on the gates of the city. 

The twelve tribes indicate the full complement of the faithful. For after calling the believers Israel, he has mentioned, too, the number of their full complement, by saying twelve tribes, and he says that they came from the four corners of the world through three gates [on each side]. For the blessed apostles have mentioned the whole Trinity, proclaiming to the nations [the persons of the Godhead] as being of the same substance, and “baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” 

And the wall of the city, he says, had twelve foundations: for Christ, whom we have considered to be a wall, relies on the preaching of the apostles, and stands upon them like “a precious cornerstone,” according to Scripture. 

And on them, that is, on the foundations, are the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb: he has at last revealed the symbolism by clearly saying that he means the apostles are the gates and foundations of the holy city, the church. 

May all of us stand firm in their teaching and “avoid the unhallowed chatter of the falsely called knowledge” of the heretics, by the grace of “Christ our master” and “chief shepherd,” to whom be the glory for ever. Amen.
