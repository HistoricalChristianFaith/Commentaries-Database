I therefore seriously charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom: Preach the word; be prepared in season and out of season; correct, rebuke and encourage—with great patience and careful instruction.

The continuous exhortation and command produces three effects: it makes the command more formidable and undeniable, and it presents what is useful in speech. For if it were not such, it would not be necessary for it to be preached with such great determination. Moreover, what belongs to him who urgently announces it is done, no longer subject, as is likely, to the negligence that usually occurs in preaching.

who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing. Paul speaks of the sinners and the righteous, or those who have passed away, and those still living, or that many will be left alive then. Paul also says elsewhere, "Indeed, we shall not all sleep." (1 Cor. 15:51)

at his appearing. When is the future to be judged? At the Lord’s arrival, which will be after the kingdom and glory have come. For he will not come in the same way as he came before.

Preach the word. But what then is the obstacle? Do not hide the message, but proclaim it.

be prepared. That is, repeat, look around and watch that no one sins. And do this promptly, untimely, that is, do not have a fixed and definite time for this, but at all times, even if it is not convenient, manage. And if you find, Paul says, someone sinning, correct. For nothing ought to be done before you have convinced: and after you have shown him to be guilty, rebuke.

Find fault, blame. Then after the wound, apply a remedy. For Paul says, "encourage," so that such a person is not swallowed up by excessive grief.

with great patience. For the matter requires patience, so that one should not simply trust those who speak, but come through every investigation and the test of time to the truth.

and careful instruction. Paul says to admonish along with the rebuke, as one lays it upon a child, not as one punishing an enemy, for he knows when encouragement has more power than rebuke.
