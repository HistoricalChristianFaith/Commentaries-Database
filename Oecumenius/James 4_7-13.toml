Be subject therefore to God, but resist the Devil, and he will flee from you. Approach God, and he will approach you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners: and purify your hearts, you double minded. Be miserable, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned into mourning: and joy, into sorrow. Be humbled in the sight of our Lord, and he will exalt you. Do not speak ill of one another my brethren. He that speaks ill of his brother, or he that judges his brother, speaks ill of the Law, and judges the Law. But if you judge the Law, you are not a doer of the Law, but a judge. For there is one law-maker, and judge that can destroy and deliver. But you, who are you that judges another?
"purify your hearts, you double minded.” 'Double of mind' refers to those who do not wish to live in a certain way but are driven and carried away by the wickedness of men. For they do not dwell in the house under the Lord in one way. Moreover, that the soul is also called life will be sufficiently taught to us in Job. “Skin for skin, all that a man has will he give as a ransom for his life.” (Job 2:4)
“Do not speak ill of one another.” New pride and arrogance arise from contempt and speaks ill against the meek, which drives those who use it to complete contempt for these things. Therefore, withdrawing them from this, James wishes to make them modest through what is submitted here, saying:
"He speaks ill of the Law and judges the Law.” This is to condemn, to despise. For he who condemns does so out of contempt. But which law? First indeed that which commands: “Do not judge, so that you may not be judged.” (Matt. 7:1) Therefore, what is in the Psalms: "I was secretly pursuing this one who was detracting from his neighbor." (Ps. 101:5) And because this is done out of contempt, he adds: If you judge the law, whether you condemn it, you are not a keeper of the law. For who indeed despises anyone, how will he bear to live from now under his authority? Therefore, he says, do not despise, and have as if a contrary legislator. For it is not permitted to you, since there is only one lawmaker, God, who can save and destroy the transgressors of His law. For it is the role of the law and the lawmaker to make their transgressors subject to punishment; it is not yours, who can do nothing else but joke about these matters. Moreover, you fall upon yourself and are contrary to yourself, bringing a judgment against yourself. For when you do the same things as the one you speak ill of, in the very act of condemning him, you condemn yourself long before.
"Who are you that judges another?" By despising: that is, when you are such, how do you dare to judge or condemn him who is similarly affected?
