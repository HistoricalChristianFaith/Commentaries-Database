“They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green growth or any tree, but only those of humankind who do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads,” since by a transformation the earth had become new. Somewhere it says concerning this, “You will send forth your Spirit, and they will be created, and you will renew the face of the earth.” It was not yet good for anything that adorns the earth to be stricken, neither a tree nor any plant, only those persons who “do not have the seal of God upon their foreheads.” For those persons who were perfectly holy and pure had received that place mentioned above, being always with Christ and gazing upon the throne of God. However, those who have been baptized and bear the sign of Christ upon their foreheads, yet are less holy and have seriously soiled themselves and their baptism by sinful behavior, such persons are, so to speak, halfway between virtue and evil and remain upon the earth, although they experience no further punishment.
