He says, that you may eat the flesh of kings. And he calls the feast over the death of enemies an eating of these and those; for therefore also the Lord names joy when speaking to his disciples and apostles: "I have a food to eat which you do not know," (Jn. 4:32) calling in this way the gladness that is to come upon the believers.
