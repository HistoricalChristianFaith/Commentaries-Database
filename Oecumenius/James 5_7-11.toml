Be patient therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. Behold, the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it until he receives the early and latter rain. Be patient therefore, you also, and establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand. Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged. Behold, the Judge is standing at the door. Take as an example, my brothers, of suffering and patience, the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed who endured. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you have seen the end intended by the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and merciful.
After James has accused the indulgences of the Jewish leaders, and their cruelty and inhumanity towards the poor, he also turns to the faithful and says: "Do not be offended by seeing these things, brothers, nor be disheartened, as if either vengeance is not being taken against them, or if it is indeed being taken, it is too delayed. For there is certain retribution, and it will come immediately.” He speaks of the insult of the Romans and the captivity of the Jews under them, which he even calls the coming of the Lord: just as John, who reclined on the Lord's breast, when he speaks of his own destruction, introduces the Lord himself, saying: “'If I want him to remain until I come.” (Jn. 21:22) Indeed, this time of this life has been extended until the captivity of Jerusalem, and a little beyond that time.
And that the coming of the Lord and the destruction of Jerusalem in this place and in John is evident from the prophet, who says: "Behold, the Lord will come, and who will endure the day of his coming?" (Mal. 3:1) as the coming of the Lord brings judgment against the wicked. But also John Chrysostom1, in a certain commentary of his, explains the same thing, saying: This statement intends to signify the complete destruction of Jerusalem: and he confirms it from the prayer of the three youths, who said: "So let our sacrifice be in your presence today, and may it be perfected after you." (Dan. 3:40 LXX) He says: What does “after you” mean? It means, after your fury has passed. And when did it come? When Nebuchadnezzar destroyed Jerusalem. And indeed, this is about the coming. However, some of the Fathers say that “patience” [µακροθυµία] here refers to long-suffering, which pertains to those who are among us; while “endurance” [ὑπομονή] refers to patience towards strangers. For one bears with those whom he could avenge; but he endures those whom he cannot avenge. Therefore, in God, “endurance” [ὑπομονή] is never said but “patience” [µακροθυµία]; in men, however, it is “endurance” [ὑπομονή].
Until he receives the early and latter rain. The early rain is repentance completed in youth with tears, while the later rain is that which occurs in old age. Indeed, all things depend on God's kindness, therefore it says: Until he receives.
