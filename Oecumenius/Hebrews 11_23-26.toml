Where he had listed righteous men who acted with faith, he also speaks about the parents of Moses, who were of no reputation. encouraging them, and almost saying: They were so obscure yet had faith, but you waver? For what reason did they hide him for three months, and this despite a royal decree that male children should be immediately killed? It is clear that they believed he would be saved. But what was the source of their faith? From the fact that the child was beautiful. For, he says, without divine grace, he would not have been such from the swaddling clothes.
“By faith, Moses, when he had grown up, refused.” For he did this, hoping to receive greater goods than those present. And the phrase “refused” indicates that he was determined to alienate himself."
"to enjoy the momentary pleasures of sin," He called it a sin, not to collaborate or to suffer together with the people of God: not to enjoy the benefits of this sin. Whose? So that he would not be afflicted with the sufferings of the people of God.
"greater riches than the treasures of Egypt." He did not say; he considered the greater wealth of the treasures in Egypt to be the goods laid up in heaven, but rather, showing more of his virtue, he said, "the reproach of Christ," that is, to be reproached as Christ was. "Who made you ruler over us?" (Ex. 2:14) For this is what Christ also heard, "By what authority do you do these things?" (Matt. 21:23) It is the shame of being reproached for the sake of Christ. "The rock was Christ." (1 Cor. 10:4) But he, for that rock and to give water from it (Ex. 27:1), was greatly reviled by the Jews.

"the reproach of Christ." What is the reproach of Christ? That is to say, to be reproached in such a way, showing the reproach that Christ endured. The fact that he endured it for the sake of Christ. The rock was Christ. It is also fitting that he was affected by shame. When he heard: "Do you wish to kill me as you killed the Egyptians yesterday?" (Ex. 2:11-12; Acts 7:28) this is the reproach of Christ, being subjected to evils and injuries until the very end of his spirit: just as he endured and heard insults, "If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." (Matt. 27:40) For both were being reproached by their own kindred, on behalf of those whom they had benefited.
