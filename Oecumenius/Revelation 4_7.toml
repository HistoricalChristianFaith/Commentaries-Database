quote='''
Each of the animals is associated with one of these elements:

the lion with fire, due to the animal's warmth and spirited nature;

the calf with the earth, because the calf's work is connected to the soil;

the man with the air, as humans are celestial and transcendent beings due to the artfulness [λεπτότητα] of the mind;

and the eagle with water, since birds originate from water.

Around the throne of God are seen those deemed worthy of care and providence, signified through living beings, that is, those on earth.
