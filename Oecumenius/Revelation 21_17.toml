And he measured, it says, its wall at a hundred and forty-four cubits by the measure of a man, which is that of an angel. In many places, according to the customary usage of the divine Scripture, men are called angels. And this is clear from those passages in which Gabriel the Archangel is interpreted as a man of God (see Dan. 9:21). And the prophet said, "You will save men and beasts, O Lord" (Ps. 36:6): men indeed are called angels, beasts the men; for despite the mind of the angels we men happen to be irrational and brute. For he did not say "men and beasts" so that one might be proud, meaning true men and real beasts; for it was said to the apostle about the beasts, "Is God concerned with oxen?" (1 Cor. 9:9) Therefore the things called beasts by the prophet must be understood as men, and those called men as angels.

But the Lord also, according to Luke, called men angels, saying, "Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and you likewise are like men awaiting their Lord, when he will be released from the wedding." (Luke 12:35-36) Since therefore in many respects men are called angels from above; and they have eyes toward God. For this reason he says here a measure of man which is an angel. The saying hints that the divine is altogether incomprehensible, for we have conceived Christ as a wall of the city in the things before, and still more by contemplation of the majesty of God men become angels.

Therefore the wall of the city was measured by an angelic rod and not by a human one. And the secret who is to have the number of the rods is by the wisdom of the angels, who also measured it knowingly.
