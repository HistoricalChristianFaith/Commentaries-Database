It is often the habit of holy Scripture to use the word men when speaking of angels. This is clear from those passages in which the archangel Gabriel is interpreted as “man of God.” Moreover, the prophet said, “You will preserve men and beasts, O Lord,” by “men” referring to angels and by “beasts” referring to men. For compared with the thoughts of the angels, men are irrational and like animals.… In addition, according to Luke, the Lord also called angels “men” when he said, “Let your loins be girded and your lamps burning, and be like men who are waiting for their master to come home from the marriage feast.” Therefore, since angels are often called “men,” as we have said above, their gaze is directed toward God. For this reason it says here “by a man’s measure, that is, an angel’s.” By this language is signified that what is divine is wholly incomprehensible—above we have interpreted the wall of the city to be Christ—but rather by the contemplation of the greatness of God men become angels. And so, the wall of the city is measured by an angelic cubit, not a human one. That the wall measures 144 cubits indicates a certain mystical number determined by the wisdom and the discerning measurement of the angels.
