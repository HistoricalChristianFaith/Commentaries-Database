These things says the Amen. This is equivalent to what the True one says (Rev. 3:7), as explained above.

For Amen means Yes. Yes, for in Him there is neither no nor anything contrary concerning what is spoken about Him (2 Cor 1:19). And the faithful witness has been mentioned above (Rev. 2:13). Therefore, it is unnecessary to speak twice about the same things.

He says He is the beginning of the creation of God. Perhaps the group of the Christ-fighting Arians would interpret this passage as referring to the Son as a creation written through these things. But let us not pay attention to their impious words. It must be examined whether something similar is found in another place in Scripture, so that one may regulate similar things from similar terms. The wise apostle says concerning the Son, writing to the Colossians, "who is the first fruits" (1 Cor. 15:23) ... "the firstborn of all creation," (Col. 1:15) but not the first created.

And the prophet says: "From the womb before the morning star I have begotten you," (Ps. 109:3) not "created you." But also Solomon: "Before all the mountains I was born of him." (Prov. 8:25) For "the Lord created me as the beginning of His ways," (Prov. 8:22) over the spiritually ensouled body of the Lord, which Gregory took up among the saints in his discourse "On the Son". And He begets, in accordance with His divinity. Therefore, concerning the generation and not the creation of all things, as those who teach about the only-begotten Word and Son have dogmatized, what does it mean in the present context to say the beginning of the creation of God? Nothing other than the ruler of God's creation, and He who holds the principle over all things. Since the Father has made all things through the Son, it is fitting that the Creator of all and Maker, who brought all things into being from non-being, should rule over those born of Him.
