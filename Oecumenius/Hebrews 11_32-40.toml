When he had finished speaking about the harlot and had urged them based on the quality of the person, for the sake of conciseness he does not enumerate all the names: yet he does not cease the discourse.

"of Gideon." What kind Gideon was.
"of David." As for what David was, in that he was established on his throne, according to the literal sense indeed Solomon, but according to the spiritual understanding, Solomon, the spiritual Lord Jesus.
"through faith." All these did what they did by faith: Abraham, Moses, Joshua.
"they conquered." They defeated, they destroyed whom? Abraham defeated the kings who had taken his nephew Lot captive, and the king of Gerar. Moses defeated the king of Egypt, and many others. Joshua, most of all. (Gen. 14:20; 15; Num. 25)
"enforced justice. " Abraham, Phinehas.

In this place, I believe he speaks of David. And he called kindness righteousness.

"obtained promises," of the Patriarchs, namely, Elijah, David, Joshua, Caleb, and many others.
"closed the mouths of lions." Daniel, Samson.
"quenched the power of fire." The three boys, Ananias, Azarias, and Misael.
"escaped the edge of the sword," For example, Elijah, from Jezebel, and David himself, from Saul.
"were made strong out of weakness." And he speaks of those who returned from Babylonian captivity, and of Hezekiah.
"became mighty in war." Abraham, Moses, Joshua, Samson, and David. Or that they not only returned from captivity through faith but also defeated neighboring nations.
"Women received back their dead." The Shunammite through Elisha, and before that the woman of Zarephath through Elijah.
"Some were tortured." They were cut off, like James and John, and those who were beheaded. Or they died by clubs. Others say that being tortured means being flayed. It is also said about the Maccabees, "refusing to accept release." (2 Macc. 7:1) As if they did not accept to be released from the punishment that was brought upon them. Although it was possible for them, he says, to live, they did not wish to. And this was also a matter of faith, therefore he says: "so that they might rise again to a better life;" or the other people. For the resurrection is common to all, but these will rise, he says, to eternal life, and those to eternal punishment.
"Others suffered mocking," such as Elisha (2 Kings 2), those around Peter later and John.
"and even chains and imprisonment." Jeremiah and Micah. (Jer. 32:38; 1 Kings 22)
"they were stoned." He speaks about Stephen and Naboth. (Acts 7; 1 Kings 21)
"they were sawn in two." It is said about Isaiah, whom they also sawed with a wooden saw, so that the punishment would last a long time.
"they were tempted." Like Abraham (Gen. 22:1-2), Jacob, Moses, and Job. (Job 1:2)
"they were killed with the sword." Micah, John, James, and Zechariah.
"they went about in skins of sheep." Like Elijah, Elisha. This they suffered from poverty. (2 Kings 4)
"destitute." As the prophets whom Obadiah nourished. (1 King 18)
“afflicted.” Effected by evil.
"of whom the world was not worthy." This also encourages them. For if this world was not worthy of those who suffer badly for the sake of God, that is, all people and this creation itself, why do you, he says, wish to receive the rewards here for the sufferings endured for Christ? For being better than the world, do not seek anything in this world.
"wandering about in deserts." But Elijah, and the prophets whom Obadiah fed. (1 Kings 23:19) Note, however, that it does not say, "They found rest in the occupied desert," but rather that they also wandered there in fear of their persecutors.
"And all these." What, he says, do you mourn and become indignant, you who are still in the struggle, if you do not receive the rewards? Yet all those previously mentioned saints, having earned a testimony by faith that pleased God, have not yet obtained the good things promised to the righteous.
"since God had provided something better for us." How is it better? Indeed, so that they would not have anything more than we do in that they were crowned before us, He defined one time, so that we may also be crowned with them. This, however, is for us: for they sit in honor, awaiting our completion.
"that apart from us they should not be made perfect." He did not say, "They would be crowned," but rather, with greater emphasis, "they should not be made perfect," or "They would be perfected," that is, they would receive the end of goods, for which all effort and toil of one who is endowed with virtue strives.
