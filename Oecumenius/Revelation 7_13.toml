One of the elders asked the Evangelist who those were who were from the nations and were clothed in white robes. He asked this not because he himself did not know but rather to urge the Evangelist to make them known more fully. And so he says, “These are they who have come out of the great tribulation.” For the righteous endured not a small struggle, but indeed an exceedingly great struggle during the rule of the antichrist.
