I encourage the elders who are among you, I who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and a partaker of the glory that will be revealed: feed the flock of Christ that is among you, exercising oversight not under coercion, but willingly; not for shameful gain, but eagerly; nor exercising dominion against the clergy, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory. Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God.
Since Peter proposes to discuss the modesty of the spirit, which he even touches upon while speaking about “doing good”, (1 Peter 4:19) and now calling himself a co-elder, that is, both an elder together with them. Through this, Peter designates either his own age or the honor of bishops. For it is known that bishops are also called elders, as the book of Acts indicates. (Acts 20:17;28) Then, wishing to demonstrate his own eminence, and that he calls himself a co-elder for the sake of modesty, he adds his dignity:
"witness of the sufferings of Christ:" wanting to signify through this: If I, who am an interpreter of such visions to you, do not contempt to call myself a co-elder, neither should you, who are righteous, be exalted against those who are inferior to you. Therefore, Christ, teaching this precept of modesty, thus pronounces: "If therefore I, your Lord and Master, have washed your feet." (Jn. 13:14)
Furthermore, "a partaker of the glory that will be revealed," to demonstrate the excellence of a modest spirit: just as Paul says, "When Christ is revealed, then we will also be revealed." (Col. 3:1)
Moreover, he does not feed the flock coercively, who, by presenting himself as an example of good conduct to his subordinates, has disciples who mutually encourage each other to imitate their teacher: Nor does he seek for shameful gain, who walks not arrogantly nor raises himself against those under him, but converses humbly, maintaining a constant frugality that requires no expense for costly garments or a lavish table, which receives pride with applause and seeks expense from shameful gain.
Peter calls the clergy a sacred assembly, just as we do even now. Furthermore, by adding,
"but being examples to the flock," Peter instructs that they should not feed the flock as if coercively.
Furthermore, when it is said, "And when the chief Shepherd appears," it is a conjunction. And it is informally placed for "So that": that is, "So that when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory." Just as in Psalm 89, when it is said, "And look upon your servants and upon your works." For there "And" is placed in the place of "Because of which." "Εγκομδώσασθε" indeed means, "surround yourselves, embrace."
