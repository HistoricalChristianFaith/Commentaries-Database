And we declare to you eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us. What we have seen and heard, we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ: And we write this to you, so that your joy may be complete.
"And we declare to you the life." Therefore, what we have seen, we also declare to you, John says. What is that? That he who is eternal life has been revealed to us, and we have become witnesses of him both before his crucifixion and after his resurrection. For he was indeed nailed to the cross in the flesh, and in that same flesh he rose again. And what profit do we bring you from this announcement? Namely, that just as we have taken you as partners [κοινωνοὺς] through the words of what we have seen and heard, so you may also be partners of the Father and of his Son Jesus Christ.
However, having seized this, let us be complete with joy as if united with God. Or because while you are participants with us, we have our joy to the fullest; which the joyful sower will establish for the reapers, rejoicing in what they may enjoy from their labors.
