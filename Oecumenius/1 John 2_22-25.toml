Who is the liar, except for the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the Antichrist who denies the Father and the Son. Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father either. Therefore, let what you heard from the beginning remain in you. If what you heard from the beginning remains in you, then you will remain in the Son and in the Father. And this is the promise that he himself made to us, eternal life.
Here too, we must hear the conjunction καὶ, that is, "and", for the sake of clearer understanding, so that the sense is this: And who is the liar, except for the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ? But the wicked Simon was raving, claiming that there was one Jesus and another Christ: the Jesus who was born of the holy Mary; but the Christ who descended from heaven into the Jordan. Therefore, he who applauds this lie, John says, is the Antichrist. This, however: This is the Antichrist, must be understood in two ways, both regarding the one who denies that Jesus is the Christ, and regarding the one who denies the Father and the Son. For he, John says, who denies the Father and the Son, is also a liar and an antichrist.
For some heretics, from whom the impure Valentinus arose, claimed that there is another unnamed Father besides him who is called the Father of Christ. They also deny the Son, because they say he is merely a unveiled man and not God by nature, as if he were from God. "Whoever denies the Son does not have the Father," just as the Jews, while denying the Son, pretend to know the Father and claim this for themselves. But let them know that they have not known the Father either; for if they had known, they would have known that He is also the Father of the Only Begotten Son. The same nonsense was also uttered by those who followed Simon. Therefore, John says this: but you, let what you have heard from the beginning, namely the divine teaching about Christ, remain in you. The name means, "Let it remain in you."
"For if what you heard from the beginning remains in you, you will also remain in the Son and in the Father." This is, you will be his partners.
"And this is the promise." For the conjunction και, that is, "and", must be taken causally for "indeed". But what is the promise? It is that which the Lord says to the Father: "That as I am in you and you are in me, so they may be one in us." (Jn. 17:21) And again: "That they may have eternal life. And this is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you have sent." (Jn. 17:3)
