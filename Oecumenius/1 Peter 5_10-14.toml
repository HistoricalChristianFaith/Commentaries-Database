But the God of all grace, who has called us to His eternal glory by Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself restore, establish, strengthen, and settle you. To Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. By Silvanus, a faithful brother to you, as I consider, I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying that this is the true grace of God in which you stand. The Church that is in Babylon, elected together with you, greets you, and Mark my son. Greet one another with a kiss of love. Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus. Amen.
And beginning the letter, Peter said that the Father, for the sake of the Son, have mercy on us, and now concluding, he teaches to call the same Father through the Son: for this is their aim to preach the mystery, although they do this with exhortation.
"By Silvanus." This Silvanus was very faithful and eagerly motivated around the preaching. Indeed, Paul also mentions him and takes him as a helper along with Timothy in his letters, saying: "Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy." (1-2 Thess. 1:1)
Peter calls Rome Babylon, because it was so remarkable and distinguished, as it had been for a long time in Babylon.
Peter calls his son Mark according to the spirit, and not according to the flesh. To him, he entrusted the task of writing the Gospel. However, some have dared to assert that Mark was the son of the divine Peter according to the flesh, using as an argument what was said by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles. (Acts 12:1) For he says that Peter was miraculously brought out of prison by the angel of God, in which Herod had kept him, and after being released from the angelic conversation, Peter came to the house of the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark, as if he had come to his own house and to his lawful wife. However, when Paul writes that they should greet each other with a holy kiss (2 Cor. 14:12), Peter says here,
"With a kiss of love," saying the same as that. For Paul (1 Cor. 13:1-19) knows the love which is according to Christ and is greater than all virtues, even than martyrdom itself suffered for Christ. Therefore, he calls the holy kiss separate and defined in God, while he similarly refers to the kiss of love which is true love, which Paul has praised. Therefore, he also adds:
"Peace to you all who are in Christ Jesus:" not speaking of the common peace which is among men, which is dear to men because of the affection for vain glory and the enjoyment of pleasures, to which those who are free from war surrender themselves; but Peter prays that they may attain the peace which Christ himself agreed to grant them as he proceeded to passion, saying: "My peace I leave with you;" and adding a distinction: "Not as the world gives." (Jn. 14:27) For peace is not to be sought because of affection, but that we may be united in love, in order to receive in this way the blows of adversaries. Moreover, the disciples of the Lord, adding as it were a seal, bring a prayer at the end, as a genuine sign of their holiness. (It was written from the city of Rome.)
Again, Peter writes to those already believing. This letter, however, is a reminder of the former one. For when he knew that the ending of his body would soon come, he was eager to admonish everyone concerning the teaching by which they had been instructed. And first epistle indeed he explains faith, showing that it was announced by the prophets and that the prophecies which speak of the Savior are not human, but have been proclaimed by God. Then he warns them not to pay attention to deceivers, saying that their destruction will be forthcoming, just as it happened to the transgressing angels. He also foretells in the letter that there will be days when mockers will come, wanting to seduce some, saying that the coming of the Lord is to be regarded as a vain thing, since it is always said and it has not yet come. Therefore, he especially commands to be separated from these, teaching that times should not be neglected: since all time is nothing before God, because one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day. He confirms and shows that the day of the Lord will be forthcoming, and he commands that all of them to be prepared for it through good works, and to embrace what has been written by the apostle Paul, and not to pay attention to those who slander it, since all also slander the divine Scriptures. Therefore, having suggested and taught all to foresee in matters, he urges them not to fall away from the purpose of faith, and so concludes the letter.
