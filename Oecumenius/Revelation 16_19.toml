And he says the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. Concerning Jerusalem he says the great city, and it is clear from what he contrasts with it the cities of the nations; for in the divine Scripture, it is customary to call Israel, apart from the other peoples, a nation. And he calls it great, as infamous.

And all the cities fell; for when the land was being transformed and made new, how could the cities standing in it remain untouched, defiled by the dwelling of sinners?

And Babylon, he says, the Great, was remembered before God to be given the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath. In what it said previously, And another angel followed, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen;" (Rev. 14:8) but in the present passage he wants us to understand that he does not mean that Babylon, but signifies another. And I think he means Rome and those who will then occupy it, as the discourse to follow will teach.

Therefore he says that great Babylon was remembered before God. That is, the memory of her former sins, when they persecuted and killed the saints, came before God; and the cup of the wine of the wrath of God is already interpreted; therefore there is no need to speak at length.
