By the words “the great city” he speaks of Jerusalem, and it is clear that in this way he distinguishes it from the cities of the nations. For it is customary in the holy Scriptures to call the rest of humankind apart from Israel by the term nations. And he speaks of it as “great,” as though it were famous. But all the cities fell. For when the earth is being transformed and is becoming new, how could it be that the cities in it would stand, having been defiled by the habitation of sinners? “And God remembered great Babylon, to give to it the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.” In a foregoing passage it says, “And a second angel followed, saying, ‘Fallen, fallen, is Babylon the great.’ ” But in this present passage, he intends for us to think of another Babylon, not that one, and he assigns to it another sense. I think that he is speaking of Rome and of those who will capture it at that time, as the narrative will teach further on. And, therefore, he says, “God remembered great Babylon,” that is, God remembered its former sins, when they persecuted and killed the saints.
