"For the bodies of those animals, whose blood is brought into." Then Paul shows the solemn things among the Jews, being types of our own, and he says that those sacrifices were nothing, of which the people were prevented from partaking; but neither do the high priests of our law partake of our sacrifice; for those were the ones that they typified. Just as in the sacrifices offered for sin, the blood was brought into the holy place by the high priest; the bodies were burned outside the camp; so also Christ, suffering for the sins of the world, brought his own blood into the holy place to the Father as high priest; but his body was crucified outside the city of Jerusalem, because the bodies of the sacrifices for sin were burned outside the camp. Therefore, this blood is brought in by our high priest to our altar. Thus, it is not permitted for the Jewish high priests to eat from that altar.
