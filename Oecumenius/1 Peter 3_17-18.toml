For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil: for Christ also died once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death indeed in the flesh but made alive in the spirit.
This is the explanation of the cause not relating to what has been said immediately, but to what was mentioned a little earlier, for example: “if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed” (1 Peter 3:14); [now Peter says] for it is better to suffer for doing good than for doing evil. Or if someone wants to refer to the immediately preceding explanation of the cause: what is said about doing good should not be understood as pertaining to someone else doing good, but absolutely, that is, as doing good works. Similarly, it applies to those doing evil.
Peter also adds: "if that should be God's will," indicating that nothing happens to us without God's will, but either for the easing of sins, or for our praise and glory, or even for the salvation of others. This happens in two ways. Either a righteous person is afflicted for the correction of others' sins, as it has been said: If the righteous is scarcely saved, where will the ungodly appear? (1 Peter 4:18; See Proverbs 11:31 LXX) And this also presents twofold usefulness: for the just one who is afflicted, an increase in righteousness due to patience; for the sinner who observes, conversion, as we have said.
Therefore, the just man suffers for these reasons: either for the salvation of others, as Christ did. And for this reason, Peter now adds the example of Christ: for Christ died not for His own sins, but for ours.
Therefore, Peter also adds: righteous for the unrighteous. For He, as previously shown through the prophet, had not committed sin. However, showing the effectiveness and power of Him who suffered, he adds: once. So great, he says, was the strength of Him who suffered for men, that although He offended many of their sins, the single passion of the Lord was sufficient to overcome all the power of our sins. Therefore, since Christ suffered to bring us to God and His Father, it is shown that not all who suffer do so because of sins. And because Christ is considered in a twofold manner, namely God and man, He also bestowed upon us a double grace. For He died as a man, freeing us from death and corruption, renewing for us the resurrection, and giving by His example, that those dying from this time should not face death without the hope of resurrection.
But made alive, that is, rising from the dead by the power of divinity (for He rose from the dead not as a man, but as God), He simultaneously restored to life all who were in Hades, raising them up together with Himself. Indeed, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, according to the holy evangelist, and were seen by many. (Matt. 27:52) But when Peter has proceeded thus far in his discourse and has shown these things, he then proposes how the dead benefited those who had previously slept. At the same time, with much questioning, if the incarnation of the Lord occurred for the salvation of all men, what kind of salvation did those who had died before receive? He resolves both in one way and says that the death of the Lord accomplished both, namely the hope of action through the fact that he himself has risen, and again the salvation of those who had previously slept. For those who had adorned their lives with good works during the time they lived, just as if Christ had come at that time they would not have been deprived of the preaching that gives life to them, so also at that time through the Lord's descent to Hades they obtained salvation, as it also seems to the divine Gregory4. For he himself says: “Does Christ who appeared, namely in Hades, save all simply? Or does he also save those who believed there? For by saying: Those who believed, he signifies that they had prepared themselves in such a way that if he had come even then, they would have believed.” Nor do I think this should be rejected. Salvation is not held by inheritance, since although it comes to all the living, it does not save all, but only those who believe. Indeed, it was also the work of the free will of individuals, that since they were rational, they would not behave insensibly towards the magnificence of him who had granted such a gift, but would present themselves as worthy of the goodness of the giver. However, he stated, They had been disobedient, thereby resolving a certain objection. For it was likely that someone would say: And what else before Christ was preached, afterwards were they judged or deemed worthy of condemnation who preceded Christ? And since he could demonstrate this, just as Paul did, from the rational powers dispersed among us, which, when given to them, allowed them to discern between good and evil, and yet they did not act according to good afterwards, such were worthy of death; this does not, however, make it so, for that is of a higher consideration and a deeper philosophy than the mind of the Jews could bear: but it confirms disobedience from Scripture; nor is this from the times of the prophets, but almost from the very beginning of the world: from which he demonstrates that salvation was preached to men from the beginning, but was despised due to their inclination towards vain and sensual pleasures.
For even in their time, although there were countless wicked men, only eight, who believed what was proclaimed through the preparation of the ark, were saved (1 Peter 3:20). And because salvation was through water, he immediately applies this to the sacred baptism, and says that that water prefigured our baptism, since it also drowns and submerges unbelieving demons and saves the faithful who come to the ark of the Church. At the same time, he says: Just as water washes away filth, so does baptism. But it does not effect the removal of bodily dirt, rather, through a symbol, it demonstrates the washing away of the stains of the soul. It is, moreover, as it were, a pledge and guarantee of a good conscience toward God. For those who are well aware of themselves, that is, who embrace a blameless life and earnestly seek and, as it were, inquire after it (for those who seek something are accustomed to inquire), these also hasten to the sacred baptism. And who, he says, provides that divine baptism should be sought and requested? The resurrection of Christ. For before His resurrection and passion it is shown: “Unless one is born of water and the Spirit;” (Jn. 3:5) but after the resurrection: “Baptizing all nations who come, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.” (Matt. 28:19-20) After he concluded the discourse on the dispensation, I speak now of the descent of the Lord into Hades, and for what reason he also went there—namely, that it was for the salvation of those who were in Hades as well. He again takes another occasion from the death of the Lord to exhort to virtue, and says:
If Christ died in the flesh for us (for he could not die in his immortal and divine nature), then surely you also, repaying him in turn, by dying to sin for his sake, will no longer be captivated by human desires, but will live for the rest of your time in the flesh only for the will of God.
“put to death indeed in the flesh” —that is, by the nature of the flesh, that is, the human nature, but rising by the power of divinity. For God is spirit (Jn. 4:24), just as He Himself, the source and wisdom of theology, has taught us.
