I therefore seriously charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing and his kingdom.

The continuous exhortation and command produces three effects: it makes the command more formidable and undeniable, and it presents what is useful in speech. For if it were not such, it would not be necessary for it to be preached with such great determination. Moreover, what belongs to him who urgently announces it is done, no longer subject, as is likely, to the negligence that usually occurs in preaching.

who is to judge the living and the dead, at his appearing. Paul speaks of the sinners and the righteous, or those who have passed away, and those still living, or that many will be left alive then. Paul also says elsewhere, "Indeed, we shall not all sleep." (1 Cor. 15:51)

at his appearing. When is the future to be judged? At the Lord's arrival, which will be after the kingdom and glory have come. For he will not come in the same way as he came before.
