For the bishop must be blameless as God's steward, not stubborn, not quick-tempered, not drunken, not violent, not greedy for gain; but hospitable, loving what is good, self-controlled, righteous, holy, disciplined, holding firmly to the trustworthy message as it has been taught, so that he may be able both to encourage with sound doctrine and to refute those who contradict it.

To be accused is a general concept. For to be accused encompasses all things that are to be named: that is, one against whom no crime can be charged.

as God's steward. Since, Paul says, the office is great, it also requires great watchfulness.

not quick-tempered. For he who cannot master himself, how will he be able to beneficially lead others?

not drunken. Drunkard, overbearing.

not violent. Not one who harms the consciences of brothers.

not greedy for gain. As one who is poor is usually like: as if any profit, even if it seems just, is disgraceful for a bishop.

holy. Pure from passions.

disciplined. Not only regarding food alone, but also all passions.

holding firmly to the trustworthy message.  Or of the true, or of that which is granted through faith, and not from reasoning.

Therefore Paul said, as it has been taught, meaning that one can teach even without external wisdom. For, he says, there is no need for natural or philosophical evidence, but rather for doctrine and usefulness.

be able both to encourage with sound doctrine. This will be from both understanding and knowledge of the Scriptures. Teaching that is healthy is that which teaches true doctrines and a righteous life.

and to refute those who contradict it. For the one who does not know how to fight against enemies, and to capture every thought into the obedience of Christ, will do none of the necessary things.

Against those who advocate for bodily purifications, and in favor of spiritual virtue.
