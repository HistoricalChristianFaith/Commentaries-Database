But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life. And have mercy on those who doubt; save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh. Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy, to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.
"But you, beloved." Therefore, Jude says, but you building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit, that is, making your own gatherings according to the teaching of the Holy Spirit in your prayers. "keep yourselves in the love of God," that is, safeguard yourselves, waiting for the mercy of our Lord that leads to eternal life. And those, if they separate from you (for this is what "to distinguish" means), rebuke them, that is, make their wickedness evident to all.
If they are aimed at healing, do not reject them, but receive them with your love, snatching them out of the fire that threatens them. But receive them with caution and with fear, considering that the reception of these may become a cause of distress for you if you are careless in your dealings with them, leading to the theft of those already established into the same overflow of their wickedness. For wickedness is very zealous. Therefore, let their reception be, Jude says. But approach them with fear, either with careful consideration, and let the hatred towards their small deeds be accompanied by mercy, hating and detesting them, and the garment stained by their flesh, or their defiled garment, as it touches their flesh and becomes disgusting. Those who receive them with the fear of the coming punishment, Jude says, should see mercy granted to them, preparing for repentance. Having said these things, he seals the letter with a prayer.
