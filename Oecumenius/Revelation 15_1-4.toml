He says, I saw seven angels with seven plagues. By the number seven he means the many plagues prepared against the sinners, by means of which God’s wrath reaches its limit. 

He says, And I saw a sea of glass mingled with fire, and the conquerors of the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass holding harps of God. The very wise Paul in one of his writings says, “If anyone builds on this foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, the quality of each person’s work will be tested by fire, because it will be revealed in fire.” So then when the sinners with their offerings of inflammable loads of sin are put to the test, will the righteous also be tested in fire although they bring along gold and their precious materials? 

He is now speaking of those who have conquered the beast through thick and thin: they are standing beside the sea of glass mingled with fire —glass because of the brightness and purity of the righteous in it, but mixed with fire because of the purging and cleansing of all uncleanness, since even the righteous need to be cleansed. “For we all frequently stumble,” as Scripture says, “and who will be free from uncleanness? no one, not even if their life on earth is but one day.” 

The harps, as has often been said, symbolize the tuneful song of the saints addressed to God. 

He says, And they sing the song of Moses in its entirety. This was the one he sang when Pharaoh and all his army had been drowned, saying, “Let us sing to the Lord, for he has triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider he has thrown into the sea; he has become my help and protector for our deliverance.” The song is a paean of victory for the punishment of the ungodly and the victory over the Devil and his lawless son, the Antichrist. 

He says, And the song of the Lamb, that is, the appropriate song for the Lord and his righteous judgment against the ungodly; that is why they wonder at the truth and righteousness of the Lord. 

He says, The king of the nations: Christ is king of all, but since it is said by Isaiah, “And there will be the root of Jesse and one set up to rule over the nations; on him shall the nations hope,” on account of this the divine oracle says both that he is king of the nations and that all the nations will come and worship him, neatly foretelling the calling of the nations and their faith in the Lord.
