The one who overcomes is said to be clothed with white garments in the coming age. For indeed, he himself promises in the Gospels that the saints will shine like the sun and the moon (Matt. 13:43); but the pure ones are said to be written in the book of life, that blessed and everlasting life. The Lord mentioned this inscription also in the Gospels, saying to His disciples: "Do not rejoice that the demons are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in Heaven." (Luke 10:20)

And he says, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels. He will confess them as faithful servants and as favorable household servants. For it is also said in the Gospels: "Whoever confesses me before men, I will also confess before my Father who is in Heaven." (Matt. 10:32) And to speak concerning the Father and His angels does not exclude that the holy angels are also His; for sometimes they are of the Father, and sometimes of Himself. For it is said in Matthew: "Then the Son of Man will send out his angels with a great trumpet call; and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other." (Matt. 24:31)
