“He who conquers” the passions will wear white robes in the age to come, for he has promised in the Gospels that the saints will shine as the sun and the moon. The pure, he says, will be inscribed in the book of the living, for that blessed and eternal life.

“And I will confess your name before my Father and his angels.” He will confess them as his faithful servants and as house slaves who are well-disposed [toward their master], for indeed also in the Gospels he says that whosoever should confess “me before men, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven.” And that he speaks of the Father and his angels does not suggest that the holy angels are not also his. For at times he speaks of the angels as the Father’s, and at other times he speaks of them as his. For he says in Matthew: “Then the Son of man will send his angels with a loud trumpet sound, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.”
