quote='''
But I have this against you; this is to show that only God is completely blameless.

What do I have against you? That you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, that you do not persecute [διώκεις] her. From Jezebel, who dwelt with Ahab, she who is continually a demonstration of wickedness. She says that she herself is a prophetess; she teaches and leads many astray into fornication and eating food sacrificed to idols.
