By the glory and honor of the nations, which are brought into the holy city, he meant metaphorically those from the nations who had been held in esteem and had accomplished deeds worthy of life; for these will be brought into the heavenly Jerusalem and will share life in it with the saints. 

He says, But nothing common shall enter into it, nor anything which causes abomination, but only those who are written in the book of life: for “what fellowship has light with darkness,” or a sinner with the righteous people of God? They are separated by a great chasm, the Lord told us in the gospels. He says, 

Then he showed me a river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb through the middle of the street of the city. A river of life would be the rich and abundant graces of Christ, which have unceasingly been shed on the saints and are borne along like a river and flowing over them. 

He says, On either side of the river was a fruitful tree of life bearing fruit each month: the Lord is the tree of life according to what the writer of Proverbs says about wisdom; he says, “She is a tree of life to those who lay hold on her,” and wise Paul told us, “Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God.” He means that not only are the saints enriched by Christ’s gracious gifts, but they also have him dwelling in them and with them, which is the crown of highest bliss. Christ, the tree of life, produces for the saints continuous and uninterrupted fruit and gifts, so that honor follows on honor and they are never without the divine flow of gifts. 

He says, And the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations: the leaves of life are those who are dependent on Christ and hold close to him—patriarchs, prophets, apostles, evangelists, martyrs and confessors, those who at the right time perform the priestly service of the gospel, pastors of the church, and every righteous soul; all these have now found healing for their souls, and all good things will be added to the saints. 

He says, There shall be nothing accursed any more: for at present even though the accursed things are very much in flight, nevertheless we are constantly embroiled in them, as thousands of occasions [for sin] arise in us, both knowingly and in ignorance; but then the saints will be pure and free from every defilement of both soul and body. 

He says, And the kingdom of God will be in the city: for this is the throne. 

He says, And the saints shall worship him with a worship that is not burdensome, but a worship of pleasure and spiritual joy. This will result from their beholding his face, 

for, he says, they shall see his face: they shall see him insofar as he is accessible to human nature. 

He says, And his name shall be on their foreheads: the present saying symbolizes God’s unceasing remembrance of them and communion with them. For since God is imposed and inscribed on them, he will always be present with the saints. This is clear, too, from what Paul said, “And we shall always be with the Lord.” 

He says, And there is no more night, as the saints have no need of the light of the sun or of a lamp, when the divine light gives unceasing illumination. 

And they, that is, the saints, shall reign for ever: wisest Daniel bears witness to this, saying, “The saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom and possess it for ever and ever.”
