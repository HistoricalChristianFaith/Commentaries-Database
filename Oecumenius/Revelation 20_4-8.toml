The previous chapter had said that after the vision had once made mention of the Devil, in order to retain some continuity in the account, it went on to describe not only what the Devil will suffer at the end of the present age, but also his spiritual sufferings in the time of the Lord’s incarnation. The vision continues with this theme and describes in greater detail the Lord’s incarnate visit to us; this is now our present concern. 

For he says, Then I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was committed to them: he sees in his vision the holy apostles “seated on twelve thrones” and “judging the twelve tribes of Israel,” according to the promise made to them. Although this will be more fully effected in the age to come, it has already happened in some way in the time of the incarnation. For those who put their trust in the Lord and so received a share in countless benefits condemned those who refused to hasten to the faith and so, though taught by the grace given to the apostles, did not attain the true worship of God, but rather devised a cross and death for him. 

He says, And the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God: the verb I saw in the phrase “those seated upon thrones and judging the rest of mankind” is to be understood here, too. By those who had been beheaded he means those who had been killed with an axe. He is speaking figuratively about those who had put to death their own bodies because of their faith in Christ, and who endured very much because of it. For they expelled them from the synagogues, assaulted them with countless abuses, and plundered their personal possessions, when they put their faith entirely in Christ, as the wise apostle testifies. The Lord also spoke of them, “Blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.” 

If you follow the sequence of the argument and subject every thought in obedience to Holy Scripture, you will understand that those who did not worship the beast and did not receive its mark or its image, are those who did not agree with the rest of the Jews in their plots against the Lord, and who refused to obey the propositions of the abominable and blasphemous Devil. For this is to worship him and his image. For by the word image he means the imprint of [the Devil’s] will in the hearts of the Jews. He also means that this mark includes both control and action. For the head, of which the forehead is a part, stands for control, and the hand stands for action. 

They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years: as was said earlier, he again calls the Lord’s domicile on earth a thousand years, during which they were living their spiritual life, and reigning together with Christ, as they gave orders to demons, cured diseases, and worked countless miracles. For it is not simply by being present with Christ, the king of glory, that a person reigns together with him. So the prophet said of them, “When the Heavenly One gives the orders, kings will be covered with snow in Salmon.” 

The rest of the dead did not come to life, he says, until the thousand years were ended: he calls dead those who have persisted in unbelief, about whom the Lord also said, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead.” So the unbelievers did not come to the spiritual life until the time of the incarnation had ended, which is the thousand years; for they came to life only after this. How? By the coming and presence of the Holy Spirit. For by then most of the Jews had come to faith in Christ, who did not believe in him when he was physically dwelling and moving among them. 

The event was most divinely ordered, beyond the hope of any human mind. For when the Son had been proclaimed and made known in the old covenant as well as by his incarnation and his countless divine signs and miracles, the Holy Spirit had not yet been clearly revealed to human beings. There was only a report about the Spirit in the old covenant, but there was no manifest and perceptible work of the kind which specially leads people to faith, as there was of the Son, even though the Spirit was being made known to those who had attained the depth of vision, because everything which has been done and effected has been accomplished by the Holy Trinity. 

The Lord clearly proves this, saying somewhere, “The Father has told me what I am to say and what I am to speak,” and again, “I can do nothing on my own,” referring the events to the Trinity; and again in John, “The Son of man can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees his Father doing”; and elsewhere he asserts, “If I cast out demons by the Spirit of God.” 

But since, as I have said, there was no perceptible work of the Holy Spirit available to human beings, it was arranged that almost all people should receive faith in Christ by the coming and the power of the Paraclete and of God the Father, in order that it might be clear to everyone that the Spirit was of the same substance as the Father and the Son, and possessed of the same power. 

Of course, in the whole period of the incarnation not more than “a hundred and twenty” are recorded as having been believers. This was the number reckoned by Acts of those assembled in the upper room. Even if the power of the teaching of Christ had reached many others, their faith was maintained by the coming of the Spirit. 

So one might find that, just as when seed has been scattered the rain comes down and the sun shines upon all the seeds that up to this time have been hidden unnoticed in the earth, and then they spring up and become visible, because they were wholly stored up in the earth, so, too, the same thing happens at the coming of the Holy Spirit. All those in whom the teaching of the Lord had been sown sprang up into faith. So the Revelation accurately says that the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years had ended. 

He says, This is the first resurrection, that is to say, which results from faith: the second will be the universal bodily resurrection. Therefore, 

Blessed is the one who has a share in the first resurrection: for we shall all have a share in the second, whether we like it or not. 

But he says that the second death will not have any power over those who share in the first resurrection, that is, the faithful. What sort of death is this? It is that quite clearly which results from sin and is followed by punishment. For just as he has spoken of the first and the second resurrection, so he speaks of the first and second death. The first one is the physical death, which separates the soul and the body, but the second death is the spiritual death, resulting from sin. The Lord said of this, “Do not fear those who kill the body; but rather fear him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.” 

The faithful, he says, shall be priests of God and of Christ: all the faithful were appointed priests of the evangelical word, about whom the prophet, striking the prophetic lyre, said, “You will make them rulers over the whole world.” And they shall reign with him for a thousand years, which are the years of the incarnation, as I have said more than once. 

And when, he says, the thousand years are ended, that is, when the Lord has completed his course in the flesh and has gone back into heaven, the Devil will be set free from his spiritual bonds and will again deceive the nations. For it has already been said that the dwelling of the Lord with human beings nullified the activity of the Devil. But once the Lord has gone up into heaven, both the Devil himself will carry on his own customary activity, and human beings on earth in their usual way will follow their free will. In the face of the Devil’s attempts to deceive everybody, some obey him, while others who refuse to do so struggle against the evil one. 

But perhaps someone will say, “Why in the world was the Devil, whose assault was restrained and held in check by the bodily presence of the Lord, again set free to deceive us upon earth? For would it not have been better for him to have been bound, and for human beings to continue undeceived?” 

To such a one we should reply, “Why do you not rather say, ‘Why did the Devil come into being at all, or when he had been created and then transgressed, why was he not utterly destroyed, to prevent him getting access against human beings?’ And how, my good fellow, would the contestants have been trained without any opponent? And how would the might of athletes have been shown if there were no competitors? 

For slothful human beings, giving way to their desires, go all awry when left to themselves without the presence and provocation of the Devil, whereas the people of God and noble contestants would be unfairly treated if they were not able publicly to display their courage in the face of their sufferings. So it turns out that whereas the slothful would have no benefit if Satan did not exist, the noble would suffer great unfairness. For Satan is a kind of trainer of human beings, providing an opportunity for the contestants to receive a crown of victory. For those who love sin, who in the absence of the Devil use their own laziness as a substitute for the Devil, have not been at all unfairly treated, as I have said. So in spite of himself he does good to some, and does no harm, or very little, to others. 

But on account of you and me, ‘the slaves of sin,’ irresponsible and irresolute, in order that we might suffer little or no further harm from the activity of the Devil, you wanted patriarchs and prophets, apostles and evangelists, those who had persevered in their witness to Christ unto death and had kept loyalty with him, as well as confessors and pastors who had faithfully guided the churches, and the most steadfast ascetics, and every righteous person perfected in the faith of Christ, ‘of whom this world was not worthy’—you wanted them all to be deprived of glory. The noble contenders for virtue alleviate the penalty of those sinners who for quite a short time suffer harm. A single person who acts rightly is more honored by God than countless others who break faith.” 

Both events have been effected in the best and most inspired way—the impious assaults of the Devil were checked during the bodily presence of the Lord, and after the Lord’s ascension into heaven the Devil was freed to test human beings. For if Satan had been allowed to display all his activity when the Lord was dwelling on earth, he would not have permitted people either to hear his divine teachings or to learn who it is who is naturally and truly God, or the nature of the holy worship due to him, or the difference between evil and goodness. He would also have prepared the cross for him before the time, even before he began his teaching. If this had happened, the incarnation of the Lord and such a wonderfully glorious mystery would have been incomplete, or rather useless. 

But after those on earth had been taught these things while the Devil was in bondage, they were then able to use their own free will, and to continue the fight against the adversary on the basis of acknowledged and recognized ways both of evil and of good. For one who knows the good and that which is not so good is entirely free to choose either this or that. But one who does not know what he could do, is like a man wounded in a night battle who does not realize that he has been hit, and therefore does not recognize his own destruction. For the one who knows his adversaries has the opportunity to choose what he wishes, but there is no such opportunity for one who is ignorant. For God created human beings in the beginning with free will and controlled by their own reasoning powers. 

But because they first needed to know good and evil, so that in this way there may be room for free will, see what Moses the divine lawgiver says in Deuteronomy to the disobedient people of the Israelites, “See, I have set before your eyes this day life and death, good and evil,” so that the choice may be freely made between both. Again he says in Exodus, “If you hearken attentively to my voice and do all that I say to you.” And what about Isaiah, who sets forth the same teaching near the beginning of his prophecy, saying in the person of God, “If you are willing and listen to me, you shall eat the good of the land, but if you refuse and do not listen to me, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this”? 

So much then for this. After saying earlier that the Devil will come out to deceive the nations, he now identifies the nations and their leaders. He says, Gog and Magog gather them for war (Rv 20.8); the war is that against the saints. 

For after completing the account of the saving incarnation, he has returned to the place from where he set out to explain those things to us. He started with the Devil and the Antichrist, and the defeat and punishment of the nations which collaborated with them. 

So he is now going to supply what was earlier left unsaid.
