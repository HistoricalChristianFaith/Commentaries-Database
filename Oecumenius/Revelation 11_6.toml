And he says they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they desire. For "the presence" of the Antichrist will be revealed "in the power of Satan through all kinds of signs and false wonders," as Paul writes in his second letter to the Thessalonians (2 Thess. 2:9), and these signs were intended to lead to assent and belief. Therefore, the two prophets who speak about him say that he is a deceiver and a fraud, and that he will use various signs to draw those who hear him into belief.
