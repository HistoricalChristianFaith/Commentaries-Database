Such is [the power] of these very persuasive individuals. For if one of them, Elijah the Tishbite, had such power even before he fulfills the service of Christ, how would he remain unpersuasive as the precursor of Christ? “And they had power,” it says, “over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague as often as they wish.” For since “the coming of the antichrist will be by the activity of Satan with all power and with deceitful signs and wonders,” as Paul says in his second letter to the Thessalonians, these signs will lead to agreement and faith. And for this reason these two prophets who refer to him as a deceiver and a cheat will also make use of various signs, so that they might attract those who hear to faith.
