The third mercy of Christ toward us opened the third seal and restored us, who had been condemned, to God the Father. This is his salvific teaching and the benefits of his miracles, for these contributed to the dissolution of the devil. For, through these we know who is truly God by nature, so that we may “no longer be children, tossed about by every wind of doctrine” nor honor that which our hands have made but that we might exchange the corrupting demons for the glory of God. As yeast draws flour, the divine teaching of the Lord drew to itself those being taught according to the discourses of the Lord and those who were benefiting from the miracles that were healing souls rather than bodies. And when this occurred, a black horse came out, and the rider had a balance in his hand. The black horse is indicative of shame and sorrow, for the destruction of the devil had received increased intensity by the divine teaching, and therefore he laments his dissolution which lasted for such a long time. The balance … is a figure of equality and righteousness, for “he who judges in righteousness sat upon his throne and rebuked the nations of demons, and the impious One who led them was destroyed.” The balance is, therefore, a symbol of the righteous judgment of the Lord on our behalf, so that we may speak boldly to him, “You have executed my right and my cause,” and so that we nations might know that we are men, and that we may not be pulled about like beasts with bit and bridle or allowed to be led astray by destructive tyrants.
