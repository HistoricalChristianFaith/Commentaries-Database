Since I had many things to write to you, I did not want to do so by paper and ink. But I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete. The children of your sister the Elect greet you. Amen.
The reason for the briefness of the letter, both in this and in the following one, is that John hoped to come to them and to add in person and by his presence what was lacking. However, by what he adds, "The children of your sister, the Elect, greet you," some wish to argue that the letter is not addressed to a woman but to the Church; concerning which I have decided not to dispute.
The letter is about hospitality. First of all, it acknowledges Gaius, for whom many bore witness regarding his hospitality, and encourages him to remain committed in that purpose, receiving and welcoming the brothers caringly. Again, it acknowledges his offering as well: and it accuses Diotrephes of not giving anything to the poor and preventing others from doing so, and John says many things against them. However, he says that such people are alien to the truth and do not know God. He acknowledges Demetrius, bearing the best testimony about him.
John also writes a letter, commending certain brothers. He writes to Gaius and gives testimony of the great hospitality he shows, which he praises with many tributes. For John says that the one who does good works is from God. Furthermore, he is stirred even more by the fact that Diotrephes slanders and criticizes him, as he has determined that these things should not happen. He praises Demetrius, who does the same, and exhibits faithful testimony of him. However, this letter is brief, due to the reason mentioned in the preceding letter. (see comment on 2 Jn. 12-13)
