Since I had many things to write to you, I did not want to do so by paper and ink. But I hope to come to you and speak face to face, so that our joy may be complete. The children of your sister the Elect greet you. Amen.
The reason for the briefness of the letter, both in this and in the following one, is that John hoped to come to them and to add in person and by his presence what was lacking. However, by what he adds, "The children of your sister, the Elect, greet you," some wish to argue that the letter is not addressed to a woman but to the Church; concerning which I have decided not to dispute.
