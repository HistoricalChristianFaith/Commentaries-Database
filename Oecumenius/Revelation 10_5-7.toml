This is said in the form of an ellipse; for he means that when the seventh angel is about to sound his trumpet, all the different and varied punishments of the wicked will be completed. But he says that this will not take place now when the trumpet sounds in the vision, since the other events had not yet then occurred, 

but only when the trumpet is sounded at the appropriate time. After this, he says, the secret purpose of God will be fulfilled, as he announced to his servants the prophets (Rv 10.7). For up to the time of the judgment and the rewarding and punishment of the good and the bad, the prophets prophesied, but after this they said no more. Therefore, when in that age the seventh angel sounds his trumpet, all Godâ€™s secret purpose will be fulfilled, together with every prophetic prediction.
