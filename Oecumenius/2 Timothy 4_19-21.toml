Priscilla and Aquila greet you, and the household of Onesiphorus. Erastus stayed in Corinth. I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Make every effort to come before winter. Eubulus and Pudens and Linus greet you, as does Claudia, and all the brothers.

These are the ones whom Paul continually remembers among the tentmakers, from among whom he also stayed with and often mention. But he first remembers the woman, as more trustworthy and earnest. For she also instructed Apollo. He offers a greeting, both comforting at the same time, and also showing honor and love through this, and the greater things, having been filled with much grace, the one being addressed.

and the household of Onesiphorus. For Onesiphorus was in Rome. Therefore, Paul greets those in his house, stirring up zeal similar to that of Onesiphorus.

Erastus stayed in Corinth. Since Paul did not remember these things before, now he remembers, in order to show that he is isolated on all sides and needs Timothy.

I left Trophimus sick in Miletus. Miletus is near Ephesus. Therefore, when he sailed to Judea, Paul left him in Miletus, or after arriving in Rome, again in these parts, we do not have information to say.

sick. Why then did he not heal him, but let him be? Because the saints did not do everything, so that they would not be considered better than human nature.

Make every effort to come before winter. "Until then," Paul says, "while I live, so that you do not see me having been delayed by the winter."

and Linus. They say that this Linus became the second bishop of Rome after Peter.

as does Claudia. Do you see how even women have been fierce and passionate, crucified to the world? Indeed, this kind is in no way inferior to men, provided they desire it.

and all the brothers. Those mentioned by name were more fervent in faith.
