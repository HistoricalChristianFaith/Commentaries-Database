This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end we both labor and suffer criticism, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all, especially of those who believe.

This is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. What kind? The one that gives life both here and there. And see that you yourself are also trustworthy, as if true, and acceptable to all; for in some things you are truly so, but in others doubtful. But because of the courage of the disciple, Paul speaks clearly throughout the entire Epistle.

For to this end we both labor and suffer criticism. For what purpose? "because we trust in the living God." And we too labor readily to be conscious of this, and for this very reason our enemies especially wage war against us.

who is the Savior of all. He is the Savior of all here. But here, not of all, but of those worthy to be saved. And here, He especially cares for the faithful. For even though we are fought against by so many, we are saved. Paul encourages Timothy into dangers for the sake of the faith, having God as Savior.

Concerning his care, and that of the Church.
