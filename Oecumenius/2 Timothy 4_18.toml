And the Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.

and the Lord will rescue me. If He will deliver, how does He say, "I am already being poured out"? But see. Then indeed the Lord delivered Paul from Nero, but now no longer from Nero, (for enough has happened according to the Gospel,) but from every sin, that is, the Lord will not allow one who has been condemned in anything to perish.

will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. Paul says, "He will snatch me from there, and will keep me." For this means, "He will bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom." Therefore, this is the true salvation, when we shine there.

To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen. See the doxology for the Son as well as for the Father elsewhere, and for the Spirit; here indeed is the Lord, namely the Son.
