The Lord is recorded in the Gospels as addressing the lawless among the Jews with the words: "Behold, your house is left to you desolate." (Matt. 23:38) For they were no longer worthy of divine visitation after the madness at the cross. How then does the Lord now appear from the vision standing on Mount Zion, as if from remorse? That the city of theirs and the temple and the whole people were left deserted, the Romans clearly showed, having burned the temple, set the cities on fire, laid waste all their land and sold even their mother-city into slavery. But now to show the Lord as having ascended to Mount Zion is to show the ultimate return of Israel through faith, and that the Lord will dwell among them and receive them. For this is what was proclaimed through Isaiah: "'The Savior will come to Zion, and he will turn ungodliness away from Jacob,' says the Lord." (Isa. 59:20-21) The prophet and the apostle agree with Isaiah; the one sings, "For you shall make them turn their back in your latter end, you will prepare their face," (Ps. 21:12) and the one writes, "when the full number of the Gentiles has come in, then all Israel will be saved." (Rom. 11:25-26)

He says, and with him one hundred and forty-four thousand having the name of his Father written on their foreheads. Previously he called the one hundred and forty-four thousand the twelve thousand believers from each of the twelve tribes of Israel. (see Rev. 7:4-8) Does he then also now speak about these? I do not think so; for neither did he name them with the article [the], for he did not say "the one hundred forty-four thousands," but only "one hundred forty-four thousands"; nor does he testify that they have also kept their virginity. For virginity was not held in special esteem among Israel, as later it was neglected among the Gentiles; so that those here named must be considered as mixed from both Israel and the Gentiles, and in fact mostly from the Gentiles.

But to have the name of the Father and of his Son written indicates that they are endowed with some divine glory.
