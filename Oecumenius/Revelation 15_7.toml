Their girdles are symbolic of the fact that they are effective and well equipped for their task. For concerning them it is said, “Mighty in strength are those who do his word.” These seven angels take from one of the four living creatures, concerning whom we have said much, the wrath of God in seven golden bowls. And aptly did he say “golden,” for the wrath of God is worthy, bearing within itself that which is good and beneficial rather than just, even though those who are tormented might experience distress.
