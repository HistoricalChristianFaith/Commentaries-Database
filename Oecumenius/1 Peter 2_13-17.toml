Therefore, be subject to every human creature for the Lord's sake: whether to the king as the supreme authority, or to governors as those sent by him for the punishment of evildoers and the praise of those who do well. For it is the will of God that by doing good you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people. Live as free people, but do not use your freedom as a cover-up for evil; live as God's servants. Honor everyone, love the brotherhood. Fear God, honor the king.
The human creature is said to be the leaders who have been appointed by kings, or even the kings themselves, because they too have been established and placed by men. For Scripture knows how to call creation a constitution, as when it says: "That he might create two in himself into one new man," (Eph. 2:15) that is, to place or establish. Therefore, it says: "Be subject to human authorities; be subject for the Lord's sake." For the Lord's sake, that is, as the Lord has commanded. But what has the Lord commanded? "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." (Matt. 22:21) Therefore, in what they command outside of God, that is, what is contrary to or beyond God's constitution, they must not be obeyed. This the Lord and his disciple absolutely command, so that the Greeks might not be able to say that Christianity brings about the subversion of life and politics, and is the cause of disorder and confusion. Moreover, for the Lord, also on account of the faithful. For it was likely that some of them would say: Since we are deemed worthy of the kingdom of heaven, add great dignity to us from it, why then do you again cast us down, subjecting us to worldly princes? If anyone should say this, let him know, he says, that this kind of command is not mine, but the Lord's. However, Peter also shows to whom and to what kind of princes it is necessary to be subject, namely to those who uphold what is just. He also adds the reason, because both the will of God and the example of our righteousness is in submission to princes, and what is more, it brings shame upon the unbelievers. For when they speak ill of us as being arrogant and stubborn and disobedient, seeing us humble and obedient in what is necessary, their mouths are more shut and they are put to shame.
"as free people.” The order is this: Be subject as free people, and not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but also as servants of God. Not only honor the princes, but also everyone: indeed, those who love brotherhood, fear God, and honor the king. However, as if they were free, John Chrysostom explained it this way, saying: "Let them not say, 'We are free from the world, we have become citizens of heaven, and you again subject us to princes and command us to obey?” Therefore Peter says: “So obey as if you were free,” that is, as if complying with him who has freed you, and this he has commanded. For you should not have in mind evil, that is, the excuse for disobedience and stubbornness, for the very freedom for which you refuse to obey. However, according to another consideration, something can also be said about this matter. A person is free according to the Lord, who does not obey anything absurd. Therefore, since living in hypocrisy is not free, but that of one who is subject to passions, whether of flattery or any other dishonorable pleasure: for which someone also pretends to be in pretense, lest it appear what he is, and to whom he has endured to serve (this, however, is foreign and alien to the servants of God), he now commands that subjection be shown to princes, with true and not fictitious morals, lest we exhibit a forced subjection towards them as if hostile; and when such evil lies hidden in us, which is certainly sincere and simple, let us make a ploy and veil of manners, exhibiting an apparent subjection, and not one that proceeds from affection.
"Fear God." Consider carefully how the fear of God is said to be distributed, and honor to the king, so that if fear is to be given to God, who can destroy both soul and body (Matt. 10:28), we should by no means obey kings when they urge us to do something absurd. For fear knows how to conquer even the honor that is given to kings; moreover, it will deprive of honor those who are compelled by them to do evil, according to the holy one who said: "The wicked are brought low before him." (Ps. 14:4)
