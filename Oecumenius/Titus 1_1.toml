HYPOTHESIS ON THE EPISTLE TO TITUS

Paul sends this letter from Nicopolis. For he spent the winter there. The purpose of this letter is this: He left Titus in Crete to appoint clergy in the cities. Since many there were attempting to deceive the people under the pretext of the law, Paul, having learned this, writes. And first, giving thanks to God for His reverence, it signifies that the faith in Christ is not new, but has been prepared and promised by God from eternity. Then concerning the state of the clergy, and it teaches how and what kind of minster they ought to be. And he is commanded to rebuke those who contradict the sound doctrine, especially those of the circumcision, knowing that the Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons, and to teach that all food is clean to the clean, and how the older women who owe this duty must train the younger women in self-control. He also exhorts how slaves ought to be subject to their own masters. And finally, having reminded that the grace of the Spirit did not justify us by works, but by His own kindness; and having commanded to avoid legal disputes as shameless, Paul shows that after sending Artemas to Titus, so that he might come to him, he also instructed him to teach and to take the lead in good works among his own, and thus Paul completes the Epistle.

Titus was an excellent disciple of Paul. Indeed, he was appointed by Paul to be the bishop of Crete, which was very large. Moreover, he was authorized and entrusted to ordain bishops in the lower ranks. When Paul wrote these things, he was in freedom: for he nowhere mentions affliction. The letter is also extended to the Jews. However, this letter seems to have been earlier than the letter to Timothy.

Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness.

Paul places no distinction here; elsewhere indeed a servant of Christ, but an apostle of God, now truly in a different manner.

according to the faith. Because of faith, that is, because the chosen vessels of God have entrusted themselves to me, I have been made an apostle to teach them. Or in this way: I am an apostle to bring the elect to faith through me, and to know the truth of godliness, Christ. Or thus: To become an apostle and for the elect to be believed was not simply given to me, but because I came to know the truth of godliness. But what is this truth? Christ. Well then, the truth concerning godliness, just as with any other truth, is not about godliness as if it were a skill to be learned.
