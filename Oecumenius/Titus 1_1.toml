Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness.

Paul places no distinction here; elsewhere indeed a servant of Christ, but an apostle of God, now truly in a different manner.

according to the faith. Because of faith, that is, because the chosen vessels of God have entrusted themselves to me, I have been made an apostle to teach them. Or in this way: I am an apostle to bring the elect to faith through me, and to know the truth of godliness, Christ. Or thus: To become an apostle and for the elect to be believed was not simply given to me, but because I came to know the truth of godliness. But what is this truth? Christ. Well then, the truth concerning godliness, just as with any other truth, is not about godliness as if it were a skill to be learned.
