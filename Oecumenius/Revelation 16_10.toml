And the bowl of the fifth angel was poured out, he says, upon the throne of the beast; and his kingdom became darkened. For it is written concerning the apostle about the Antichrist, "whom the Lord will consume by the breath of His mouth," (2 Thess. 2:8) and concerning Isaiah: "Let the wicked be taken away that he may not see the glory of the Lord," (Isa. 26:10) "the glory" that calls the Lord's glorious presence.

The previous statement that the bowl was poured out upon the throne of the beast indicates that the godlessness of the Antichrist will receive a tyrannical end, his ruin being wretchedly effected, and that darkness will seize all those placed under him with unexpected punishment of the accursed; for they remain in darkness of thoughts, perplexed by what has happened.
