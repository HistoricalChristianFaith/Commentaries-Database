Yet I think it right, as long as I am in this tent, to stir you up by reminding you, knowing that shortly I must put off my tent, just as our Lord Jesus Christ showed me. Moreover, I will be careful to ensure that you always have a reminder of these things after my departure.
What is suggested, for example: "I will be careful to ensure that you always," some understand through a reversal of a word order in this way: I will take care and after my departure, you will always have or continuously the memory of these things: wanting to show from this that even after the death of the saints, they remembered what they accomplished here for the living. Others, however, simply treating that saying, understand it thus: I will take care and you will always have after my departure the last mention of these things: that is, do not be surprised, nor consider it burdensome that there is a constant mention made to you about these matters. For I do not do this condemning your ignorance, but by a continuous teaching about these things, I present to you this support, so that, being strengthened by these, you may also have after my death a living and permanent teaching about these matters.
