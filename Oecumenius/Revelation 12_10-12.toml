Therefore, the holy angels, intimating their own joy which they had at the destruction of Satan, sing a song of victory to God. They said, he says, Now have come salvation and the kingdom, and the power of God has shone out, and the authority of his Christ, showing that it is all-powerful. For by its cooperation, he says, we have conquered the enemy, and the accuser of our brethren, who accuses them day and night before our God, has departed from us. 

What modesty of the holy angels! How they imitate their own master! They call human beings their brothers. And why is this amazing, when our common master did not refuse to call them this when he said, “I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will praise you”? 

But why do they say of Satan, “He went away”? He was deprived of his dignity. There was no longer any room for him to stand before God, and to accuse human beings. 

And he says, they themselves took vengeance on him in equal measure, and they conquered him who seemed to be invincible in venturing even against God. And they conquered by using as support and help the precious blood of Christ and the word of those who bore testimony to him, which they chose before their own lives. 

After this, he says, Rejoice, all you angels of God, now that you have been delivered from the bitter sphere of Satan. 

He says, Woe to the earth and the sea, for the Devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short. And “if he was going to harm the earth and the sea by the descent of Satan,” someone might ask, “Why did he come down?” The answer is that for those who are self-controlled and have their hope in God, not only has it not been for their harm, but in fact for their benefit. He is exercising them like a gymnastic trainer, making them more acceptable by temptations and hardening them like iron. But he does harm the sluggish and fainthearted, who perhaps, even when the tempter was not around, were bad in themselves because they had turned their passions into their nature. 

When they say, Woe to the earth and the sea, they do not mean, “woe to most of those who dwell on the earth and on the sea,” but those who are earth and “ashes,” according to Scripture, those who are earthbound in their mind, as well as the capricious and perplexed and mentally unstable. For it is these that our common enemy attacks and enslaves in their weakness, as they willingly succumb to his tyranny. 

He says, He knows that his time is short: for the time is short, from the fall of the Devil until his judgment and just deserts, when compared to eternity. For the same reason, too, the patriarch Jacob, even though he was a hundred and thirty years old, said when asking something of Pharaoh, “few and evil have been the days of the years of my life.”
