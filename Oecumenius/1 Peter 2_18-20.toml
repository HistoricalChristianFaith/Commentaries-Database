Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unjust. For this is grace, if anyone endures grief for the sake of conscience toward God when suffering unjustly. For what credit is it if, when you are beaten for your sins, you take it patiently? But if, when you do good and suffer for it, you take it patiently, this is praiseworthy before God.
"Servants, be subject." It must be understood that it means, that is, you are, just as when he said, Wives (1 Peter 3:1). "with all fear." Fear is expressed in many ways: it is called fear and also that which is with knowledge, which is now understood through Conscience, which is also called reverence with fear; it is also called painful fear, which is experienced by some through the punishment, which even wild animals fear; it is again called initial fear which follows those approaching the Lord, because they are aware of many things that provoke punishment: therefore the harlot mentioned in the Gospel, fearing, approached Christ (Luke 7:37); but perfect fear is again said to be that which is always present with all the saints, fearing lest anything be lacking in them for what is fitting for those who have been taken up to perfect love: therefore, since fear is expressed in many ways, whether it is just for servants to be presented to their masters through all these means, he who now encourages servants to be subject to their masters with all fear would not deny: since both initial and perfect fear would be present, it would rightly affect them: there, indeed, that they might fear, lest anything happen to them because of their offenses for which there would be no remedy; here, however, that they might not even think of anything, which, if accomplished, would be ungrateful to their master. Now, therefore, he speaks of fear that is due to conscience, that is, which occurs with a right conscience of reason: when, indeed, evil masters afflict their servants who have committed nothing. Therefore, judging this fear as worthy of praise, he commands that it be received with patience. Since those who have fear because of sins, whether those they have committed or even those they have not observed to do, are indeed good servants if they endure anything because of that, and are inclined towards correction: but they are not yet endowed with such great wisdom of mind as they would be if they endured affliction with a grateful heart, even when they were not conscious of any evil. This is great, this is also fulfilled by few; it is commended before God, as responding to the afflictions of Christ; since he himself, he says, did not suffer for his own sins: for he committed no sin, but suffered for us and for our transgressions. (Is. 53:8)
From the iniquities of my people, or because of the iniquities of the people, he was led to death, the prophet says (Is. 53:5), he places fear to be praised. However, he also wishes to retain servants with other fears: which is evident from what he says: with all fear. Moreover, he rightly and skillfully placed above other fears the fear that is due to conscience towards God, and demonstrated with the truest discourse that this alone is worthy of praise, for indeed they have a cause for the wrath of their masters against them, but here there is never anything of the sort.
