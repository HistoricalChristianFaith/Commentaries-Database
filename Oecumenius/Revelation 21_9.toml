And one of the seven angels came and said to me, who were these seven about which much was spoken in the earlier ones (Rev. 15-17):

Come, he says, I will show you the bride of the Lamb. He wishes to show "the church of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven," (Heb. 12:23) which Jerusalem he also calls the heavenly; concerning which Paul spoke to the Hebrews, saying, "For you have not come to a mountain that can be touched and that is burning with fire, and to darkness and gloom and a storm, and the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which those who heard it begged that no further word be spoken to them. For they could not bear what was commanded. Even if a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned, or shot through with an arrow. And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, "I am exceedingly afraid and trembling." But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to multitudes of angels, to the festive gathering and assembly of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, and to God the judge of all." (Heb. 12:18-23) Through the assembly or church of all the saints and through the heavenly Jerusalem the word depicts the blessedness of the saints, and the life they shall have in God and with God, as it has been said, adorning it bodily and gloriously, and leading our mind into a spiritual glory and brightness.
