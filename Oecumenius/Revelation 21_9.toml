The angel intends to show the church of the “firstborn who are enrolled in heaven,” which he also calls the “heavenly Jerusalem.” Paul spoke to the Hebrews of this church, writing, “For you have not come to a mountain that may be touched, to a blazing fire, darkness and gloom, and a tempest and the sound of a trumpet, and a voice whose words made the hearers entreat that no further message be spoken to them. For they could not endure the order that was given, ‘If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned.’ Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that he said, ‘I tremble with fear.’ But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering, and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven and to a judge who is God of all.” In the gathering or the assembly of all the saints into one, that is, by the image of the heavenly Jerusalem, the passage depicts the blessedness of the saints and the life that they will have in God and with God. As we indicated, he adorns it with physical and magnificent imagery in order to guide our mind to some extent from its depiction to its spiritual glory and splendor.
