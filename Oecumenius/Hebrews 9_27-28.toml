Because he was man along with his being God, he also endured the things common to humankind. For just as people “die one time only, so also Christ died once.”

He says that “he bore the sins of many” on the cross, in order that he might quell them, paying the penalty that they deserved.Now the Father sent him, “having made him sin.” For also Christ became as if a sinner, inasmuch as he took on the sins of the whole world and claimed them as his own. But then he paid the penalty that was owed, the punishment belonging to sinners. At last he will come with his Father’s glory, no longer as a sinner, no longer “reckoned among the lawless.”
