That the scroll was shut and sealed indicates that the people who were written in it were unable to speak, and that their mouths were stopped from all pleading in their defense before God, according to what was said earlier. The successive removal of the seals, then, symbolizes the resumption little by little of the openness and intimacy towards God that the Only-begotten by his incarnation made possible for us, making amends for our faults by his own acts of reparation. We must understand that the undoing of each seal denotes one of the works of the Lord effected for our salvation, and of his acts against our spiritual enemies. For the Lord’s providence for us entails the destruction of their sovereignty. 

No one should be surprised that before the Only-begotten became incarnate—for his works and deeds before his visit to us are shown in the vision to the blessed evangelist—yet the lamb is seen in the Revelation as slain. For the visions of the prophets were regularly a prediction of what was to take place in future. Thus a man was wrestling with Jacob, who was the type of Christ. Thus Isaiah saw the prophetess who conceived and bore a son, whose name, too, was called “plunder quickly, despoil sharply.” Thus Daniel saw as “a son of man” the pre-incarnate God, the Word, coming to the “Ancient of days.” 

Therefore, the first benefit of our savior Christ to our race, which loosed the first seal of the scroll and has begun our restoration to the place from which we were banished as a result of Adam’s transgression, and the recovery of the intimacy with God which we lost, and the change of our inability to speak into frank confidence, was established by the physical birth of the Lord. This hallowed our birth, so that we may no longer begin life in lawlessness and be conceived in sin by our mothers, but that we may have a hallowed birth, since Christ through his own birth has blessed our human birth. The divine apostle is a witness to this great honor shown to human beings when he writes, “Otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.” 

So when the first seal had been opened, he says, I saw someone approaching on a white horse from those spiritual holy creatures, with a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering so that he should conquer. The white horse is a symbol of the gospel, as the benefit due to be conferred on human beings. The crown symbolizes might and victory. And he came out carrying the crown for Christ, as for one who had begun to conquer the Devil, who had enslaved our race. He says he went out so that the conqueror might conquer: Christ was the conqueror, so that he might make a complete conquest, and [the rider] carried the crown for him as a symbol of victory. 

This, then, is the first benefit. The second benefit of Christ towards us, which opened the second seal of the scroll and went on both to expunge our disgrace and to restore to us the vision of God, was for the Lord to be tempted to conquer the tempter, so that he might know not only that he was himself the conqueror, but also that the wretch had been defeated; instead of “biting the horseman’s heel” and “tripping us up on our steps” to God, he was “falling back” and was being sent off like a slave. It was with a man that he wrestled, even though God was in him: he heard the words “Begone, Satan!” and in disgrace he went away and for the first time came to know his own weakness—he who boasts of “putting his throne above the clouds,” and who imagines that he will be “like the Most High,” as Isaiah portrayed him. 

After this a bright red horse came out, urged on by one of the holy living creatures, and the rider of the horse, he says, was given authority to take peace from the earth, so that men should slay one another; and he was given a great sword. The red horse is the symbol of blood; that is why a sword was given to its rider, so that he might destroy and cut to pieces the propensity for evil found among the inhabitants of the earth. They all planned to turn to idolatry. And, he says, so that men should slay one another, that is, that they might destroy each other’s eagerness to commit evil. For the Lord “did not come to bring peace on earth, but a sword, and to raise up a son against his father and a bride against her mother-in-law,” and their new and God-fearing behavior against that which is old and condemned.
