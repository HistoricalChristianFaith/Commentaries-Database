though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man; but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief.

though I was formerly a blasphemer. See how Paul increases the mercy of God, remembering his former life, and showing whom he chose to have mercy on.

And a persecutor. For Paul would say: Not only was I uttering blasphemies, but also by persecuting others, I compelled them to speak blasphemies.

but I was shown mercy. Paul shows himself worthy of punishment, for mercy is shown in these cases.

because I acted ignorantly. If Paul did it ignorantly, he was shown mercy; why then were not the Jews also shown mercy? And we say, first of all, that they do not want it. For those who approached Christ were shown mercy. But why did not all see the vision as Paul did? For if so, all would have approached. Because Paul persecuted out of ignorance, but those others did so knowingly. Heard the evangelist saying that many of the Pharisees and Jews believed, but they did not confess it; "For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God." (Jn. 12:43) And again Jesus said to them; "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another?" (Jn. 5:44) And again: "This they said, his parents said, because of the Jews, so that they themselves would not be put out of the synagogue." (Jn. 9:22) And the Jews themselves were saying, "Do you see that we are not benefiting at all? Behold, the whole world is going after him." (Jn. 12:19) Did you see them sinning in knowledge, for the sake of ambition? At that time Paul was perhaps at the feet of Gamaliel, not associating with the crowd, and after that, seeing the faith of Christ increasing, he was zealous with the zeal of God, though not in full knowledge.

in unbelief. From the law, Paul read about Christ. Therefore, since he did not immediately believe in Christ, he calls the matter concern, born from unbelief.
