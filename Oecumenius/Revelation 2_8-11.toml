The Lord calls himself first because of his Godhead, but he calls himself last because of his humanity and the mystery of his incarnation. 

He says, he who was dead and came to life: he who went to the trial of death, he means, and by death put death to death. 

I know your tribulation and your poverty: do not say, as the disbelieving Jews said, “Why did we fast and you did not know? Why did we humble our souls and you took no notice?” 

He says, but you are rich, since you have Christ as your rich protector, even though “he became poor” for our sake, “taking the form of a servant,” and incurring the blasphemy of the spurious Jews. 

So Judas is interpreted as “confession,” and Israel as “those who spiritually see God.” Therefore the true Jews and the spiritual Israel would be those who confess Christ. “For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly, nor is the external circumcision in the flesh” acceptable to God, as Paul says, “but he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and circumcision is that of the heart,” and not of the flesh. Those Jews therefore who have remained in unbelief are found to be a blasphemous synagogue under the command of Satan. 

He says, Have no fear because of what you are going to suffer. See, the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and you will suffer tribulation for ten days; for by the action of the Devil people ill-treat the godly. And God consents, making them more acceptable by their temptations. “But,” he says, “take courage; your tribulation will soon be over and is of a short duration.” 

He says, Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life: this is true, for it is also said, “He who endures to the end will be saved,” assuredly not the one who throws away his shield and shows cowardice in battle. 

He who has an ear, let him listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers shall not be harmed by the second death. What is said is exceedingly accurate; for to the first death, which is the separation of the soul from the body, all alike, both righteous and sinners, are subject, so that the divine pronouncement may achieve its end: “you are dust, and to dust you shall return.” But the second death, of sin, which the Lord mentions when he says, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead,” would not injure those who conquer their temptations.
