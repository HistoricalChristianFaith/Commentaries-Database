But what did these creatures shown to the Evangelist signify? That would be good to explain. There was among some of the Jews a certain falsehood, that God exercised providential care among the holy orders in heaven and desired to dwell among them only, while he removed himself from those on the earth on account of Adam’s sin and did not care about their well-being. And for that reason, they spoke in Isaiah the following: “Why have we fasted, and you did not know it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you did not pay attention?” And some such falsehood among them is suggested by this scriptural statement: “Lord, your mercy is in the heavens, and your faithfulness is unto the clouds.” It is as though the providence of God did not extend to the earth, regarding that as unworthy on account of sin. And therefore, the vision given to the Evangelist reveals that the providence of God pervades all things, sustaining those who dwell in heaven but also extending to those who dwell upon the earth. And this is what the four living creatures who are around the throne of God symbolize. For every physical and earthly creature is a compound of the four fundamental elements—fire, earth, air and water—and each of the living creatures symbolizes one of these: the lion is a symbol of fire, because of its vigorous ferocity. The ox is a symbol of the earth, because it is a beast that works the earth. The man is a symbol of the air, since he is heavenly and sublime on account of the subtlety of his mind. The eagle is a symbol of water, since the origin of birds is from water. And these creatures are seen to encircle the throne of God, indicating through the four creatures that what is upon the earth is worthy of attention and providential care.
