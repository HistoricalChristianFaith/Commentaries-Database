Therefore, I wish the younger women to marry, bear children, manage the household, and give no opportunity to the adversary to have a cause for slander. For already some have turned aside after Satan. If a faithful man or woman has widows, let them be supported, and let the Church not be burdened, so that it may provide adequately for the truly widows.

The good aspect was that, once the widows were instructed, they should not abandon Christ nor reject their initial faith. But since they do this, let them marry, and let them not pledge themselves to Christ, and so let them marry. The former is blameless, the latter is unholy. For their arrogance and looseness of conduct are thus restrained, at least by greater affliction and concern.

and give no opportunity to the adversary. For if they marry correctly, not engaged to Christ beforehand, they will not expose themselves to the occasion of being slandered. Paul did not command them to live without fear in marrying, but that, pressed by cares, they should look to live modestly.

For already some have turned aside after Satan. But why then did you pay such great attention to these things, and even more to those concerning the virgins? Because they, Paul says, gave occasion, turning away after Satan. For he says this not that there are no younger widows, but because he feared lest he might reject Christ.

If a faithful man. He repeated: If a faithful man or woman has widows. For if they were unfaithful, it would not be necessary for them to be supported by them, lest the faithful appear to be in need of the unfaithful. Moreover, the laws also concern those who obey them, not those who are not subject to them.

let him provide for them. Let the matter be done lightly. For through this, let them support, Paul meant the necessary nourishment.

so that the Church is not burdened. So the faithful, supporting their own widows, also contribute to the widows of the Church. Just as the Church, not being burdened, and for this reason nourishing more abundantly those it nourishes, namely truly the widows, that is, those unprotected and isolated.

and that those who are truly widows. Truly widows are those who are abandoned on all sides. For he who does this, Paul says, not only supports them if he provides for them, but also greatly helps the rest, granting them relief.
