The Lord knows how to rescue the godly from temptation, but to keep the unjust for the day of judgment, especially those who walk according to the flesh in the lust of pollution and despise authority: bold, brave, who do not fear to speak evil of dignitaries: whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.
"especially those who walk according to the flesh." Therefore, it cleverly comes from the aforementioned examples to the present argument. Peter speaks, however, of the curses of the Nicolaitans or Gnostics, or Naassenes or Cerdonians, for their wickedness has taken on various names: and as with their wicked deeds, so too is it found to be confused with names. For these, as we have said, having taken on depth and silence, narrate marvelously the first works of the world's existence and certain mothers and ages, just as Marcion who took corrupt seeds from these: then, through this, repulsed from the dominance of institution and oversight or governance of the world, they boldly arrived at all fleshly immorality. But if anyone wishes to learn about these things, taking in hand the book composed by the blessed man Irenaeus of Gaul (Book 1, cap. 1,8-9), which he titled Against Heresies, he will find the impurities of these, especially because of Marcus, the most obscene man, and those who were seduced by him, as well as the corrupted miserable women, "Audacious, reckless." It must be understood who they are. Therefore, rejecting the Overseer or Governor and Creator of the world, it is no wonder that such audacious and reckless individuals are pursuing their own pleasures. But he also speaks of revilers. For those who do not fear authority out of contempt, what is surprising if they also stand boldly against all splendor? However, the blessed Apostle Jude speaks more openly about these things, where he also makes mention of the body of Moses. (Jude 9)
Now, Peter only hinted at this matter in passing, touching upon it and calming the discussion. Therefore, taking this occasion to speak about those things that are proposed, we say that "do not fear to speak evil of dignitaries," that is: they scornfully attack all exceptional dignitaries with curses. And wishing to restrain their boldness regarding such matters, he says: "whereas angels, who are greater in power and might, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord," saying the same as blessed Jude, as we have said: since he too, restraining the crabbiness and nonsense of certain tongues, made a warning from the same example, and he says more broadly: "Michael the archangel," etc., "did not dare to bring a railing accusation." (Jude 9) Therefore, this is what Peter also wishes to say now, that these evil spirits spare nothing in hurling curses at the dignitaries. However, those indeed who are greater in power and might, namely these unclean ones, do not bring or utter a railing accusation against them, that is, the dignitaries, before the Lord. And of this, Michael the archangel is a witness. For indeed, the Devil also shares in some glory, in that he is the beginning of the creation of the Lord, he did not bring forth a slanderous accusation against him. There is also a more effective argument in this way: For if the Devil, who is more worthy to receive accusations, nevertheless participates in splendor, this was not achieved by Michael before the Lord; it would be utterly unwise for those who rashly attack all splendor or those adorned with splendor with insults, since they are far inferior in honor to the angels; however, he speaks of dignitaries, whether divine virtues or even ecclesiastical principalities, which these most obscene ones do not cease to attack even with curses.
