Therefore, it says, “repay her double for her sins.” It is true that through wise Moses God has commanded us, “You will not take vengeance twice at the same time.” How, therefore, does God repay “double”? The word double does not mean twofold or twice. Rather, since God is a lover of humankind and good and punishes to a much lesser degree than is deserved, he deems that he has given back double, and indeed not only double but even sevenfold, whenever he gives back only a part. And knowing this, the prophet said, “Repay to your neighbors sevenfold into their bosom the reproach with which they have reproached you, O Lord.” In this petition for the punishment of their enemies according to their deserts, they implore God to give back sevenfold. Similar to these words, it says, “give back to her,” who was exalted and lived wantonly during this present life, giving no thought to the divine will. For [Babylon] said, I will never lose my rule or see any evil—for by “widow” it means to be deprived of rule. Therefore, on account of her arrogance utter evil will come on her all of a sudden. For it says, God is mighty, and he will be hindered by no one from bringing upon her judgment and torment. From this [judgment] may we all be free by the grace of him who has called us into his knowledge and into the hope of Christ, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
