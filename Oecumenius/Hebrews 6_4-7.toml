“For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened.” He did not say that it is difficult, unprofitable, or improper, but impossible, so as to cast them into despair of hoping for a second cleansing.
"Having tasted the gift." The forgiveness of sins, which is in baptism; for this is a heavenly gift. For no one can give such things except one, God.
"and having become partakers of the Holy Spirit."After the forgiveness of sins, then comes the partaking of the Holy Spirit; for He does not dwell in a body burdened with sins; By the laying on of hands, as he says above (Heb. 6:2).
"and having tasted the good word of God." The teaching concerning the mind of Christ.
"the powers of the age to come.” For we shall all give an account of the words we have lived by, and both punishment and rest are everlasting. For in these things is the power of the age to come. That is, the seriousness [ἀῤῥαβῶνα] of the coming age, namely, faith in Christ.

“the powers of the age to come." Powers of the coming age. That there will certainly be a resurrection, and that we shall all give an account of the life we have lived, and that both punishment and rest are inescapable, and such things, for these indeed are the powers of the coming age. Or that the pledge of the coming age is faith in Christ. Powers of the coming age, Instead of what the future age can teach. For those who have tasted, in common, what has been taken figuratively [τροπικῶς], signifying, those who have learned, have been instructed. What then can the future do, and what is its necessity and work? Because in it each finds the reward of what he has done, since there is no end either to the punishment in it, nor to the happiness, because then the unfailing judgment and the just will be revealed more clearly, and many other things. Therefore, those who have learned these things along with the others, he says, and having fallen away, it is impossible, and thereafter.

"and having fallen away." It is impossible to renew a city to repentance after having lost all these things and having fallen away. What then? Should we cast away repentance? May it never be, (thus says the holy Cyril in the sixth book of “On the Veneration and Worship in Spirit and Truth”) but rather the repentance through baptism. For it is necessary first to consider repentance and the renunciation of wicked deeds, and thus to be baptized. Therefore, he says, the repentance in baptism, from which he also said, "To renew what is proper to baptism," and "To crucify again, which is also proper to this baptism." For those being baptized are crucified with the Lord. Therefore, he who wishes to repent again through the second baptism crucifies Christ by being crucified with Him.

"they crucify again for themselves the Son of God." What does it mean, crucify again for themselves the Son of God and setting an example? He says from above, crucify again for themselves and bringing shame. But he says it is of this kind; once Christ was crucified, and we too, once, are crucified with him through baptism. Therefore, he says, one who thinks there is a second baptism, as far as he is concerned, crucifies the Lord from above. For what else does the one who thinks he is being crucified a second time through baptism do, except that he also considers himself to be crucified a second time, through what he does? But to crucify a second time, he says, Christ, as far as it pertains to him, is nothing other than to set an example for him and to bring him to shame. For once crucified, he is therefore immortal. But he who re-crucifies does this as a falsehood, which brings him shame as if he had only pretended to die once.

What does it mean to crucify again? Calling it a second crucifixion and a second passion [πάθος], if such repentance exists, and the worthiness to receive the remission through baptism was achieved only by the cross of Christ. Therefore, those who understand this desire again to see Christ being crucified, mocked, and typified. Oh, the audacity and shamelessness! If anyone contemplates such things. And indeed, through these, they shake their thoughts, so that having become hopeless of being able to attain such repentance, they strive for virtue instead.
