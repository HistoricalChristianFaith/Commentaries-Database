How variously and neatly has he woven the lament over her and the climax of her grief. Since practically everything is clear, let us simply note what seems to be difficult and go on to the rest. 

He says, Horses, chariots, and slaves. The word for chariots is Latin, for since the Romans were ruling, it is not at all unreasonable for the blessed evangelist to use Latin. But the text has turned it into Greek. For redium is the Latin for chariot, but he has put the genitive plural case, and one ought to say rediorum according to Latin usage, but when turning it into Greek he has written a Greek ending, saying redōn, in order that the word may be in a proper form. 

He says, Horses, chariots, and slaves, meaning chariot-horses are suitable for chariots, and slaves, that is, steeds meant for riding.
