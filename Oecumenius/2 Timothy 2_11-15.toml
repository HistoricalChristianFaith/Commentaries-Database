The saying is trustworthy. For if we have died with him, we will also live with him. If we endure, we will also reign with him. If we deny him, he also will deny us. If we are faithless, he remains faithful. He cannot deny himself. These things he reminds you of, sincerely charging you before the Lord not to quarrel about words to no profit, which leads to the ruin of the hearers. Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.

The saying is trustworthy. Those who are chosen obtain glorious and eternal salvation. For some have doubted concerning the resurrection, and this assurance was needed. That the saying is trustworthy is also established from reasoning.

For if we have died with Christ, (by which I mean death both through baptism and through sufferings, this indeed being the sensible one,) we shall also reign with him." For no one, Paul says, who has shared in sorrows with others can be deprived of good things and prosperity: let alone Christ, who is goodness and kindness itself.

If we deny him, he also will deny us. Then also fear them who are evil. But consider what is likely to happen to one who is denied by Christ.

If we are faithless, he remains faithful. If we are faithless concerning that he rose from the dead, or that he is God, he remains faithful, that is, true. For having said that he will rise, and that he is God (for this was signified in many ways), he is faithful. For he rose and he is God. He says that he cannot deny himself, so as not to be God or to have risen. Just as he said: There will be no change because of our denial, but he remains faithful and true concerning himself. And to deny, that is, to lie to himself, he cannot do, in not having risen or not being God. For having promised concerning himself, he cannot lie to himself and fail to fulfill the promises. For neither by believing do we make him not God, nor by being unfaithful do we cast out the divine nature, but both in our believing and in our unbelief he himself is God. Therefore, we who believe reap the benefit. But the "It is not possible," instead of, "It is not permitted." "He remains faithful." Therefore, for our salvation, he demands from us consent to him. For, he says, it is not harmed by our denial.

These things he reminds you of. So that no one might think these things are unnecessary; concerning these words to Timothy, Paul says, "These things he reminds you of," testifying before the Lord, and it is a fearful thing to speak before God as a witness.

not to quarrel. Since the matter has a certain taste, and the human soul always wishes to dispute and argue, you, Paul says, protesting to them before God, do not engage in argument; instead, he says, command, taking God as a witness, so that they may know that if they despise you, God will judge them.

about words to no profit. For not only does it have no benefit to engage in disputes, arguments, and battles, but it also causes harm to the weaker among those who listen.

present yourself approved. As an example, blameless.

a worker who does not need to be ashamed. Much has been said about this shame. For it is likely that some who are perishing feel shame about the preaching, as the apostles suffer badly, and as Christ is preached with the cross, or at least because the preachers are humble, namely, Paul, a weaver of tents, and Peter, along with several others, were fishermen. The fact that he is not ashamed is because he has done nothing corrupt.

rightly dividing the word of truth. Cut away like a knife the excess and false doctrines, which those perishing have added to the preaching, and lead straight through the Spirit.
