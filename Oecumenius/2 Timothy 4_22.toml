The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Grace be with us all. Amen.

The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. The help is twofold, that of Christ and that of the Holy Spirit, as if Paul were saying, With the coming of the Holy Spirit which you now have. Let also the Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Since this is with you, you will not suffer at my departure. Or that it is not possible to enjoy the presence of Christ without being endowed with spiritual grace, so as to be, in relation to this interpretation, with your spirit, that is, with spiritual grace.

Grace be with us. And Paul prays for himself, either so that he may always be grateful, or so that he may always have a spiritual gift.

Finished, with divine help, of the later Epistle to Timothy.

It was written from the city of Rome, when Paul was brought before Nero Caesar the Roman for the second time.
