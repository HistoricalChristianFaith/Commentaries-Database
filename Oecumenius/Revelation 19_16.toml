And it is written upon his garment and on his thigh: King of kings and Lord of lords. The garment is understood to be the flesh of the Lord; it is interpreted spiritually as flesh and blood, according to the holy interpreters who cite Isaiah: "Why are your garments red, and your clothing like one who treads the fully trampled winepress?" (Isa. 63:2-3)

But the thigh signifies the fleshly birth; for it is written in Genesis, "all the souls that went into Egypt with Jacob are those who came forth from his loins." (Gen. 46:26) This, then, shows the riddle written on the garment and on the thigh: that the King of all is Emmanuel. For although the Word was united to flesh in hypostasis and endured the fleshly birth from the Virgin, he nevertheless was established as King and Lord of all (Isa. 7:14), both of those in heaven and of those on earth, not diminished in worth by the incarnation; for he was and is and will be God.
