The robe symbolizes the flesh of the Lord, which was endowed with a rational soul. The holy angels spoke of his flesh through Isaiah, “Why are your garments red and your apparel as if from a trodden winepress, utterly stained by trodden [grapes]?” Moreover, the thigh indicates his birth in the flesh, for it is written in Genesis, “All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, who came out of his thighs.” Therefore, when the vision shows that on the robe and on the thigh it is written that the Immanuel is king of all, it shows that the Word, united personally to the flesh and having undergone a fleshly birth from a virgin, was in no way established less a King and Lord of all things in heaven and upon earth; nor was he diminished in rank by virtue of his incarnation. For even as such he was God and is and shall be God.
