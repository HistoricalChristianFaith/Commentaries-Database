Peter said “according to God’s will” either because our afflictions are part of God’s providence and are sent to us as a form of testing, or because although we are afflicted by God’s will, we depend on him for the outcome. For he is faithful and sure and does not lie when he promises us that we shall never be tempted beyond what we are able to bear.
