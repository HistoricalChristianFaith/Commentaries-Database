As for this divine Revelation, some say, wagging their tongues brashly and ignorantly, that it was not composed by the divine John the evangelist and theologian. They listen to this tradition as though they have secretly received it. 

But I think they say this not from ignorance nor from any secret revelation, but only from simplicity and, if one may dare to say it, from cowardice and a passionate love for earthly things, showing by their denials their fear of what is absolutely incontrovertible. For in the face of the explicit testimony of the blessed and holy fathers, who is able to contradict their testimony or somehow to reach the conclusion that this is certainly not the case? 

For the great Basil in his writings against Eunomius refutes his godless blasphemies and nonsense. The divine theologian referred to these in his fourth book, “in which he mentions on the authority of the divinely inspired Scriptures both the problems and solutions to the controversies about the Son” by means of the Old and New Testaments. He starts by saying, “If the Son is God by nature, and the Father is also God by nature, the Son is not one God and the Father another, but they are the same.” And later on, “Moses said about the Son, ‘I am has sent me,’ and John the evangelist said, ‘In the beginning was the Word,’ and he said ‘was’ not once only, but four times, and again elsewhere he said, ‘he who is from God’ and ‘he who is in the bosom of the Father,’ and elsewhere, ‘he who is in heaven,’ and in the Revelation, ‘he who is and who was and is to come.’” He made no distinction between authors, but he followed the testimony of Paul and repeated it. 

If then this Revelation was composed by some other John, as the nonsense of the majority has it, the great Basil also would have written his books on the Revelation with the name of its author. But after first listing the books of Moses, and then those of the apostle and theologian, as those, too, of the apostle Paul, he had no need to refer to anyone else in addition to these. These then are the incontrovertible words of the great and holy Basil. 

The great Gregory, surnamed “the Theologian,” whom they call “the Organizer,” when he was making his defense in the presence of the hundred and fifty bishops, clearly and truly wrote, “When will you inherit my holy mountain?” and he went on to say, “I am convinced that others preside over other churches, as John teaches me in Revelation.” 

And Eusebius Pamphyli, in the third book of his Ecclesiastical History, says somewhere, “This, then, was the situation of the Jews at that time,” and goes on to say, “It is recorded that at that time John the apostle and evangelist was still alive, and was sentenced by Domitian the son of Vespasian to live on the island of Patmos on account of his witness to the divine word. Indeed, Irenaeus, when writing about the number of the name of the Antichrist as given in the book of John called Revelation, uses these very words in the fifth book of his Against the Heresies, saying about John: ‘If it seems right at the present time for this name to be openly announced, it would have been mentioned by the one who actually saw the Revelation.’”
