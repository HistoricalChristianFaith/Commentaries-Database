As from a great multitude I heard a voice from heaven: for the ranks of the holy angels are innumerable; as one of the Fathers said, the ninety-nine are the sheep (see Matt. 18:12, Luke 15:4) preserved and steadfast, the angels, and the one that was led astray is all humanity. And they said, "Alleluia." The word alleluia is Hebrew; it means "praise" or "give thanks, praise God." Therefore they sing a song of thanksgiving at the righteous judgment of spiritual Babylon.
