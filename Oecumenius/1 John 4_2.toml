The confession that the Lord has come is not made in words but in deeds. Paul said: “Always bearing about in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus might also appear in our body.” Therefore whoever has Jesus at work inside him and is dead to the world, and who no longer lives for it but for Christ, and who carries him about in his body—this person is of God.
