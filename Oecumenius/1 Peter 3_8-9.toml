Free from the ordinances that concerned both men and women, Peter then presents a common exhortation to all men, women, youths, adolescents, kings, leaders, subjects, and those who are governed, foreigners, citizens, the rich, and the poor. Therefore, he adds: "In summary." That is, what is the need to discuss in detail? I say simply to all of you. For this signifies summary/τέλος): and this refers to the goal of salvation proposed to all, and this is the law of love; established for all, from which all virtue proceeds, namely, the modesty of the soul, compassion, mercy, and other similar virtues which he enumerated,
the united indeed being harmony without discrimination about something with a willing spirit:
compassionate, however, is pity towards those who are afflicted as if towards oneself:
fraternal, on the other hand, is the due affection towards relatives as towards brothers.
Again, merciful is the movement from the soul to do good towards those who are in the same condition.
Indeed, approachable or benevolence is kindness and courtesy towards all, which also extends towards those of similar character and towards friends.
Humility, however, or modesty of the soul, is bearing another's insults, acknowledging one's own sins, and enduring accusations, which could also be a form of kindness of the soul.
Indeed, insult arises from a corrupt habit, which is rooted in the reproach of others. With these, Peter says, adorned with the aforementioned virtues, moreover, you should not be easily captured by warfare: furthermore, competitors are also directed by the divine way of living. For he who is blessed by all must certainly also be a competitor. And he brings in David (Ps. 34:12-15) as a witness saying:
"knowing that you were called to this." The order is with the aforementioned structure. In summary, or I may say absolutely, may you all be unanimous and so forth, knowing that you have been called to this, to bless, that is, to bless all. For Paul says: "Bless those who persecute you." (Rom. 12:14) By doing this, you will inherit the name, so that you may be heard by all as those who bless. For it is not just to bring reproach upon anyone who clings to eternal life. Therefore, David also advises to have a pure tongue from reproach for one who is affected with a loving heart towards true life, etc. (Ps. 15:3) Thus, being prepared, you will have the omnipotent and all-seeing inspector kindly observing you, not with a stern or angry mind, as he looks upon those who do evil. If this is the case, who will harm you? And if you are afflicted while you are doers and initiators of good, do not be of little spirit, but rejoice: first of all, because these things are not evil; and also, because you are blessed and not miserable because of these things.
