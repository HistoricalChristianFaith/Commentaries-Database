Then the divine angel took the censer, filled it with the fire of God, and threw it to the earth; and there were voices, sounds of thunder, lightning flashes, and an earthquake. Perhaps one of the angels cast this divine fire upon Mount Sinai, and there were sounds of thunder, voices, trumpets, flashes of lightning, and the mountain was covered with smoke as God descended upon it. Just as then the thunder and the signs preceded, so now these things have preceded the glorious coming of the Lord.
