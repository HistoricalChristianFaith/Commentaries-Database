Then, it says, the holy angel took and filled the altar with divine fire and “threw it on the earth, and there were voices and peals of thunder and flashes of lightning and an earthquake.” Similarly, an angel threw this heavenly fire upon Mount Sinai and there was thunder and voices and trumpets and lightning, and the mountain was covered in smoke, since God had come and was present. Therefore, just as at that time thunder and fearsome wonders preceded him, so also now such wonders occur before the glorious advent of the Lord.
