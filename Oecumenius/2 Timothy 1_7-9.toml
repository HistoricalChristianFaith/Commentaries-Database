For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love and of discipline. Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me His prisoner; but share in the sufferings for the gospel according to the power of God, who has saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus before time began.

How then shall I rekindle the gift of God? If I stand honorable against temptations.

For God has not given us a spirit of fear. For there is a spirit or gift of fear, as it is said in the books of the Kings: And the spirit of fear fell upon them, where it was altogether necessary to fear. (2 Chron. 17:10) But to us, Paul says, a gift of power has been given.

but of power. Which is against temptations.

and of love.  Which is towards the brethren.

and of discipline. Concerning a proper life. And in all these things, we must also include our own eagerness.

Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord. Many miserable people, examining the mystery according to human reasoning, say it is a shame to preach the Son of God crucified, not knowing what was accomplished through the cross and the death of the Lord. You, therefore, Paul says, do not be ashamed of the testimony, that is, the cross of Christ, but proclaim it boldly.

nor of me His prisoner. Nor should you be ashamed that you have as a teacher one who is bound. For if Christ did not find shame to be crucified, neither do I for the chains.

but share in the sufferings. And do not only be unashamed, but also endure hardship with me; that is, if it is necessary for you to suffer such things for the sake of the Gospel, do not have fear. For this is what he also indicated above where Paul says, "For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power." For do you say that you have suffered by your own power? God gave and will give such power; you only introduced the willingness.

who has saved us. Then also concerning the cooperation of God and the power, which makes one bravely endure temptations and suffering, Paul states the proofs. He saved us, he says, from the death of sin, and called us with a holy calling, having wandered away, not because we were worthy of the calling, but because God himself did this by his own purpose and grace. Who then, he said (for this is the opinion), while we were enemies, had such feelings towards us, much more so when we have become friends, and wish to be afflicted on that account. God will give the power to become virtuous.

and grace which was given to us in Christ Jesus. It shows that the salvation given to us by grace through Christ (this he says in Christ Jesus) was predestined beforehand before the ages.
