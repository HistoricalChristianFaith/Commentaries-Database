According to the holy prophet Isaiah, the seraphim said “holy” three times and so composed a threefold hymn to one lordship. In this manner they showed that there are three individual existences or, which is to speak in a similar way, [three] persons of whom to sing, while there is one essence of the Godhead. Also in this passage the holy angels, having spoken the Hallelujah three times in the passages above and having rendered homage to each of the three holy hypostases, now sing the Hallelujah to the holy Trinity, showing that the holy and much-sung Trinity is in one unique essence and Godhead. “For the Lord our God reigns,” it says. Our Lord, Jesus Christ, even before his saving incarnation, as the only begotten Son and Word of the Father and the Maker of all things, reigned over what is in heaven and on earth with the Father and the all-holy Spirit. But even after the incarnation he is similarly Lord and King of all things, for by his taking of flesh he was in no way made inferior in regards to his rule and dominion over all things. As the all-wise apostle says, we do not yet see all things subjected to him, but all things will rather be subjected to him in the coming age, including those who now until then behave insolently toward him. Even death itself is to be subjected—for “the last enemy to be destroyed is death”—the holy angels properly say “the Lord our God reigns.” [In this way they] lift up a doxology regarding the future age, since then by the subjection of all things, Christ will have acquired a perfect sovereignty over all things. Some will experience this subjection by way of torment, while others will experience it by way of a direct knowledge which is not “through a dim mirror or an enigma,” as is the case now.

He says, For the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride has made herself ready: at the present time the marriage of the Lord to the church is still a courtship and not yet a complete marriage. The blessed apostle symbolizes this when writing the second epistle to the Corinthians, in which he says, “I betrothed you to one man to present you to Christ as a pure virgin.” So this is still a matter of courtship; for “I betrothed” is used of courtship. And as a symbol of courtship we receive “the earnest of the Spirit.” 

When, however, the church truly becomes one spirit with Christ, then the marriage is complete, just as the man becomes one body with his wife. For when the wise apostle reflects on physical marriage, he puts it very graphically, saying, “the two shall become one flesh,” and then adds, “This is a great mystery, and I take it to refer to Christ and the church.” So when the holy angels say, The marriage of the Lamb has come, they mean that the marriage consequent on the present courtship will be consummated. 

The gospel, too, has clearly taught us this on two occasions: firstly it tells the story of the marriage of a king’s son, when many had been invited to the banquet, some of whom joined in the feast, but others excused themselves from the supper, and how one who was not wearing “a wedding garment” was chased away. Then also it speaks of the ten virgins, of whom five, whom it calls “prudent,” went with the bridegroom into that happy bridal chamber, while the others were shut out, since they had not filled their lamps with sufficient oil. Nothing in these events can be understood as referring to the present, but only to the future. So the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his bride the church is present, ready to enjoy those ineffable good things resulting from its union with Christ. 

By clothed with linen he means, “having a garment of virtues.” It is linen on account of its brightness and plainness, bright because of [the church’s] incomprehensible being and way of life, plain in its teachings and thoughts about God. 

He says, And he said to me, “Write: Blessed are those who have been invited to the marriage-supper of the Lamb,” even though some are destined to depart. For we know that although many have been invited in the gospels, some did not attend the spiritual banquet, either by going away, or by being excluded because they did not have “a wedding garment,” as was made clear a short while back. And the divine apostle, too, has said, “Many are called, but few are chosen.”
