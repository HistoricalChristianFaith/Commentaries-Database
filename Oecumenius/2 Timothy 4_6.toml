For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.

For I, Paul says, already offer myself as a sacrifice to Christ. And he did not say sacrifice, but a drink offering, indicating something greater and more sacred. For a part of the sacrifice alone was offered to God as incense. But the entire drink offering was dedicated to Him. And Paul himself commands his disciples to do this, saying: "Present your members as a living sacrifice." (Rom. 12:1) For he who sacrifices for Christ performs a sacred service himself.

— [OECUMENIUS] The meaning of "being am poured out" is, as it were, that I break the war against all. Neither fighting nor being fought against, for I am perfected.

of my departure. For departure means death, either because of the departing from the earth from which we were taken; or towards the Creator Christ. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius Π f.169r; A f.182v; B f. 220v; G f.309v—310r] —
