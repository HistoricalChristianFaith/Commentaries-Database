Dearly beloved, you faithfully do whatever you work for the brothers and for the guests, who have borne witness to your love in the sight of the Church; if you have led them to God worthily, you will benefit. For they went forth for His name, taking nothing from the Gentiles. Therefore, we ought to receive such as these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
"you faithfully do," this is what befits a faithful man.
"we ought to receive." ᾽Απολαμδάνειν is taken for ἀναλαμδάνεσθαι, that is, to receive as when it is said: "They received me like a lion ready for prey." (Ps. 17:12) Moreover, this instructs us not to wait for the needy until they come to us, but rather to run to and follow them: like Abraham and Lot. (Gen. 8)
