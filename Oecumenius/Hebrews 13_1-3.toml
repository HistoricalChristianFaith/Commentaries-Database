"Let brotherly love continue." Let it be unwavering, do not allow it to escape from you.
"Do not forget to show hospitality." For as they had been plundered of their possessions, they might perhaps have been more sparing. But by saying, let it remain, and do not forget, it shows that they had long possessed these virtues, but now, due to the continuous hardships, they were in danger of becoming indifferent to these virtues; therefore, Paul again encourages them towards these things.
"in this way, some have been unaware while they entertained angels." Thus, Paul says, great is hospitality, so that it became a cause for those around Abraham and Lot to receive the angels. (Gen. 18) And the fact that they were unaware, instead of not knowing, that the guests were angels, and yet they received them so hospitably; therefore this great reward for them; for if they had known, they would have done nothing great.
"as bound." For he who is bound to someone, even if he wishes to forget, cannot.
"and those who suffer adversity." Of those who are suffering either in prisons, or in famine, or in another affliction. For if someone were to consider that he himself is surrounded by a body that suffers similarly, he would have more compassion for them, both because of sympathy, and because of the fear that he too might experience similar sufferings from inhumanity.
