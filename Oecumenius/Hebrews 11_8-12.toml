"By faith, Abraham was called.” For he would not have followed, if he had not believed that God speaks the truth, to dwell in that land. And the very act of going out was an act of faith. For when God called, he obeyed, believing that he was being called for good.
“not knowing where he was going.” And the greater aspect of faith is that he did not even know what he was being called to.
"By faith he dwelt in the land of promise." See what it says: In the land which God had promised, saying, To you I will give it and to your seed, he lived as a foreigner, and seeing that the promise of God was not yet fulfilled. For God had said he would give it. Yet he, as a stranger, dwelt in a foreign land, and thus he did not weaken in faith, but even with his descendants he regarded it as foreign; nevertheless, he still believed that it would be given to him and to his seed.
"dwelling in tents." So much did he dwell in it as a foreign land, that he did not even have a house, but dwelt in tents; for to dwell in tents is the lot of strangers and foreigners of the land, those who move from one place to another because they have no permanent possession.
"with Isaac and Jacob." And this shows their faith, that even being co-heirs, they lived in that land as strangers. And Isaac was driven out by Ishmael, while Jacob was fleeing from Esau. Neither did they therefore doubt that the land would not be given to them.
"For he waited." And by what word, he says, did these not weaken in faith, as if dwelling in a foreign land concerning the promised land? For, he says, they were not concerned with the earth, but indeed having received the land of promise, they sought the greater things and were expecting the heavenly city. For if they had been attached to the earth, they would have been shaken by not receiving it. Thus, he says, we also ought to seek the things above, and not have a word about those here.
"the city which has foundations." This is said because of its permanence and certainty, meaning it has foundations, or that it alone has foundations. For those on earth, in comparison to it, do not have foundations.
"whose builder and maker is God."The greatest praise of the one in heaven.
"By faith, Sarah herself also." It is a challenge that even Sarah herself, as if to say: If a woman has believed, it is a shame if we are found to be of less faith than a woman. But how did she believe? And yet she laughed. But afterwards she was afraid when rebuked, which is what faith is.
"received strength to conceive seed." For the reception of the seed, that is to say, she was strengthened to receive the seed that produces children.
"and she bore a child when she was past the age." This, too, means not only, he says, that she was barren, but also that beyond the proper age, that is to say, in her very old age, she was strengthened to receive the seed.
"because she considered Him faithful." Faithful, that is, truthful. But where did he promise? According to this time, he says, I will come, and there will be a son for Sarah.
"Therefore, from one man.” Therefore, all who are of the seed of Abraham were born from one seed, and because of the age, they are as numerous as the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea.
