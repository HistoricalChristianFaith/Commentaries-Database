I believe this refers to the falling of the star, which, having angered God, made the waters bitter.

Waters are metaphorically called humans, as stated by the prophet regarding "the sounds of many waters; the wonders of the sea's waves are marvelous," (Ps. 92:4) and again "the rivers lifted up their voices, saying, Lord, the rivers lifted up their voices; the rivers lifted up their waves." (Ps. 92:3) These things are to be understood as a form of allegorical speech. However, it must not be disregarded that such events and similar ones occur perceptibly.
