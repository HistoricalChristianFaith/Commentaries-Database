HYPOTHESIS ON THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY

Paul sends this from Rome. The pretext of the Epistle is this: Since those who had accompanied Paul on his journey left him, the Apostle, wishing Timothy to come to him, writes the Epistle. And first, he shows that he remembers Timothy’s devotion and the faith of his ancestors. Then he states that those from Asia, namely Phygelus and Hermogenes, have turned away from him, seeing his chains. But he bears witness to the greatest zeal only in Onesiphorus, and he received him when he came to Rome and stayed with him. Paul commands Timothy to avoid foolish disputes, because from them arise quarrels. For Hymenaeus and Philetus also turned aside in this way, departing from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened, and they overturn some people; therefore, Paul rather encourages Timothy to pay attention to himself and to the teaching, and to know that in the last times there will be men lovers of themselves, and of pleasures rather than of God, and foreseeing these things, to safeguard the people lest anyone be deceived by them. And having urged him much concerning morals and the accuracy of the teaching, and indicating that the time of his departure is at hand and that he is about to be offered as a drink offering and to bear witness, he instructed him to come to him quickly, bringing the cloak and the books. Paul warns Timothy about Alexander the coppersmith and to be on guard, as he indicated many things to him, and thus he concludes the Epistle.

What then does the Second Epistle to Timothy say? In the first, Paul said, "I hope to come to you soon." He was not able to go. For he was already held captive by Nero. Therefore, knowing this, instead of his presence, he sent letters, at once comforting him regarding his not coming, and at the same time encouraging Timothy, who was thus entrusted with the care of the Church.
