Do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, namely the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life, is not of the Father, but is of the world. And the world is passing away, and the lust of it: but he who does the will of God abides forever.
We have already mentioned what John is calling the world, “a vile crowd”, for which the Lord also says to the disciples: “You are not of the world, just as I am not of the world.” (Jn. 17:16) The father of this world is the Devil (see Jn. 8:44 and 2 Cor. 4:4), I say, of worldly pleasure and confusion. Therefore, the Lord says to the Father about His disciples: "I do not ask that You take them out of the world, but that You keep them from the Evil One," (Jn. 17:15) or from the world: whom He also says elsewhere is “established in the evil one” (1 Jn. 5:19). — In another way: If the Evil One opposes the good Father, then he who serves the desires of the world is not from the Father, but is of the world; it is clear that he who is not from the Father, but from the world, is also from the Devil: as He says to the Jews in the Gospels: "You are not from the Father, but from the Devil" (Jn. 8:44): that is, from worldly pursuits and exercises, of which the Devil is the sower and planter. (see Matt. 13:24-43)
And he said, these lust of the flesh do not have durability and subsistence, but pass away: those, however, that are done according to the will of God abides forever. But the persistence of the wise is not to despise by contempt and to cling to things that perish: they do something similar to one trying to build a house with a shadow, "but he who does the will of God." But what is the will of the Father? That they believe in Him Whom He has sent. (see Jn. 6:29)
