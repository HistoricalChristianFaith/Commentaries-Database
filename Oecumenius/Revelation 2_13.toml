He says where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. For all of Asia is indeed full of idols, especially Pergamum. But he also says that dwelling in such a place, you have kept my faith unshaken, not deviating at all toward the evil counsel of the many, but even opposing it during the days and festivals of the idols, as my faithful witness who has spoken boldly in my name says, you came as far as you could against those plotting, guarding the truth until death. And since he also touches on the most holy covenant, and we all sin greatly according to what is written to you (James 3:2), and yet being such, he says, "I have the right to accuse."
