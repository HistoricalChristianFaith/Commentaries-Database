First of all, then, I urge that petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people; for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life in all godliness and dignity. For this is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

In daily worship, this would be before the remembrance of others, he says. To make petitions. A petition is a plea offered for deliverance from troubles. Prayer is a request for good things. Intercession is an accusation against wrongdoers.

thanksgivings, for it is necessary to give thanks for the good things that happen to one another.

be made for all people. Since the bishop is a common father, he ought to pray for all people, both the faithful and the unbelievers, friends and enemies, those who slander and those who afflict.

for kings. Then, so that the matter might not appear to be flattery, first saying, be made for all people; thus he declared, “for kings and all who are in high positions."

that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life. Let no Christian be disturbed in any way; therefore, during the time of the mysteries, let him remember that the king, since he is often unfaithful, shows that our profit is their salvation. But how is their salvation our profit? How? For if they are preserved and conduct themselves excellently in wars against enemies, we live quietly and peacefully with no one disturbing us. It would indeed be absurd if they were to be exhausted for the common safety, but we do not even bring together that which is in us as help (I mean prayer) for them.

in all godliness. There are three kinds of wars: one is against the Barbarians; one is against those of the same race; the third, which the soul wages against the body, which is the hardest of all. For the war against the Barbarians brings only death or slavery. The war against those of the same race, I have learned to avoid through gentleness. "Instead of loving me," he says, "they attacked me, but I prayed." (Ps. 109:4) And, "I was peaceful among those who hate peace". (Ps. 120:6) But the one within ourselves is difficult to accomplish, and it brings harm to the soul. Therefore, he wishes to pray for the kings, so that they may both conquer and endure, knowing that the peace from the Barbarians greatly contributes to the peace within ourselves. For if one must be at leisure and know God, then freedom and harmony are necessary for the knowledge of God and kindness. How then could those engaged in wars with the Barbarians be at rest? For it is noble and undeniable to pray for all people, both Greeks and others, so that they may turn back.

who desires all people to be saved. He says, if He Himself desires all to be saved, the Lord who also saves, who then needs my prayers? Yes. For you draw them and those to love, and you show affection. "Imitate," He says, "the purpose of God." (Eph. 5:1) For He Himself desires all people to be saved, and you pray for all people above all.

and to come to the knowledge of the truth. Paul said, "To the knowledge of the truth." Then he explains what the truth in doctrines is. If therefore God wills, he says, why does what He wills not happen? It does not happen because they do not want it. For God does nothing by compulsion.
