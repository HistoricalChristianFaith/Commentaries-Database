Since Christ suffered in the flesh for you, arm yourselves with the same thought: for he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, that he no longer should live the rest of his time in the flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God. For we have spent enough of our past lifetime in doing the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in filthiness, lusts, drunkenness, festivities, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries. Therefore, it seems strange to them that you do not run with them in the same flood of degeneracy. They will give an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
The order is as follows: Therefore, since Christ has died in the flesh, you also should arrange yourselves according to the same thought: for you have died, namely, to the world: moreover, he who has died has ceased from sin, etc.
"For we have spent." Whether we have abundantly operated the will of the Gentiles in our past life: that is, we have lived in a Gentile manner, walking according to the customs of the Gentiles. Therefore, the Gentiles now marvel at this.
"the same thought." That is, according to the same intention and the same purpose. For due to the lack of intention, it is said κατὰ, that is, “according to”.
"he who has suffered in the flesh:" that is, He has died, saying similar things with Paul: "If we have died with Christ, we shall also live with Him. And indeed we will be dead to sin, but we will live to God." (Rom. 6:8-10)
"For we have spent." As if Peter were saying: But what? Is it not enough for you that for such a long time you have indulged in lust? Have you not lived in a similarly reckless manner as the Gentiles? And what those filthiness and obscenities were, he specifically mentions, confusing them.
"With drunkenness," with immoderate desires for wine.
"Therefore, it seems strange to them." They are amazed, that is, they admire. This is what he says: When you have once renounced the pursuits of the Gentiles, which you once lived by, you adhere to the honorable life that you have assumed. For even the Gentiles admire you, that you do not rush into a similar outpouring or confusion of impiety. And therefore, they not only admire and marvel at your strange transformation, not only are they ashamed, but they also slander you, that is, they mock you. For divine worship is an abomination to the sinner. However, they will not bear such slander unpunished, but will give an account to the judge of all, who sits unchallengeable and firmly for this very purpose: for this is what it signifies in this place to be prepared: just as when it is said, "Preparing mountains in your strength," (Ps. 65:6) and, "Your throne is prepared." (Ps. 93:2) Therefore, those who slander you will give an account to him who judges the living and the dead unchangeably and firmly. How he is the judge of the living and the dead will be made manifest in due course.
