If a faithful man or woman has widows, let them be supported, and let the Church not be burdened, so that it may provide adequately for the truly widows.

If a faithful man. He repeated: If a faithful man or woman has widows. For if they were unfaithful, it would not be necessary for them to be supported by them, lest the faithful appear to be in need of the unfaithful. Moreover, the laws also concern those who obey them, not those who are not subject to them.

let him provide for them. Let the matter be done lightly. For through this, let them support, Paul meant the necessary nourishment.

so that the Church is not burdened. So the faithful, supporting their own widows, also contribute to the widows of the Church. Just as the Church, not being burdened, and for this reason nourishing more abundantly those it nourishes, namely truly the widows, that is, those unprotected and isolated.

and that those who are truly widows. Truly widows are those who are abandoned on all sides. For he who does this, Paul says, not only supports them if he provides for them, but also greatly helps the rest, granting them relief.
