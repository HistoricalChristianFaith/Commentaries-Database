And if you call upon the Father, him which without respect of persons, judges according to every one's work: in fear of turning, you spend your time in your dwelling. 18 Knowing that not with corruptible things, gold or silver, you are redeemed from your vain conversation of your fathers' tradition. 19 But with the precious blood as it were of an immaculate and unspotted Lamb, Christ.
Gathering and with much exaggeration: first from the angels who are affected by a longing spirit for these things: then from the description of what is just again: from that which is necessary. For since they call upon God as Father, it is necessary that those who desire adoption, which are worthy of the Father, should act: and fourthly, since they have received countless goods, through the established price for them: that is the blood of Christ which was given as a price for those who had sold themselves to evil through sin. After these things, he commands to have a continuous fear throughout life: not the initial one, for this has a ensuing punishment, but perfect fear. For perfect fear always accompanies the holy ones, lest anything be lacking to them of what is fitting for the perfect. Consider how, when it has been said by Christ, "The Father judges no one, but has entrusted all judgment to the Son," (Jn. 5:22) Peter now says that the Father judges. To which we say that the Son can do nothing except what he sees the Father doing: for this is what Christ also said. Furthermore, this shows that it is inherent to the Holy Trinity: and that the divine operations are not divided among the persons we see in it: but there is both complete identity and a peaceful concord free from strife. Therefore, he said without distinction that the Father judges: as if it were truly and universally considered common to all, whatever another might say is divinely accomplished by one of the three. Moreover, since the Lord frequently calls the apostles sons, and said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven," (Mark 2:5) and to the woman who suffered from a flow of blood, "Daughter, your faith has made you well," (Mark 5:34) there is nothing obscure or absurd if he also calls this one the father of the offspring whom he generated through the sharing of holiness.
"In fear of turning." According to this limit of perfection, it was also said by the blessed David: "Fear the Lord, all you His saints, for there is nothing lacking to those who fear Him." (Ps. 38:10)
