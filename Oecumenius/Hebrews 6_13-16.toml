Of those who through faith inherited the promises, many have died, but they were kept safe for others; he only remembers Abraham, both because of the dignity of his person and because he especially was deemed worthy and attained the promises. And through this, he shows that one should not be faint-hearted, but should wait for God, having the habit not to hastily bring about the promised things, but through a long time.
“He swore by Himself.” When did God swear by himself? In those very words, in which he says, "By myself I have sworn." (Gen. 22:16) Perhaps also the word "Amen" could be considered a divine oath; for "Amen," truly "Amen," signifies nothing else but a confirmation of the truth; and what else could truth be but God? Therefore, when you see Christ saying, "Amen, amen, I say to you," understand that he swears by having no one greater than himself, and the "Amen" is an oath, just as the Father also swears. Yet some have thought that the Son swears to Abraham; for the Word swears, "Amen, I will bless you." For Scripture says that the angel spoke to Abraham. But nowhere do they say that the Father is an angel, but the Son is the angel of the great counsel.
"And so, having patiently." You see that the patience of Abraham accomplished something? He said that by being patient he obtained the promise, in order to show the great power of patience, and that it was not the promise alone that accomplished everything; but also patience.
"he attained the promise." And yet in the end, it says that all these, having seen them from afar and embraced them, did not receive the promises, so that they would not be made perfect apart from us. How then does he say here, "he attained the promise?" And we say, he did not speak about the same things. For the things here he has given to him, concerning which he now spoke, but those there, he keeps, concerning which he says at the end of the Epistle, "And the end of all their opposition." (Heb. 12:3) And the end of all opposition and dispute to confirm the things spoken by him is the oath. Both, however, the obtaining and the not yet obtaining, serve as encouragement to the faint-hearted; the one, that we also, if we endure patiently, will obtain; the other, that, since he has not yet obtained it, though perfected many years ago, we who are still struggling are not foolish because we have not yet obtained it.
“an end of all dispute.” And the conclusion of all contradiction and dispute to confirm what is said is the oath. For indeed many things are spoken and disputed on each side; but the oath, coming last and confirming, resolves all doubts.
