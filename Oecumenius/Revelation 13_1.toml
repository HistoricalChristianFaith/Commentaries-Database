In the vision before this, the prophetic evangelist saw a sign in heaven, and behold he says a red Dragon (Rev. 12:3). Now he tells us he saw coming up out of the sea a beast like a leopard. Then in the vision that follows he again sees another beast rising out of the earth (Rev. 13:11), having two horns like a lamb. So, therefore, he saw three beasts in all: the first in heaven, the second out of the sea, and the third out of the earth. But the first and the third are apparent to all; for the first is the ancient evil Dragon, the apostate and adversary of God the Almighty, Satan, and the third is the Antichrist. This middle beast, which now lies before us for observation, what is it? I think it comes after the apostate Dragon, Satan, and it holds the leading position among the rest of the demons; for many fell together. And it is clear from that passage that the divine Scripture declares the ruler of all the demons has been bound to the sea and to Tartarus, as was shown above (Rev. 9:14); perhaps metaphorically thus naming the commotion and disturbance that accompany them, indicating from what things and to where they have fallen, and that they are reserved for the judgment of the great day according to what is written (Jude 6).

For if this were not so, but it was perceptible in the sea and in Tartarus, how is it that before this it is recorded in the account that, having devised many schemes, he acted against the Lord and against his mother? Except that according to the literal historical sense, which must not be disregarded even itself, he has been assigned to Tartarus and the abyss.

This beast, then, is the second one. The one now before us has been introduced in the book of Job, engaging in dialogue with God, accusing Job, subjecting him to countless trials, yet saying that he has "walked before the face of heaven." (Job 1:7) And not only does the book of Job record him, but the Lord has made mention of him to John when addressing the Jews: "You are of your father the Devil, and you desire to do the desires of your father." (Jn. 8:44) That one was a murderer from the beginning, and in the truth he did not stand, because there is no truth in him. When he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own, for he is a liar and the father of it, the one who is now presented to us for viewing, the apostate Dragon, become their leader and ringleader of the revolt; just as the holy Abraham is proclaimed father of nations, having been made beforehand the source of their faith according to what was said to him, "I have made you the father of many nations." (Gen. 17:5) With these matters therefore clarified according to my view, let us return to the passage in question.

He says, I saw a beast rising out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on his horns ten crowns. He sees him coming up from the sea; for his rise and, as it were, his elevation are from the disturbed and unstable life of men, who have chosen him as their tyrant; and the ten horns plainly indicate to him a great dominion, just as the seven heads signify certain ploys and principles of deceit and constructions; for the numbers ten and seven are perfect numbers.

And there were crowns about his horns, showing him as ruler risen up against mankind, because we through deceit had voluntarily delivered ourselves to him.

And upon his head he says names of blasphemy. Properly said, upon his head; for he raves to himself and, as his own head, mocking God, stealing reverence from God and assigning it to himself.
