In the previous vision the holy Evangelist saw “a sign in heaven, and behold,” it says, “a red dragon.” But now he says that he saw “a beast rising out of the sea, like a leopard.” Moreover, in the following vision he sees “another beast which rose out of the earth,” and it had “two horns like a lamb.” Therefore, we have three beasts altogether, the first is in heaven, the second is from the sea, and the third is from the earth. Who the first and the third beast are is clear to everyone. The first is the dragon who was the author of evil, namely, Satan, who became apostate and exalted himself against God Almighty. The third is the antichrist. But this second beast who now lies before us in the vision, who is he? I think that he comes after the apostate dragon, that is, Satan who was the leader of the other demons—for many fell with Satan and were cast down to earth—and from this it is clear that the holy Scripture says that this leader of all the demons is condemned to the sea and to tartarus. And perhaps it speaks of him in this figurative way because of the disorder and turmoil in which he exists, recognizing also from whence he has fallen and into what condition he has come, and that “he is kept for the judgment of the great day,” as it is written. … But this second beast which now appears to us is introduced in the book of Job, conversing with God and seeking Job and bringing upon him many trials and even saying that he is come “walking to and fro upon the earth under heaven.” But it is not only the book of Job that speaks of him, but the Lord too makes mention of him when in the Gospel of John he says to the Jews, “You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father’s desires. He was a murderer from the beginning and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and as is his father.” He calls the apostate dragon the “father of the devil,” namely, of this one who is present in this vision. For [Satan] is “father” as their leader and the author of the apostasy, even as the holy Abraham was called “father of nations,” since he was progenitor of the faith before them, as it was said of to him,” I have made you the father of many nations.” “I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems upon his horns.” He saw him coming out of the sea. For him it is an ascent, since he is elevated from the troubled, unstable life of people who have elected him to be their master. The ten horns testify to his powerful lordship, even as the seven heads suggest his various cunning deceits and tricks. For the numbers ten and seven are perfect numbers. The diadems upon his horns reveal that he has become a powerful force against humankind, since through deception we have willingly given ourselves over to him. “And blasphemous names were upon his heads.” Rightly does it say “upon his heads,” for he rages against himself and his own head and is insulting to God. And stripping worship from God, he grants it to himself.
