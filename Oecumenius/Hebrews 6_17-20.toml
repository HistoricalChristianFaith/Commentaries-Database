It was necessary, therefore, he says, to believe in God who had promised without an oath, but since God wanted to do something more, he mediated the promise by an oath.
"to show the firmness of His counsel." He also came to us. For we are the heirs of the promise, being the seed of Abraham; and if we are the seed, then we are also heirs.
“He mediated with an oath.” See what he prepares. That the Son was thereafter the mediator of God and men (for he has also become a mediator in the incarnation); and then he mediated with the Father and with Abraham, confirming him with an oath; for the Word was he who both spoke to Abraham and swore. The meaning of the interpretation is well-founded, so that it may be thus. God, that is, the Word, wanting to show the unchangeable nature of those glorifying the Father, mediated with the Father and with Abraham with an oath, that is, he became a mediator in the oath. For through him, as the Word, God and the Father swore.
"that by two unchangeable things." Two things, both that God has promised, and that He has added an oath to the promise. For since among men the oath seems more trustworthy, on account of this He also added it Himself.
"In which it is impossible." In which, instead of "from which," from these two things, the promise is shown to be most trustworthy, and it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, just as He swore by us (although it is unworthy of Him to swear), so also understand the "from which" He learned what He suffered. For men also consider it more credible to come through experience.
"we might have a strong encouragement," That is, a great exhortation and urging.
"who have fled." To him, he says. "to hold,” let us have strong encouragementto lay hold to the hope set before us. From those, he says, that were said to Abraham, let us be faithful also to the things to come, and to the kingdom of heaven. For this is our hope, which now is set before us in expectation, but then will be realized, as it was said; From those things, this will be understood. There it was made true, that in these things we may believe. And that for this reason he swore then, that now we may believe concerning the things to come. For there was nothing else, he says, and the things then promised with oaths, or the future hope of the faithful.
"we have as an anchor," which stabilizes the wavering ships, and hope makes those who are shaken by temptations brave, committed, and patient.
"safe and committed." Not simply an anchor, but also safe and secure. For there is an anchor that does not keep the ship unshaken when it is smaller than it ought to be.
"which enters." In order that, he says, while we are still here, hope may enter into the kingdom of heaven, that is, so that we may already be in our hopes. See what hope does. It anticipates what is to come.
“enters into the inner sanctuary behind the curtain.” The inner part of the curtain is called heaven.
“where Jesus has entered as a forerunner on our behalf.” Having said that our hope enters into heaven, he confirms what has been said, trusting this by the facts. For Christ himself entered there; and not only did he enter, but he entered on our behalf. And where our forerunner has entered, there it is necessary for us also to enter. For the forerunner is the forerunner of those who follow; and the difference between the forerunner and those who follow is not very great, just as between John and Christ. Do not be disturbed, then; as long as we have not yet entered, we will enter where our forerunner is. The "on our behalf" is extended so that he may be called our forerunner. The fact that he entered in the flesh is on our behalf, so that we also, having flesh, may obtain entrance.
“Having become a high priest.” And this is a great encouragement, if indeed our high priest is above and much better than those among the Jews; first, in manner; for he is not according to their order, but according to the order of Melchizedek; then, in place and tabernacle; for he is above and in heaven; third, in the covenant; for it is upon greater and more perfect promises; likewise, in permanence; for he is eternal, and not temporary; lastly, in person; for he is the Son of God. Therefore, do not lose heart. And well is the term "having become," because it was according to the flesh that he became a high priest.
