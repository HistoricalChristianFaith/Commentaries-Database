And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place for her, so that there she might be nourished for one thousand two hundred and sixty days. Therefore, was the child saved from the Dragon's plot, while the woman was given over to destruction? Not only that, but she herself was also saved by fleeing into Egypt, which was a deserted place and free from Herod's plotting. And there she is said to have lived and wandered for one thousand two hundred and sixty days, which amount to about three and a half years, with a few days less. For it was probably this length of time that the Mother of God spent in Egypt, until the death of Herod, after which an angel's message again led them back to Judea.
