The breaking of the sixth seal accomplished our complete salvation: it destroyed death: it restored life: it robbed the conqueror of human beings of his crown, openly triumphing over him, as Scripture says: the Only-begotten “ascended on high”; “he took captivity captive, and he gave gifts to men.” 

What is the breaking of the sixth seal? The cross of the Lord and his death, which were followed by the resurrection and ascension in response to the prayers of all spiritual and sensible creation, “opening for us a new and living way,” the return from death to life through “the veil of his flesh.” All these benefits he effected not only for the living, but also for those who had gone before. For the Lord also “went” and “preached to those in Hades who had been disobedient,” according to the divine apostle Peter, and there, too, he saved believers, as Cyril also thinks. 

After this, he says, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon was turned into blood, and the stars of the sky fell to earth like a fig tree shedding its fruit when shaken by a gale: the vision clearly describes for us the miracles which took place at the cross—the earthquake and the turbulence of the earth, the darkness of the sun, and the changing of the full moon into blood. 

Quite accurately, he added the word full to the moon; for the moon was filled with light even though it was not quite a full moon on the day of crucifixion, and in its fullness it beheld the passion. This is what usually happens in the illuminated part during lunar eclipses. The prophet Joel, too, predicted that this would come about, saying, “The sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and wonderful day of the Lord.” 

The falling of the stars perhaps actually took place, but if not, the account symbolically means that the heavenly light ceased, and that it became completely dark. 

The sky vanished like a rolled scroll. By the sky he means the heavenly powers of the angels, who themselves, too, were shaken, since they were unable to bear the insult done to their master, in heaven as here on earth. They rushed around like a scroll rolled up and shaken. 

He says, And every mountain and island was removed from its place: he calls the regiments of the haughty demons mountains and islands, according to what Scripture says of them: “the mountains were being moved in the heart of the seas.” Again he says of the islands that they are lifted high and raised up by the vain folly of their attitude in the unstable and bitter distractions of this life. 

And the kings of the earth, he says, and the potentates and the generals and the rich and the strong, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains. And they called to the mountains and the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the presence of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb, because the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?” Again he calls the guilty demons kings and potentates and generals and the rich and the strong, since they have ruled over those upon earth through deceit and guile. The slaves and the free refer to those of the demons who are in power and those who are subject. 

That they hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains and even cried, Fall on us and hide us, is figurative. It symbolizes their attempts to escape the punishment being brought upon them by Christ. For if some unseen punishment and retribution was not being brought against them, what is the meaning of the saying in the prophet Isaiah spoken in the person of Christ, “I have trodden the wine-press alone, and from the nations no man was with me; I trod them underfoot in my anger and crushed them in my wrath, and I brought down their blood on to the earth”? And what is the meaning of the words of the abominable demons in Matthew, “What have you to do with us, Son of God? Have you come to torment us?” 

One could also suppose that these things recounted in the Revelation were the sufferings not only of demons but also of the lawless Jews who erected the cross for the Lord, when they were oppressed by the war against the Romans and became fugitives in the mountains and caves and holes of the earth, and on every side were afflicted by hardship and stress.
