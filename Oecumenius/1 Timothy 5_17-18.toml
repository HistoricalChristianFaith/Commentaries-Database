The elders who rule well are to be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching. For the Scripture says, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and, "The worker deserves his wages."

Who then are the ones who lead well, Christ declared. "The good Shepherd," he says, "lays down his life for the sheep." (Jn. 10:11)

are to be considered worthy of double honor. Paul calls the necessary provision an honor, or rather a contribution. "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain," and, "The worker deserves his wages."

those who labor in preaching. Preach, not the boastful kind, but that which has the power to nourish spiritually. But where now are those who say that the leader does not need words or teaching, but life? Let them now hear how Paul honors the word [λόγον], especially preaching. For even this, if from some other. For when the word is about doctrines, where then does life have power? And see the contrast to, "Do not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." For indeed, one who is threshing must be muzzled.

The worker deserves his wages. Even Christ speaks in accordance with the law. By wages, he means food, and by worker, he means the one who labors, namely that one who does not labor is unworthy of food. This, however, Paul says to teachers who do not labor in teaching.
