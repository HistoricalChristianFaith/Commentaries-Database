The arrangement [σύνταξις] of the speech returns from the last to the first. He says to him, The glory and the power belong to the one who loved us; for how could he not have loved, "who gave himself as a ransom for the life of the world?" (1 Tim. 2:6)

"and has washed us from our sins in His blood." For He Himself bore our handwritten record that was against us in the decrees; and He fastened it to the wood of His cross (Col. 2:14), stretching out our sins to His own death and freeing us by His blood from our offenses, "having subjected Himself to death, even death on a cross, (Philip. 2:8) to heal our disobedience.

"and has made us a kingdom." And who says that in becoming "priests to His God and His prophets" there is benefit for us? For it was deemed fitting for men to obtain these things, securing for us the future kingdom and bestowing upon us an unfading glory even in the present time. For to "wash us from our sins in His own blood" is a greater and more marvelous gift, worthy of the divine grace. Moreover, that those who have offered nothing beforehand should become "priests of God and prophets" is a gift of such a kind.
