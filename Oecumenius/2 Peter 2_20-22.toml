For if, after having fled from the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and overcome, the latter end has become worse for them than the beginning. For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to its own vomit, and a pig, having washed, to her rolling in the mud.
"For if, after having fled." In the present discourse, Peter strives to establish two things: that it is necessary for the one who is overcome to serve the one by whom he is overcome; and that those who, after the recognition of the Truth, embrace again the former things, fall into worse conditions than the evil things they previously experienced. He also adds a proverb for support. Therefore, the entire discourse should be arranged in this way: For if, after the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they have fled from the pollutions of the world, and are again entangled and overcome by them, they certainly serve them, and in their servitude they experience worse things than before the knowledge, greatly aided by our adversary Satan, so that they may be dragged down to worse in repayment for their former termination from evil deeds. Therefore, the Apostle also says that since this happens to them, that they sing a retractation of evils, it would have been better for them not to have known the truth at all than to be captured by worse things after they having known it.
For since a dog returns to its own vomit is more abominable. For what nature had hated, and thus had compelled it to reject, this again having in delight, and as if eating those things that corrupt, and as if ejected through a miscarriage of nature, is more abominable. And the pig again seeking to roll in the mud, if it does this, will appear dirtier than the previous filth.
