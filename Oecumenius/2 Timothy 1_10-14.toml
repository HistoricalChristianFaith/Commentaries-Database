Now revealed through the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel, for which I was appointed a preacher and an apostle and a teacher of the Gentiles. For this reason I suffer as I do, but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day. Hold to the pattern of sound teaching that you have heard from me, in faith and love that are in Christ Jesus. Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.

Already long ago it was prefigured that we would be saved, but now it has been revealed through the incarnation of our Savior God. For such is the will of God, that the world should be saved through faith, now and not at another time, it has now been revealed.

who abolished death. To the one who forgives sin, and granted resurrection.

life and immortality to light. That is, revealing. The word is worthy of life.

Paul says, through the Gospel. For through it, both eternal life and resurrection have been made clear.

for which I was appointed. First, he says what is, then he also implies this: You must also go to the Gentiles. Moreover, he also makes the statement more credible.

For this reason I suffer as I do. What then is that reason? Because I am a messenger and an Apostle. As if he were saying: I am not being overcome as a criminal and dragged to prison.

but I am not ashamed. For the greatest glory is to suffer something for Christ. Do you see how Paul prepares the disciple for afflictions? You will show that if someone does not fear to be ashamed, the danger itself will be easier with the help of Christ.

that he is able to guard my deposit. He calls the faith a deposit [παραθήκην], which Christ entrusted [παρέθετο] to him to preach. Either Paul means the believers, whom God entrusted to him to teach, or those whom he entrusted to God. "Behold, I entrust you to the Lord." (Acts 20:32) Among those entrusted is also Timothy. Therefore, Paul says: "for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day."

Hold to the pattern of sound teaching. Like an image, likeness, imitation. "of sound teaching," those concerning faith and life. As I suppose concerning others, they are not sound.

that you have heard from me. He did not assign to the disciple only epistles to be made, but also gave instructions orally in his presence. For thus he acted in all things as well. Therefore, let no one think that anything is lacking in the epistles, because they do not discuss everything.

in faith and love. For the words and teachings came into being in faith and love given to him through Christ.

Guard the good deposit. Paul calls the faith and the care of the Church entrusted to him a deposit. Then he shows that human strength is not enough to guard so much. For there are many obstacles. Therefore, he indicates the way of guarding. "Guard," he says, "through the Holy Spirit." As if he said: Strive to have the Spirit abiding in you, and do not cast it away through bad conduct, and you will guard the deposit. "For unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain; unless the Lord watches over the city, the guards stand watch in vain." (Psalm 127:1)

Disadvantages of the transmission of divine dogmas.
