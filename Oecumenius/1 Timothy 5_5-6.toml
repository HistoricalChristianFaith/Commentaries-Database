But the widow who is truly alone has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day. But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living.

But the widow who is truly alone. Since Paul ordered that those who are truly widows to be honored, he now says what kind of women are truly widows, characterizing them in an explanation. He says she is isolated, both from children and from descendants.

has hoped in God and continues in supplications and prayers. Therefore, this is the true widow, who hopes in God and waits with prayers. For since she is abandoned of human help, it is reasonable that she turns to God.

But the one who lives in luxury has died while still living. For many choose widowhood in order to act with greater authority in things that are not proper, Paul says: "But the one who lives in luxury," that is, the one living in indulgence, "though living, has died." How? For life seems to be the life now. The eternal life has been lost. Therefore, she has died through sin, as far as eternal life is concerned.
