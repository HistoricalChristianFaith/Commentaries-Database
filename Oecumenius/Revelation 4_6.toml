Also before the throne there is a sea of glass, like crystal. The vision of the sea represents the multitude.

But what about glass and crystal? The pure ones. And it is shown to be free from every stain by the holy fathers concerning God, who are as numerous as the sea (Isa. 10:22; Rom. 9:27). For Daniel says that "thousands upon thousands stood before Him, and ten thousand times ten thousand served Him." (Dan. 7:10) And being such in number, all are pure, resembling glass and crystal.

One cannot say that those sacred creatures were exactly like the ones that the prophet Ezekiel was deemed worthy to behold in his vision (Ez. 10:13). Each of them had four faces and eight wings, and they were accompanied by certain wheels called "Gelgel", which were also many-eyed, much like these creatures. Here, however, each had a single face, though different from one another, and six wings. And those were the Cherubim, for that is how they are called in Ezekiel. These others, as I believe, are the Seraphim, shown in Isaiah the prophet (Isa. 6:2), although Isaiah neither mentioned any faces for them nor described them in detail, only that they covered their faces with their wings; not that they had many eyes, but that they had six wings.

But what was meaning of these great things shown to the evangelist? Was there some deception among certain Jews? That God, who governs the holy orders in heaven and dwells within them alone, has withdrawn from and neglected those on earth because of the transgression committed in Adam. Therefore, they said to Isaiah, "Why have we fasted, and you did not notice? We humbled our souls, and you did not pay attention." (Isa. 58:3) But such a deception came upon them from a certain written passage that says, "Lord, in heaven, your mercy and your truth reach to the clouds." (Ps. 35:6) As it shows that divine providence proceeds by disregarding the sins committed below on earth, the vision therefore reveals to the evangelist that God's providence extends through all things, both overseeing those in Heaven and those who have come to dwell on earth.

And this is symbolized by the four holy living creatures surrounding the divine throne. For every perceptible and earthly body is composed of the four elements: fire, earth, air, and water.
