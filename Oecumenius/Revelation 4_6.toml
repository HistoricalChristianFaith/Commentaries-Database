The vision of the sea indicates the multitude, the glass and crystal indicate the purity and utter cleanliness of the holy spirits who are around God, who are as a sea in multitude. For Daniel says, “A thousand thousands stood before him, and ten thousand times ten thousand served him.” And, although they be so many, they are all pure, similar to glass and crystal.
