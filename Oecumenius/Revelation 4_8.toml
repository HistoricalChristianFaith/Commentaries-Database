Them being full of eyes characteristics demonstrates God's all-encompassing watchfulness over them.

And they had no rest day or night; this does not mean that they live a life of pain and misery, unable to find relief from work and pressing necessity, but rather that they never cease praising God, delighting continually in their melody to Him.

The term "holy" being repeated seven times is a frequent and unceasing form of allusion. For the number seven is often handed down by divine Scripture; for example, "the barren woman bore seven children, and the many became weak through their offspring," (1 Sam.2:5) and "the seven eyes of the Lord watch over the entire earth," (Zech. 4:10) and "the righteous man is delivered seven times from distress." (Prov. 24:16)

He says, "who was, and is, and is to come." Through these, the Holy and venerable Trinity is revealed, as was stated earlier. There is nothing wrong with saying now, "for writing the same things is not burdensome to me," (Phil. 3:1) and the divine apostle has clearly demonstrated this to those who encounter it as certain.

The Father, who is, is named by Moses. For he says to him, "I AM THE ONE WHO IS [ἐγώ εἰμι ὁ ὤν]." (Ex. 3:14) And concerning the Son, it is said to the evangelist, "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God." (Jn. 1:1) And he says that the Holy Spirit is the one who is to come, for He always visits the souls worthy of receiving Him.
