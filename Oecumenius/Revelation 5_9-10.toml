“And they sang a new song.” It was new because it was sung to that God who had become flesh, for this song had formerly never been offered, until the incarnation. And what was the song? “You are worthy,” it says, you who were slain for us and who by your blood did acquire an inheritance from the many nations under heaven, to grant this salvation to humanity. And with very good reason he said “from tribe and tongue and people and nation.” For while he did not gain all nations—for many have died in unbelief—yet he acquired from every nation those worthy of salvation. And the prophet said something similar: “Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you will inherit [some] from among all the nations,” not to be sure, “all the nations.” And he made “them kings and priests for our God, and they will reign upon earth.” In addition to the faithful servants of Christ who are kings and leaders of the churches, perhaps you will also be able to understand the “kings” in this passage as those who have ruled their passions and have not been ruled by them, and the “priests” as those who have offered their own bodies as “living sacrifice, holy and pleasing to God,” as the Scripture says.
