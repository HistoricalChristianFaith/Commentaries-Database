There is fire, for this reason, that God may appear more fearsome to those who were delivering the law. "And to darkness and gloom." Darkness and gloom signify the shadow of the Old Testament. For if those were figures, it is evident that until the truth came, the figures were obscure, while it was not known what they signified. Moreover, darkness also signifies the invisibility of God. "and to darkness," he says, "under his feet." (Ps. 17:10)
"and a storm." By the word, storm, he excites them when they were sluggish. Indeed, the storm is a twisting of the wind.
And the trumpet, however, as if in the presence of the king; for this will be in the second coming.
"and the voice of words." For Moses spoke, and God answered. Indeed, it was necessary for the voice of God to be formed (Ex. 19:19), so that the lawgiving would be worthy of faith, and it would not be thought to be from Moses, through whom God was about to bring the law.
"For they could not bear what was commanded." He stated the reason for the excuse, because they could not bear what was being defined, that is, what was being commanded or said. Indeed, they said to Moses: "Speak to us, and let not God speak to us." (Ex. 20:19)
"Even if a beast touched the mountain." Such was the terror that if the beast touched the mountain, it was stoned.
"And so terrifying was the sight."It wishes to show that the New Testament also excels in relation to the Old. For indeed, even if the Old had nothing of this kind that the New has, it was to be feared in some way; however, the New, having perfection, is gentle and without terror.
"that Moses said, "I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.." This was also said by the one who was about to enter into darkness.
