"By faith, he kept the Passover." For Moses said: "Mark the doorposts so that you may be saved," (Ex. 12:23) and they believed that they were to be saved. Indeed, they believed that they would be saved through the blood of the lamb, he says, and they achieved this. Therefore, how will you not believe even more that you are to be saved through the blood of Christ, and you will be saved from all who lie in wait for you?
"and the sprinkling of blood." He called the sprinkling of blood the anointing of the doorposts, so that the Destroyer angel would not touch them. This was, however, a type of the blood of the Lamb of God. For through His blood we drive away the destroyer Satan.
