After this the blessed evangelist depicts for us the nature of the worms in a way which is both subtle and fearful. In each of the statements about them, one might wonder at the accuracy of the account; for he did not say that they had lions’ teeth and scorpions’ tails and human faces, but that there was in each a sort of image disclosing a figurative picture, not the truth. 

By such means, therefore, either their fearsomeness and amazing power is indicated, or he has truly sketched their shape. 

He says, They have as their king the angel of the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek Apolluon. The name has either been invented to correspond with the aforementioned events of the vision, or perhaps not only are there “ministering spirits, sent to serve those who are to inherit salvation,” according to the divine apostle, but also spirits sent to punish those who deserve to be punished, rather like the angel who in a single night struck the hundred and eighty-five thousand of the Assyrians; and those who destroyed by fire the five cities of Sodom. 

He says, The first woe has passed; two woes are still to come. Woe is the jargon denoting great distress and indicates present and future afflictions. So he says the one punishment has already been mentioned; two will be mentioned later.
