He said that the new covenant is better. And this indicates, he says, the difference of the priests. He said that everything has changed. Therefore, he speaks of the reason for the change, and he says, "For annulment occurs of the preceding command.” Therefore, an annulment occurs when the preceding commandment is in force, that is, of the older law. Not simply, but then when it was found to be weak and unprofitable. Since there is no fault, what need is there for the change? Therefore, he says, this is also the law. For this, the preceding commandment has been annulled due to weakness and uselessness.
For the law was not able to produce any perfection in virtue. For it only said, "Do this," and "Do not do that," and it was no longer able to strengthen and assist in bringing about what was said, which now happens to us through the Spirit.
"but is a certain introduction." It is done in common.
"of a greater hope." For the law had hope, but not such as that which was introduced. For those who were observing the law hoped to possess the land. "For you shall eat the good things of the land," (Is. 1:19) but the hope through Christ gives the kingdom of heaven, and the nearness to stand before God, and to serve Him with angels.He said above (Heb. 4:6): Entering into the inner part of the veil; but now: Through which we draw near to God, he says; for the hope that is with him leads us to the divine throne, and stands with the Cherubim.
"because the matter was not done without an oath." And so much, he says, the hope has been greatly improved, insofar as Christ has become a priest without an oath. For the oath indicates the unchangeable nature of his being a high priest forever.
"For they indeed became priests without an oath." Then, from the lesser, the comparisons of the priests among the Jews and our High Priest.For the legal priests, he says, were made priests without an oath; for God never found it necessary to swear: "You shall be a priest according to the law." But Christ, with an oath, made by the one who said to Him, as it were, by God; for God spoke through David: "You are a priest," in a certain new way; for He is not according to Aaron, but according to Melchizedek.
"by the one who said to him." As through God. For God spoke through David, "So much better is Jesus." "For," he says, "they indeed became priests without an oath, but Christ has become a high priest with an oath. And this would not have happened, he says, if the difference were not great. Therefore, there is also a great difference between the new and the old."
"the Guarantor [Έγγυος]." Like a guarantor [ἐγγυητὴς], Mediator.
"And indeed, there were many." And according to another, he says, the high priest is greater than us, not only because of the oath, but also because he is immortal.
"because they were prevented by death." For it is through death and change, namely of the priest.
"from continuing." in the priesthood, namely, "permanently." Lacking succession, forever, "Therefore." Since he always living. "always." Not only in this age, but also in the future. For this is what they want entirely and completely.
"those who come to God." Through the faith that is in Him. For whoever believes in the Son, comes to the Father certainly; for he himself is the way to the Father, and whoever takes hold of this, dwells there.
"always living." Therefore, He saves completely, because He always lives. Furthermore, He saves because He intercedes for those who approach God the Father.
"to intercede for them." Concerning Christ, as He is according to the flesh, this humble word has been said. However, when I say according to the flesh, I do not mean division. Far from it: but I know Him to be worshiped indivisibly, without confusion in one hypostasis along with His flesh. But what does it mean, "to intercede for them "? For example, He asks his Father on our behalf. For when he called him a priest, it is characteristic of a priest to ask on behalf of the people; for this reason, he said, “to intercede." That this has been said for this reason is evident. For He who raises the dead by His own authority, forgives sins, does not need the Father to save, as if He were powerless to save by His own power.

What he says: "to intercede," take as what is said: "We have an advocate with the Father." (1 Jn. 2:1) From His very incarnation, He asks and intercedes with the Father that He may have mercy on us.
