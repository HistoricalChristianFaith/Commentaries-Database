The end of all things is at hand. Therefore, be sober and watchful in prayer. Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaint. As each one has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of the diverse grace of God. If anyone speaks, let him speak as if it were the words of God; if anyone ministers, let him do it as with the ability which God supplies, that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
The end, that is, completion, consummation or the end of all the prophets is said to be imminent: however, the true word is Christ, for He is the perfection of all. And not as the Greeks rave, who indeed say that pleasure is the end, like Epicurus5, while others say wisdom or contemplation or virtue6. Therefore, since perfection has come in Christ, Peter also says, having been made conformable to this perfection, present yourselves in all things without defect in sobriety, in vigilance for prayers (for the prayer of the sober or the watchful, and not of those who are held by the drunkenness of worldly things), in love for one another. Paul, however, says that this is the change of the law (Rom. 13:10): here indeed that it may cover sins. For mercy towards one's neighbor makes God merciful to us. This mercy would never proceed to what is righteous, unless it is out of great love. But where he mentions love, he also adds that those who are endowed with love, namely hospitality, which he commands to be shown without complaint; for this is the essence of true love.
But also concerning the gifts that are available to each, they should be shared with the brother who has none: for example, let the one who has the discourse of teaching (for this is what it means by the words of God) generously provide for the one who is in need. Let the one who has received the supply of food give to the one who has none: not with a small spirit, but as the power of the expenses given as God permits. Furthermore, he says, I exhort you that in all things, whether among the Gentiles or even in your works, that God may be glorified. And when he had spoken thus, since he saw that some were offended because of the afflictions brought upon them, as if a promise of life had been placed in the law from all foreign troubles for those who serve the Lord: indeed, previously when he had made a statement about servants, he gave a brief exhortation about these things: but now he has used a more elaborate discourse and says: Beloved, (1 Peter 4:12) immediately signifying by this name that these things do not happen to those who are hated, but to those who are greatly loved. However, do not be surprised, that is, do not marvel, do not consider it strange (1 Peter 4:12) from the friends of God. Then, where he also said that afflictions are a fiery trial, (1 Peter 4:12) he shows that they are tempted upon them as a test: but the trial makes desirable the one who is tested, just as gold and silver. Moreover, by adding that it is more blessed for all these, namely, those who suffer these things to be conformed to the Teacher Christ: and now to be dishonored with him, so that they may be glorified together with him in the future age, when he has subjected the whole world to himself.
"love covers a multitude." This means persevering and enduring and stretched out over a long period.
"As each one has received a gift." For whatever is placed in us, and of which we are masters to do, can be an accusation of injustice in all these matters. For it is not only in the possession of money, but also in the abundance of other natural goods that one is obliged to give to the one who does not have: so that one may give to the needy.
