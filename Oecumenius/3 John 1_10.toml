If the principle of the gospel is that we should not return evil for evil, what is the meaning of this warning? I think that the answer is that we are not to return evil for evil when the injury has been done to us personally and to no one else. But when it affects others, we must heed what Paul says to Elymas, who was corrupting the ways of the Lord: “You son of the devil.”
