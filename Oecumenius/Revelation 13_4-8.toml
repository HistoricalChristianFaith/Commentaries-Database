After he had outwitted Israel, those who had been caught by him contrived a fair address to him, saying, Who is like the beast and who is able to make war against him? 

When all had been defeated and had fallen beneath his feet, he says, And he was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words. By whom was it given? By those people who had been thoroughly deceived and had worshiped him; for boastful talk is a mark of arrogance. For what is more arrogant than saying, “I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of heaven I will place my throne”? And a little later he says, “I shall be like the Most High,” as Isaiah satirizes him. These are plainly blasphemies against God. 

He says, And he was given authority to do this for forty-two months. Previously we accepted the forty-two months as a short time. For all time is short, even if it seems to be very long, when compared to ages of eternity. 

He says, And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling and those who dwell in heaven. Some of the rebel’s blasphemies against God have already been mentioned. By the dwelling of God he means the holy angels, because God dwells among them. For if it is said of human beings, “I will live in their midst and move among them,” what [less] could be said of the heavenly powers, than that they have God living among them? 

And he was given authority over every tribe and people and tongue and nation, and all who dwell in the world will worship him. I said earlier that he had received his authority from those human beings who had willingly submitted to his deadly power. Rightly then does he say that all who dwell in the world will worship him. Apart from the God-fearing Israel, all the rest of the human race were idolaters, and, though even Israel shared in this, every other race and tribe of people was found to have worshiped the wretch. 

Every one, he says, whose name has not been written in the book of life in heaven, which has been sealed since the foundation of the world. The vision has already defined this with great accuracy. For although it said that all who dwell in the world had worshiped the rebellious Devil, there were a few who were untainted by his worship, both from among the gentiles and from Israel, such as Job, his four friends, Melchisedek, and the holy prophets of Israel, and those who were distinguished in the Old Testament for their piety. He says that all had worshiped him, except for those who on account of their worship of God and the exactness and purity of their way of life are written in heaven and are protected by God. 

This is the meaning of the sealing of the scroll. About this scroll the Lord says to his holy disciples, according to blessed Luke, “Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.”
