They went out from us, but they were not of us: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us; but they went out, that it might be revealed that they were not all of us. But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things. I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and that no lie is of the truth.
"They went out from us." However, John adds this, having laid down or started nothing for the explanation of the speech: I say, as if John had asked himself: And where do these “antichrists” (1 Jn. 2:18) come from? Then he would have added, They went out from us. Since it ought to have been done this way, he does not do this, but rather in a confused manner, perhaps showing through the confusion of speech the distress John had concerning them. But why are those who went out from the Lord's disciples called antichrists? So that they could be regarded as trustworthy by those who were being led astray, as if they were from the disciples, and they made their preaching in accordance with the teacher's and instructor's opinion: nor did they have a completely contrary preaching. Therefore, it is said of them, "They went out from us." For when they became disciples, they departed from the truth and found their own blasphemy. It must be understood, however, from where these antichrists came, so that the statement may be clearer.
"but they were not of us." That is, concerning the sort of those who are saved: for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But now it has happened to them that they became revealed, that is, it became known to all that they were completely alienated from us, and joined to those who were not of us. For there are among them some who were never of us, to whom they have joined themselves, who have went out from us. Because of these things, John said, “not all are of us.” For among us, who were domestic and familiar, others followed those who were external to us: choosing rather to live self-indulgently in the manner of the pagans than moderately and honorably with us.
Having said this, lest it seem to him that he alone attributes knowledge of these things and thereby becomes arrogant against the faithful, as if he alone knew them, he adds: "But you have an anointing." As if to say: But why do I tell you these things as if you were ignorant? There is no ignorance of these matters among you. For you have received the sacred anointing through holy baptism, and through this, the divine Spirit, who leads you into all truth. (Jn. 16:19)
Since this is the case, you know that I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it. What are these? The last hour, the coming of the Antichrist (1 Jn. 2:18), that all things are full of lies. Therefore, because lies abound, he says: I also say that many antichrists have come. For if Christ is the truth, whom you also know, you have the truth in yourselves, certainly since the liar is contrary to the truth or Christ, he is an antichrist.
