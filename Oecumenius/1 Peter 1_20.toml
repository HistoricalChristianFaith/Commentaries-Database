Christ existed in earlier times and even before the foundation of the world, when he was hidden by divine providence until the right time should come. He was manifested to the prophets who did their best to examine these matters, as Peter has already mentioned, and now he is even more manifest, since he has been fully and perfectly revealed. Furthermore, Peter adds that he has been revealed for our sake.
