This is not to say that these are those holy living creatures whom Ezekiel the prophet was deemed worthy to see. Each of those had both four faces and eight wings, and they sidled along on wheels called Gelgel, even if those were many-eyed just like these. Here, each had one face, even if it was different, and six wings. And those were the cherubim, so called by Ezekiel, but these, as I surmise, are the seraphim, who were shown to the blessed Isaiah, even though Isaiah did not mention that they had any faces, but only that they covered their faces with their wings, nor did he mention a multitude of eyes, but that they were six-winged. 

It is important to explain the symbolism of the visions shown to the evangelist. There was an error among some of the Jews, who held that while God made provision for the holy orders in heaven and loved to dwell only among them, he stood aloof and was not concerned about those on the earth because of the transgression of Adam. That is why they said in Isaiah’s words, “Why have we fasted and you did not see it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you took no notice?” Their error arose from a scriptural text which said, “Lord in heaven, your mercy and your truth reach up to the clouds,” as though the divine providence deemed it unworthy to proceed downwards on account of the sins on earth. 

So the vision shows the evangelist that the providence of God extends through all things, both providing for those in heaven and condescending to those on earth, and this is the symbolism of the four holy living creatures which are around the divine throne. For since every perceptible and earthly body is composed of the four elements—fire, earth, air, and water—each of the living creatures represents one of these. The lion represents fire, on account of the heat and the passion of the animal; the ox represents the earth, because the ox’s work is on the earth; the man represents the air, for man is a heavenly creature and high in the air on account of the subtlety of his mind; the eagle represents water, for birds have their origin in water. 

They are seen around the throne of God, since those who are signified by the living creatures, that is, those on earth, are deemed worthy of his concern and providence. Their being many-eyed represents the all-surveying oversight of God over them. 

And they have no rest by day or by night. He says this not because they continually spend a painful and burdensome life, so that they are unable to have any respite from toil or from demanding obligation, but because they never desist from giving praises to God, and from reveling in their songs to him. 

Their saying holy seven times signifies often and incessantly. The number seven has been handed down many times in Holy Scripture, such as “she who was barren gave birth to seven, and she who had many children grew weak,” and “the seven eyes of the Lord which watch over all the earth,” and “the righteous man” set free “seven times from his distress.” 

He says, who is and who was, and is coming: the holy and august Trinity is indicated here, as was said earlier. But it does no harm to say it again now, for “to write the same things is not irksome to me, but it is safe for those who read,” the divine apostle declared. He who is was the name given to the Father by Moses. For he says to him, “I am who I am.” He who was is said about the Son by the evangelist himself, saying, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” By he who is coming he means the Holy Spirit, for he always visits the souls who are worthy to receive him.
