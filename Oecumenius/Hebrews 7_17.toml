"For it is testified." And that, he says, Christ has not become a priest according to the law of a fleshly commandment. The testimony indicates the Father; for the Father testifies to him, saying, a priest according to the order of Melchizedek. For if he says, according to the law he was made, he ought to have been made according to the order of Aaron.But now, since it is written according to the order of Melchizedek, it is evident that he is not made according to the law, but according to a different, more divine manner.
