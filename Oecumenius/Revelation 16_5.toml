And I heard, he says, the angel of the waters speaking. Almighty is God and foreseeing of His creatures and sufficient for the benefit of all, so that there is no need for any collaborator for this; for where the mere willing is the sole work accomplished and where by the impulse of the will all things have been made existent, how could there be need of one who assists and partakes in the conferring of benefits? But since God is good and desires also to show kindness to the holy angels through assistance given to those who pray, for by aiding one who is in need one benefits not so much that other as oneself, and because there was no one among the angelic powers who was in want and in need of assistance from another, God appointed that those on earth who are in every respect needy of good should be provided for by the holy angels.

Therefore, in previous passages (see Rev. 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14) we recognized angels as the guardians of the churches, and Daniel the wisest wrote that Michael, the chief among angels, watches over the tribe of the Jews. (Dan. 12:1) And now the Revelation recounts to us an angel appointed over the waters. For the earthly creation, composed of the four elements, has the air conjoined with fire, earth, and water. For some among the heavens wished to be fashioned into a fifth kind of body, which they say it is ethereal and circular in its motion; the three elements, fire and earth and air, are lavishly diffused for the purposes of respiration and other common uses. That indeed fire, though the element is said to saturate the whole ether, is abundant and self-sufficient upon the earth, and dwells in its cavities and stones; and already some draw fire from waters in vessels lined with glass, whenever, when lifted up toward the sun, they become mirrors facing it.

But the earth is common to all, a mother and a tomb and a secure dwelling. Yet the water is not abundant for everyone: there is drinkable water in springs, fountains, wells and rivers, and the aerial water retained in the clouds in the heights gives us timely rain by divine command and nourishes every living thing on the earth. Since therefore water is not abundant for all, one of the holy angels has been appointed over it, so that it may be provided sufficient and adequate for the needs of those who lack it, which indeed often, through our wickedness, cuts off and causes scarcity, famines and the plagues that follow them.

Of this angel, appointed by God's providence over the waters, I heard him say: Righteous are you, who are and who was and who are holy. That "who are," then, shows the unending nature of God; and that "who was," the one without beginning; and He "who is" holy is righteous in all things through all things.
