He says, Then I saw another beast rising up from the earth, from where all human beings have their origin. For the Antichrist is a human being, “whose advent occurs by the action of the Devil,” as Paul in his great wisdom believes. 

It had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a serpent. He rightly said not that it had the horns of a lamb, but like those of a lamb, and he did not say that it was a serpent, but that it spoke like a serpent. Since the wretch pretends to be the Christ (though he is not), he has given him horns like those of a lamb. And although he tells of all kinds of profanity like the Devil (but he is not the Devil), he did not say that he was a serpent but that he spoke like a serpent. This being so, the account retained the image in the vision, and attributes to him the form not of a lamb, but like a lamb, nor of a serpent, but like a serpent. For Christ is said to be a lamb, and the Devil is said to be a serpent, but he was neither the one nor the other. He says, It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence. That is, it becomes the successor of the Devil’s authority, and it teaches everyone to worship the one whose mortal wound had been healed. 

This has already been mentioned earlier on, and now we need only to notice it. For when he said that it exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence (and he has called the red serpent the first of all, which the vision showed depicted in heaven), lest anyone should think that he is now speaking of it as the one which had received the authority of the first beast, he says, I am not speaking of that which is the first of all, but of the later one, which comes before the Antichrist. The vision showed this one rising out of the sea like a leopard (Rv 13.1–2). For it was this one’s mortal wound which was healed, as was said earlier. 

And it works great signs, so as to make fire come down from heaven to earth in the sight of human beings. The working of signs and wonders by the operation of the Devil is also attested by the apostle, for after saying, “whose advent occurs by the action of Satan,” he adds, “with all power and with pretended signs and wonders.”
