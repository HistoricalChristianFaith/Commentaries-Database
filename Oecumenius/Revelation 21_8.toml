quote='''
But as for the cowardly and unbelieving and these and those, there will be a portion in the lake of fire. He calls cowardly those who are weak in every good work through voluntary misery.

And he says false to all liars. He did not say to the liars but to the false ones, that is, to those who act against nature and, having falsified the natural beauty of virtue, wear counterfeit faces of depravity. And that that fire will be the second death has been said among those who have reached it.
