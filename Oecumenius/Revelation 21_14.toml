And the wall of the city, he says, had twelve foundations; for Christ, whom we have thought of as a wall, rests upon the preaching of the apostles, and upon them has gone forth as a "chief cornerstone," (1 Peter 2:6; Isa. 28:16; Eph. 2:20) as it is written.

And upon them, that is, upon those foundations, are twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb. He has barely revealed the riddle, plainly saying that he calls the apostles the gates and foundations of the holy city of the church; by whose teaching may we all abide, turning away from the profane babblings of the false knowledge of heretics; by the grace of Christ our teacher and chief shepherd; to whom be glory forever. Amen.
