“The wall of the city,” it says, “had twelve foundations.” Christ, whom we consider to be the wall, rests upon the preaching of the apostles, and he is placed upon them as “a precious cornerstone,” as it is written. On them, that is, upon the foundations, are the “twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.” He has clearly revealed the symbol, saying explicitly that the apostles are the gates and the foundations of the holy city, the church. “Avoiding the profane chatter of what is falsely called knowledge” by the heretics, may we all remain in their teaching by the grace of Christ, our Guide and chief Shepherd, to whom be glory forever. Amen.
