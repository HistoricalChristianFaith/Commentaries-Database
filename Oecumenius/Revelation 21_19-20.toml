And he says the foundations of the wall of that city are adorned with every precious stone. As for the foundation of the wall, the Lord is a wall, as has been said many times. We have spoken of the holy apostles in the foregoing. As though Christ rests in their teaching and has mounted upon them according to the promise given, in which he also says, "and behold, I am with you all the days until the end of the age." (Matt. 28:20) Therefore these are the foundations, that is, the apostles, in every excellence; for the precious stones denote excellence, they are adorned; for by deed they became pure through the preaching and through the struggles for Christ and by their favorable nature toward him even unto blood.

And if anyone will wish to be precise even about the stones, such a kind of vision may be found, but a little from above will be enough. The high priests according to the law of Moses were variously attired with a kind of tunic and a shoulder-covering and a mitre and a breastplate, girded and surrounded by other things (see Ex. 29:5-6), both awe and astonishment, moreover exhibiting a secret symbolism through their form. And among them was also the saying of judgment (see Ex. 28:15), which was carried upon the shoulder-covering by a woven work in various fashion. The form of the saying was a double breastplate, a small and square thing (Ex. 28:16), in which twelve stones were set in four rows with the names of the sons of Israel; some of these stones indeed were also placed in the foundations of the wall there, others were corner-stones and not placed in those. For in the breastplate of judgments there are borne eight stones corresponding to the foundations there: jacinth; sapphire; emerald; sardius; chrysolite; beryl; topaz; amethyst; and four of the stones in the foundations are not numbered with those in the breastplate of judgment. They are these: sardonyx; chrysoprase; hyacinth.
