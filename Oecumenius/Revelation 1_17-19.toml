It is the habit of the holy prophets when seeing a vision to be struck with amazement and to exhibit human weakness. Divine matters far exceed human affairs, and surpass them in ways past all comparison. We know that this is what Joshua the son of Nun felt when he saw the commander-in-chief of the battle-line of the Lord, as did Daniel, “the man of desires,” in the visions seen by him. 

Therefore I fell at his feet as though dead, says the evangelist, struck with amazement by the sight. But he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Do not fear. Saint John would not have been able to stay alive as a result of being struck by the vision, if the saving right hand of the Son of God had not touched him, which could effect so many marvels with a single touch.

And he says to me, I am the first and the last, as if he said, “I am the one who came to be with you in the flesh for the salvation of all of you at the end of the age, though I am the first and ‘the first-born of all creation.’ So how can you suffer any evil from my appearance? For if while living and being a fountain of life for you I died and again came to life after trampling on death, how can you who have life because of me and my vision, ever become dead? 

And if I also have the keys of Death and of Hades, so that those whom I wish I may put to death or preserve alive, and if I could send them down to Hades and bring them up in accordance with what has been written about me, and mine are, as the prophet says, “the ways of escape from death,” I would not dispatch my worshipers and disciples to an untimely death.” 

Since, therefore, he will not die, he says, write what you have seen, both what is and what is going to take place. In saying what is, he means both past and present events, and in saying, what is going to take place, he means future events. Of the things seen in the vision by the holy one, some had already taken place. Even if he had gone back as far as he could, these events would not have preceded the beginning. So he mentioned what is; but the argument will go on to show some events that were past and some which were still to take place.
