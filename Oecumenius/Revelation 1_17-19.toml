It is customary for the holy prophets to see a vision and be struck with awe, revealing human weakness; and how much the divine surpasses the human and excels it with incomparable differences. This we also know from Joshua the son of Nave, when he saw the chief commander of the Lord's army (Jos. 1:9), and Daniel the man of desires in the visions that appeared to him. (Dan. 10:11; 8:17)

"I," therefore, "fell at his feet as though dead," says the evangelist, struck with awe at the vision.

"And he placed his right hand upon me, saying, 'Do not be afraid.'" The holy John could not have survived the terror if he had not leaned upon the saving right hand of the Son of God, which alone worked the greatest wonders by touch; and he says to me,

"I am the first and the last." Thus he spoke: "I am the one who, at the end of the ages, came to dwell with you in the flesh for the salvation of all of you, I am the first and the firstborn of all creation (Col. 1:15). How then could it be possible for you to suffer any harm from my presence?" For if, being alive and the source of life, I became dead for your sake and again came to life after having trampled down death, how is it possible for you, who are alive through me and through my vision, to become dead?

If "I" too "hold the keys to death and Hades," so that I may kill or bring to life whomever I wish, leading them down to Hades and raising them up according to what is written about me, and as the prophet says, the pathways of death belong to me (Prov. 12:28), I would not send my worshippers and disciples prematurely to death. Since he will not die, he says:

"Write, then, what you have seen and what is, and what will happen afterward." In speaking of what is, he reveals both what has passed and what is present; and in speaking of what is about to happen, he reveals the future. For among the things seen in the holy vision, some were already accomplished, although they had reached their limit, they had not ceased to exist; therefore, concerning these things, he spoke of "what is," meaning what was present. As for "what will happen," the word would show it as it unfolded.
