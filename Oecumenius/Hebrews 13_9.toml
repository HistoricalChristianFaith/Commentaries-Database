"diverse and strange teachings." Paul says, do not be led astray by teachings that go beyond doctrines, neither different nor strange ones. For the doctrine itself is also recognizable; but to be carried away, as from the metaphor of those who are mad, who are carried here and there, has been said.
"for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace." For the heart established by the grace of God will not be led astray by diverse and strange teachings, but will keep to the truth.
"not by foods." Therefore, by faith, which is active through the grace of God, the heart must be strengthened, not being strengthened in regard to the observance of foods; for those who walk in these observances, that is, those who keep them, have gained nothing from them.It is said that some among them observe the food according to Jewish customs.
