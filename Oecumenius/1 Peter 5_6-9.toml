Cast all your anxiety on him because he cares for you. Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the Devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
It is added, "In time." For it refers to the exaltation in the future age, which is the only true exaltation, as unchangeable and everlasting, since the present exaltation is neither secure nor firm, but rather contributes to a perpetual humiliation, so that it may be humbled more quickly than it was exalted. Furthermore, the Lord Himself is suitable to reconcile humiliation with exaltation. For He says: "Everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted." (Matt. 18:4) And: "Whoever wishes to be first among you shall be the last of all." (Matt. 20:27) And speaking at that time, he indicated, as we said, that in the future, the exaltation promised would arise from humiliation. For there will be a time of unchangeable things in the future and in the incorruptible age. For the incorruptible has nothing mortal or perishable. Then, removing the fear that would arise from humiliation (for perhaps he saw some fearing that by humbling themselves in this present life, they would suffer some evil), he said: "Do not be afraid, casting all your anxiety on the Lord, when you have entrusted yourself to him who will take careful and diligent care of you."
"because he cares for you," or concern is placed upon him regarding all these things.
"Be sober-minded; be watchful." On those who are spiritually asleep (this, however, is to aspire to vain things) and from this, the watchfulness of souls is weighed down, the evil and most savage beast of despair is accustomed to leap upon them. Therefore, Christ's disciple, strengthening us (Matt. 13:24), exhorts us to always be vigilant and to watch over him who sows tares, lest in any way, while we are asleep, or living carelessly and sluggishly, he secretly sows wicked thoughts and drives us away from true life.
For the Devil does not cease, Peter says, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour; to whom you also resist with firm strength of mind. Concerning such sharp snares and the precise deceit of him against us, the holy Justin Martyr8 also brings forth the case, stating that the Devil did not clearly know the power of his punishment before the coming of the Lord, when the divine prophets had announced it mysteriously: just as Isaiah (14:4), under the persona of the Assyrian, tragically narrates the entire representation of the Devil. But when the Lord had come and had openly said that the eternal fire is reserved and prepared for the Devil and his angels (Matt. 25:41), upon hearing this, he does not cease to lie in wait for the faithful, wanting to have many companions in his defection, lest he be ashamed to cling to this alone, applauding himself with this cold and envious consolation.
"knowing that the same kinds of suffering," as it is likely, those to whom Peter writes were being pressed by many afflictions for the sake of Christ: therefore, both in the preceding and in the following, he brings consolation to this: indeed, by the fact that the enduring become themselves partakers of the afflictions of Christ and heirs of the glory that is to be revealed; here, however, by the fact that they do not suffer alone, but all the faithful who are in the world: moreover, the company of companions lightens the severity.
