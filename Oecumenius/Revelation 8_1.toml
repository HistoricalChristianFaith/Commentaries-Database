Perhaps someone who is very meticulous might analyze what has been said and say to me: Oh you, what are you doing? Have you perhaps forgotten what was said in the prologues of this Revelation? For it was also said that the first voice I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things." (Rev. 4:1) And you have become a narrator to us of things not yet come to pass but already happened, recounting the birth of the Lord, the temptation, the teachings and divine signs, the lashes and bonds and the wounds inflicted by Pilate, the cross and the death, and the resurrection and the ascent, or rather, the return to Heaven. To this I would say: most certainly you have heard, my friend, and some of the things that will happen, whenever we recount the righteous among the nations together with Israel around the divine throne, and those who exist with the Lord.

And now you also hear in the breaking of the seventh seal. For the one who said to the evangelist, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after these things," (Rev. 4:1) did not remove from him the ability to see anything that had happened before, but along with those, he also revealed what was to come. Therefore, listen.

The breaking of the seventh seal has accomplished for us the most perfect glory; for no longer is the release from sins and the turning back to God and from God to us as before, but rather the indescribable blessings: to be called children of God, "heirs of God, and joint heirs with Christ," (Rom. 8:17) brothers and friends and children of Christ, to reign with Him (2 Tim. 2:12) and to be glorified together, (Rom. 8:17) and "what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man, these good things." (1 Cor. 2:9) What then is the breaking of the seventh seal? It is the second coming of the Lord and the restoration of all good things. For although some are delivered to punishment for their sins, the purpose of Christ and the foundation of the Incarnation is that all become heirs of His kingdom.

Therefore, when the seventh seal was broken, it is said that there was silence for about half an hour, as the King of creation was about to come, and all angelic and supernatural powers were overwhelmed by the surpassing glory of the One arriving, and for this reason, there was silence.
