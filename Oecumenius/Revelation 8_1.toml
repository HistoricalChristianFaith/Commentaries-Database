The loosing of the seventh seal effects the most perfect and complete glory for us. No longer is there as before the loosing of sin and our turning to God or God’s turning to us. Rather there is now the most unspeakable blessings: to be called “sons of God,” to be inheritors of God, to be co-heirs with Christ, to be brothers and friends and children of Christ, also to rule with him and to be glorified with him, and those blessings that “eye has not seen nor has ear heard nor has come into the heart of man.” And what is the loosing of the seventh seal? It is the second coming of Christ and the giving of blessings as rewards. For although some are handed over to the punishment of sinners, nonetheless it is the aim of Christ and the intention of the incarnation that everyone become an heir of his kingdom. Therefore, when the seventh seal was loosed, “there was,” it says, “silence for about half an hour,” since the king of creation was coming and every angelic and supernatural power, astounded at the exceeding greatness of the glory of him who was coming, for that reason became silent.
