When he betrayed his Lord and sought no forgiveness for this his great sin, Judas chose to himself perdition. Here, then, his own place or lot means suicide. So when we read Balaam that 'he rose up and went and returned to his place,' (Num 24:25) this is said not only of a local removal, but of a moral one.
