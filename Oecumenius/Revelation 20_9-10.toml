“And they surrounded the beloved city,” that is, the church. However, “fire brought from heaven” will destroy all of them, and moreover when the consummation has occurred, Satan, the originator of evil, together with the devil and the antichrist, will be thrown into the lake of fire, that is, Gehenna. Let the one who reads take note that in earlier material the Revelation has transmitted information about three figures: the first was the dragon, who was shown in heaven and who is the originator of evil; the second is the beast who rose from the sea and whom we claimed was second to Satan but prominent among the rest of the demons; and the third was the antichrist, who is also called the false prophet. However, it was stated a little earlier that the second, the devil and the antichrist were “thrown into the lake of fire that burns with brimstone.” But now it speaks of Satan, or the devil, who earlier it had called “dragon.” Therefore, you who read this book know that we have interpreted the phrase “the thousand years,” in which the devil was bound and thrown into the bottomless pit and again loosed, to refer very precisely to the incarnation of the Lord and his life upon the earth, during which the devil’s activity was for a short time impeded. But now it is revealed that his punishment and that of those deceived by him is not a thousand years and then there is a loosing of the evil one. Rather, this punishment is “forever and ever.”
