Then he says, Repent therefore; if not, I will come to you soon and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth. O depth of the riches and wisdom, and goodness of God. (Rom. 11:33) For he did not say, "I am coming to fight against you," but rather, "I will fight against them," clearly referring to the Nicolaitans. For he spared among those in Pergamum who were faithful and devout.
