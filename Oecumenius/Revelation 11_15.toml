By way of digression the vision related the attacks upon the two witnesses or prophets and discussed everything about them. The vision now returns to the previous narrative from which it departed. It has spoken of the future reward of the saints and that those from the nations were more numerous than those from Israel, and those who pleased God in the New Testament more numerous than those who pleased him in the Old Testament. And, it says, when the seventh angel blew his trumpet “there were voices in heaven saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of God and of his Christ.’ ” To be sure, God always is king and has never begun nor indeed shall ever cease to rule the heaven and the earth and that which is visible and invisible in them, for he is without beginning and without ending Master and Lord of all things. However, since also people take the title of “king” upon earth and after a manner God has those who reign with him, when the earthly kingdom of people is dissolved at the consummation of the present age, God alone will rule. And for this reason it says that “the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of God and of his Christ,” because those people who rule on the earth and the tyrannical demons have been destroyed and brought to an end.
