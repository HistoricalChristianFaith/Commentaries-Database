It confirms that he who was in the figure of Christ was greater than the priests of the Jews. The Levites, he says, being more honorable than the rest of the people, receive the tithes. For what is taken from brothers who have the same father? Therefore, it is evident that the tithes are a symbol of honor and of being more sacred. Thus, Melchizedek, being a foreigner and without genealogy, would not have received tithes from the patriarch unless he was greater than him. For Abraham would not have given to one who was not truly greater. If he is greater than the patriarch, it is evident that he is much greater than the priests among the Jews.
"to tithe the people.” To tithe means, for example, to take tithes from them; for the Levites were receiving tithes from the people.

“who have come out.” This is what it says: Although in all other respects they were equal in condition and honor, yet from the fact that these indeed gave tithes, while those received them, great excellence is shown. If this is so, it is clear that even in Abraham and Melchizedek, when Abraham gave tithes, Melchizedek received them. Therefore, he who was a type and figure of Christ was greater than the patriarch Abraham: and if Abraham himself, much more the priests. But if the type was greater, what can anyone say about Christ?

"But he whose genealogy is not counted among them." Among them, that is, among those. Therefore, he whose genealogy is not mentioned to among them, nor reckoned in the number with their kind, namely Melchizedek, received tithes.
"and blessed the one who has the promises. He took up Abraham, so that Melchizedek might receive more. Since it was a great thing to Abraham to receive the promises from God, he now adds this, that Melchizedek, so great and so old, having been deemed worthy of divine fellowship, and having God as his debtor, was blessed by the type of Christ. The lesser is blessed by the greater. He said that Melchizedek blessed the aged Abraham; and we all commonly and unquestionably know that the one who blesses is greater than the one who is blessed. Therefore, Melchizedek, the type of Christ, is greater than the patriarch himself.
