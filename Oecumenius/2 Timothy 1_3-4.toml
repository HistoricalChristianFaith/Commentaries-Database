I give thanks to God, whom I have served from my ancestors with a pure conscience, that I unceasingly remember you in my prayers day and night, longing to see you, mindful of your tears, so that I may be filled with joy.

Do you see the excess of love? Paul says, I thank God that I remember you. This is love, when someone takes pride in loving someone.

with a pure conscience. How is it in a pure conscience? Where Paul originally was ignorant of Christ? They show that he was conscious of nothing evil in himself. For even if he persecuted, he persecuted out of zeal, and not according to human reasoning, like many who do so for glory, forming heresy; those who are conscious know great corruption. And he presents himself well, so that he may also show that his love for Timothy is genuine, and not receive the reputation of being unloving, not having gone to him, and promising these things.

unceasingly remember you. Not just unceasingly remember you, but "In my prayers." Not in a common way, Paul says, as I remember, but in prayers, both night and day.

longing to see you. Therefore, I did not voluntarily deprive myself of such great pleasure. You are truly worthy to be loved, both because of your tears and because of your faith and that of your ancestors. But notice that at the beginning Paul does not want to sadden Timothy as if he were not coming, but rather gives hope of seeing him: near the end, however, he implies that he will no longer see him in the flesh, saying: "For I am already being sacrificed, or offered." (2 Tim. 4:6) But here is the order: I have grace from God because I remember you, desiring to see you, so that I may be filled with joy. Then what is left in the middle: "mindful of your tears." Afterwards, lest it seem rash to love, Paul also adds the reason.

mindful, Paul says, of your tears. For perhaps, being separated from Paul, Timothy was so distressed as even to weep. But the exceeding, "longing to see you so that I may be filled with joy," as if the mere sight alone were sufficient to fill me with joy.
