Where it has been shown that there is a third rest, he consequently encourages them to enter into it. And he rightly says: Let us strive. For faith alone is not sufficient to enter into it, unless there is also unless there is also good behavior.
"lest anyone fall according to the same example." By the same, as with the Israelites. For just as they, after having crossed a greater part of the way in the desert, had fallen from all comfort through unbelief, let no one among you fall in the same way or by example, after so many trials, not acting courageously until the end.
"For the word of God is living." It gradually shows that Christ alone was the one who acted in what happened concerning the children of Israel. For it is living, he says, and will live forever. But lest they think that those who sin and provoke Christ are only frustrated by the earth as the ancients were, he adds a more terrible deed.
"sharper than any two-edged sword." As those who did not hear the speech might fear something more terrible, it expresses what has been said, adapting examples that are among us: for it could not be understood in any other way than what is said, cutting from both sides with any sword.
"piercing to the division of soul and spirit.” He says something fearful: either that the spirit separates from the soul, and leaves it desolate of the holiness that the Lord in the gospel called division; (for just as a king, when a ruler sins, is stripped of his belt and his office beforehand, and then punished; so here too the spiritual dignity is first taken away from the person, then he is punished;) or that it even reaches the incorporeal themselves.
The holy Cyril certainly received in a certain place: piercing to the division of soul and spirit: He says that the preaching concerning God divides and distinguishes the parts of the soul, making them receptive and capable of the things heard. That it also reaches them, he says, of the incorporeal beings, and punishes the soul. That it works a division of soul and spirit. It is indeed fearful.
In another way.

The division that the Gospels threaten, the Fathers understood as the complete abandonment of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, I think it is now a day that causes the separation of the Holy Spirit, and it removes itself from the soul, after which all good things will subsequently follow and be taken away.

"of joints and marrow." So that, having heard the things of the soul, they do not become careless, as if the punishment were unclear, having spoken of the incorporeal, he also speaks of the corporeal; for the more visible things strike with greater fear.
"and discerning the thoughts." To distinguish and examine the very thoughts themselves, and the invisible concepts of the heart. Here the divinity of the Word is shown; for it is God who examines, that is, who tests and knows the thoughts; he says "God searches the hearts and kidneys." (Jer. 17:10).
"And no creature is hidden from his sight." But what do I say about men, he says? Nor can any other creature hide or be concealed from that watchful eye, whether you speak of angels, or Cherubim, or Seraphim.
"but all are naked." Nothing can be hidden from the inspecting power of Christ. All things are bare before Him, and no covering or character can allow anyone to conceal themselves from those eyes.
“exposed to the eyes.” To make it clearer how all things are naked and visible before the Word of God, He used a metaphor from the flayed sheep. For just as those sheep, having been flayed, that is, having had the knife taken to their neck and been slaughtered, after the skin is removed, everything inside is exposed; so it is with God, everything is evident. Or, flayed, He says naked, by metaphor from the sheep hung by the neck and stripped of their skin. Or, the term flayed, instead of those bowing down and stooping necks, because they cannot look upon the glory of that judge and God, our Jesus Christ. But you accept the first.
"to whom we must give account." To Him, he says, we must give an account of our actions, and we must respond to Him, to whom we also have the word [ὁ λόγος]. Do you see where the matter concluded? For in order that, having heard, you should not think that the same punishment is for us and for the Israelites on the same pattern of disobedience, he shows through these things that ours are much more terrible.
