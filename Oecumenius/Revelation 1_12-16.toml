"The seven lampstands," as John himself goes on to explain, are the seven churches to which he has been commanded to write; he calls them "lampstands" because they bear the light of the glory of Christ. For he does not call them lamps, but "lampstands." This lamp itself does not emit light; rather, it contains within itself the power to illuminate. Christ illuminates His churches spiritually. For just as the holy apostle encourages those who have received the faith: "Become like stars in the world, holding forth the word of life," (Philip. 2:15-16) so too, the star itself does not possess light by itself but is receptive to an external light. In the same way, here the evangelist saw the churches not as lamps themselves but as "lampstands." For it has been said concerning Christ, "you wonderfully illuminate from eternal mountains," (Ps. 75:3) perhaps that means angelic powers; and again, towards the Father; "send forth your light and your truth" (Ps. 43:3); and again, the illumination of your face, O Lord. (Ps. 44:3) The participants in the divine light were recorded, some as stars, others as lamps.

John says that the "lampstands" are "golden" because it is honorable and surpassing to receive the divine radiance.

And he says that "in the midst of the seven lampstands, one like a son of man"; for if the Lord Himself promises to dwell and walk among the souls that received Him, how would He not be "seen in the midst of the lampstands"?

He says that the "Son of Man," Christ, who humbled himself for us "taking the form of a servant," (Philip. 2:7) became the fruit of the womb according to the divine melody (Ps. 126:3); the womb of the undefiled and ever-virgin Mary; for since Mary is a human and our sister, it is fitting that the one born from her without seed, according to the flesh the Word of God, is called the "Son of Man."

And he has spoken carefully without saying "the son of man", but "like a son of man," and also God and Lord of all, Emmanuel; and the vision shows his varied form, outlining the shape from his works and powers.

And first, he puts on a priestly garment; for the long "robe" and the "belt" are priestly garments; for it is said to him from God and the Father: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." (Heb. 5:6; Ps. 109:4) But the apostle also calls Christ "a high priest and apostle of our confession," (Heb. 3:1) as one who performs priestly service and brings to himself and to the Father and the Spirit our confession of faith.

And he puts on "a golden belt," having a belt with decorated attire [φάρους], as prescribed by the law for priests. For it was necessary for the difference between slaves and master to be shown, between the shadowy law and the truth in the New Covenant.

"His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow." For the mystery according to Christ is new in its appearance, but indeed eternal in its good pleasure. For the divine apostle wrote concerning him the mystery hidden from the ages and from the generations, which now has been revealed to his saints, to whom he willed. Therefore, the ancient aspect of the mystery, as far as it reached into divine favor, reveals the gray of the head intermingled with "wool" and "snow."

"and his eyes were like a flame." It is shown since Christ is also light, and He calls Himself this, saying "I am the light and the truth," (Jn. 8:12; 14:6) or He reveals the fearful things and the threat against the seven churches to which the things of the Revelation are sent, as those who are not following His laws perfectly. And He says,

"his feet were like gleaming bronze." They say that the copper mined in Mount Lebanon is both pure and self-originating, becoming purer after being purified in a furnace from the moderate impurity within it; through this, the firm and unshakable faith in Christ, bright and visible, is shown to have been firmly established in safekeeping. For Christ has been called the rock [πέτρα] by the apostle (1 Cor. 10:4), and a precious stone [λίθος] in the foundations of Zion by Isaiah (Isa. 28:16). Or he means that the "gleaming bronze" is incense that is bronze-like, which the physicians [ἰατρῶν παῖδες] have been accustomed to call male [ἄρρενα].

But this one is fragrant when it is burning; for the burning "furnace" is a sign that it is being burned. It shows that the foundation of the evangelical proclamation; for the foundation of the rest of the body are the "feet," which is Christ; for He is fragrant and, by fixing the spiritual fragrance, both the things in heaven and those on earth. The foundation is Christ, and Paul refers to this in a certain letter he wrote to the Corinthians, wisely saying, "I have laid the foundation as an expert builder; another is building upon it. Each person must consider how they build upon it, for no one can lay any foundation other than the one already laid, which is Jesus Christ." (1 Cor. 3:10-11) That Christ is fragrant in a spiritual sense is attested by the bride in the Song of Songs, who, having received a share of His fragrance, declares both that "the scent of your perfumes is more delightful than all spices" and that "your name is like a poured-out perfume." (Song 1:3) Moreover, the Lord Himself presents Himself as fragrant in His words to the bride, saying, "I am the flower of the field, the lily of the valleys." (Song 2:1) What then? Did not Paul also, having become fragrant from the participation [μετουσίας] in Christ, say: "that we are the fragrance of Christ?" (2 Cor. 2:15) And again: "and the aroma of the knowledge of Him is revealed to us." (2 Cor. 2:14)

"and his voice was like the sound of many waters," John said; and rightly so. For how else could his utterance have reached every part of the earth, and the proclamation about him to the ends of the inhabited world, if it were not unheard of? Not by audible loudness, but by the power of the proclamation.

"and he had seven stars in his right hand," he said. He himself interprets these stars as the angels of the seven churches, as the divine Gregory said in the presence of the bishops, addressing the ruling angels; "for I believe that each church is guarded by a different angel, as John teaches in the Revelation." I believe that the "stars" are called the holy angels because of the abundant illumination of Christ within them; and they "are in His right hand." For they are deemed worthy of the most honorable position before God, and as if they rest in the hand of God.

"and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword." Therefore, the divine David says to the Lord, "Fix your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one." (Ps. 44:4) For at that time, the evangelical laws commanded us to observe them strictly, for violating them was deadly; therefore, the place of the thigh where the sword was placed indicated a delay in punishment, for it was not yet fully prepared for slaughter. Now from "his mouth" comes forth the "sword," signifying the riddle [αἰνίγματος] that those who are disobedient to the evangelical commandments face the danger of being cut in two by the sword of the soul. This is what the Lord declares in the Gospels, making this clear; and the apostle said: "for the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword" (Heb.4:12) against those who disobey, clearly indicating the threat it raises. Therefore, this sharpness is also attributed to John; it is the same as the sharp style found in the writings of Paul.

"and his face was like the sun shining in its power," John said. Well said, "like the sun"; for the Lord is "the sun of righteousness," according to the prophet Malachi. (Mal. 4:2) But so that you do not think the illumination of Christ's "face," which enlightens every person coming into the world (Jn. 1:9), is a physical body that is transparent and visibly shining, he attributed it to his power, as if to say: the light of Christ is intelligible, operating by power (Col. 1:29), not a bodily appearance, but one that enlightens the eyes of the soul.
