"I therefore appeal to you for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my chains, formerly useless to you, but now indeed useful both to you and to me, whom I have sent back. I appeal to you to receive him as my very heart: whom I wished to keep with me, so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf; but I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary."

Paul mentions Philemon first, praising the servant as a beloved child, because he says he also baptized him. For this is the one, "I have begotten while in my chains." Therefore, having calmed his anger through these things, he thus gives the name "Onesimus", he says.

"formerly useless to you". For he knows that the acknowledged sin is to extinguish the master's anger.

"but now indeed useful both to you and to me". If such faithfulness is useful to Paul, who demands so much, it is clearly also useful to Philemon.

"whom I have sent back". To hand Onesimus over to the master, rather extinguished his anger.

"to receive him as my very heart". What do I mean by "receive him"? Receiving this one, you will receive my own very "heart". Thus he says, I love him as one calls him his own "heart". And "receive" means to accept with love.

"so that he might serve me in the chains of the gospel on your behalf". Do you see that Paul has brought the master to the very place, little by little? For he says that "he serves me on your behalf". Here he shows that he wishes what is more advantageous for the master. For if you say that you ought to serve, and he does this instead of you, the benefit is yours.

"in the chains of the gospel". In chains for the sake of the Gospel.

"without your consent". This was especially humiliating for him, that he did not do something so necessary for him without your consent.

"so that your good deed would not be forced but voluntary". Paul did not say, "By force," but, "would not be forced;" as if he had said, "I knew that even against your will, forcing Onesimus on you, I would not cause you pain. But so that it may not seem to be done by force, I was not willing," he says.
