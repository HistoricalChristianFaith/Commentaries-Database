She who calls herself a prophetess; she teaches and leads many astray to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols. This means either sensual fornication or the apostasy from God, according to what has been said: "and they committed fornication in their practices" (Ps. 106:39); and again "they committed adultery with the trees." (Jer. 3:9) But the Lord, not wishing the death of the sinner, but rather repentance and life, says that He has given her an opportunity for repentance. But if she refuses to repent, then I will do these things to her and those who commit adultery with her, so that all may know that I am God.

For God who searches mind and heart. For it is said, "For God searches the minds and hearts," (Jer. 17:10)
