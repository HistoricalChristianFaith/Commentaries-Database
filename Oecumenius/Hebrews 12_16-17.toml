Some interpret "and yet seeking the blessing with tears" as a time during which "he did not find an opportunity for repentance."

"that no one is sexually immoral." He did not say sexually immoral, referring to Esau, but it is placed in opposition to what preceded, "Pursue holiness." The defiled is indeed placed as if it refers to Esau; however, he called him a glutton, because he had sold away God's gift, namely the birthright, for a single meal. For it is written in the book of Genesis: "And the boys grew; and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the field: but Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents. And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but Rebecca loved Jacob. And Jacob boiled pottage. And Esau came from the field, and he was faint: and Esau said to Jacob, 'Feed me, I beg you, with that same red pottage; for I am weak.' Therefore was his name called Edom. And Jacob said, 'Sell me this day your birthright.' And Esau said, 'Behold, I am at the point to die: and what profit shall this birthright do to me?' And Jacob said, 'Swear to me this day.' And he swore to him: and he sold his birthright to Jacob." (Gen. 25:26-33) Therefore, at that time, the right of the firstborn is ours, and not that of the Jews. For we are descended from Isaac and Jacob.
"he was rejected." He was rejected by God. For God is the cause of Isaac being deceived, to bless Jacob.

"though he sought it with tears." Some interpret it this way: Although he had sought it with tears, namely the blessing: and what is said: and there was no place found by means of repentance for him.

"though he sought it." Does he therefore reject repentance? Certainly not. How then, if he sought repentance with tears, did he not attain it? He did seek it, but he did not find it; for he did not seek it rightly. How so? Because he was not properly repentant. For what kind of words of repentance did he speak? "The days of mourning for my father are approaching, and I will kill my brother Jacob." (Gen. 27:41) Therefore, for this reason, he does not find repentance, because he did not seek it as he ought. Either this is the case, or Paul terrifies those who have not yet fallen so that they do not fall, as if the greatest sins do not deserve repentance: and to those who have not yet sinned, he speaks in such a way, preserving them from falling by fear. But when he sees that some have completely fallen, consider how he changes his speech. For Paul says: "My little children, for whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you." (Gal. 4:19) For that he writes this to those who have already fallen is evident. For he says: "You who are justified by the law have fallen from grace." (Gal. 5:4) You see that when he testifies with them that they have fallen, lest they come to despair, he says: "Of whom I am again in labor until Christ is formed in you?" (Gal. 4:19) Do you not recognize that he does not reject this holy repentance, but is speaking in an economical manner [οἰκονομικῶς]?
