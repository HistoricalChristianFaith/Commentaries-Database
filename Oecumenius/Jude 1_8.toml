Likewise, these dreamers defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme glorious beings.
Furthermore, what he says: "Likewise, these dreamers defile the flesh," it is worthy of admiration that Jude has expressed the speech so modestly. For he indeed testifies much filthiness and nerve about them, saying that their life is impure, and their tongue is especially lustful: however, he rightly comprehends the fervent immorality of their actions through this word ἐνυπνιαζόμενοι (that is, dreaming or agitated by sleeplessness), which we will briefly and appropriately reveal, taking understanding from the work that blessed Epiphanius, bishop of Cyprus, published about these, which he called the Panarion (26).
For he says here that those wicked Borborites (that is, those filled with filth and sludge) when they mixed with foul women, did not dispense semen into the womb, but with an imperfect abomination, they received it with their own hands, and immediately inserted it into the mouths of the women with whom they had been corrupted: and thus they departed from each other impure, thinking they had accomplished something great. This unclean drama is called a dream because such things are also found in dreams. Therefore, by this filthy assumption, they further rage against the divine nature, Jude says, despising its dominion and the authority it has over the universe. Moreover, blessed Irenaeus of Lyons spoke more broadly about these things in his Refutation of the So-called Knowledge, from which anyone who wishes may gain understanding.
They reject authority, that is, the perfection of the mystery that is according to Christ: in order and in turn, fulfilling their shamelessness through the mysteries of angels. However, the term "glorious " (Δόξας) that is, splendors, is mentioned in both the Old and New Testaments: as Paul says, "For if what was brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory." (2 Cor. 3:11) And again: "For if the ministry of condemnation was glorious, much more will the ministry of righteousness abound in glory." (2 Cor. 3:9) Or it also refers to the ecclesiastical authorities, upon which they heap blasphemies: as can be learned even from the third Epistle of John the beloved, among whom he mentions Diotrephes, who gossiped against them with malicious words. (3 Jn. 10)
