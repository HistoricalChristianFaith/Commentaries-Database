Little children, it is the last hour: and as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come, by which we know that it is the last hour.
"it is the last hour." In this way, the discourse can be more easily understood: Since the Catholic Epistle is suited to each person regardless of the time, and there is no prescribed end of life for each individual, yet each one has an uncertain end, it is rightly applied to each one's end, so that, as the final time of life that threatens each individual, forethought and sobriety may follow: and thus a life irreproachable and pure may always be conducted in actions by Christians. Nor does any madman have a place for mocking this, if it has been said for so many years: it is the last hour, and yet until now it has not been measured or calculated that last moment. Indeed, if you compare the span of time from the creation of the world, how much has been elapsed from that time until now? I mean the time since Christ was born.
Furthermore, if anything is divided into three parts, namely the first, the middle, and the last, whatever follows from the middle can certainly be called the last without any absurdity. Certainly, if the Lord came according to the middle of ten thousand years (since His coming to earth was almost in the fifth millennium), whatever follows from this, as that which follows the middle, could be justifiably called the extreme and the last; for instance, from a hundred years, even the first, namely ten or twenty, and so on for the subsequent ones, could be called the last.
Therefore, here too, since the time of the Lord's coming had passed through the middle of the thousand years, whatever follows from this can rightly be called the last or extreme. This is therefore most true, even according to John Chrysostom [Easter Sermon]. The last or extreme can also be understood as the worst, as when we say: He has reached the extreme of evil. Therefore, since the world was then shaken by great evils, the Devil developing these things after the coming of that Savior, whether for the temptation of the good or for the confusion of those things which are better, so that no one could discern what was good and what was not good: for this reason, that time is called the last hour, as it brings forth that which is worst, when it has the character of the most foul and thickest waste.
However, it confirms that it is the last hour, or the worst, even according to the substance of time from the Antichrist. For if we expect the Antichrist, he says, in the last times, but now many antichrists are present in this life (he mentions Cerinthus and those like him), it is evident that the time of the end is imminent, while many antichrists precede one and prepare the way for him. Then John adds to this saying whom the antichrists have come, namely that they are from among us, etc.
