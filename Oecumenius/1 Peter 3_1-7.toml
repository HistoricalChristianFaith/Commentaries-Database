Similarly, wives should be subject to their husbands, so that even those who do not obey the word may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your chaste conduct accompanied by fear. Let your adornment not be external, consisting of braiding hair and the wearing of gold, or of fine clothing; but let it be the hidden man of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God’s sight is very precious. For in this way, holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, being subject to their husbands, just as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him master. And you are her daughters if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening. Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
Concluding this discourse on morals; namely through kings, through presidents, through masters, through servants; since it has also been established that subjects should be subjected to kings and presidents in what is necessary and in what is appropriate, and through this it is shown that those princes who have laws as a certain incentive of justice, will not be condemned for those things they have done according to them: but in those cases where they have acted unjustly and without judgment and tyrannically against them, they will also perish through these. Indeed, the law was given to them for the benefit of the nations, as Paul also proclaims (Gal. 3:19). But also the authorities, just like the laws, were given for the benefit, and not as some wrongly wish, namely that the power of those who are on earth comes from the Devil: who supports this Devil by saying to the Lord: "All these things have been given to me, and I give them to whomever I wish." (Luke 4:6) For it is not by his command that kings are established, who have been given for the correction of evildoers, since the Devil does not bring about anything like this to be administered among men. For powers and princes have been given by God, partly for the preservation of justice and the correction and benefit of the subjects, partly indeed out of fear for the punishment and correction of wrongdoers; partly also to punish with fitting punishment those who are unruly. Therefore, this having been shown, and that it is good to be subjected, or to be disobedient is evil, where it would also have been established in the same way that servants should obey their earthly masters, and that those who are afflicted and endure without cause by evil masters should receive the greatest praise: where in some way this would have recalled to the order of masters also through the slander of evil masters: it then also passes to the assembly of women, and says;
Let these two things concern women or wives, to be subject to their husbands, and to show themselves alienated from all adornment and culture, imitating holy women, for they too, he says, knew only this form of worship, namely obedience to their husbands. And what profit will come from this? The good imitation of those who are outside of the faith, which is also generated from our subjection to the rulers, and the praise of God on our behalf coming from them: this also greatly contributes to the praise of Christians, namely that for our sake He is not spoken ill of, but rather the name of God is blessed. But where he said "holy women" indefinitely, he also specifically adds Sarah: and proceeding in an encouraging manner, he calls them daughters of this Sarah, whether according to faith or even according to lineage. For it is necessary for daughters to imitate their mothers. With honest truth and decent Christian conduct, it also admonishes them to be merciful, without fearing the accounting of their husbands. For this indicates that they are not afraid of any terror. For it was likely that husbands would sometimes revisit the account of expenses. In this way, having raised the discourse, where Peter encouraged the female sex to be more generous towards their household, he also moderates the harshness of men towards their wives, and says:
"Husbands, living together in an understanding way, that is, learning through experience the triviality and folly of women in all things and their carnality in fear, be patient with them, not strictly reevaluating the accounts of what has been entrusted to them for safekeeping." However, as we said, the more freely they persist in giving to the poor, he admonishes men not to be demanding investigators. Yet, it seems to me that something deeper is suggested through this, and more charming and casual than what Paul hints at regarding the marital act. For Paul openly cries out: "Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by mutual consent," etc. (1 Corinthians 7:5) Here, however, more modestly, as we said, speaking of understanding and thereby designating the matter itself, Peter advises, since the female sex is more prone to this slippery behavior, not to drive them away with harsh criticisms, but rather to treat them gently as the weaker ones, and then to persuade them to adopt some moderation in abstaining from such things: for this is what he wants to signify (moderation, I say, or abstinence) by saying,
"showing honor"; for honor does not follow unless someone looks towards something. Therefore, as to the weaker ones or even as co-heirs of the grace of life, it is necessary to use life in the custom of such people. And that we have not misused this understanding is made clear by what follows, when he says:
"that your prayers may not be hindered." For what kind of interruption of prayers can a man's severity towards his wife bring? Indeed, this negligence brings great attention and eagerness during the time of prayer. Therefore, it seems to me that this should be said. Furthermore, if someone has indicated this better, I certainly do not envy.
"without a word." Whether by ceasing all speech and all response, or because a demonstration through deeds is more effective than the anxious diligence found in words: for a silent deed is more excellent than a work deprived of speech.
"but let it be the hidden man of the heart." For all the glory of the king's daughter comes from within. "All her glory is that of the daughter of the king.” (Ps. 44:14) For he knows here by blessed David (Ps. 19:14), and Paul (Eph. 3:16) is another inward man from the outer.
"They adorn themselves." Do you see that this refers to adornment or decoration as subjection?
