"whom I have sent back". To hand Onesimus over to the master, rather extinguished his anger.

"to receive him as my very heart". What do I mean by "receive him"? Receiving this one, you will receive my own very "heart". Thus he says, I love him as one calls him his own "heart". And "receive" means to accept with love.
