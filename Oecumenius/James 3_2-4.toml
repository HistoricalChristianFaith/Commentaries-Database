If anyone does not stumble in speech, he is a perfect man, able to bridle the whole body. Behold, we put bits in the mouths of horses so that they may obey us, and we turn the whole body about. Behold, ships also, though they are so large and driven by fierce winds, are turned about by a very small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman wishes.
"Behold, we put bits in the mouths of horses." This is the order of letters: We put the reins in the mouths of horses; for unless it is arranged this way, speech is unintelligible (namely, if we take the Greek words in the order they are placed). This confirms what has been said about the tongue, and also addresses something greater: namely, that he who brings into his power that which is easy to arrange, will also overcome that which is difficult to handle. However, this resolves the objection. For it was plausible that someone might add: What labor is there in governing such a small member? Or what harm can come from the smallest member? And this shows that from the bridle and the helm and from the small things which are indeed small, but make great things. — In another way. Furthermore, these also show that the tongue should not move recklessly, but should be directed towards better things: just as the strength of horses is restrained by the bridle, and the onslaught of a ship is controlled by the rudder. Thus, we must also direct the tongue to what is beneficial with proper speech. For this signifies what is said: So also the tongue, that it should be directed in this way with proper speech, and not do what it does: for when it is small, it does great things, and kindles a great fire for us, since it is itself a fire. And what does it do? It adorns iniquity through the cunning eloquence of orators, contaminates the body, persuading women to allow its approach: it operates through deceit: it slanders others with falsehoods: and above all, it ignites the wheel of hell: that is, it sets on fire and stirs up hell in us, as if making a fire rage against us. But it also, he says, is set on fire by hell, as is evident from the rich man who was tormented by the tongue. (Luke 16:24) For the tongue is punished not for any other reason than because it has been inclined towards pleasures and trifles. Therefore, if the Wheel of hell is read, as some copies have it, the meaning must be explained accordingly. However, if it has the Wheel of Birth, it achieves this solution: the Wheel of Birth signifies our life. Therefore, inflaming the wheel of birth contaminates life: and how? While it is moved carelessly and lustfully, from which our life is enraged, or the time of our life. For this, the Psalmist also called it a crown, saying: "You will bless the crown of the year." (Ps. 65:11) Indeed, the wheel and the crown agree in that both are circular and spheric; the Wheel is said to be life, as if rolled back upon itself. But how does it contaminate our life? As it is moved, as we said before: because of which our life is both soiled and full of sighs. Thus, the tongue is turned about in proper speech. Indeed, the world is full of iniquity, as if it were cast down to a vile and popular crowd, looking back. For the world is understood here as a multitude. Or the world is, that is, an ornament, or adorning human nature: through this, we communicate our thoughts to one another, for in this meaning, some also wish to accept the World. Therefore, while it is directed towards the vile crowd, it does harm and injures and contaminates the whole body, and the wheel of birth is inflamed and is inflamed by hell. Yet, it is not difficult to direct it so that it moves rightly and in the way that the one who governs wishes. But if all of nature of wild beasts, birds, serpents, and marine creatures is tamed and has been tamed by human nature, is it true that the tongue, which is an uncontrollable evil, full of deadly poison, cannot be tamed by any human? I would say by no means is this the case. For if it cannot be tamed, it never inclines toward what is better; how is it that by it we bless God and the Father, and by it we curse men? Behold, it is governed by the will of the one who uses it. But it should not be so, my brothers. For if by it we bless God, is it not shameful to curse men who are made in the likeness of God? Is it just that from the same mouth there should come blessing and cursing? It should not be so.
