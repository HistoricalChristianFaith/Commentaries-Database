Having sufficiently struck them by calling them sluggish, and saying other things, he now comforts them; therefore he did not say, "I think," but "I am convinced."
"and things pertaining to salvation." Being near.
"even though we speak in this way." He says, I know that you will not produce thorns and thistles, but I strike only with words, so that I may make you stronger.
"For God is not unjust." Therefore, we are convinced of the good things concerning you, knowing that God is not unjust. If He is not unjust, He will not forget your good work and the love which you have shown in His name, having endured all for Him. So do not lose heart, but always hope for better things; for God is always righteous. Therefore, I have not spoken about you in a discouraging way; for I know that you are not worthy of curses.
“in serving the saints.”Greatly testifies to them, not only by works, but also by works done with eagerness; for serving is a sign of eagerness. To the saints, that is, to the faithful. For every believer is holy, even if he is of the world [κοσμικὸς]. But see how he ministers to them. For he did not say, having served, and stood; but added, and serving; that is, continuing to do the same.
This love that you continue to show, he says, "we desire [Επιθυμοῦμεν]." He did not say, "We want [βουλόμεθα]," but rather, it was more affectionate, "We desire," he says.
"to show the same diligence." Then someone might say, "If you are convinced about the better things concerning us, and you know our works and our ministry to the saints, why then were you afraid to call us sluggish, and remembering the thorns? Why? Because “we desire each one of you," he says, "to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end”, that is, to be steadfast in your faith in Christ and the hope that comes from it. And he did not say, We wish; which would have been a teaching authority; but, we desire; which is of paternal affection. For this is not something we wish in words only, but our soul burns for you. For such a thing is meant by the phrase, we desire.
"that you may not be sluggish." And this is also for their healing; for it leads them to the future time.And although he said above, "You have become sluggish," (Heb. 5:11) he then said to their listening ears, "but now, all of you have become sluggish."
"imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises." Then he lists those who inherited the promises through faith, such as Abraham. What is meant by "through patience"? That is, through endurance. For he endured the promise being set forth for so many years, and still remained believing. For if the gift were to follow immediately upon the promise of God, there would no longer be any need for faith or endurance on the part of the one receiving the promise, since God would be completely truthful. But if, having promised, he is delayed, and the one receiving the promise patiently waits for the delay, then he believes purely, then he endures with self-control.
