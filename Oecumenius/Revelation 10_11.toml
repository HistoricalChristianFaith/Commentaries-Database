“It is necessary that you prophesy again about many peoples and nations and tongues and kings.” This is as though he had said, “Although you have seen the consummation of the age and the wrath against the wicked in this vision, do not think that the day of fulfillment has in fact come. There remains much time yet for you to prophesy to many nations and to kings.” And so it is that up to the present time the blessed Evangelist prophesies through his Gospel and his catholic epistles and this Revelation. For all things have been spoken and prophesied to him by the Spirit.
