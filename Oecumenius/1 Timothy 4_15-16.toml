Study these things; give yourself entirely to them, so that your progress may be evident to all. Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine; continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you.

Study these things. Which ones? Those that Paul mentioned above. In word, he says, in conduct, in faith, in purity. And from the frequent repetition of the same things, it shows that the bishop must unquestionably guard these things.

your progress may be evident to all. But if the progress does not become very great, it would not become obvious. In all, either with people or with matters.

Take regard to yourself. That is, focus and apply your mind, not only for yourself but also for the sake of learning, so that you may benefit others as well. Then, giving precise instructions, Paul said, continue in them. For by doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you. For encouraging others, the one who encourages is also moved and benefited, becoming responsible for those whom he prevents from sinning.

That he may suitably adapt himself to each individual.
