"Consider him." For if one who reflects on the afflictions of the brethren finds comfort in his own afflictions, how much more will he who weighs the afflictions of the Lord.
"from sinners," for it is greater that even sinners have endured these things. However, he calls contradictions mockery, scourges, ridicules, and whatever opposed his teachings and doctrines: similarly, the shouts with which they cried out under Pilate.
"so that you will not grow weary and lose heart." For if you weigh these things in your mind, you will be hardened against afflictions, knowing that you have become imitators of God.
"you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood." In the above, he testified to them that they had struggled greatly, where he says: You have endured a great race of afflictions: therefore, lest they be exalted by this, he now says: You have not yet contended perfectly; you need something else: which is also a kind of exhortation. For he says: You have come to persecutions, to the plundering of your possessions, but not to death: yet Jesus Christ went even to death.
"In your struggle against sin." It shows that sin passionately breathes and they themselves struggle in opposition. For it says, "resisted," as if in battle, as if also resisting sin.
