And I am grateful to Christ Jesus our Lord, who has strengthened me, because He considered me faithful, appointing me to minister, though I was formerly a blasphemer and a persecutor and a violent man; but I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief. And the grace of our Lord overflowed exceedingly with faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.

Since Paul said, "which was committed to me," (1 Tim. 1:11) so that he might not seem to boast, he attributes everything to God, and he says, "I have grace because He has given me this power," for the Gospel to be entirely believed.

who has strengthened me." For Paul says, I have been given a great burden, and I am in need of much strength from God.

because He considered me faithful. Then Paul shows that something has also been brought in from us. For God is not indiscriminately selective of some. For the matter would have been disapproved. And he says; "because He considered me faithful." But how could God consider one who is not worthy of faith to be faithful? He is faithful, who does not take any of God's things to himself, but also commits his own things to God.

to minister. That is, of the Gospel. He says "minster" because it means to preach. The proof that I considered myself trustworthy is that the ministry of the Gospel was entrusted to me.

though I was formerly a blasphemer. See how Paul increases the mercy of God, remembering his former life, and showing whom he chose to have mercy on.

And a persecutor. For Paul would say: Not only was I uttering blasphemies, but also by persecuting others, I compelled them to speak blasphemies.

but I was shown mercy. Paul shows himself worthy of punishment, for mercy is shown in these cases.

because I acted ignorantly. If Paul did it ignorantly, he was shown mercy; why then were not the Jews also shown mercy? And we say, first of all, that they do not want it. For those who approached Christ were shown mercy. But why did not all see the vision as Paul did? For if so, all would have approached. Because Paul persecuted out of ignorance, but those others did so knowingly. Heard the evangelist saying that many of the Pharisees and Jews believed, but they did not confess it; “For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.” (Jn. 12:43) And again Jesus said to them; "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another?" (Jn. 5:44) And again: "This they said, his parents said, because of the Jews, so that they themselves would not be put out of the synagogue." (Jn. 9:22) And the Jews themselves were saying, "Do you see that we are not benefiting at all? Behold, the whole world is going after him." (Jn. 12:19) Did you see them sinning in knowledge, for the sake of ambition? At that time Paul was perhaps at the feet of Gamaliel, not associating with the crowd, and after that, seeing the faith of Christ increasing, he was zealous with the zeal of God, though not in full knowledge.

in unbelief. From the law, Paul read about Christ. Therefore, since he did not immediately believe in Christ, he calls the matter concern, born from unbelief.

the grace of our Lord overflowed exceedingly. For not only, he says, did He leave unpunished one deserving of punishment, but He also justified him, and made him a son, and a friend, and an heir.

with faith and love. Moreover, it abounded with my faith and love, and both came to me through Christ himself.

For he says "in Christ Jesus." And Paul spoke of faith and love, that it is one thing to believe, but not to do the things of those who love Christ. However, he showed that it is necessary for us to bear something as well.
