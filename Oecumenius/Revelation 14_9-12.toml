The third angel forbids human beings to worship the beast, and to receive his seal. For to worship anyone else as god, other than the real and true God, is most impious. 

He says, And he shall drink of the wine of God’s wrath, poured unmixed into the cup of his anger. Blessed David has also mentioned this cup and the wine when he says, “For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, full of a mixture of unmixed wine, and he tilted it from side to side; but its dregs were not emptied out; all the sinners of the earth will drink them.” He calls the wrath of God wine, speaking metaphorically not of joy, but of darkness and the changed destiny, by which those who are subject to the wrath of God are inspired. 

He says, mixed unmixed: that is, purely mixed. For the wrath of God is mixed with loving-kindness and goodness; it is purely mixed. For there is no equivalence between his wrath and his goodness, but his loving-kindness is many times more abundant. For if there were an equality of righteous wrath and goodness, no living person would survive. Because the prophet knew this, he said, “If you, Lord, should take note of iniquities, Lord, who could survive?” 

That there is much more goodness in God’s cup than righteous anger, the same writer again signified when he said, “The Lord is merciful and just, and our God will have mercy on us,” putting his justice in the middle, as if it were constrained by mercy on each side and not being allowed to exercise its own vocation. For the vocation of justice is to award each person what he deserves. 

After he had once mentioned wine and thus called it wrath, he continued with this image and named the cup as that which is given to sinners from the hand of God. 

But perhaps someone will say, “How do you speak of God’s mercy as abundant in the future judgment when the vision went on to tell us a little later that the penalty for those being punished is eternal? For why does he say, And the smoke of their torment goes up for ever and ever; and they have no rest, day or night”? 

One could reply to this in these words: “It means, my dear fellow, to be tormented eternally, yet not to suffer according to one’s deserts. How is this? If anyone deserves fire and darkness but has been condemned to darkness and is punished only by not being given a share in God’s bounty, and suffers pain only in this respect, he is certainly not being physically punished. 

By the smoke of torment which goes up he means the breath of sinners which has been exhaled from below in their wailings.” 

He says, This is the patient endurance of the saints: he means that in this time of the Antichrist and in the time of trial their endurance is clearly shown. For when the danger is greatest and the accompanying tribulation, so much greater is the need of endurance. 

Then the account proceeds as though in answer to a question: who, he says, are these whom you call holy and patiently enduring? Those, he says, who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus. For such people, even in the presence of trials and death, will put everything second to their faith and love of God.
