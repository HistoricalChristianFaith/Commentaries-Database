He who addresses the evangelist explains more clearly his own proper title. He says, These things says the Son of God, with eyes like a flame of fire, symbolizing his striking and threatening attitude against sinners. And feet like burnished bronze, indicating the constancy and stability of faith in him, or the spiritual fragrance of the evangelical teachings, as has been said above. 

He says, I know your works, your love and faith and service, as if he were saying, “I praise all your devotion.” For he has put I know instead of “I praise,” just as “I know you to be above all people” was said to Moses, and “the Lord knows the way of the righteous.” He calls service aid to those in need. 

He says, And the last are more than the first: he declares that as they progressed they grew in stature in fulfilling the commandments. 

But I have this against you, to show that to be completely sinless belongs to God alone. What do I have against you? That you tolerate the woman Jezebel and you do not banish her, who calls herself a prophetess: he describes the wickedness of this church in terms relating to Jezebel, the consort of Ahab. She, he says, who calls herself a prophetess is teaching and misleading many to commit fornication and eat food sacrificed to idols: he means either actual fornication or apostasy from God, according to what is said, “and they committed fornication by their practices,” and again, “they committed adultery with a tree.” 

But the Lord, who does not wish the death of a sinner, but his conversion and life, says, “I have given her time for repentance. But if she does not wish to repent, I shall do the same to her as to those committing adultery with her, in order that all may know,” he says, “that I am God, for it is God’s business to search the minds and hearts. For Scripture says, ‘God, who examines the hearts and minds.’ 

But to those who have nothing in common with the adulterous woman, who are more simple and do not know the crafty ways of the evil one, say this: ‘I shall not place any heavier burden upon you. Your simplicity is sufficient for you. Only keep the teaching given to you until my second coming.’” 

And to him who conquers the evil one, he says, I will give him authority over the nations and he shall be a shepherd to them with a rod of iron, as when clay pots are broken in pieces, as I myself have received authority from my Father. This is what is said in the Gospels to those who were good stewards of the pounds and talents entrusted to them: “Be in charge of ten cities”; and to another, “be in charge of five cities”; and in Daniel, “And the kingdom shall be given to the saints of God.” For he shows by this that some kind of rule and authority will be given to the saints over the more inferior and those in need of correction. So he says he will shepherd them with harsh authority, but the unbelieving he will crush like clay pots. 

And I will give him, he says, the morning star. The prophet says of the Assyrian, that is, Satan, “How did the morning star which rises early in the morning fall from heaven?” So he now calls him the morning star: he says, “I will make Satan subject to my servants.” This is similar to what was said by the apostle: “God will soon crush Satan under your feet,” and “You will tread on the asp and the basilisk, and you will trample the lion and the serpent underfoot.”
