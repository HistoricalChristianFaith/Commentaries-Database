And we declare to you eternal life, which was with the Father and was revealed to us. What we have seen and heard, we also declare to you, so that you may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father and His Son Jesus Christ: And we write this to you, so that your joy may be complete. And this is the promise that we have heard from Him; and we announce to you that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. If we say that we have fellowship with Him and walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.
"And we declare to you the life." Therefore, what we have seen, we also declare to you, John says. What is that? That he who is eternal life has been revealed to us, and we have become witnesses of him both before his crucifixion and after his resurrection. For he was indeed nailed to the cross in the flesh, and in that same flesh he rose again. And what profit do we bring you from this announcement? Namely, that just as we have taken you as partners [κοινωνοὺς] through the words of what we have seen and heard, so you may also be partners of the Father and of his Son Jesus Christ.
However, having seized this, let us be complete with joy as if united with God. Or because while you are participants with us, we have our joy to the fullest; which the joyful sower will establish for the reapers, rejoicing in what they may enjoy from their labors.
Having said this, John resumes the conversation, explaining what the announcement he heard is: and he says that this is that God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all. And where did John hear it? From Christ Himself, who said: "I am the light of the world (Jn. 8:12);" and: "I came as light into the world." (Jn. 13:46) Light therefore is, and darkness is not in it. Spiritual light, however, stirs the eyes of our soul to its reception, turning away from all these material things, and urging solely towards its desire with loving affection. However, darkness signifies either ignorance or sin. In God, indeed, neither ignorance nor sin can be found. For these refer to material things and the structure that is found among us. If it has been said elsewhere: "Darkness has been placed as a hiding place for Him," (Ps. 17:12) it was nonetheless said "has been placed;" not, however, "he is darkness," as it was said, "God is light." For it is one thing that is placed by Him who places. Here, then, darkness signifies ignorance, which consists in the fact that God cannot be comprehended: and this is ours, not God's. Therefore, something is placed among those things that do not belong to anyone, nor for his own sake, but for someone else that concerns him. That he also calls darkness sin is evident from what has been said by the same in the Gospel. For what does John say there? "And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it (Jn. 1:5);" by calling darkness our substance, which is subject to sins, in which he was made or by which he was assumed, he did not contract impurities from it: for he did no sin, etc.
Since therefore we are called to have fellowship with God, who is light; furthermore, in such light the darkness cannot stand, as has been demonstrated, nor can we, who are partakers of the light, thereafter receive darkness in ourselves, lest we suffer the penalties of falsehood and be separated from the fellowship of light along with falsehood. Therefore, having mutual fellowship (namely, both among ourselves and with the light), we make ourselves difficult to sin.
But how will this happen to us, John says, who have previously offended in many sins? For no one who is truthful and accustomed to speaking the truth will dare to say that he is without sin. Therefore, if anyone is surrounded and occupied by this fear, let him be of good spirit, he says, for he has been purified by the blood of His Son Jesus Christ shed for us, having contracted a fellowship with Him. Therefore, observe that because of the supreme union, He also calls the Son of the Father the nature assumed from us, whose blood is undoubtedly of the assumed nature and not of God.
How then, is Nestorius3 mad and impious, who separating the flesh of the Son does not allow His mother to be called Θεοτόκον, that is, the Mother of God? "But if we walk in the light, as He is in the light," (1 Jn. 1:7) it should be understood that the understanding of the whole sentence is the overturning of the blasphemy of the Jews (see Rev. 2:9): for they indeed said of Christ: "We know that He is a sinner." (Jn. 9:34) John says therefore: If we do the works of light, we are partakers of him; but if we do not, we are strangers to him. How then, is he not truthful, he asks, and has committed no sin, although “he was rejected by us among sinners?” (Is. 53:12) If therefore we who said, "His blood be upon us and upon our children," (Matt. 27:24) boldly say that we have not sinned, we deceive ourselves (1 Jn. 1:8) or are deceived, as if it were not a sin to crucify Christ.
For it is indeed the greatest: that is why John did not say, "We lie," but: "We deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us," (1 Jn. 1:8) because error is outside of the truth. If, however, we acknowledge and confess our sin, he will forgive us. (1 Jn. 1:9) By communicating in speech with others, John greatly lessened the harshness of reproach, saying: If we say.
