The holy angels hint at the joy they received at the banishment of Satan by singing a triumphal hymn to God, saying, “Now have the salvation and the kingdom and the power of God appeared, and the authority of his Christ,” since he is all-powerful. For by the assistance [of Christ’s authority], it says, we have conquered the enemy, and “the accuser of our brothers, who accuses them day and night before God,” has departed from us. O, the moderation of the holy angels! How much like their own Master they are! They call people their “brothers.” But why should this seem so marvelous, when even our common Master did not think it improper to call them by this name, saying, “I will proclaim your name to my brothers, in the midst of the congregation I will praise you”? But why does it say that Satan has departed? Because he has been deprived of his rank and there is no longer a place for him to accuse people before God. But these gained their revenge in equal measure, for they defeated him who seemed so unconquerable when he had even dared to rise up against God. They conquered by the efficacious and beneficial and precious blood of Christ and the word of witness about him, which they regarded as more precious than their own lives.
