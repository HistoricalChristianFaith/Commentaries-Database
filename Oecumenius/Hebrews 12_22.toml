"But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, heavenly Jerusalem, and to multitudes of angels." Instead of the people of Judah, angels are present. And he says there is a festive gathering among the multitude of angels. He also speaks of the firstborn, the faithful, whose names are written in the book of life. For this is what the Lord also says to the disciples: "Rejoice because your names are written in heaven." (Luke 10:20)
