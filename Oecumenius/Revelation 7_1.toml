Here clearly what happened to the Jews during the war against the Romans is shown to the Evangelist, which things occurred to them because of the crucifixion and their blasphemy against the Lord. For the four angels who held the four corners of the land of the Jews were keeping guard lest any of the Jews who were deserving of death should escape. And so they either brought upon them a fear of flight or dissensions or an untimely devotion to the fatherland or to their wives and relatives, and it is these things that are figuratively signified by the four corners of Judea being guarded. And that the four winds are restrained so that they blow neither upon the land nor upon the sea nor against any tree indicates that no respite was found by them in the war nor any consolation from their woes, neither for those who fought on the land, nor for those who fought at sea—for, according to Josephus, there were many sea battles—nor for those whose concern is with farming. For these evils wholly overpowered everyone, since the cities were destroyed by fire and the land was devastated and wasted. And Josephus accurately relates all of these events in his account of the siege of Jerusalem.
