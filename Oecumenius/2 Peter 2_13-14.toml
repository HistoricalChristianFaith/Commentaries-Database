Spots and blemishes party in their errors against you, having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin, enticing unstable souls.
"Spots and blemishes." The order is taken as follows: Spots and blemishes (Σπίλοι καὶ μῶμοι) are the heart of those who are exercised in plunder, that is, exercised through plunder, accursed children, assaulting you, having eyes full of adultery, and who cannot cease from sin: they entice unstable souls, which Paul also called women burdened with sins. (2 Tim. 3:6) Furthermore, these have forsaken the right way, and have gone astray following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, and the rest. These are wells without water, clouds carried with a tempest, etc. (2 Peter 2:17) And why is darkness reserved for them in the future world? Because of their immense vanity, by which they entice those who had previously walked in error, and had truly fled from it: so that through filthiness and the desires of the flesh, they return like a dog to its vomit. (Prov. 26:11) But those who are placed in the middle declare and confirm this vanity.
"Spots and blemishes." They have nothing that is fixed in purity, but like stains on a clean garment, they cling to long-standing conversation and defile everything: when they have drawn some away and have been able to make them shameless, those who are together, men and women, they consider this act a delight, satisfying their own lust: but also, they say, those who are dining with you do this not out of love, or because they share (as they say) in salt11, but to find this time suitable for deception among women. For these, having eyes, look at nothing but adulteresses, and in this, they sin continually, like children of abomination or abominable ones, ensnaring unstable souls.
