“I know your tribulation and your poverty”—indeed, you do not speak, as do the wicked Jews, who say, “Why have we fasted, and you did not notice it? Why have we humbled ourselves, and you paid no heed?” But “you are rich,” he says, since you have Christ as a wealthy patron, although indeed for us he became poor, “taking the form of a slave.” “and the blasphemy” of those falsely called “Jews.” Judah means “confession,” and Israel means “those who spiritually see God.” Therefore, those who are true Jews and the spiritual Israel would be those who confess Christ. “For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is the circumcision which is outward and physical” pleasing to God, as Paul says, “rather, he is a Jew who is one inwardly, and the circumcision is a matter of the heart,” not of the flesh. For that reason, those who have remained Jews in unbelief are a blasphemous synagogue, under the leadership of Satan.
