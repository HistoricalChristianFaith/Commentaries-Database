I know your affliction and your poverty, yet you are rich, yet do not say anything like the disobedient Jews said who rejected the faith, "that we have fasted and you did not notice, we have humbled our souls and you did not pay attention." (Isa. 58:3) But he says you are rich because you have Christ as your wealthy protector, even though he became poor for our sake (2 Cor. 8:9) by taking the form of a servant (Philip. 2:7).

And the slander of the illegitimate Jews is interpreted as the confession of Judas. Therefore, the true Jews, and the spiritual Israel, would be those who confess Christ, and Israel are those who see God in spirit. "For the one who is a Jew outwardly is not a Jew, nor is circumcision that is outward in the flesh" pleasing to God, as Paul says, "but the one who is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is of the heart," not of the flesh. (Rom. 2:28) Therefore, the Jews who have remained in unbelief form a blasphemous synagogue, led by Satan.
