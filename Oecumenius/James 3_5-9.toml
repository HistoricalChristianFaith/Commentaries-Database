So the tongue also is certainly a little member, and boasts great things. Behold how much fire what a great wood it kindles? And the tongue is fire, a whole world of iniquity. The tongue is set among our members, which defiles the whole body, and inflames the wheel of our birth, inflamed of hell. For all nature of beasts and fowls and serpents and of the rest is tamed and has been tamed by the nature of man. 8 But the tongue no man can tame, an unquiet evil, full of deadly poison. By it we bless God and the Father: and by it we curse men which are made after the similitude of God.
"So the tongue also." As if it were said: In the same way, the tongue must be rightly moved, which, although it is a small member, nevertheless accomplishes great things, both good and bad: however, the discourse is not so explicit, since the one who writes this is a disciple of a condensed writing style.
"world of iniquity." In this place, some wish to signify the multitude, just as where it is said: "The world did not know him," (Jn. 1:10) that is, the popular multitude. Therefore, the world is also the tongue, that is, the multitude of iniquity. And how great if a multitude was said there when it was sent before, how great the matter.
"For all nature." One must understand the objections in accordance with what has been said previously. For when James had previously said and demonstrated that those things which are indeed small become great when moved correctly, and had added that in the same way the tongue should be directed by appropriate language: he now shows with the examples given that it is not impossible for it to be instructed: as if he were to say: But someone will say that although the tongue is a small member, it nonetheless accomplishes great things, both good and evil: it is neither obedient nor manageable by us in what we desire. This does not affect the response. For if wild animals are tamed by man not by their nature, indeed fierce in appearance, but far more fierce in handling, would it not be much more appropriate to handle a member that is appropriate so that it might easily obey? Therefore, also what he says:
"the tongue no man can tame," should not be read affirmatively, but rather with doubt or as a question, so that it might be said in this way. If a man can tame wild beasts and make them manageable, can he not tame his own tongue? Thus, this must be read and understood. For if it were said assertively, it would not seem right to use it as an exhortation when it says: "My brothers, this should not be done." (James 3:10) For if it were impossible to adjust in such a way, he who admonishes impossibilities does not make a stable and fitting warning. Someone might say: "Nevertheless, what he says." An uncontrollable evil must be expressed assertively, for these show through amplification that the tongue is untamable. However, on the contrary, the statement, "From out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing," (Jame 3:10) must be read with hesitation: for it is the speech of one exhorting the listeners. For if we are commanded to bless all, since the cursed will not inherit the kingdom of God, is it not shameful to use the same member for the ministry of iniquity and good works? No wise person would use the same instrument to move mud and oil. Do you pray? Do not curse your enemy. There is a great difference between prayer and cursing. If you do not forgive him who has troubled you, neither will you be forgiven: but by cursing you will ensnare yourself, when you pray that your debts may be forgiven, just as you forgive your debtors. (Matt. 6:9) But let us provide, for the sake of easier consequences, the whole section in the middle to present the order of the required phrase, adding some things that are lacking. It will be in this way: Behold, we put the reins on the horses so that they may obey us, and we turn their whole body around: behold also that ships, however large they are and tossed by fierce winds, are turned about by a small rudder wherever the impulse of the helmsman wishes. Thus also let the tongue be turned about in right speech. Nor is this difficult. For all nature, both of wild beasts and birds and serpents and sea creatures, is tamed and has been tamed by human nature. If this is so, can no one tame the tongue? This cannot be said at all.
