If anyone aspires to the office of bishop, he desires a noble task.

Writing to Timothy, Paul shows in general what kind of person a bishop must be. "he desires a noble task." He says, "I do not accuse him." An honest man is needed, certainly for service and leadership; provided that he desires it for helping many, and not for glory. For a bishop is said to be one who oversees all. Even Moses desired it, but not for glory, rather for the benefit of many.
