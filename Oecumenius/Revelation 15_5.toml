The tent of testimony, the tent that had been compacted in the wilderness, that tent which Bezalel the chief craftsperson of the works then made had the custom to call in the divine Scripture (see Ex. 35:30), because it was the tent of the testimonies and commandments of God. For there was the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, the table, the altars of incense and of offerings, the lampstand (see Ex. 31:7-8), and all that God commanded the divine Moses to construct, saying, "and you shall make for me according to all that I show you on the mountain" (Ex. 25:9); and by metaphor from the ancient tent and also the heavenly temple which is what it is called, it was named the tent of testimony.
