“For the joy that was set before him” can be understood also as Gregory says: although it was possible for him to remain in his own personal glory and divinity, he not only humbled himself to the very point of the form of a slave, but he also endured the cross and despised its shame.Therefore he says that he is able to reward you for all your afflictions for his sake. For not only was he crucified, but also he sat down at “the right hand of God,” the right hand and the throne giving him the same honor.
