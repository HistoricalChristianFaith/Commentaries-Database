He says, And it deceives the inhabitants of the earth by signs: for it performs signs, deluding the eyes of the spectators, just as the magicians did before Pharaoh. For both they and this one were under the command of one and the same deceptive demon. 

Rightly did he say that it was working the signs in the presence of the beast. For since it will erect an image as a monument, which it will compel everyone to worship, it will in truth consummate its signs by making the image a god, because it is in virtue of the image that it is able to do these things. 

He says, And its task was to give breath to the image. For they say that many of the images sweat and appear to speak by the work of the Devil. 

He says, too, that the Antichrist gives the mark and seal of his own name, without which no one can either buy or sell. 

He says, This calls for wisdom: let him reckon the name of the beast, and by means of the reckoning let him find it. I will not say, he says, that this form of reckoning is strange or unusual, nor that it is named for concealment or doublemindedness, but it is a well-worn method of reckoning known to people, which calculates the number to be six hundred and sixty-six. 

Although this number applies to many other appropriate names and titles, it applies especially to these: Lampetis, Benediktos, and Titan [all of which fit the number]. Though Titan is spelled with “i,” one can also spell it with a diphthong, for if Teitan is derived from teisis [stretching], and the word teinō and the future tenō, it must properly be written with a diphthong, like phtheirō from phtherō, and speirō from sperō. 

“The conqueror” is also a title, for perhaps he gave himself this name, because he will make war and root out the three horns or, in other words, the kings. See what Daniel says about them in his eighth vision. He says, “I considered” his “horns,” that is, of the fourth beast, “and see, there came up among them another little horn, before which three of the former horns were uprooted from its presence; and see, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of a man, and a mouth speaking great things.” So he is the unstable one, the evil guide, the truly noxious one, the ancient sorcerer, the unjust lamb. Although he might have been given these names by his opponents, 

he will not only not feel disgraced at being called by these names, but will even rejoice in such titles, since he is not ashamed to call himself thus. In hitting at such wicked and abominable choices, the wise apostle says, “whose glory is in their shame.” 

Since, then, many names have been proposed, anyone can apply to the accursed demon the one that is most appropriate.
