I urged you to come to me quickly.

For what reason does Paul call Timothy to himself to whom the Church of Ephesus had been entrusted? Since Paul being in prison, he was not able to leave. Therefore, he wishes Timothy to come to him, both because he is alone, and because he had given him certain instructions.

come to me quickly. Paul did not say: Meanwhile, while I am still alive: for he did not want to sadden Timothy.
