By way of digression the vision related the attacks upon the two witnesses or prophets and discussed everything about them. The vision now returns to the previous narrative from which it departed. It has spoken of the future reward of the saints and that those from the nations were more numerous than those from Israel, and those who pleased God in the New Testament more numerous than those who pleased him in the Old Testament. And, it says, when the seventh angel blew his trumpet “there were voices in heaven saying, ‘The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of God and of his Christ.’ ” To be sure, God always is king and has never begun nor indeed shall ever cease to rule the heaven and the earth and that which is visible and invisible in them, for he is without beginning and without ending Master and Lord of all things. However, since also people take the title of “king” upon earth and after a manner God has those who reign with him, when the earthly kingdom of people is dissolved at the consummation of the present age, God alone will rule. And for this reason it says that “the kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of God and of his Christ,” because those people who rule on the earth and the tyrannical demons have been destroyed and brought to an end.

When the voice was heard, “the elders worshiped God,” bringing their own thanksgiving and saying, “We give you thanks, O God, the Almighty, who is and who was.” The phrases who is and who was are fitting to be used of the holy Trinity, although usually who is is used of the Father and who was of the Son. For “to be” is true of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and we speak rightly when we say “was” of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit. Therefore, the thanksgiving of the elders is ascribed to the holy Trinity. For it says, “You have taken your great power” from those on the earth, and you have taken your rule which you gave to them, and you now alone rule. And since the earthly kingdom is destroyed, naturally “the nations raged,” for they had been deprived of their dominion—by nations he speaks of the ranks of the demons and of unfaithful people. “But your wrath has come,” it says, “and the lot of the nations to be judged and to give reward to your servants the prophets and the saints.” Although, it says, you exercised great long-suffering toward them in the past, they made no use of your kindness, and now, that is, in the day of judgment, you have brought your wrath against them, and that fate that has been determined for the nations has come and is present. And what is this? This, that they are judged and that recompense is given to the saints who had suffered evil from them, and that they who had corrupted the earth by polluting it with their sins be destroyed by the recompense of punishment.

“And the temple of God in heaven was opened,” it says, “and the ark of his covenant was seen in his temple.” When this had been said, those good things, which had been hidden, and in addition certain new mysteries were seen by the saints. For this is the significance of the ark of the covenant being opened. And [Paul] shows that the good things of the coming age are hidden from people at the present time by saying, “What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, that God has prepared for those who love him.” And that there will be certain mysteries and another knowledge that is now unknown, the Lord shows when he said, “I shall not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” While the saints have been thought worthy of these things, for the sinners “there were flashes of lightning, voices, and thunder, earthquakes and heavy hail.” This is the third woe. From that which is familiar to us, the passage depicts those punishments and terrors from God that come upon the wicked.
