He calls the altar a “censer,” because it receives incense. When Christ appears, the prayers of the saints, which are by nature fragrant but made even more fragrant by the cooperation of the holy angels, are brought to him by those angels that govern us as though they were his spoils and the first offerings of homage given to him. And for this reason it is said that “much incense was given to him.” It is clear that the governance of people was given to the angels from God that they might make our prayers acceptable to him. “And the smoke of the incense rose with the prayers of the saints from the hand of the angel.” You see that the prayers of the saints are made more fragrant by the angel and rendered worthy to be offered before God.
