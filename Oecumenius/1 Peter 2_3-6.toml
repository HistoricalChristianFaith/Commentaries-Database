If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good: to whom coming as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and honorable, you also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. Therefore, it is also contained in the Scripture: Behold, I lay in Sion a chief cornerstone, elect, precious, and he who believes in Him will by no means be put to shame. [Isa. 28:16]
For when you have tasted, that is, when you have progressed through the practice of the sacred commandments according to the Gospel, you have recognized the sweetness of the doctrine by sense: for sense is more effective than any word for knowledge, since that which reaches experience is more pleasing than any word. Therefore, as you have tasted the Lord is good, show the goodness of sweetness to others, and apply yourselves to Him as to a living stone, rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and honorable, who has also been proclaimed through the prophets: being bound to one another in love, and being fitted together for the completion of a spiritual house, having no care for contempt among men: for neither did Christ, the cornerstone, have that care, who was rejected by them: and being built up and perfected into a spiritual house by yourselves, demonstrating a holy priesthood, offer spiritual sacrifices, which are far more acceptable to God than sacrifices lacking reason. For you cannot, without a firm bond of mutual love, offer pure sacrifices to God. For it is said: "Lifting up holy hands without anger and disputes." (1 Tim. 2:8) For how can one who strives to unite himself with God through prayer achieve this, while separating himself from his brother through anger and wicked disputes?
