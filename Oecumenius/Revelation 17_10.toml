"And" he says "there are seven kings: five have fallen, one is, another has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a little while." Appropriately he regards the kings as the heads; for the kings are the headship of Roman dominion. What then? He said that of all those who reigned in Rome, only seven were heads of the beast; since these seven are most of all the beast, that is, the Devil, they divided his head against the Christians, having stirred up persecutions against the Church; of whom the first is Nero, the second Domitian, then Trajan, Severus, after him Decius, Valerian, Diocletian; for these among those who reigned in Rome especially persecuted the Church, as Eusebius says in his Chronicles, of whom he says five of the seven fell by death: Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, Decius; and the one remaining is Valerian.

The other says "he has not yet come yet", and that whenever he comes it is necessary that "he remain a little while." But another names Diocletian, after whom the reign over Rome ceased and transferred into the renowned city of the pious Constantine, Constantine himself having assumed the imperial power. And everything was reported very precisely to the evangelist, especially the matters concerning Diocletian, among which it is said also "and whenever he comes it is necessary that he remain a little while," saying "to remain" in reference to the persecution against the Christians; for although he reigned twenty years, having begun the last two with the persecution, he resigned the empire.
