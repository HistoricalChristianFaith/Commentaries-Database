That the divine angel appears from the rising of the sun and not from its setting which brings on the evening is symbolic of the gospel and the promise of its blessings. For the prophet foresaw in the spirit that sealing that now is when he said, “The light of your face was lifted upon us.” Meanwhile he rightly commands that nothing be harmed until those from the Jews who are worthy of being saved should be sealed, so that none of the righteous should suffer any of these calamities along with the sinners.
