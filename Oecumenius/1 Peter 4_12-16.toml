Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you: but rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed; for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you: if you are insulted for the name of Christ, it is glorified in you. Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or any kind of criminal, or even as a bigmouth. But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear that name.
"the fiery trial that has come upon you." this is how you are proven.
"of the name of Christ." Because you are called Christians.
"if you are insulted." It must be understood: Who, to be. The meaning: Who seems to be blasphemed by the spirit of God among the wicked, but is glorified in you. How? Because while they falsely accuse you, confusion is indeed poured back upon them, but glory upon you.
"even as a bigmouth," who curiously scrutinizes what belongs to others, in order to have an occasion for slander. This, however, is the disposition of a wicked and deceitful mind, and one that is quick and ready for every evil.
