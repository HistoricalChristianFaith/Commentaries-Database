And all who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived. But you remain in the things you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for criticism, for correction, and for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.

And what am I saying about myself? For all who desire to live piously will be persecuted, Paul says, persecution not only from the idolaters but also tribulations and temptations. For the way of life is narrow and afflicted. (Matt. 7:14)

in Christ Jesus. For this alone is a godly life, the one in Christ Jesus.

will be persecuted. Such is the nature of things. Since the present life is not for the godly, but for the wicked. For no one lives in peace who wages war and shoots arrows.

will grow worse and worse. For to grow is split in the middle, both for the better or for the worse. Therefore, these will grow towards the worse. For by interpreting what worse is, Paul said that they themselves will be led into error and will get it wrong.

But you remain in the things you have learned. Likewise said David, Do not envy the wicked, nor desire to be with those who do evil. (Ps. 24:1)

you have learned, Paul says, that is, you learned with certainty.

knowing from whom you have learned them. Paul states two reasons why he must remain committed. And because you have not learned from just any common person, but from Paul; and because a deep root has been placed in you by the Scriptures, having been written a long time ago. However, he calls the Sacred Letters Scripture because they are inspired by God.

which are able to make you wise for salvation. He will not allow you to suffer anything foolish, like most do. For the one who knows the Scriptures, as one ought to know them, would never be put to shame.

for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. But it makes you wise, not according to the external wisdom that is in words and deceit, but to salvation through the faith in Christ. For the holy Scriptures, and the wisdom from them, lead to the faith of Christ.

All Scripture is God-breathed [θεόπνευστος] and profitable. Having spoken many ways of comfort, Paul now speaks of the greatest, that which comes from the reading of the Scriptures. For he is about to say something sad, namely about his own death. But if Timothy must read, how much more must we?

for teaching. Since good things teach both lessons and actions.

for criticism. Concerning the refutation of falsehoods.

for correction. To correct the brothers.

for training in righteousness. For the training and leading into righteousness. For from these things, Paul says, something perfect [ἄρτιον] comes to be. A perfect person is one who is always equal, neither leaning downwards with a saddened spirit nor rising and swelling in prosperity, but always remains the same in unequal circumstances.

equipped for every good work. Not merely participating but being equipped and complete.
