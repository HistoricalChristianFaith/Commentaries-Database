And out of his mouth, namely of the commander-in-chief, a sword proceeds. Therefore the divine prophet gives the sword to the Lord's thigh for use placed a little before (Ps. 44:4); but the vision, writing more precisely, presents it at the mouth. By which it is signified that by the word of God all things subsist, and whoever transgresses it in any way will not go unpunished, so that by him he may strike the nations. What kind of nations? Those who join with the Antichrist against the servants of Christ and are placed under him.

And he says that he shall rule them with a rod of iron; for the Lord, being supremely good and merciful, would shepherd these nations about whom the word speaks with a shepherd's and consoling rod, "leading them to a place of pasture and nourishing them at waters of rest." (Ps. 22:2) But since they have not willed this, they shall be shepherded with an iron rod, that is, with strict and deadly discipline. For whom the word does not reform, those it certainly submits to punishment. And because the iron rod denotes strict and punitive action, the prophet, intending to signify the rule of the Romans about which Daniel says, "Arise, devour much flesh," (Dan. 7:5) said to God, "You shepherd them with an iron rod: as with earthen vessels you will crush them." (Ps. 2:5) But when the season was favorable God shepherded by means of that; in the last time by means of this.

And he treads the winepress of the fierceness and wrath of Almighty God. The Lord in the Gospels said concerning the heavenly Father, "The Father judges no one; and he gave all judgment to the Son." (Jn. 5:22) It is therefore most fittingly said in the Revelation that he himself treads the winepress of the fury of the anger of God; for by judgment and recompense of the wicked he fulfills the paternal will and becomes the fulfiller of the righteous anger of the Father.
