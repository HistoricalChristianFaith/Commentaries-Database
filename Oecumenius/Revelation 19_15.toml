The vision places [the sword] in the mouth. In this way it is indicated that all things have their existence by the Word of God and that whoever in any way disobeys him will not remain unpunished. “So that with it he might smite the nations.” Which nations? Those that are arrayed with the antichrist for war against the servants of Christ and have been gathered under him. “And he will rule them,” it says, “with a rod of iron.” Since he is intrinsically good and merciful, the Lord desired to rule these nations … with a staff of comfort, as would a shepherd and to lead them to “green pastures and to nourish them with the waters of rest.” But since they did not wish this, they will be governed with a “rod of iron,” that is, with severity and death. For certainly punishment awaits those whom the Word does not reform. To indicate that the rod of iron is that of severity and punishment, the prophet suggests the rule of the Romans72 about which Daniel spoke in saying, “Arise, devour much flesh,” when he spoke to God, saying, “You will rule them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces as a potter’s vessel.” However, when there existed a favorable time, God ruled them with the former rod, but at the last time, he will rule them with this latter rod. “He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.” In the Gospels, the Lord says of his own Father, “The Father judges no one but has given all judgment to the Son.” Most appropriately, therefore, it says in the Revelation that “he will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God.” For through the judgment and recompense of the wicked, he fulfills the will of his Father in that he fulfills the righteous anger of the Father.
