Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of God's elect and the knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness, in the hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the beginning of time, but has now been revealed in his times his message through his preaching, which was entrusted to me, according to the command of our Savior God, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the Gospel, to Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

Paul places no distinction here; elsewhere indeed a servant of Christ, but an apostle of God, now truly in a different manner.

according to the faith. Because of faith, that is, because the chosen vessels of God have entrusted themselves to me, I have been made an apostle to teach them. Or in this way: I am an apostle to bring the elect to faith through me, and to know the truth of godliness, Christ. Or thus: To become an apostle and for the elect to be believed was not simply given to me, but because I came to know the truth of godliness. But what is this truth? Christ. Well then, the truth concerning godliness, just as with any other truth, is not about godliness as if it were a skill to be learned.

in hope of eternal life. Indeed, to know the truth itself for its own sake is a great reward beyond thousands, but now the generous God also gives, besides this very reward, eternal life. For it is said to be for the knowledge of the truth, of the life that is based on hope, eternal. And the term "eternal," making a comparison to the Jews: for they had the promise of present life.

which God, who never lies. If God is without deceit, He will certainly fulfill what He has promised.

promised before the beginning of time. Not by a later decree or repentance, Paul says, did God determine this, but from the beginning. The greatest honor is that we were loved from the beginning.

but has now been revealed. What did God reveal in his own times and appropriate seasons? The life which he had promised from eternity. For his Word, that is, Christ, is life and the giver of life. Therefore, when Paul said that God had promised life, he immediately added, "revealed in his times his message through his preaching": but through his preaching, as if the Word itself, that is, Christ, is the author and giver of that life. Through preaching indeed, that is, openly and plainly.

which was entrusted to me. From what Paul says: It has been entrusted to me, and, according to the command, he signified that it must necessarily be done and, without making any excuse, whether willing or unwilling, to preach. This also you, he said, do, O Titus.

to Titus, my true child. For one is a child because they have been baptized by them, but not legitimately, because they are sinful. The reason for you being my child, Paul says, is shared faith. He praises Titus as having nothing more than faith in him.

Another way. Titus, the child of Paul, as he was taught faith by him, and according to common faith, that is, from baptism, is a brother of Paul. For there is one Father, Christ, and one mother, the baptismal font.

Grace, mercy. It is fitting that grace and mercy be prayed for Titus, who is a teacher. For if you do not govern the people, that is, with grace, mercy, and peace, Paul says, the ship of the Church will be overturned.

On the training of teachers for ministry and the rebuke of the disobedient.
