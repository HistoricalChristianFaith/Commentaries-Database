That an equal number from each tribe is said to have been sealed and to have believed indicates the equality of their zeal and unanimity of their faith, although there would have been more from one tribe and less from other tribes of those who were saved and believed on Christ, who although dishonored by the Jews, is worshiped [by us] and by every supernatural creature now and always and forever more. Amen.
