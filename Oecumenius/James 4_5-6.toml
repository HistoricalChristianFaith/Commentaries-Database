Or do you think that the Scripture says in vain, or out of envy? That the spirit desires which dwells in you? But he gives a greater grace?
This signifies something through these means, through the lack of using language, and again through the use of abbreviated wording. Therefore, James says: Indeed, I have criticized you in my own words regarding the correct and blameless use of your wisdom, lest you, abusing it out of arrogance, pollute and deceitfully handle the discourse of doctrine. But if you seek this from Scripture, listen. For it says: "The Lord resists the proud." (1 Peter 5:5) Therefore, I was not speaking absurdly when I said that contempt for divine doctrines arises from pride and a great zeal for the world constitutes hate against God. For if He resists the proud, and we are accustomed to resist enemies, surely the proud must also be numbered among the enemies. For Scripture does not publish difficult precepts to us in vain or out of envy, but to desire or seek the grace that dwells in us through its exhortation: which, when it finds working in us through spiritual modesty, gives a greater grace. Therefore, if you obey the Scriptures, humble yourselves and become lowly before the Lord, and you will find grace through His exaltation. Pride (Ὑπερηφανία), however, is a vice that inflates deeply, which we call elevation: and it differs from arrogance, which is called conceit (οἴῃσις), because the former is exalted by what it has, while the latter is exalted by what does not belong to it in any way. On the contrary, humility or modesty of the mind is a great good. And since both are voluntary for us; whoever exalts himself through arrogance, apart from being condemned by the Lord, is also humbled by Him: exalted through the occasion of the one who had humbled himself out of modesty of spirit: so that, guided by this, he who exercises himself in these things achieves spiritual greatness in the contests.
"Do you think that Scripture speaks in vain, or out of envy?" None of these, but it desires or seeks grace in you through its counsel dwelling within. It is similar through the restraint of the response, as in Job: Do you think I have answered you for any other purpose than to appear just? Indeed, in this place the response: No, is not expressed.
"The spirit desires." It refers to the good intention, as David also says: "With a willing spirit:" (Ps. 50:14) that is, by the Lord's will through which He sends afflictions. And it refers to the right spirit as the right will.
