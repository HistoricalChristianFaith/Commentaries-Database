The war with the Lord and the divine angels was waged by both the Devil and the Antichrist, for he calls him a false prophet of the beastly Devil, and kings who band together with them; but they were defeated sooner than speech.

What do the divine Scriptures say about them? Isaiah says, "Let the impious be taken away, so that he may not see the glory of the Lord," (Isa. 26:10) the sudden annihilation; but the apostle, "whom the Lord will consume by the breath of his mouth." (2 Thess. 2:8) What is swifter than to breathe upon and blow the enemies away?
