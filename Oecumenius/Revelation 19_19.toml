And they waged war against the Lord and his holy angels, that is, the devil and the antichrist—for it calls the latter the “false prophet” of that brutal devil—and the kings who are arrayed with them. However, they were defeated more quickly than a word [is spoken]. For what do the divine Scriptures say about them? Speaking of their sudden destruction, Isaiah says, “Let the ungodly be taken away, that he not see the glory of the Lord.” And the apostle says, “whom the Lord will slay with the breath of his mouth.” For what is shorter than to breathe or to blow upon one’s enemies?
