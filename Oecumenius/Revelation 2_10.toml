Do not fear anything, he says, of what you are about to suffer. behold, the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison, so that you may be tested; and you will have a trial for ten days. For indeed by the power of the Devil, men do evil to the godly. But God consents, testing them more thoroughly through trials. But take heart, he says, your suffering is brief and short-lived.

Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life. This is true: for it has been said, "He who endures to the end will be saved," (Matt. 10:22) but not the one who throws their shield [ῥίψασπις] and, having grown weak, turns away from the struggles.
