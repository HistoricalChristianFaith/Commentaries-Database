"Therefore, strengthen your limp hands." Limp, loosened. He spoke of the whole by mentioning a part. For not only the hands and knees were loosened by afflictions, but together with the whole body, both mind and soul. Indeed, this is caused by deep sadness and sorrow.

However, he did not speak of the knees and hands, but of the thoughts that limp and are loosened by a multitude of afflictions and temptations.

"and make straight paths for your feet," or "and make straight paths for your footprints": as if speaking to the runners and boxers themselves. He indicates, however, that it is necessary for thoughts to be confirmed (which arise not from hatred, but from God's governance, corrections, and afflictions) and thoughts about faith and doctrines. For when they were still infants, they clung to certain Jewish matters in life and conduct. Let not the initiated evil (for this he calls a limp) become incurable, but rather let it be corrected. Behold, he has clearly admitted repentance, and take note of this because of the Novatians.
