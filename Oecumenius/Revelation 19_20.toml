"And those two," he says, "were cast alive into the lake of fire, and the rest were slain by the sword." O excess of justice! He did not deem the authors of the war and those co-responsible worthy of the same punishment; but the two, namely the Devil and the Antichrist, were condemned to fire, in which they will live forever, for this is hinted by their being cast alive into the fire; the rest were slain by the sword. By far it is preferable to give judgment by the sword briefly than by fire.
