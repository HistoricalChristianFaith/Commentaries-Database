who forbid marriage, abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful who know the truth.

who forbid marriage. What then? Do Christians not hinder from marrying? By no means. "Marriage is honorable in all things, and the bed undefiled." (Heb. 13:4) But those who do not wish to marry are urged to abstinence. And those who hinder marriage are said to hinder on account of impurity.

abstain from foods. It is not a mistake or a lapse in elegance of speech when it says, "to abstain from foods", which seemed to some not even a matter of apostolic vision, but rightly expressed according to the Attic custom (dialect). Just as the phrase, "He prevented him from doing improper things," does not mean that he encouraged him to do improper things; and likewise, "He deterred him from offending friends," does not mean offending friends, but rather the opposite. And again, "He prevented him from stealing," does not mean that he permitted theft. And, "He prevented ceasing from speaking," instead of, "He kept away from such an action." Thus also, "They prevented abstaining from foods," instead of, "They prevented from eating." And this usage is also frequent among outsiders.

created to be received [μετάληψιν] with thanksgiving. See how Paul expelled luxury in the name of participation [μεταλήψεως]. For to be received [μετάληψιν] signifies a measured reception [μεμετρημένην]. And he did not expel luxury as something unclean, but as something obstructive due to excess and, as it were, a rupture of the soul.

To the faithful, God has created foods to be received [μετάληψιν] thankfully. But not to the unbelievers anymore. For by their own laws they shut themselves off from them.

who know the truth. The Jewish rites were indeed a shadow; now the truth has come. Many things were forbidden to them, not because they were impure, but to restrain indulgences. But the truth speaks of the faith which is in Christ.
