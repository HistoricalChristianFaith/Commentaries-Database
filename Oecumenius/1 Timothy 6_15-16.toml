which in its own times he will show, the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen nor can see; to whom be honor and eternal power. Amen.

which in its own times. That is, to the appropriate, the appointed times. Therefore, do not be upset that it has not already happened.

the blessed and only Sovereign. These things have been said about the Son. For the one who is coming shows the presence. But the Father will not come, but the Son, for judgment; these things have been said concerning the one who is coming.

the blessed, the self-blessedness. For all sorrow and pain have fled from him. Jesus is both a ruler and a good king. Therefore, the earthly ones should not be feared by us.

and only Sovereign. Where you might hear about one of the three holy Persons, this or that one alone, do not accept what is said of the other two by way of contrast, but rather about those who do not exist, yet are called gods. For behold, now speaking about the Son these things, which elsewhere have also been said about the Father and about the Spirit, He said, The Only one.

— [OECUMENIUS] who alone has immortality. How does he say about God that He alone has immortality, when both angels and souls and demons have immortality? Therefore, when he says about God: "Who alone has immortality," he either takes away immortality from those we mentioned, or he lies. And we say that those about whom the address is do not have immortality, but they partake in it, by the grace of Him who alone by nature is immortal. For this has been given to them by God. For God is the one from whom we all partake, just as we do with other things, so immortality is compared to that which is more excellent. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f. 15ν; B f. 211ν; G f. 300r] —

dwelling in unapproachable light. Which itself is immortality and inaccessible light, do you think it is limited to a place? Is light one thing and the light itself another? Yet it is the light itself. Do you see that when we want to say something great, the tongue becomes powerless? It is truly called unapproachable because no one can approach the shining mind, "whom no man has seen." For no one has seen the divinity of the Son, just as neither the Father nor the Spirit; for he was seen according to the flesh.

to whom be honor and eternal power. If his honor and power will be eternal, certainly his appearance will be as well. For he promised: "And behold, I am with you all the days." (Matt. 28:20)

A guide for the wealthy towards true life.
