The first act of my words and interpretations has indeed been accomplished; now again another target must be struck, showing what is the exhortation to the churches. Therefore, first to the church in Ephesus, as presiding over the rest of Asia, it is commanded to write.

He referred to the church in Ephesus in an indirect way as the angel of the church in Ephesus. For his angel, the protector of the church, has not sinned in a way that requires repentance upon hearing; he is the most holy one and, because of this, being at the right hand of the Lord, he bears this sign of his natural purity and radiant brilliance. Why was it necessary to say to the one who was exchanging words to write to the evangelist? For the divine angel was present and heard the things being said; for he was on the right hand of the one speaking, and finally, the holy one himself, interpreting the vision shown to him, says: He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. For he did not say this to the angels of the churches, but to the churches themselves. Therefore, in the other visions wherever you find them, write these things to the angel of this church, that the words are not about the angel, but about the church. What does he command to be written to the church in Ephesus?

It is similar to saying, "this is what the one who surrounds, holds sway over, and binds together both the holy angels in heaven and the men on earth," for these are the seven stars. For these are the seven lampstands, as has been said before; because He walks in the midst of those who worship Him, and through the prophet He says: "I will dwell among them and walk among them." (Lev. 26:12)
