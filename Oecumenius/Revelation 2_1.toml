He speaks periphrastically of the church in Ephesus as an “angel of the church in Ephesus.” For the guardian angel of the church has not sinned, so that it requires the admonition to repent. He is rather most holy and for this reason exists at the right hand of the Lord, giving as proof of this the purity of his nature and flashes as of light. Moreover, what need would there be for him who is conversing with the Evangelist to say, “write to him [the angel],” since the holy angel was present and was listening to the conversation (being on the right hand of the one speaking)? And, finally, the saint himself interprets the vision seen by him and says, “He who has ears, let him hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.” He did not say “to the angels of the churches” but “to the churches.” And so, also in the remaining interpretations you will find the words “write the following to the angel of the church,” not that he is speaking about the angel but about the church.
