And he says I saw no temple in it; for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple. For what need is there of a temple when He is present and in a certain sense cohabiting with the saints of God and is seen face to face as far as possible? For the divine apostle called the present knowledge of God "through a mirror and in a riddle"; but the future, "face to face." (1 Cor. 13:12)

But naturally one might ask, what then? We have already invoked God the Almighty, and the Father of the Lord and of the Lamb, the Son of God; shall we not also recall the Holy Spirit? One must say to him: saying, "O this one," the Lord and God named the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, for God did so; and again saying, "the Lord God Almighty," he signified the Holy Trinity by the three names. But someone might also ask this: why, then, having been reminded of the venerable Trinity by the saying "the Lord God Almighty are its temple," is the Lamb, who is Christ, counted to us from the outside, so that we should no longer conceive a Trinity? May it not be so, I should say to him. For we are not taught so, but a memory is borne of both the Holy Trinity and of the Lamb, the sense of the statement signifying that the one who was incarnate is of the Holy Trinity, and that after the flesh the Son fills the Holy Trinity and is not now in heaven separated from the flesh. For he indicated the Son incarnate by periphrasis both by "God who is the Son," and by "the Lamb," which again is the same Christ incarnate, consubstantial with us and enlivened intelligibly; in whom the Word is united to the particular flesh according to hypostasis.
