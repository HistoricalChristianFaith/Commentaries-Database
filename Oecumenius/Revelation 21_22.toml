What need is there of a temple when God is present and in some manner lives with the saints and when God’s face is to some extent made visible? For the holy apostle has said that in the present age the knowledge of God is “in a mirror” and “in darkness” but that in the coming age such knowledge will be “face to face.” Someone might reasonably ask, “Why did he mention God the Almighty, that is, the Father of the Lord and the Lamb, the Son of God, but did not yet mention the Holy Spirit?” To such a person one must respond, “When he says the Lord and God, he is naming the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, for these are God. And further, when he says the Lord God the Almighty he indicates the holy Trinity by the three designations.” But someone might inquire further, “Why, then, having mentioned the venerable Trinity by the words ‘the Lord God the Almighty is its temple,’ does he make special mention of the Lamb, who is Christ, so that we no longer are to consider the Trinity?” Let it not seem to him to be so, for we are not taught to think that! Rather, when it mentions the holy Trinity and the Lamb, the passage indicates that one of the holy Trinity has become incarnate and that with his flesh the Son fills the holy Trinity and even now in heaven is not without his flesh. For figuratively he signified the Son who became flesh through the name God, who is the Son, while by “Lamb” he indicated the very same Christ incarnated, consubstantial with us and endowed with a rational soul, to which flesh the Word was united hypostatically.
