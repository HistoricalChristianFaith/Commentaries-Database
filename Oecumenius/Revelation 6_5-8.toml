The third mercy of Christ to us broke the third seal, and brought us from condemnation back to God the Father. This mercy is his saving teaching and the benefits effected through his divine miracles. For these contributed to the destruction of the Devil. For through them we came to know who was naturally and truly God, “so that we might not be children, tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine,” and might not worship what our hands had made, exchanging the destructive demons for the glory of God. For the divine teaching of the Lord drew to itself, as leaven draws flour, those who were being taught by the Lord’s voice, and were receiving the benefit of his miracles, which healed their souls more than their bodies. 

After this, a black horse came out, and its rider had a balance in his hand: the black horse represents sorrow and grief, now that the destruction of the Devil had been achieved by the divine instructions. On this account the Devil was grieving for his release, which was being deferred for so many ages. The balance is the symbol of equity and righteousness. For “the judge of righteousness had taken his seat on the throne. He rebuked the tribes” of demons, and the impious one, their leader, was destroyed. 

The balance therefore is the symbol of the righteous judgment of the Lord on our behalf, so that we may also say boldly to him, “You effected judgment and justice for me,” so that we gentiles may know that we are human beings, and that we may not be like beasts dragged along “with bit and bridle” and led astray by the destructive tyrants. 

And, he says, I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, but do not harm the oil and the wine.” The gospel and the teaching is described allegorically by Holy Scripture as seed, for it is written in Matthew, “The sower went out to sow,” and again the better-disposed of the slaves said to their lord, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?” Some of the seed is wheat, signifying the proclamation of the gospel as being the proper food for mature people, who “have their senses trained to discriminate between good and evil.” What is the barley? It is the teaching according to the law of Moses, as being ripe fodder, more fitting than wheat, for nourishing the infant Israel. 

Therefore, the speaker, God, in the midst of the four living creatures says, “A quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius.” These words symbolize that there was a famine and scarcity among people of that time of the teaching both of the gospel of the Lord and of the law, as Scripture says, “I will give them not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.” 

Even if those who despise all teaching and attention had especially to suffer this and that, he says, “do not harm the oil and the wine, forgive them and do not bring any punishment on them; I shall still have mercy on them,” says God, “since they have hope of being spiritually gladdened by the divine proclamations of my only Son.” For these are “the wine that” spiritually “makes glad a man’s heart.” 

So he who was going to set out against the former disobedience would harm the mercy which was to be shown to them by God and the spiritual gladness which would come with faith. And why do I say only “spiritual”? For the teachings of the Lord also afforded discernible grace. And the prophet is witness when he said to the Lord, “grace has been poured upon your lips.” Josephus the Jew also, constrained by the truth, wrote the following about him in his eighteenth book of The Antiquities: 

“There was about this time a wise man, Jesus, if indeed one ought to call him a man, for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of people who gladly speak the truth. He won over many Jews and many of the Greeks. He was the Christ. When Pilate, on the indictment of men of the highest standing among us, had condemned him to be crucified, those who had first come to love him did not cease loving him. On the third day he appeared to them restored to life, for the holy prophets had prophesied these and countless other marvelous things about him. And the tribe of the Christians, so called after him, has still not now disappeared.” 

The breaking of the fourth seal and of the rest marks the beginning of release from sin resulting from Adam’s transgression. For release from this clearly brings affinity with God. For if “our sins separate us from God,” as Isaiah says, their destruction clearly restores our intimacy with him. What effected this release? 

“The blows” struck on Christ, by which we have been set free. For since by the pleasure of tasting we were condemned, we were healed by the opposite. Blows are the opposite of pleasure, with the pain which is felt from them. Christ paid on our behalf everything on account of which we had been brought down to the corruption of death, and he made payment through opposites: by “obedience” he paid for our “disobedience,” by painful submission he paid for the pleasure [of sin], by his hands stretched out boldly on the cross he paid for the hands which rashly grasped the forbidden tree. 

After this, he says, by the summons of the fourth of the holy living creatures there came a greenish horse, and its rider’s name was Death, and Hades follows him, and authority was given them over a fourth of the earth. The greenish horse is the symbol of wrath, for bile, as doctors call it, is greenish. 

Death and Hades were sent for the spiritual overthrow of the sinful demons and to exact retribution from them for the destruction of humankind. But since the saving passion of Christ, by which he paid for all our sins, had not yet been described in the vision, the complete destruction of the demons had not yet come about, but only the fourth part. 

This destruction he calls metaphorically slaughter and a famine of those who were formerly worshiping them and death, so laying bare the end of their tyranny by death, and their destruction by the wild beasts of the earth; he calls the demons’ passions of arrogance and vanity wild beasts of the earth. These passions consume and devour them as they are being ousted from their dominion over human beings. Even though they are naturally incorporeal, the demons are earthly in that they exult in their earthly wrigglings.
