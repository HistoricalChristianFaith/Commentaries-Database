The brilliant and lofty mid-heaven is by nature an emblem of the glorious angel. But he possessed an eternal gospel; for from eternity the lesson is salvation: to fear the Lord, since "the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom," (Prov. 1:7) and love is the end (see 1 Tim. 1:5). Yet he says the cruel and soul-destroying beast, the Antichrist, must not be feared, even if he threatens and acts more harshly.
