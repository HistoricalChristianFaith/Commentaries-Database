“Mid-heaven” signifies the exalted and sublime nature of the holy angel. He had “an eternal gospel.” The saving teaching that one should fear the Lord is from eternity, since the “beginning of wisdom is the fear of God, and its end is love.” On the other hand, it says, the harsh beast who works spiritual death, the antichrist, is not to be feared, even though he may threaten and do the most amazing feats. For “the hour of his judgment has come,” and he who is fearful to those who live upon the earth will punish him in a way wholly unprecedented. Rather, [we should] “worship him who made” every creature rather than worship the wicked devil who is hated by God.
