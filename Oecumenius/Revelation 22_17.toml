“And the Spirit,” that is, the prophetic Spirit, “and the bride,” the church that is universal and in every place, say, “Come!” We are instructed to seek the second coming of the Lord, and indeed to pray for it. For to be sure, whoever prays “thy kingdom come” to God seeks the kingdom of Christ, which is also the kingdom of the Father and of the Spirit. “And let him who hears say, ‘Come,’ ” it says. Everyone who hears these words, even you, John, ought to pray for the kingdom of the coming of Christ. He says this to exhort everyone to the works and practices of righteousness. For no one who is not fully aware of righteousness in himself would pray for the coming of Christ, at which he will demand an accounting of the life of all.

Since the time of my coming will come, says the Lord, place your mouth on the fountain of life, that is, on the practice of virtue. Already before the Lord came, Isaiah had said the same thing when he urged, “All who have no money, go and buy, and drink without money and without price.” … The acquisition of virtue through struggles and labors is received as a free gift, since “the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us,” as the all-wise Paul says.
