“Let brotherly love continue.” Let it be unwavering, do not allow it to escape from you.
“Do not forget to show hospitality.” For as they had been plundered of their possessions, they might perhaps have been more sparing. But by saying, let it remain, and do not forget, it shows that they had long possessed these virtues, but now, due to the continuous hardships, they were in danger of becoming indifferent to these virtues; therefore, Paul again encourages them towards these things.
“in this way, some have been unaware while they entertained angels.” Thus, Paul says, great is hospitality, so that it became a cause for those around Abraham and Lot to receive the angels. (Gen. 18) And the fact that they were unaware, instead of not knowing, that the guests were angels, and yet they received them so hospitably; therefore this great reward for them; for if they had known, they would have done nothing great.
“as bound.” For he who is bound to someone, even if he wishes to forget, cannot.
“and those who suffer adversity.” Of those who are suffering either in prisons, or in famine, or in another affliction. For if someone were to consider that he himself is surrounded by a body that suffers similarly, he would have more compassion for them, both because of sympathy, and because of the fear that he too might experience similar sufferings from inhumanity.
“Marriage is honorable in all things.” How much indeed is the discourse about moderation! For also earlier, recalling sanctification, Paul spoke about this, and again after this he will speak about prostitutes and adulterers. Therefore, in all things, that is, not honorable in this part and not in another, but entirely throughout honorable and unblemished, let it be. In all ways and at all times; not in distress, but in ease let it not be.
“but God will judge fornicators and adulterers.” And here, along with punishments, is the prohibition of fornication and adultery. For God will judge, or rather condemn. And rightly so. For if marriage is permitted, and it is lawful to fulfill desire without sin, what excuse will there be for adulterers and fornicators?
“Let your conversation be without greed.” Paul did not say, "Do not possess anything"; (and it is clear from what he leads to: Being content with what is present, whatever it may be.) but rather, "You have a philosophical and ungreedy opinion." For he himself has said:
“for he has said, ‘I will never leave you, nor forsake you.’" Since your possessions have been seized; for Paul said: And you have received the confiscation of your possessions with joy (Heb. 10:34); he advises them to be content with what is present; lest they say: With what present things shall we be content? We have been seized, and we have nothing; he says: but even if you have been seized, you can be content with what remains, even if it is very little, because of the one who says, God: 'I will not forsake you,' that is, I will not leave you, nor will I abandon you.
“So that we may boldly say.” If he does not allow it, God does not abandon either, therefore, he says, we must speak boldly the words of David: “The Lord is my helper.” (Ps. 118:6-7) For if God helps, one should not be afraid of those who seize or threaten."
