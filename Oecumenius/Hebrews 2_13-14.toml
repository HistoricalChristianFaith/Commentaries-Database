"I will put my trust in him." Since he previously called Him brother and internally father, he signifies that these indeed are names of kindness and grace, but by nature and truth, God is, he says. For who trusts in anyone else except in God alone? And if he were to say: Do not think that hearing Him being called brother and father refers to someone among the common people, God is, he says, in whom it is written that one must trust.
"Here I am, and the children." Here our Father made Christ. But he says: He gave, on account of humanity, just as it is said: "Afterward I will give you the nations as your inheritance." (Ps. 2:8) "Since, therefore, the sons," that is, men, "have communion with flesh and blood; in the same way," that is, similarly and truly, not according to some fantasy, as certain heretics say, He Himself became a partaker of flesh and blood: so that in this also He might demonstrate the love He has for the sons.
The Father made Christ our own. And He gave, for the sake of humanity. Similar to that, "Ask of me, and I will give you the nations as your inheritance." (Ps. 2:8)
"Therefore", therefore, he says, "the children," that is, the humans, "share in flesh and blood, he likewise," that is, truly and not according to some fantasy, as certain heretics say, He Himself shared in flesh and blood, so that in this also He might demonstrate the love He has for the sons.

We who are numbered among the children have partaken of the blood and flesh of God, that is, we are in blood and flesh, and in perishable and earthly bodies. For this reason, the only-begotten Word of God, being life by nature, partook of the same, and not in any other way, but similarly to us.
"that through death." Then he also speaks of the reason for the Incarnation.
"The," Paul says, "the Devil", who has the power of death, might be destroyed; and he will be destroyed through death, as it is said, O Wisdom of God! Through death, the Devil had the power; through death, he will be abolished. Christ used against the Devil those arms which He himself was powerful with. How then does He rule over death? Because He is the ruler of sin, from which death comes, and He rules over death, that is, sin is the power of death. Therefore, having sin and being its possessor, He has the power of death (for we say that sin is the power of death). So that it might be thus: through His own death, He abolished sin, having the Devil as a servant, which is the strength of the power of death. For if this had not prevailed over man, death would not have entered into the world.
