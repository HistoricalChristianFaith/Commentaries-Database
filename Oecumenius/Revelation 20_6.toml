second death. What sort of death is this? It is that quite clearly which results from sin and is followed by punishment. For just as he has spoken of the first and the second resurrection, so he speaks of the first and second death. The first one is the physical death, which separates the soul and the body, but the second death is the spiritual death, resulting from sin. The Lord said of this, “Do not fear those who kill the body; but rather fear him who can destroy both body and soul in hell.(Mt. 10:28)”
