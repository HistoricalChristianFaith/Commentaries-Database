Blessed therefore is the one who has part in the first resurrection; for of the second resurrection we shall all partake, willingly or unwillingly. But concerning those who are participants in the first resurrection, that is, the faithful, the second death will have no power. What is it? It is the death of sin, that is, and the punishment of that time; for just as he said first and second resurrection, so also first and second death.

And the first death is the physical death, the one having a separation of soul and body; second death is the spiritual death, that of sin, about which the Lord also said, "Do not be afraid of those who kill the body; rather be afraid of him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna." (Matt. 10:28) And the faithful are, he says, priests of God and of Christ; for the faithful have all been shown to be ministers of the evangelical word, concerning whom the prophet, striking his prophetic harp, said "he would appoint them rulers over all the earth." (Ps. 45:16)

And they will reign with him for a thousand years, those of the Incarnation as has been often said.
