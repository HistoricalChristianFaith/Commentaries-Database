The present passage is a repetition of what has been said before; for it does not mean that immediately after the Dragon saw that he had been cast down to the earth, he pursued the woman, but rather that when the Dragon saw himself existing in such evils, and that he had fallen from angelic dignity, he became exceedingly bitter against humanity, and pursued the woman who had borne the Savior of mankind, in order to destroy her. He pursued the woman because he recognized that the one born of her was mightier than he who had been captured, being envious of mankind's salvation through the Lord, and not accepting such a great reversal, that although he himself was cast down from heaven, men from the earth would ascend to heaven through virtue.
