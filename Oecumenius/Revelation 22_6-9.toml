He said, These words are trustworthy: that is, they are true. And the Lord of the spirits of the prophets: by the spirits of the prophets he means the prophetic graces, as wisest Paul says, “And the spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,” and as the blessed prophet Isaiah says, “Because of fear of you, Lord, we have conceived and suffered birth-pangs; we have brought forth the spirit of your salvation, which you have brought about on earth.” 

He says, To show his slaves what must soon take place: for by means of John and his writings everyone has learned what he saw. He was right to say soon, for all time is short (as I said earlier) when compared with the infinite future ages, even though one might think it excessively long. 

This is why he added, See, we are coming soon: blessed are those who keep the [words] of this prophecy: for those who are keeping them through their God-fearing life are eager to avoid falling into the punishments described. 

He says, And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel: this has been interpreted earlier, when we also showed that the doctrines of the atheistic Greeks concerning the national gods among them had nothing in common with the purest doctrines of the church.
