By “all” John means primarily all those who respect the truth, though it is possible that the term should be extended to cover unbelievers as well, since Paul tried to please both Jews and Gentiles. By “the truth itself” he means the fact that Demetrius practices what he preaches. For there are some who sound good when they talk, but their subsequent actions do not live up to what they claim.
