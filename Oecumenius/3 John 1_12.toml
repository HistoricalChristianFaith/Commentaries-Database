Demetrius has been testified by all, and by the very truth itself: but we also bear witness, and you know that our testimony is true.
"by all:" say those who keep the truth.
"and by the very truth itself:" which is the effectiveness of speech. For there are some to whom virtue bears witness, but it is frustrated by ineffective speech or lacking in deeds. If someone accepts the part “by all,” even from the unfaithful, because “all” comprehends everyone, he would not be wrong to take the speech in a good sense. It commands the Jews and Greeks and the Church of God to strive, just as I, John says, please all in all things." (1 Cor. 10:35)
