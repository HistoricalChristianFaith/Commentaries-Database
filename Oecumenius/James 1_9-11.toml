Let the brother who is humble glory, in his exaltation: But the rich, in that he is made humble: because as the flower of the grass he shall pass away. For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it withers the grass, and the flower thereof falls, and the beauty of its appearance perishes: so also shall the rich man fade away in his ways.
Because James likens the wavering, to a wave driven by the wind, who, being inflated, is exalted together with the winds of the sea, but before he is raised, he prostrates himself and gives himself up: but this very thing happens to the wavering one, who, in spite of his pride, does not confirm his petitions in any of the things that are necessary;
therefore, James adds: “Let the brother who is humble glory.” As if he were saying: Whoever wishes to ask for something, let him first ask for what is right, and He will not refuse those who ask. For of these is the kingdom of God and righteousness. (Matt. 6:33) Then let him be tolerant in the petition of such, and let him not depart immediately when he has prayed a little, for that is arrogant; but let him wait until he receives, by enduring with humility.
"Who is humble, in his exaltation." From humility according to God, all good is bestowed upon us. James calls the rich arrogant and proud, whom he also calls humble, because by the very act of being elevated, he is brought low.
"But the rich, in that he is made humble." It would have been more fitting for James to say, "But let the rich man be ashamed in his humility," but avoiding saying it in an offensive manner, he added this instead: “and the beauty of its appearance.” Appearance, that is, face or countenance, He spoke in a critical manner: for this is said of man alone and not of other animals; however, among the quadrupeds, the snout is not called a face. but on birds it is a beak.
“in his ways.” James speaks of ways or paths of the rich, in prosperous success, or business, among which he unexpectedly receives a change to unhappiness and misfortune.
