And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: God was revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, preached among the nations, believed on in the world, received up in glory.

confessedly. For no one doubts this. And faith which is in us is both great and a mystery, and a mystery of devotion, and it has no hesitation. Do you see the steps?

God was revealed in the flesh, etc. Then Paul speaks of the mystery. For He who was revealed to men in the flesh was not judged righteous by human eyes, but by the eyes of the Spirit, who also searches the depths of God. (1 Cor. 2:10)

But he says: He was justified because of the flesh. For since God is God, he is not justified but justifies. This is also what the prophet said: "He who has not committed sin, nor deceit found in his mouth." (1 Peter 2:22) Saint Cyril in the twelfth chapter of the Scholia says: "’He who was revealed in the flesh was justified in the Spirit.’ For in no way was he subjected to our weaknesses.”

seen by angels. For they did not disregard His birth according to the flesh.

— [OECUMENIUS] He was justified in spirit. And by what justification is he justified who is righteousness itself and redemption, the Sun of righteousness according to Malachi? Which indicates the most pure and perfect righteousness, the fulfillment evidently of the legal rights; concerning which John said: "Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness." (Matt. 3:15) For since the law also commanded concerning baptisms, He came to the Jordan to fulfill this as well, just as He fulfilled circumcision and the offerings for the firstborn. But what does He mean by "In spirit"? Israel was bound in the spirit of slavery through the punishing law. For it did not have the spirit of adoption; this has been granted to Christians, as Paul also says: "What is above is Jerusalem the free, which is the mother of us all." (Gal. 4:26) He says therefore, Even if he fulfilled the legal righteous requirements, but not with the spirit of slavery (for how, he who also frees others?), but with the Holy Spirit of adoption, which the genuine Son received according to the human nature, bestowing the gift upon us, and consubstantial with the Spirit, and not for Himself. Just as He cared for and prayed, making our prayers acceptable, and called His own body a temple, causing us to become temples of God. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius] —

For indeed, the righteous according to the Gospel, truly spiritual, have long surpassed many of those who are justified by the law.

— [PHOTIUS] Instead of being justified legally, he was justified spiritually. For he fulfilled the legal commandments not legally, but spiritually. The fact that he was not considered justified by the fleshly and hard-hearted (for they said, "Glutton and drunkard") but was justified by those who are established in the Spirit of God. "For we have seen his glory, glory as of the only begotten," and so on. (Jn. 1:14) [end of the excerpt by Photius] —

seen by angels. (O the mystery! The angels saw Christ with us, when before they had not seen.) Not as by men. Thus Clement in book seven of the Hypotyposes. "He was believed in the world." Truly great is the mystery. For everywhere in the inhabited world he was believed.

received up in glory. For the angels ministered to him as he was taken up on the clouds. Therefore he says, "in glory," because even the ascension itself is glorious.
