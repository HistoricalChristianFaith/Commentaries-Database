Therefore, he says that these are the ones who come out of the great tribulation; for the righteous did not only endure a considerable struggle but also a very great one under the dominion of the Antichrist.

And it says that they washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb; indeed, it was more fitting for the robes dyed in blood to become crimson rather than white. How then have they become white? Because baptism, which is accomplished through the death of the Lord, as it seems to the most wise Paul (Rom. 6:3), acts as a cleanser of all impurity arising from sin, rendering those who are baptized in it white and pure.

But also the partaking of the life-giving blood of Christ grants this: for the Lord says that it is poured out for many and for the forgiveness of many concerning His own blood. (Matt. 26:28)
