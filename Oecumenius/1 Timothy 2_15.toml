Yet she will be saved through childbearing, if they continue in faith and love and holiness with self-control. This is a trustworthy saying.

Yet she will be saved through childbearing. Not only Eve, but every woman. And by "childbearing," it is meant not only to bear children, but also to lead them according to God. What then shall one say, that virgins and barren women, and those without children and widows, are lost? Away with that though! For it does not say that they will not be saved by their own virtue; but that childbearing will also be a means of salvation for them, that is, the acknowledged means of being saved by their own virtue.

if they continue in faith. If Christians have nurtured and remained virtuous. What then if she herself is evil, but nurtures well? It certainly cannot happen that what is bad trains well; yet if it does happen, there will be a reward. But what if being good she nurtures evil? She will die because of the evil of the children. And the priest Eli is witness. (1 Sam. 2-4)

This is a trustworthy saying. Because the fathers, Paul says, will be able to share in the virtue of the children.

On the Virtue of Bishops.
