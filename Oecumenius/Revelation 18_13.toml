And he says horses and chariots and bodies. The word "chariots" is a Latin term; for with the Romans holding sway it is not inappropriate for the divine evangelist to have used a Latin word. The Scripture has put it into Greek. For in Latin the chariot is called rheda [ῥεδιον], and they put a general plural ending in the case; and one ought according to the Romans to say rhedioroum [ῥεδιοροὺμ], as having Hellenized it he wrote a Greek ending, having said rhedōn [ῥέδων], so that the said thing may be such. And he says horses and chariots and bodies, like also horses suitable for chariots, and bodies, that is, cavalry and made for riders.
