And why does the angel say to him, “Put in your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe”? “And he swung his sickle,” it says, “and the earth was reaped.” A “plentiful harvest” is mentioned in the Gospels, while “the laborers are few.” However, in that passage the harvest signified the gathering of the faithful, while here the harvest represents the consummation of humankind, so that, should there be any chaff or impurities in them which is worthy of fire, it might be given over to fire.
