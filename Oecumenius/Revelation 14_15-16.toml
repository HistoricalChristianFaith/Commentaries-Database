And the angel said to him, Send forth your sickle, and reap: for the time to reap is come; for the harvest of the earth is ripe. And he says he cast his sickle upon the earth and it was reaped? A harvest is often spoken of in the Gospels; "but the workers are few." (Matt. 9:37; Luke 10:2) There, the harvest signified the gathering of the faithful; here, it signifies the end of humanity, so that if any in them were chaff, unripe and worthy of fire, it would be delivered to the fire.
