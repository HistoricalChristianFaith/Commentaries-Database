"but he took hold of the seed of Abraham." The term "hetook hold" [ἐπιλαμβάνεται] indicates that we, as humans, flee from him, but Christ pursues, and by pursuing, he reached and took hold. He did not take hold of the nature of angels nor did he assume it, but of human nature.
Then, wishing to signify that Christ came according to the flesh from Judah, he says, "the seed of Abraham."
"Therefore, he had to be made." Since he deemed it necessary to fully partake, from this point onward, he had to be in all respects made similar to humans. For he was born, he grew, he ate, he drank, he slept, he died, he rose again.
"that he might be a merciful." These things, he says, were arranged for no other reason than that he may have mercy on those on earth and lift them up from the grave.
"and a faithful high priest." Faithful, true.For it is the unusual function of the true and real high priest to free those of whom he is high priest from sins. Therefore, in order to offer a sacrifice capable of cleansing us, a man has come and offered himself. Then he explains how this has come to be, and why he is a faithful high priest.
He says, to make atonement for the sins of the people. For this reason, he has come to atone for us and to cleanse us from our sins.
"in the things pertaining to God." In matters that pertain to God. For in these, high priest has come to be, not to demand bodily tithes and first fruits, but he knew that we had become enemies and rejected before God, and having had mercy on us, he gave himself to us as a high priest.
"For because he himself has suffered and been tempted." The statement is humble and not outside the measures of emptiness. Furthermore, it was said also because of the infancy of those who hear. For what does he say?
For because he himself has suffered, that is, since he himself has been tempted in his own body, he will more willingly help those who are being tempted. As he said: Having learned by experience what it is to fall into temptations, not only as God, but also as a man, having learned by experience the passion (he is able, that is, he will more willingly reach out his hand to those who are being tempted).

He can help those who are being tempted, thus it must be understood. For when, he says, the Evil One attacked the sinless body of the Lord and attempted to surround it with temptations (Matt. 4:1-11); (for he attacked, tempting for his own sake; and he was the one inciting the Jews to murder against the Lord) therefore, since he was tempted and suffered while having a sinless body, he possesses righteous and reasonable strength against the Evil One, and is able to rescue those who are being led by sin from the temptations coming from there, and to become a helper to those who are being tempted. For the boldness of the Evil One against the sinless body provided just and reasonable strength to the Lord, to rescue those under sin from the temptations coming from there, and to be found a helper to those who are being tempted.
