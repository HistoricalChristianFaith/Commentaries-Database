This apostle, after calling himself the servant of Jesus Christ, went on to add that he was the brother of James because James was so highly regarded in the church that Jude was bound to benefit from so close an association with him. Note that he refers to his correspondents as those who have been “called,” because it was not they who decided to follow Jesus, but God who reached out to call them to his service.
