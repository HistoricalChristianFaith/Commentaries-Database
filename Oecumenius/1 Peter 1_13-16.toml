Therefore, gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope perfectly for the grace that is to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ, as obedient children, not conforming yourselves to the former lusts, in your ignorance: but as He who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, because it is written: "Be holy, for I am holy." [Lev. 19:2]
For this reason, an exhortation is brought forth from those things which were previously held in honor. For when it was said, The prophets provided you with what concerns your salvation, and these were so admirable that even angels were made agreeable: and that they themselves also demonstrated that these things were agreeable in that they sweetly sang from abundant joy at the birth of Christ, "Glory to God in the highest." (Luke 1:14) Therefore, having said this, he adds for their sake, saying: "Since these things have been administered to you all, both agreeable and most desirable, not only to men but also to angels, therefore do not be negligent in being affected by these things, but directing yourselves and arranging yourselves with courage. For this signifies the girding of the loins: which Job was also commanded by God. (Job 38,40) He explains what he means by loins, saying that they refer to those who are of the mind. Therefore, he says, prepared, perfectly sober, hope perfectly in the grace that is brought to you. Moreover, this is what he said a little earlier, concerning the second coming of the Lord; consider that he did not simply say, "Sober," but added "perfectly," as if the law had provided a slender and introductory soberness.
Conforming [Συσχηματιζειν], however, means to shape and adapt oneself to the present circumstances. This is also what some foolish people now say: Conform yourself to affairs and business. Therefore, it commands to renounce such vanities: whether those who were previously knowledgeable and wise, or those who ignorantly clung to these. But now, he says, you, and those like you, be holy yourselves.
