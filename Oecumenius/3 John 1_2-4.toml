Dearly beloved, I wish that you may prosper in all things and be in good health, just as your soul prospers. I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and bore witness to your truth, as you walk in the truth. I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
"just as your soul prospers." It acts prosperously, namely in the state that is according to the Gospel.
"you walk in the truth." He walks in truth who walks in the righteous simplicity of the Gospel. However, to walk does not refer to the motion of limbs, since such steps, passing from one place to another, are common to all animals that have feet; but it signifies an ordered and measured progress according to the keen affection of the mind, which few attain, even among those who are not lacking in understanding.
"no greater joy than." The term "greater" (µειζοτέραν) according to the practice of the Greek language is not a suitable comparative expression, but it is placed as if seeking a more fervent exaggeration, and thus the comparative is formed from the comparative.
