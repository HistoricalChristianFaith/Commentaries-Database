to Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.

to Titus, my true child. For one is a child because they have been baptized by them, but not legitimately, because they are sinful. The reason for you being my child, Paul says, is shared faith. He praises Titus as having nothing more than faith in him.

Another way. Titus, the child of Paul, as he was taught faith by him, and according to common faith, that is, from baptism, is a brother of Paul. For there is one Father, Christ, and one mother, the baptismal font.

Grace, mercy. It is fitting that grace and mercy be prayed for Titus, who is a teacher. For if you do not govern the people, that is, with grace, mercy, and peace, Paul says, the ship of the Church will be overturned.

On the training of teachers for ministry and the rebuke of the disobedient.
