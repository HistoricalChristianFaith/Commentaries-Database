Since he demonstrated the superiority of our high priest over the former ones, and the superiority of the new covenant over the old one, and the superiority of Christ's offering over the legal sacrifices; and that through it we have been freed from sins, he indeed refreshes the doctrinal discourse, giving the listener a breathing space; but he also very aptly moves on to the discourse concerning life. Pay close attention: for having been reminded of the forgiveness of sins, he subsequently exhorts us not to fall into the same sins again.
"Boldness to enter." Just as, he says, we were previously ashamed, full of sins, so now we have boldness to enter into heaven, because of the forgiveness granted to us.
"to enter the holy places." He speaks of heaven and the progress into the spiritual. By the blood of Jesus. "by the blood." For by the blood of the cross of Christ, we have forgiveness and boldness.
"which He inaugurated for us." It was the entrance of the holy places, and a path leading to it, recently cut. For this, it is said, was inaugurated.
"new." Which in our times, he says, took its beginning. And this is our claim, that in the times around Abraham, this road did not exist, but was established among us.
"and living." For the first way led to death and to disbelief; this one, however, truly brings to life, since it itself lives and endures.

Having said "recent," so that no one might say: "If recent, then it will cease"; for this one too will grow old and become obsolete just as the old covenant will be abolished. He says, however: "But being recent, it will always be new and living, never accepting death and dissolution."

"through the veil." For all these good things have come to us through the flesh of Christ and His sacrifice. This also recently prepared the way to heaven, having walked it first. And rightly is the flesh of Christ called the veil. For when He was lifted up, that is, on the cross, then the things in heaven were revealed, which belong to the veil, and that it concealed the Divinity within itself. And this is also the characteristic of a veil.
"a great priest." This, having, in common. He calls the Lord a priest.

"over the house of God." He speaks of the house of God as the faithful, according to, "I will dwell in them, and walk among them." (Lev. 26:12; 2 Cor. 6:16)

"let us draw near with a true heart." In the faith of Christ with truth, having nothing false or deceitful.
"in full assurance of faith." For hereafter, nothing is visible, neither the temple, that is, the heaven, nor the high priest, that is, Christ, nor the sacrifice, that is, his body, but there is a need for faith. And since there is both believing and doubting, he says, "in full assurance of faith," that is, so that we may be fully informed about these things.
"having our hearts sprinkled." This shows that there is a need not only for faith but also for a righteous life.
"sprinkled." The Jews, he says, sprinkle their bodies; but let us sprinkle and purify our consciences, so that we may not have any evil consciousness of ourselves.
"with pure water," that is, with baptism. For the Jews, by washing, only cleanse the body; but we purify the soul with baptism. For the water we have is pure, that is, purifying.
"let us hold fast the confession."Let us hold fast, he says, the confession of our hope, firm and without wavering. What hope? To hope through the blood of Christ for entrance into heaven. To have our sins forgiven through Him. To be made worthy of adoption through Him.
"For faithful," that is, "true is He who promised." And what did He promise? That we would enter into His kingdom; "for I will," He says, "that where I am, there these may be also." (Jn. 16:24) For "these" He spoke of the faithful.
