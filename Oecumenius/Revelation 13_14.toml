And deceives, it says, those who dwell upon the earth by the signs. For he makes signs indeed, but by charming the eyes of those who see, just as the magicians also did before Pharaoh; for they were directed by one and the same deceiving demon, both those and this one. And it says well that he makes the signs in the presence of the beast. For since he will erect an image for it, which he will also force all to worship, he will perform the signs supposedly by it, as deifying the image, because indeed from it he has the power to do these things.
