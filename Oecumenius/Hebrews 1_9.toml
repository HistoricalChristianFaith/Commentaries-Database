"You have loved righteousness." These humble things are appropriate after the incarnation, as they are able to receive the lowly nature of the flesh.
"therefore God, your God, has anointed you." O God, your God has anointed you. The "you" is through the flesh. For humanity is anointed with the Holy Spirit. It does not operate as it does with mere men, such as prophets and patriarchs. Anointing is, as it were, the entire presence of the anointer. Thus, holy Cyril observed. But see how Eusebius said that Symmachus refers to and rejects this anointing. "Therefore," he says, "God,your God, has anointed you with the oil of joy [χαρᾶς] over your companions."
"With the oil of gladness [ἀγαλλιάσεως]." Indeed, the oil of gladness is the Holy Spirit; the people are partakers of Christ. What he means by this is: Not as ordinary men are anointed, so Christ was anointed with the Holy Spirit to a measure, but all was anointed with the Spirit.
