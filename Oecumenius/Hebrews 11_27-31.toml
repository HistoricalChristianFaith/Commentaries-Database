"By faith, he left Egypt." He went out by faith, so as not to test God whether He saves. And not to test Him was by faith. For believing, he would come and bring out the people.
"not fearing the wrath of the king." And yet, in the Exodus, it is said that he was afraid. But there is nothing contradictory. For he was not afraid to such an extent, but returned again. For he was afraid that he would not return to Egypt anymore. Therefore, the phrase "not fearing the wrath of the king" implies the understanding of returning again. The first time he was afraid, not of the king, but not wanting to throw himself into imminent danger. For this was a test of faith in God.

And that he was not afraid that the anger would be so great as to seek him out after he had fled. Therefore, he did not flee far, but from neighboring places. And this was a matter of faith.

"for he endured as seeing him who is invisible." He saw God, who is invisible, as if he had seen Him with physical eyes. However, he saw Him with the eyes of the mind, and he bravely endured everything, namely the hardships along with the people of God, flight, and all other things. For the sake of great patience, it is important to have God in mind.
"By faith, he kept the Passover." For Moses said: "Mark the doorposts so that you may be saved," (Ex. 12:23) and they believed that they were to be saved. Indeed, they believed that they would be saved through the blood of the lamb, he says, and they achieved this. Therefore, how will you not believe even more that you are to be saved through the blood of Christ, and you will be saved from all who lie in wait for you?
"and the sprinkling of blood." He called the sprinkling of blood the anointing of the doorposts, so that the Destroyer angel would not touch them. This was, however, a type of the blood of the Lamb of God. For through His blood we drive away the destroyer Satan.
“By faith they passed through the Red Sea.” Indeed, they believed that they would pass through, and they did pass through. Such is the power of faith, that it makes possible even those things that are impossible.
"but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same.” For perhaps they suspected that the sea was land, and they also tried to pass through, but their destruction showed that it was truly the sea, and not some kind of illusion. For it was divided beyond its nature for Israel, allowing them to walk on foot; however, it enclosed the Egyptians according to its nature. The purpose, however, was to lead them to believe and hope for the future, and for this reason, he stirred up all this discourse.
“By faith, the walls of Jericho."For they believed that the future would fall, and certainly faith directed even those things that were above nature.
"By faith, Rahab the harlot." For when she had heard the men reporting, she believed and received them, although the others remained unbelieving.
