"now to appear." With the flesh, he says, it appears.
"in the presence of God." What do you say? Unless he had entered into heaven, he would not appear in the sight of the Father, who is present everywhere and fills all things? Do you see that these are humble matters of privilege?
"on our behalf." When the victim of his own body ascended to appear before the Father for us, this is to reconcile us to himself. Indeed, having made mention of the flesh, blessed Paul speaks boldly of all things humble.
"Nor was he to offer himself repeatedly," he says, this is what it means to ascend to heaven. For the offering of many sacrifices in blood is for those who enter into the copies of the true things, but not for the one who has entered into heaven itself.
"as the high priest." Do you see the difference? This one does it annually, but Christ once.
"with blood not his own." This one in the blood of others, of bulls and goats, but Christ in his own.
"For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly." For if it were necessary for him to offer a sacrifice more often, he would have had to suffer frequently since the foundation of the world was laid, as he would have to offer his own blood.
"he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages." Here something also is revealed concerning the mystery, why at the end of the ages, after many sins. For if death had come from the beginning itself, when sin was not yet so widespread, then no one would have believed, (there would have been no need to die a second time,) all would have been in vain. But now, since later the sins were many, it is fitting that at the end of the ages, that is, at the very fulfillment of the ages, and at the very end, it has been revealed; that is, with the flesh in the world; it has been revealed for the annulment of sin, that is, to annul and wipe out the sin of the world through His sacrifice, which He offered for us, that is, through the death of His flesh. Such a thing He also said elsewhere: "Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more." (Rom. 5:20)
"to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself." That is, together with the flesh in the world.
