The wall of the saints, or of the church, is Christ himself, since he is our bulwark, our fence and our help. “It had,” it says, “twelve gates.” This symbolizes the holy apostles who proclaimed to us the way of faith in Christ. “And at the gates there were twelve angels.” I am convinced that there were also holy angels who worked with the holy apostles for the faith of the world. For if the law that came from Moses was proclaimed by angels, as the apostle says: “For if the message declared by angels was valid,” how much more would not the proclamation of the gospel possess the cooperation of angels? “And names inscribed,” it says, “that are the names of the twelve tribes of Israel.” In a material sense, Israel is those who were begotten from Jacob the patriarch. However, spiritually, Israel is those who walk by the faith of our father Abraham. Of this the apostle is witness, saying, “The father of the circumcision not only for those who are of the circumcision but also for those who follow the example of the faith of our father Abraham.” For Israel interpreted means “a mind that beholds God” or a mind that has spiritual discernment. And who, other than the faithful, have seen God with the mind or have acquired spiritual discernment by the abundant working of the Spirit? Therefore, their names are written upon the gates of the city. To be sure, the twelve tribes symbolize the complete number of the saints. For having once called the faithful Israel, he mentions also the number, which signifies their fullness, saying, “twelve tribes.”
