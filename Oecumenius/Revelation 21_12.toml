He says that it has twelve gates, by which he alludes to the divine apostles who proclaimed to us the entrance into faith in Christ. And on the gates are twelve angels; for I am persuaded that they co-operated with the holy apostles, and that divine angels aided the faith of the world; for if the law given through Moses was spoken by angels, as the apostle says; "if the word spoken through angels proved unwavering," (Heb. 2:2) how much more did the evangelic proclamation have angels cooperating?

And he says, and names written, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel. Israel is indeed sensibly those born of Jacob the patriarch; but spiritually it is those who conform to the faith of our father Abraham. And to this the apostle, called "father of those by circumcision not only but also of those who follow the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham," (Rom. 4:12) bears witness.

For Israel is interpreted as "the mind seeing God," that is, discerning. And which of the faithful more than these perceived God, or have become discerning by the abundant working of the Spirit? Therefore the names of these are written on the gates of the city.
