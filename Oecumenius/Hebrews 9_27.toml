"And just as it is appointed for men."Now he also speaks of the cause, through which Christ died once for all; for, he says, he became the ransom for one death. For it is appointed to men once to die. Therefore, this once, Christ died for us. What then? Do we not die now? Yes, but we are not held by death, as before, which in its power is not even to die.
