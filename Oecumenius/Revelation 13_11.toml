“Then I saw,” it says, “another beast which rose out of the earth.” The earth is the source of origin for all humankind, for the antichrist is a man “whose coming will be by the activity of the devil,” as the all-wise Paul says. “And it had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a dragon.” Rightly does it say that it had two horns “like a lamb,” not the horns of a lamb, and that it spoke “like a dragon,” not that it was a dragon. For since the wicked one makes himself out to be the Christ but is not, he has given to him horns “like a lamb.” And since through every kind of unholy work he spreads what is similar to the devil but in fact is not the devil, it does not say that he is a dragon but that he speaks like a dragon. And since such is the case, the discourse has preserved for him an image also in the vision, and it gives to him a form, not that of a lamb but like a lamb, and not that of a dragon but like a dragon. For Christ is said to be a lamb, and the devil is said to be a dragon, but this one is neither one nor the other.
