Having made many digressions and having returned from the later principles to the earlier principles, he arrived at the matter under discussion. And that was to narrate to us the things concerning the wicked and God-hated Antichrist. This one therefore is now set forth in the midst, and see what he says about him.

And I saw, he says, another beast coming up out of the earth, from where also is the beginning of origin for all men. For the Antichrist is a man, "whose presence is according to the working of the Devil," (2 Thess. 2:9) as it seems to the most wise Paul.

And it had two horns like a lamb, and it spoke like a Dragon. He said reasonably that he does not have the horns of a lamb, but that he is like a lamb, and that he is not a Dragon, but speaks like a Dragon. For since the true one is thought to be Christ, it is not that he was given horns like a lamb. And since through every sort of wickedness he contends equally with the Devil, yet he is not the Devil, he did not say that he is a Dragon, but that he speaks as a dragon. Since therefore these things are so, the Word preserved for him the image also in the vision, and gives him a form not of a lamb, but like a lamb, neither of a dragon, but like a dragon. For Christ has been called a lamb, the Devil a Dragon, but it was neither this nor that.
