Of the righteous, having been deemed worthy of the blessed end [λήξεως], as it is said to me concerning the release of the sixth seal at the fulfilment, like those who are also caught up before the Lord's coming in the clouds, into the air so that they may meet the coming Lord according to the testimony of the apostle presented to me there (1 Thess. 4:17), the vision then proceeds to the end of the rest of humanity and to the punishment of sinners. When a complete defeat is about to occur, various forms of death and the punishment of the impious will inevitably follow; most of these will be brought about by fire, for on that day fire is destined to reveal itself, as the divine apostle wrote to the Corinthians in his first epistle. (1 Cor. 3:13) For if there are many abodes of rest, as the Lord says (Jn. 14:2), and different places of punishment, the same trumpets that bring death to those on earth will also afterward awaken the dead.

What then does it mean when the first angel sounded the trumpet, and hail and fire are cast down upon the earth? One who considers this literally will not stray from the correct interpretation; and if one understands it figuratively, nothing inappropriate will be said. The fire in this context signifies destruction and deep suffering; it represents the pain of sinners who see the saints "caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord," (1 Thess. 4:17) while they themselves remain on earth dishonored and deemed unworthy of any consideration.

For the word metaphorically refers to sinners as trees and grass burning, because of their folly, and the insensibility of the soul, which is wooden and suitable for burning.
