Since the righteous have been accounted worthy of the blessed portion … and so are to be caught up “in the clouds of the air” prior to the coming of the Lord, that they might greet the coming Lord, … the vision now finally discusses the fate of the rest of humankind and the punishment of sinners. When the coming destruction occurs, there will necessarily be various kinds of death and various rewards for the wicked. The greater part of these will be consumed by fire, for in his first letter to the Corinthians the holy apostle wrote that that day will be revealed in fire. For if there are “many rooms” for rest, as the Lord says, there are also different places for torment. And these trumpets that bring death to those upon earth are the same that also raise the dead afterwards. Why does it say that when the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire consumed a third of those upon the earth? Were someone to think that this will happen literally, he would not be interpreting this passage incorrectly. But if we understand the passage figuratively, we will also not be wrong, for the passage speaks of “fire” when it refers to the distress and profound grief of the sinners who see the saints “caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord,” while they themselves remain dishonorable upon the earth and are not regarded as worthy of any greeting. The passage refers figuratively to sinners as “trees” and “grass” that are on fire because of their folly and the insensitivity of their souls, which are hard as dry wood and so are suitable for burning.
