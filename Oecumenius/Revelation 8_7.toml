The righteous had been considered worthy of their share in blessedness, as I said at the end of the breaking of the sixth seal, being caught up before the coming of the Lord “in the clouds into the air,” so that they might meet the Lord as he came, according to the testimony of the apostle which was there presented to me. The vision then goes on to indicate the end of the rest of humankind, and the punishment of sinners. 

When utter destruction is about to take place, it follows that there will also be different kinds of death and of requital of the impious. Most of them will be conducted through fire, “for that day will be revealed in fire,” said the divine apostle writing his first letter to the Corinthians. For if there are “many resting places,” as the Lord says, there are also different places of punishment. The same trumpets which bring about death for those on earth will also raise the dead after this. 

Why, therefore, does he say that when the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire burned up a third of those on the earth? If one takes this quite literally, he will not find the true meaning of the saying. But if he reckons it as said metaphorically, he will have said nothing strange, the word fire meaning the distress and deep pain of the sinners when they see the saints “caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord,” while they themselves have stayed on earth, dishonored and considered of no account. 

When the text says trees and grass were burnt up, it refers allegorically to sinners because of their folly and the insensibility of their soul, their woodenness all ready for burning.
