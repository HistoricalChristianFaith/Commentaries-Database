You have made merry upon the earth: and in riotousness you have nourished your hearts in the day of slaughter. You have presented, and slain the Just One: and he did not resist you.
"You have made merry upon the earth." The Jewish leaders were devouring the poor, and they were growing fat on honors that were conferred by all, but they were being prepared for slaughter under the hands of the Romans. And especially because they condemned the Lord, who alone was just, and killed Him without resisting or shouting. Therefore, James now says:
"You have slain the Just One." Without a doubt, this refers to Christ. However, by what He adds:
"He did not resist you," James makes a common statement also to others who have suffered similar things from the Jews. Perhaps, however, He also prophetically designates His own passion.
