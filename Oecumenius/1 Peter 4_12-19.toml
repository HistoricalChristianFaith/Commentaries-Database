Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial that has come upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you: but rejoice inasmuch as you participate in the sufferings of Christ, so that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed. If you are insulted because of the name of Christ, you are blessed; for the Spirit of glory and of God rests on you: if you are insulted for the name of Christ, it is glorified in you. Let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or any kind of criminal, or even as a bigmouth. But if you suffer as a Christian, do not be ashamed, but glorify God that you bear that name. For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner? Therefore, let those who are afflicted according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator by doing good.
"the fiery trial that has come upon you.” this is how you are proven.
“of the name of Christ.” Because you are called Christians.
“if you are insulted.” It must be understood: Who, to be. The meaning: Who seems to be blasphemed by the spirit of God among the wicked, but is glorified in you. How? Because while they falsely accuse you, confusion is indeed poured back upon them, but glory upon you.
“even as a bigmouth,” who curiously scrutinizes what belongs to others, in order to have an occasion for slander. This, however, is the disposition of a wicked and deceitful mind, and one that is quick and ready for every evil.
“For it is time for judgment to begin with God’s household.” It makes them anxious and terrifies them, driving them away from sloth and a relaxed life; therefore, it also adds: “If the investigation of matters already done begins first with us who are the house of God, what should we think will be the end of those who did not believe? Judgment now does not mean condemnation, but investigation, scrutiny, discussion to choose what is better." However, let it begin first from the house of God, since, according to our Basil the Great7, we are more annoyed towards those who are most familiar to us when they sin against us: but to God, there are no others more familiar than the faithful, who complete the house of God, or the Church. Therefore, the Savior also said: “He will say first to those who will be on his right hand." (Matt. 25:34) However, this judgment here refers to the examination, namely the afflictions that the wicked bring upon the faithful: of which the Lord also foretold the instigation when He said: "They will hand you over to councils." etc. (Matt. 5:17)
Then, as if to console them, He adds: And, If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly. And this is confirmed by the Scripture which says: "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" (Prov. 11:31) However, this is what Scripture intends to signify: If the righteous attain salvation through labor and affliction (for the kingdom of heaven is taken by violence (Matt. 9:12), and through many afflictions one attains it Acts 14:21), what will those who lead a depraved and indulgent life attain? It must be understood in the future age regarding what concerns the wicked. Therefore, if this is so, he says,
who are afflicted according to will of God, so that we do not become sluggish, but rather entrust their souls to a faithful Creator by doing good. He said, according to the will of God, either signifying that our afflictions are not without divine providence but are distributed to us as a test from Him; or that, being afflicted by the will of God, we attribute the outcome to Him. For He is indeed faithful, that is, secure and who does not lie in His promises: nor will He allow us to be afflicted beyond what we can bear. But how should one commit oneself to God? (1 Cor. 10:13)
By doing good, Peter says. And what is that? By the modesty of the soul, committing oneself to Him without exalting oneself because of what one suffers: but the greater the suffering seems, the more firmly one should cling to Him, so that one considers oneself useless and says, "for you are righteous in all the things that you have done to us." (Dan. 3:27) Moreover, the wicked and the sinner differ in this respect: for the wicked is completely alien to God, while the sinner clings to God somewhat, but as one who despises Him and transgresses His laws. However, one can be both wicked and a sinner: for whoever works iniquity acts wickedly, in that he sins, thinking that God does not exist.
