The blessed prophet Ezekiel also told us about Gog and Magog, describing the evil end of evil men. These will be some of the nations and their leaders at the end of the age, but they do not now exist, or they are some of the present nations called by other names in holy Scripture. So these will be allies of detested Satan in his fight against the slaves of Christ. 

And they will surround the beloved city, that is, the church. But fire from heaven will destroy them all, and after the end has been reached, Satan, the origin of all the evil, together with the Devil and the Antichrist, will be thrown into the lake of fire, that is, Gehenna. 

For the reader should recognize that the present Revelation has already told us of three [adversaries]: one was the dragon, the originator of the evil, shown in heaven; the second was the beast coming up out of the sea, which we considered to be second to Satan, but superior to the rest of the demons; and the third was the Antichrist, whom he also calls the false prophet. But it was said shortly before about the second one, the Devil, and the Antichrist, that the two of them were thrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. But now he is talking about Satan, or the Devil, whom earlier he called a serpent. 

He says, And they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. So you who read this essay will know that we were quite right to consider the thousand years during which the Devil was bound and thrown into the bottomless pit and was then set free again, to refer to the incarnation of the Lord and his dwelling upon earth, in which the Devilâ€™s activity was for a short time restricted. For now he has shown that the punishment of the Devil and of those deceived by him is not for a thousand years, but for ever and ever, and that there will be no release of the evil one.
