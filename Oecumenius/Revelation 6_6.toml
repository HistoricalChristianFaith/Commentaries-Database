The word of teaching is figuratively called “seed” in the holy Scriptures. In Matthew it is written, “A sower went out to sow,” and his most devoted servants say to him, “Sir, did you not sow good seed in the field? Then why are there weeds?” From the seed comes the wheat, that is, the preaching of the gospel, which as a food fit for mature persons trains the minds to distinguish between good and evil. And what is the barley? It is the teaching according to the law of Moses, for barley is less expensive than wheat and when ripe it is food fit for cattle, and so represents that which nourished the child of Israel. Therefore, God speaks from the midst of the four living creatures: “A quart of wheat for a denarius and three quarts of barley for a denarius,” symbolizing through this that there would be a famine and a scarcity of evangelical teaching among the people at that time, a famine of both the teaching that comes from the Lord and from the law, as is written: “I will give to them not a famine of bread nor a thirst for water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord.” And if for the most part it is necessary that those who despise all teaching and conversion must suffer so and so, he says, “Do not harm the oil and the wine.” Leave them alone and do not bring any destruction upon them. There is still mercy from me for them, God says, since there is hope for them to be gladdened spiritually by the divine preaching of my only begotten. This is the wine which spiritually gladdens the hearts of humanity.
