desiring to be teachers of the law, not understanding either what they say or the matters about which they make confident claims.

desiring to be teachers of the law. Another excuse for failure. For not only, he says, does hostility lead to this, but also ambition for honor, which itself arises from hatred and envy.

not understanding either what they say. He wants to show that they truly came from love of power to wanting to be teachers. For neither do they know the law, nor about the things about which they make confident claims. For if they had known the law, they would have believed in Christ, which is also said elsewhere. "Tell me, you who want to be under the law, do you not hear the law?" (Gal. 4:21) For if they had known the law, they would certainly have believed that it leads to Christ.
