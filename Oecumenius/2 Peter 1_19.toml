And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day approaches and the morning star rises in your hearts.
Therefore, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention, whether those that were foretold by the prophets: although they were then spoken obscurely by them, and as to a lamp shining in a dark place. For such is the filthy place, scorched by the heat of the sun and deprived of the air that informs it with moisture. Hence, it is necessary that the air which serves the solar ray, when it is in danger of losing its property, should render itself an illegitimate servant to the sun, and the ray, as if carried by an illegitimate vehicle, should present a darkened splendor of itself. However, by attending to those things which were thus obscurely spoken by the prophets, you will not be deceived in your hope, for things, Peter says, will come to pass in their own time: which he also aptly called day, remaining very skillfully in the figure of speech.
For Peter said, "as to a lamp shining in a dark or gloomy place, which is also night." However, day succeeds every night. Therefore, as day approaches (I speak of the presence of things), you will have the Morning Star rising in your hearts: that is, the knowledge of Christ, or his presence and coming foretold by the prophets, illuminating your hearts like true light.
