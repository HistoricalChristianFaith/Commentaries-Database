The accursed and godforsaken Greeks understand that we have a divine doctrine which states that the holy angels, with the approval of God, are the guardians of nations and of churches and of each one of us. Daniel in his great wisdom wrote about the nations: “And I have come because of your words. And the prince of the kingdom of the Persians withstood me”; and again, “But I am now returning to make war against the prince of the Persians; and I went forth, and the prince of the Greeks came”; and again, “There is none who contends by my side for this [purpose] except Michael, your prince”; and again, “At that time Michael will arise, the great prince, who has charge over the sons of your people.” 

The present Revelation has spoken previously about the guardians of the churches, with which Saint Gregory agrees when he writes of the holy angels, “I believe that an angel is a guardian of each church, as John teaches me through the Revelation.” The prophet has spoken about the angels as guardians of each one, “The angel of the Lord encamps around those who fear him, and will deliver them,” and the apostle also writes about the holy angels, “Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve for the sake of those who are going to obtain salvation?” 

So when [the Greeks] hear these things being taught as our belief, they say to us, “Why, you fellows, since you have the same belief as we have, do you take offense at our belief which assigns gods as rulers over nations? Those whom you call angels, we call gods: we disagree only about the names, and no longer about the facts; and since you also say ranks of angels are called gods, the difference is not even about names.” 

To them we must reply: “You are damned: both in the worship of the works of your hands, and in having set up as gods only yesterday or the day before those whom you knew to be involved in all kinds of disgraceful conduct, you filched away most of our divine teachings; you took them and mixed them with your deadly doctrines, but, as you took your reason and not God as your guide, you were not able to preserve the overall excellence of our doctrines, but after following them a little way you were shipwrecked somewhere near the start. Wherefore, we and you have nothing in common, just as Scripture says, ‘light has nothing in common with darkness or Christ with Beliar.’ 

For when you think of national gods (though really they are unclean demons), you show yourselves as offering reverence to them and wishing to worship them as gods; and when you have deified them, they take no account of God, who has made provision for the care of humankind, but they govern the nations by their own will just as they wish. 

So you allocated to Ares the fierce and bloodthirsty Scythians and Germans, who had become such under the rule of murderous Ares, the bane of human beings; and you assign the Greeks for their intelligence to Athene, as having obtained their intelligence from her; and you deal similarly with others, assigning the gods to the nations each according to their own natural propensity.” 

But you will understand what we say from the present text. For when the evangelist wished to worship the divine angel, but not to worship him as God (for who knew better than John who is naturally and truly God, and who the angels are, that they are ministers and slaves and creatures of God?), nevertheless [the angel] is shown as refusing to accept even the worship due to an angel, since this is indeed a form of worship, and saying, Don’t do that! I am a fellow slave with you and your brothers who hold the testimony of Jesus. 

“Don’t do that” is not simply a phrase to prevent an action, but is a positive affirmation. He says that he is himself a fellow slave of all who confess themselves slaves of Christ and who testify that God has become incarnate. 

What, therefore, must we do, most divine angel, when you refuse to be worshiped? He says, Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy, as if he were saying, “Are you trying to worship me, because I told you beforehand the things that are to come? All those who witness to the rule and divinity of Christ are full of prophetic grace, and not I alone. Why, therefore,” he says, “do you worship one who has been given the same grace as my fellow slaves? Can the Greeks’ beliefs about those who rule over the nations ever be the same as what Christians say about the holy angels?”
