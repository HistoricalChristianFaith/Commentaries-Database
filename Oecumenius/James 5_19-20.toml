Brothers, if anyone among you has strayed from the truth and someone turns him back, let him know that whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.
"someone turns him back, let him know." For it is necessary to serve the salvation of one's neighbor.
"whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way." This is also said by Jeremiah: "And if you separate the precious from the vile, you will be as my mouth." (Jer. 15:12) For whoever announces His words becomes the mouth of God. "For it is not you who speak," He says, "but the Spirit of my Father who speaks in you." (Matt. 10:19) Therefore, He also forbids the sinner, through David (Ps. 49:16), not to declare his justifications, and to take the covenant upon his lips.
on the Epistles of Peter
This letter is written by Peter to the Jews who had become Christians and were dispersed in various places, teaching them. For he confirms those who believed from among the Jews. First, he narrates and shows that faith in Christ was announced by the prophets, and that the redemption which would come through His blood was signified by them: and that all things to which angels desire to look have been announced to them and the Gentiles. Then, having urged them to conduct themselves worthily toward Him who called them, Peter exhorts them to honor even kings and commands harmony among women and men, and after briefly encouraging them regarding morals, he signifies that a preaching of salvation and resurrection was also made by the Lord in Hades: so that those who had previously died might indeed rise and be judged in the body, but through the grace of resurrection may persevere. And that the end of all things is imminent, and all should be prepared, as if to give an account to the Judge: and thus Peter concludes the letter.
