“And the beast that I saw was like a leopard,” because, I think, of his ability to turn quickly and quickly to form devious plans. “And its feet were like a bear’s,” it says, since they are sturdy and steadfast, that he might “walk to and fro upon the earth under heaven,” plotting against humankind. “And its mouth was like a lion’s,” for “our adversary, the devil, prowls around like a lion, seeking someone to devour,” as it is written. “And to it the dragon gave his power.” Without question the power of the apostate dragon inhabits these deceptions and wiles, for he has become for [the devil] both the instigator and the teacher of his works.
