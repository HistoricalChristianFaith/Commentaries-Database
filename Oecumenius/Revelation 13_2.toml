And the beast, he says, which I saw was like a leopard, and because of its swift-moving feet, I think, and quick for deceits.

And his feet, he says, are like those of a bear, somewhat weak and patient so as even to walk under heaven to plot against men.

And his mouth, he says, is like the mouth of a lion; "Your adversary the Devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour," according to what is written. (1 Peter 5:8)

And the Dragon is said to have given him his power. Now the power of that apostate Dragon lies in these deceits and guiles, and he himself became their author and teacher.
