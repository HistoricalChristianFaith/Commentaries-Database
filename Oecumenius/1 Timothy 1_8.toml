And we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully.

that the law is good. If it's anything other than this [that is, using it lawfully], it's not good. But who is the one who lawfully uses it? The one who is sent to faith through it. For the law does not have the power to justify, but it leads to Christ who is able to justify. For the one who fulfills it, not the one who interprets it, lawfully uses it.
