And “smoke rose from the shaft,” as though a significant fire was evidently burning in the shaft. So the smoke indicates not only fire but also darkness. For the words of the prophet, “the voice of the Lord divides the flame of fire,” is interpreted by the saints in this way, that the light-giving fire of Gehenna will be divided, so that only the burning heat of the fire along with the darkness remain in it. “And the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke.” This does not suggest that these elements were themselves darkened but that those cast into the shaft were filled with darkness because of their punishment and could not any longer see the air and the sun. For, one of the holy prophets said, “The sun will be darkened at midday,” referring by this to the misfortunes of the Jews, even though the sun had not been darkened. But those who were suffering in this tribulation were not able to see the sun, because the magnitude of misfortune sometimes causes dizziness.
