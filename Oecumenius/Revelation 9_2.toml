And it was said to him, "You are given the key to the shaft of the abyss". The shaft of the abyss is called Gehenna.

Therefore, "smoke rose from the shaft", like the smoke of a great fire burning in the shaft. Indeed, the "smoke" signifies not only fire but also darkness; "for the voice of the Lord interrupting the flame of fire," (Ps. 29:7) as spoken by the prophet, is interpreted by the saints as the ending of the illuminating fire from the Gehenna's fire, leaving only the burning fire together with darkness within it.

And it is said that "the sun and the air were darkened by the smoke" of the pit; not that these elements themselves were darkened, but that those cast into the pit, filled with "darkness" due to punishment, have the "air" and the "sun" unseen. For therefore one of the holy prophets also said: "The sun will be darkened at midday," (Amos 8:9) referring to the calamities of the Jews, not to the darkening of the sun itself, but to those suffering in tribulation who do not see the sun; for the magnitude of calamities is accustomed to be filled with darkness.
