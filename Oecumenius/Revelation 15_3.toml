The harps, as has often been said, signify the sweet-sounding hymn of the saints to God.

And he says, let us sing that song of Moses, the one which he sang when the host of Pharaoh was drowned, "let us sing to the Lord, for he has been gloriously glorified; he cast horse and rider into the sea; he became to me a helper and a cover for salvation." (Ex. 15:1-2) And the song is a victory-song concerning the punishment of the ungodly and the victory against the Devil and the son of lawlessness, the Antichrist. And he calls the song of the Lamb that which is fitting, namely toward the Lord and toward his righteous judgment against the ungodly; therefore they admire the truth and the righteousness of the Lord.
