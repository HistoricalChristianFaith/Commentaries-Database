he call ‘dead’ those who have persisted in unbelief, about whom the Lord also said, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead.(Mt. 8:22)” So the unbelievers did not ‘come’ to the spiritual life until the time of the incarnation had ended, which is the ‘1000 year’; for they came to life only after this. How? By the coming and presence of the Holy Spirit. For by then most of the Jews had come to faith in Christ, who did not believe in him when he was physically dwelling and moving among them.
