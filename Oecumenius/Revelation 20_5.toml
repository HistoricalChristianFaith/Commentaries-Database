And concerning the rest of the dead he says they did not live again until the thousand years are completed. He calls dead those who have remained in unbelief, about whom also the Lord said, "let the dead bury their own dead." (Matt. 8:22)

Therefore, the unbelievers did not live the spiritual life until the time of the Incarnation is fulfilled, which is the thousand years; for after these things they lived. How? By the visitation and presence of the Holy Spirit. For then most of the Jews will have believed in Christ, those who did not believe in him when he was present bodily among them. For the matter was administered in the most divine way, and beyond what human reason could have hoped for; for in the Old Covenant the Father was proclaimed and known, and by the Incarnation and the countless divine signs and powers the Son was proclaimed; but the Holy Spirit had not yet been clearly revealed to men. But only a word about the Spirit existed in the Old Covenant, and there was no work that was evident and perceptible, nothing that most of all leads people to faith, as with the Son, although it was known to those who had advanced into the depths of contemplation. That indeed all things that have been done and fashioned by the Holy Trinity have been accomplished, and the Lord clearly presents this, where he says "the Father gave me a commandment what I should say and what I should speak," (Jn. 12:49) and again: "I can do nothing from myself," (Jn. 8:28) bringing the things that happen into the Trinity; and again to John: "the Son of man cannot do anything of himself unless he sees the Father doing it," (Jn. 5:19) and he further confirms: "if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God." (Matt. 12:28) But since, as has been said, the work of the Holy Spirit was not perceptible to people, he arranged that almost all people should receive faith in Christ by the visitation and power of the Paraclete and of God the Father, so that indeed the consubstantial and equal-to-all relation of the Son to the Father might become clear. It is needless to say that in the whole period of the Incarnation there are recorded not more than one hundred and twenty who had believed; for the Acts specify so many gathered together in the upper room. (Acts 1:15)

Even if the power of Christ's teaching has been proven to many, faith in that presence was preserved by the Spirit. Therefore, one might find, as with a scattered seed, that whenever rain comes and the sun shines, all the formerly hidden and unnoticed seeds in the earth then spring up, clearly showing that they had entirely been committed to the earth; so it occurs with the visitation of the Holy Spirit. All those to whom the Lord's teaching was sown have risen toward faith.

Therefore, it is said more precisely in the Revelation that the rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years should be completed. This, he says, is the first resurrection, namely the resurrection of faith; for the second will be the universal resurrection of bodies.
