When the divine angels seized the city of the Sodomites to execute judgment upon its inhabitants and the neighboring towns, and more precisely, as seems in the writings of the holy Cyril, when the Son of God and the Holy Spirit moved there, "since the Father judges no one" according to the Scripture, "but has given all judgment to the Son," (Jn. 5:22) the Holy Spirit being present with him, clearly and essentially as the vivifying spirit, then they say to the godly Lot: "Save yourself, preserve your own soul; do not look back nor remain anywhere in the plain; flee to the mountain, in case you be taken up with them." (Gen. 19:7)

This is also what the Revelation now teaches us: since it is not possible in so great and populous a city as Rome that there should not also be slaves of Christ in it, he says to them, "Come out of her, my people, in case you take part in her sins and lest you receive of her plagues." For to share in her sins and plagues is to share with them; for the plagues are because of them.
