And when they have finished their testimony, for they will testify that the one present is not the Christ, but rather a deceiver, a fraud, and destructive. But the Son of God, who must also be believed as Savior and God and as the benefactor of mankind, will come, a coming long foretold and now occurring.

And the beast, he says that it is ascending from the abyss. The term "beast" is used to describe the Antichrist due to his brutal, inhuman, and bloodthirsty nature; whereas "abyss" refers to the life of humans, which is bitter because of sins, salty, and unstable owing to the influence of the spirits of evil.

Therefore, the beast will kill the two witnesses, and their bodies will be left unburied in the streets of Jerusalem. For in that city, he will reign as king over the Jews, and having deceived them, he will exercise authority over all who serve and obey him, just as the Lord says to John: "I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, you will receive him." (Jn. 5:43)
