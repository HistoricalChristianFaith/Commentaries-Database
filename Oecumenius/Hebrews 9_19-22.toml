“For when every commandment had been spoken.” For after he spoke the commandment, then Moses sprinkled the blood.
"according to the law." As He says, God legislated, according to the law of God. Or of every command according to the law, these, of the legislated one.
"taken the blood of calves." This blood was a type of the blood of God and our Savior, who cleansed us from all stain.
"with water." Water was the figure of baptism.
"and scarlet wool and hyssop." Wool and hyssop were used for their preservation. Indeed, hyssop, being dense and tender, retained and sprinkled blood, and wool likewise. Scarlet, however, was wool so that by its very color it would bear the type of the blood of Christ.
"the book itself." The book was a type of the faithful, those who have the law of God within themselves.
Saying, “This is the blood of the covenant.” But Christ: This is the blood of the new covenant (Matt. 26:28), for the forgiveness of sins; but there, neither new nor forgiveness of sins. Do you see then how he called the blood a covenant? For where a covenant is spoken of, death must be understood.
"the tabernacle and." And the tabernacle was a type of the faithful, because of, "I will dwell in them and walk among them." (Lev. 26:12; 2 Cor. 6:16)
"And almost all things." Almost, for this he said, because it was not being purified clearly and sincerely at that time. For then the purifications were physical, being types of those that now purify souls and bodies.
"and without shedding of blood is no remission." For even then, such purifications were thought to provide remission, but they did not actually provide it.
“Therefore it was necessary that the patterns of things in the heavens.” The heavenly things in the new covenant are said to be, since the initiation in it is heavenly, and the faithful are citizens of heaven, even if they are still living on earth. For the examples of the old covenant are types of the new covenant.
"should be purified with these." These have been mentioned, with the blood of calves and goats, and with the ashes of a heifer, and with the other things so lowly.
"but the heavenly things." Which are in the New Testament.
"with better sacrifices." Therefore, since it was necessary according to their values to have better sacrifices, the Son of God Himself was offered, so that the death of the Lord not only benefited and enacted the confirmation of the covenantbut also to affect the true purification of the soul. And in the preceding and following, it demonstrates that the death of the Lord worked salvation for humankind, because some weaker ones were offended because of the cross.
