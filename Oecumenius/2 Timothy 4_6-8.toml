For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come; I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith. From now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day—and not only to me, but also to all who love his appearance.

For I, Paul says, already offer myself as a sacrifice to Christ. And he did not say sacrifice, but a drink offering, indicating something greater and more sacred. For a part of the sacrifice alone was offered to God as incense. But the entire drink offering was dedicated to Him. And Paul himself commands his disciples to do this, saying: "Present your members as a living sacrifice." (Rom. 12:1) For he who sacrifices for Christ performs a sacred service himself.

I have fought the good fight. For every struggle on behalf of Christ is good, even if it involves chains, or persecutions, or deaths. If therefore it is good, then you should accept it yourself.

I have finished the race. For Paul had run through the world, leading all to the knowledge of God, so that the Gospel had been fulfilled from Jerusalem all the way around to Illyricum.

I have kept the faith. For many wished to seize it from him, false friends, enemies, Greeks, Jews,

From now there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness. Then Paul also comforts Timothy from his sufferings. For who would grieve over one receiving a crown? And of righteousness, as if it were the universal virtue.

which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day. For do not tell me here about temporary things, for I seek those there. But see how the obligation demands it from him, through the phrase, "will award to me," but he did not say, "He will give"; this is also indicated by, "the righteous Judge."

not only to me. Here he also appointed Timothy, saying that he will repay you as well.

For if he gives a crown to all who love his appearance, much more to you. But who loves his appearance? Those who do good deeds and are rewarded by the good.
