He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna of the mystery. He said, in an indirect way, that he would grant him to be filled with the intelligible and future goods.

and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except the one who receives it. For it has been said, "what no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has entered into the heart of man, what God has prepared for those who love Him." (1 Cor. 2:9)
