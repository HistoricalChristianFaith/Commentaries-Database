For this reason I suffer as I do, but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day.

For this reason I suffer as I do. What then is that reason? Because I am a messenger and an Apostle. As if he were saying: I am not being overcome as a criminal and dragged to prison.

but I am not ashamed. For the greatest glory is to suffer something for Christ. Do you see how Paul prepares the disciple for afflictions? You will show that if someone does not fear to be ashamed, the danger itself will be easier with the help of Christ.

that he is able to guard my deposit. He calls the faith a deposit [παραθήκην], which Christ entrusted [παρέθετο] to him to preach. Either Paul means the believers, whom God entrusted to him to teach, or those whom he entrusted to God. "Behold, I entrust you to the Lord." (Acts 20:32) Among those entrusted is also Timothy. Therefore, Paul says: "for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him until that day."
