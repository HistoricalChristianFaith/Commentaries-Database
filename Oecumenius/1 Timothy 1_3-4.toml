As I urged you, stay in Ephesus when you go to Macedonia, so that you may command certain people not to teach false doctrines, nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, who provide questions rather than the household of God, which is by faith.

See the words of the petitioner and teacher: stay in Ephesus. (For Paul's Epistle was rather not sufficient to correct these.) Here, however, he was appointed bishop by laying on of hands.

So that you may command certain people. Paul did not say, "Please," but, as to the corrupt, he says, "command with severity."

not to teach false doctrines. There were some false apostles from the Jews again leading people to the law, and teaching other counterfeit doctrines.

nor to pay attention to myths. Paul calls myths the fictional doctrines. For the one who speaks these things teaches a different doctrine.

and endless genealogies. For they counted the forefathers and ancestors, like the Jews around the divine Abraham, adorning themselves with them, and doing nothing good themselves. But the term "endless," means those who have no useful end, either those who speak or those who listen.

who provide inquiries. If inquiries is in condemnation, how does Christ say, "Seek and you will find," (Matt. 7:7) and, "Do you seek the Scriptures?" (Jn. 5:39) because seeking is of the means. For it is sometimes good to seek, as in, "Seek first the kingdom of heaven." (Matt. 6:33) It is even evil to seek, as the philosophers do, the heavenly and the essence of God. Therefore, here you will seek, he says, the foolish things, the combative ones.
