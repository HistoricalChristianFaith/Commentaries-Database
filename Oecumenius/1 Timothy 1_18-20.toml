I entrust this command to you, Timothy, my child, according to the prophecies previously made about you, so that by them you may wage the good warfare, holding faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, have suffered shipwreck concerning the faith; among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may be taught not to blaspheme.

this command. It means careful observation.

I entrust. As to a child, Paul says, I command, not according to any authority applying to masters.

according to the prophecies previously. For the sake of emphasis it is placed there. However, the order is this: As soldiers next to those prophecies which have gone before concerning you, that is, as suitable soldiers, responding to the prophecies which were about you. For according to the revelation of the Spirit, Timothy was chosen by Paul as a disciple, and was circumcised, and was ordained a bishop.

them you may wage the good warfare. As a soldier of Christ fighting with spiritual weapons in every way against spiritual enemies.

by them. Namely, by the prophecies: for they have chosen you. Therefore, because of which you were received and by whom you were chosen, serve in them and through them, that is, through the Spirit Himself through whom the prophecies exist.

the good warfare. For there is also a bad warfare, concerning which it is said: "Just as you have presented your members as weapons for sin and impurity." (Rom. 6:13)

holding faith. For one must be a teacher of oneself before being a teacher to others. And faith, he says, is about doctrines, while conscience is about conduct.

which some having rejected. Of these, Paul says, conscience is about living rightly. For when someone lives without consideration it also shipwrecks their faith. In order not to be tormented by the fear of what is to come, they strive to persuade their own soul that all things concerning us, both about resurrection and judgment, are false.

whom I have handed over to Satan that they may be taught. Since Satan does not instruct himself, how can he bring good teaching to others? And we say, just as executioners, full of countless evils, train others to be prudent, so also does Satan. For when a person is handed over to Satan, it is by the exclusion from communion. Then the demon, having taken the person stripped of God's help, disciplines him. And this is done for his correction. But why do they hand over to Satan, and he himself does not discipline? So that it may be shown that even Satan is able to coerce, and so that, along with punishment, they are also insulted, with Satan being the avenger. For the apostles punished the unbelievers for their own sake, as Paul himself did to Bar-Jesus and Elymas (Acts 13), and Peter to Ananias (Acts 5); to show that they were able. But those who learned from these things, yet turned away, they handed over to Satan.

not to blaspheme. For these, by subjecting faith to human reasoning, have gone astray and blaspheme, as now the Nestorians suffer, and the other heresies.

On prayer, that it is above all, that it is everywhere, without wickedness, without disturbance, reverently.
