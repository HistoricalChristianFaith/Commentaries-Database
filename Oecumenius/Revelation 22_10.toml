“Do not seal up these words,” it says. That is, you ought not keep these words to yourself nor lock them up in the treasury of your mind. Rather, make them known to everyone. “For the time is near,” it says. He is saying something like this: While the right time when they will have need to hear these words is not far distant, as it once was, that time is not yet present either. For it is not good that the exhortation of these words be, as it were, superfluous—for what need of exhortation do those have who are still acquainting themselves with evil and good?—for it is untimely to instruct by word those who are learning from experience. But why does he say “it is near”? It is neither a long time away, nor is it already present.
