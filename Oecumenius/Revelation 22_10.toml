Do not seal, he says, these words, that is, do not keep them to yourself, nor lock them away and guard them in the treasury of your mind, but reveal them to all.

For he says the time is near. He speaks something like this: the time until their fulfillment is not very long, as before. But do not think it necessary that they be heard now; for it is not personal, as if their omission were unnecessary. For what need is there of exhortation to those who are from now tried by evils or by goods? For it is by deeds, not by untimely words, that those learning by action are instructed. But what does he mean by saying the time is near, neither long to come nor already present?
