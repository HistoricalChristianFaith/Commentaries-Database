And he says they came out from the mouth of the Dragon and from the mouth of the False Prophet. The Dragon, the author of evil, he calls the Devil, and the False Prophet is someone else acting by the power of the Devil, as if it were prophesying, or the Antichrist.

But if he is speaking in general of the Antichrist, whom in the earlier passages he introduced as one deprived by the Spirit of the Lord, but now as though still living he vents demons through his mouth, let the hearer not be astonished.

For what is seen is a vision, and the first things are often shown to the evangelist later, and conversely the later things first, and he says, I saw three spirits like frogs. For there are spirits of demons performing signs, which go forth unto the kings. The demons are compared to frogs because they delight in the filthy, muddy life of men and in the slime. But the damp and windless life seems to them more like the life of sinners rather than the steadfast and hardened life of the righteous, whom they greatly envy and rejoice in the destruction of the living.
