He calls the devil, that originator of evil, a “dragon.” But by the title of “false prophet” he refers either to a certain other who prophesies through the operation of the devil or to the antichrist. However, should he be speaking completely of the antichrist whom above he introduced as one slain by the breath of the Lord and whom now he depicts as still alive—he pours out demons through his mouth—let not the reader be amazed. For that which is seen is a vision, and the Evangelist often shows that which comes first as last, and contrariwise that which is last as first.… He calls the demons “frogs” because they rejoice at that life of people that is muddy and slimy. Moreover, they take pleasure in the life of sinners, which is moist and without constraint, rather than in the life of the righteous, which is steadfast and austere, being also very envious and joyful at the destruction of the living.
