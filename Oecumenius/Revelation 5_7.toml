And He came and took, that is the little scroll, from the right hand of the One seated on the throne. Therefore, when all those in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, wondered to open the little scroll or to look into it as it had been seen before, only Christ, the Son of God, who for us and through us became and remains what He was, took the little scroll.
