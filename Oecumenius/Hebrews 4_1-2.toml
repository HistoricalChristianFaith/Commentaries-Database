“Let us therefore fear.” In the saying, he says, "Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion (Heb. 3:15), let us therefore fear." And the "therefore" has been added. For the sake of being lengthy, so that the construction may not seem incoherent, the "therefore" has been placed. Let us fear, he says, lest any of you should seem to come short of entering into his rest. For the promise of entering into his rest still remains for those who wish. And this is the kingdom of heaven.
"lestany one of you may seem to have come short of it." They are lacking in entering. However, he did not say, "They have come short," but rather, "may seem to have come short."
“For we are also evangelized just as they were.” We have been evangelized about the good things to come, just as they were in a symbolic way about the earth.
"but the word which they heard did not profit them." You see that this is what he says, that nothing will profit you from becoming hearers of the preaching, if you do not also bring in what is from yourselves, namely faith; for the word which you heard by itself has not benefited even those in the past. But see how on our part the matter was called the gospel, as a promise of true goods, and as given from a crown and victory; but on their part, a matter of hearing.
"not being mixed with faith." That is to say, do not be mixed with it [the word]. From this, the idea of believing without hesitation is hinted at. And he says that those who believed heard. For they truly heard, those who also believed. Paul speaks about Joshua and Caleb. And this he says: The word which they heard did not profit them, not being mixed and as if blended and united with faith in those who heard it, namely, those who believed concerning Jesus.

He says, not being mixed, that is, with those who have believed. How were they to be united? With faith, he says, that is, through faith. For if these had believed just as those did, they would have been gathered into one, as if by a kind of glue of faith, uniting them.
