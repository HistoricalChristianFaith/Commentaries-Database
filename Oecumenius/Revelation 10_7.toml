According to the form of omission, it is stated: for it says that when the seventh angel is about to sound the trumpet, all the punishment against the impious will be fulfilled, being both various and many. However, it does not say that this will happen when he sounds the trumpet in the vision, since the other events have not yet occurred at that time, but rather when he sounds the trumpet at the appropriate time.

When this occurs, he says that the mystery of God will be fulfilled, as he declared to his servants the prophets. For the prophets foretold up until the judgment and the recompense of the good and the wicked, but not after that. Therefore, when the seventh angel sounds, the mystery will be completed, and every prophetic announcement will come to an end.
