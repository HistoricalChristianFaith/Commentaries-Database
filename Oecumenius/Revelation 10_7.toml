This is said in the manner of an ellipsis. For it says, “When the seventh angel was about to blow his trumpet,” all the various and different punishments against the impious will be fulfilled. He does not say that this will occur now when he blows his trumpet in this vision, since the other [woes] have not yet occurred. Rather, this will happen when he blows his trumpet at the appointed time. And when this has happened, “the mystery of God as he proclaimed it to his servants, the prophets” will receive its completion. For the prophets prophesied until the judgment and the recompense of the good and the wicked, but after that [they prophesied] no longer. Therefore, when the seventh angel blows his trumpet at that [seventh] age, every mystery and every prophetic foretelling will receive its fulfillment.
