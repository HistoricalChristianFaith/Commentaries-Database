"Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, to Philemon our beloved and fellow worker, and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ."

"Paul, a prisoner". Immediately from the opening words he instructs the master not to shame the servant. For all things, even chains, are good for Christ. And that it is right for grace to be given to the prisoner for Christ.

"and Timothy our brother". He includes Timothy as a partner in the supplication.

"to Philemon our beloved". If beloved, he will grant favor; if a coworker, he will not put the servant to shame in the service of the preaching. Onesimus, having been given, will also fulfill the work of the master Philemon.

"and to Apphia our beloved, and Archippus". Perhaps Apphia was the wife of Philemon, and Archippus. But see the humility, for it also urges these to join in the supplication.

"our fellow soldier". If a fellow soldier, he also struggles in this. This is the one about whom he writes to the Colossians: Tell Archippus, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received." (Co. 4:17)

"and to the church in your house". He invites the whole household, and slaves.

"Grace to you". How then will the grace of God be with you? If you also forgive those who owe you. How then is peace? If you are reconciled to the servant.
