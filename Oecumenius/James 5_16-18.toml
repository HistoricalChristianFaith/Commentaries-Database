Confess your trespasses to one another, and pray for one another that you may be healed. The effective, fervent prayer of a righteous man is very effective. Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed earnestly that it would not rain, and it did not rain on the land for three years and six months. And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth produced its fruit.
"The effective prayer." The prayer of a righteous person is effective when he who prays helps the one for whom he prays with spiritual affliction. For if, while others pray for us, we indulge in pleasures and dissolutions, and our lives are full of transgressions, we dissolve through this the fervor of the prayer that strives for us: and that which Saint Peter says is fulfilled in us: "One builds and one destroys, what does it profit them but labor?" (Sirach 34:28)
