And your wrath has come, he says, and the time of the nations has been judged, and the reward has been given to your servants, the prophets, and the saints. He says that you have long been patient with them, since they did not reject your goodness; now, that is, on the day of judgment, you have brought forth your wrath against them. And the things owed and appointed to the nations have also come and are present. What then? This was the judgment and the giving of retribution to the saints who had suffered wrongfully under them, and the destruction by the recompense of punishment of those who corrupted the earth, as if they had defiled it with their own sins.
