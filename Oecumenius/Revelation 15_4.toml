He says that Christ is indeed King of all nations, but since it is said to Isaiah: "and the root of Jesse and the one who rises to rule the nations, upon him the nations shall hope," (Isa. 11:10) therefore for this reason the vision also calls him King of the nations and that all the peoples shall come and worship him, appropriately announcing beforehand the calling of the nations and their faith toward the Lord.
