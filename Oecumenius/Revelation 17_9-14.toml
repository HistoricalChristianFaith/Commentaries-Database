He says, The seven heads are seven hills on which the woman is seated: this is a very clear indication that he is speaking about Rome, for Rome is described as seven-crested, and no other city is so called. 

He says, There are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain only a little while. He reasonably regards the kings as heads; for the kings are the head and summary of the Roman empire. 

Why did he say, in spite of the very many emperors of Rome, that the beast had only seven heads? He said this since the seven were specially responsible for causing the beast, that is, the Devil, to raise up his head against the Christians, by stirring up persecutions against the church. These were first Nero, second Domitian, then Trajan, Severus, after him Decius, Valerian, and Diocletian. When these were the emperors of Rome, they persecuted the church without restraint, as Eusebius says in the Chronicles. 

He says that of these seven, five have fallen by death: Nero, Domitian, Trajan, Severus, and Decius, but that there was still one, that is, Valerian. 

The other, he says, has not yet come, and when he comes, he must remain only a little while. He means that the other is Diocletian, after whom the seat of empire ceased to be in Rome and was transferred to the city named after the pious Constantine, who himself was responsible for changing the policies of the empire. 

The evangelist was told everything very accurately, especially with regard to Diocletian, when he said, And when he comes, he must remain only a little while, referring to the time spent in his persecution against the Christians. For although he reigned for twenty years, he began the persecution during the last two years before he abdicated. 

He says, As for the beast that was and is not, he is an eighth, but he comes from the seven, and he is going to perdition. He has placed the Devil both first and also last as a persecutor and of one mind with the seven. For how could the Devil, too, fail to be numbered among them, since it was he who directed the seven to be so very wicked? 

He says, And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power. Concerning these ten kings, or horns, the prophet Daniel in his great wisdom has marked them out as arising from the rule of the Romans when he said that they will rise up in the last times; in the midst of these the Antichrist will arise. That is why he says, They have not yet received royal power, but they will have it as kings. He is right to say as kings, because of the early demise and darkness of their reign. 

Then he goes on to say, For one hour they are to receive it with the beast. He here calls the Antichrist a beast. Earlier on, too, he has called him this, saying, Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth; and it had two horns like those of a lamb (Rv 13.11). That they reigned over them for one hour symbolizes either the short span of time of their reign, or one hour is a figure of speech for a year. 

He says, These are of one mind, and give over their power and authority to the beast. For even if the coming ten kings have contrary policies among themselves, in this at least they will be of one mind, in giving their power and authority to the beast, that is, the Antichrist. For they will be defeated by him, and he alone will then rule over them all. But even if contrary to their expectation they are to be defeated, nevertheless, since the ten will have the same experience of defeat and destruction, he says they have one mind. It is as though he was saying that it is by their consent and agreement that the ten will be defeated by the Antichrist. 

He says, These will make war on the Lamb. Before their total destruction by the Antichrist, those whom we are describing will persecute the church. 

But Christ will be victor. Evil as they are, he will hand them over to the more evil Antichrist to death. Or, according to another interpretation of “Christ will be victor,” it refers to his slaves’ striving until death on behalf of their faith in him. For he says, they are called and chosen and faithful —that is, the slaves of Christ.
