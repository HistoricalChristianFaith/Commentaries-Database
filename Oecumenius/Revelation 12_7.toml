Just as in a recapitulation of the aforementioned principle, it conceives an earlier principle, which was partly mentioned before, concerning the vision that is about to relate to us the events regarding the Antichrist; for the first principle among them is the fall of Satan from heaven. About this, the Lord also says, "I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning." (Luke 18:10)

What then he says, And there was war in heaven? The divine Scripture states that Satan rebelled against God, that is, he was stubborn and proud enough to raise his neck defiantly, and to contemplate apostasy. But God, being naturally good and patient, endured him; however, the divine angels, not bearing the arrogance of their master, expelled him from their company.

It is now said that Michael, one of the great archangels among the angels, fought against Satan and those under him.
