For this is what he goes on to say. Surely the Revelation is not telling us about the thousand years of the ungodly Greeks and the transmigration of souls and the water of Lethe and I do not know what nonsense and silly talk, when it says that the Devil will be bound for a thousand years and released again and deceive the nations? Forget about such worthless doctrines which are fitting for Greek crookedness! 

What then does he say? The prophet tells us, “For a thousand years in your sight, Lord, are like yesterday which is past, and a watch in the night.” So, then, the thousand years are reckoned as one day in the eyes of God. The second epistle of blessed Peter says the same thing, when he writes, “But do not ignore this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.” 

So this is how it is: blessed Isaiah calls the whole incarnation of the Lord “a day,” saying, “In a time of favor I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I helped you.” Nor is this all: the psalmist, too, calls it a day and an early morning, saying somewhere, “This is the day that the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it” with the joy of our salvation; elsewhere he sings, “in the morning you will hear my voice; in the morning I will stand by you, and you will see me.” For our prayers have been deemed acceptable and worthy of the vision of God and the Father. They have become so by the intercession and atonement of the Lord. And again he says about Jerusalem, “God will help her in the early morning.” 

The incarnation of the Lord has become the day and early morning, when “the sun of righteousness” (as Malachi calls him) shone upon us, and brought us “the light of knowledge.” Zechariah prophesied about this divine light, saying, “When the rising of the sun dawned upon us from on high, to shine upon those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death.” In accord with this the prophet also said, “The Lord is God, and he has shone upon us; bind the festal procession together with branches, up to the horns of the altar.” Since all this has already been explained, we must proceed to the matter in hand. 

Since I have already said that a day is reckoned “as a thousand years” by God, and again that the earthly residence of the Lord has been called “a day,” he says this day is a thousand years, as though there is no distinction with God between one day and a thousand years. 

It was in this period of the Lord’s incarnation that the Devil was bound, so that he was unable to oppose the savior’s divine miracles. This was why the destructive demons recognized these spiritual bonds and cried out, “What have you to do with us, Son of the living God? Have you come to torment us before the time?” The Lord, too, when talking of stripping off the bonds, said, “Or how can anyone enter a strong man’s house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house.” 

Since, as was said, we have considered the incarnation of the Lord and his earthly residence to be both one day and a thousand years, such a number being used indifferently in Holy Scripture in mystical fashion, see what the Revelation says: I saw another angel coming down from heaven, holding the key of the bottomless pit and a chain, and he says, he seized the Devil and bound him and threw him into the pit. 

As if in a sketch on a canvas, the evangelist perceives the spiritual actions of the Lord against the Devil. Since it was not possible for a human being such as John to see spiritual events, they are depicted for him in physical terms—an angel with a chain binding the Devil and throwing him into the bottomless pit. For this is how the book of Job, too, expressed in physical terms the Devil’s venture and God’s consent: it depicted the Devil begging God to give him [Job], and it depicted God as making a suitable response to his request and giving him Job, and then went on to write the story. So you will be right in thinking that I am now doing the same. 

He says, That he should no longer deceive the nations, till the thousand years were ended: for the Lord’s sojourn on earth had to provide rather more succor and care so that the unclean demons might be prevented from exercising the same influence on human beings as they had in the time preceding the incarnation. He says, 

After that he must be loosed for a little while. What sort of little while does he mean? That between the incarnation of the Lord and the end of the present age; for this is short, even if it may seem to be very long, when reckoned and compared with the past and the future. For if in the “last” hour, even in “the eleventh” hour, our Lord appeared in bodily form to us, according to the belief of Holy Scripture, the time until the end has rightly been called short, after which [the Devil] will be bound again with an eternal and endless bond. 

But even now that he has been released, bind again, Lord, his wiles against us. For you are our king, and to you is due glory for ever. Amen.
