The fire is symbolic of wrath and punishment. The hyacinth reveals that these who are sent are of heaven, for the sky is similar to hyacinth. The sulfur indicates that they are pleasing to God, since they are delightful to Godâ€”for to delight is to please. And who would please God more than the holy angels? Then the vision changes imagery and exalts the power of the holy angels, comparing them with lions and to fire, smoke and brimstone and snakes. In all of these analogies their fearsomeness and irresistibility is signified.
