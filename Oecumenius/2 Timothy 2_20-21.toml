In a large house, there are not only golden and silver vessels, but also wooden and pottery, some of which are for honor, and others for dishonor. Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, sanctified, useful to the Master, prepared for every good work.

But for such-shaped people, it is serious that the pottery becomes gold, and the gold through negligence becomes pottery. Therefore, if someone cleanses himself from these wooden and pottery-like people, as having nothing of their kind, he becomes useful to the Master, since those others are clearly useless.

prepared for every good work. Even if now is not the time or opportunity to do this, one must nevertheless be ready and prepared to endure persecutions, sufferings, and martyrdom.

On divine teaching and a life pure and peaceful even toward adversaries.
