Behold, I come like a thief, says the Lord. He says "like a thief" because of the sudden and unexpected nature of his second coming.

Blessed is he that watches and keeps his garments, lest he walk naked. He persevered in the way of the thief; therefore he said that the garments must be kept so that they are not lost, garments meaning the virtuous and modest life by which we are deemed worthy of God's protection, that is, the body so that it may be holy and clean. For he who has not guarded it will be shamed before the angels and the humans of the divine throne, being pursued in the judgment at that time and left naked, deprived of divine assistance.
