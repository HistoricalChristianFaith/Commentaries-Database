“Lo, I am coming like a thief,” says the Lord. He says “like a thief” because of the suddenness and unexpectedness of his second coming. “Blessed is he who is awake and keeps his garments that he may not go naked.” He continues the image of the thief. Therefore, he said that it is necessary to preserve one’s garments that they not be lost. By the term garments he refers either to that virtuous and decent life through which we become worthy of God’s protection, or he refers to the body, that it be pure and holy. For he who does not keep [his garments] will be ashamed in front of the divine throne of the angels and of people, harried by the judgment at that time and left “naked” of divine succor.
