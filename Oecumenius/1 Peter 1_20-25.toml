He was indeed predetermined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you, who through him believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God: since you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the Spirit. Love one another fervently with a pure heart, having been born again, not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever: because all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away: but the word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
Peter connected the death of Christ with the resurrection. For he fears the easy change of beginners in faith to skepticism, due to the disgrace of Christ's afflictions, but he says there is no recent mystery about Christ: since this also disturbs the foolish; but in former times and before the foundation of the world, it had been hidden by divine providence until the opportune time, indeed it was revealed to the prophets who inquired about these things, as he had said a little earlier, now, however, he says, it is more manifest, because what had been foreknown before the foundation of the world, namely by God, is now revealed, whether completed or perfected. And he adds because of whom it may be perfect, namely because of you. For because of you, he says, he raised him from the dead. But why because of you? So that when you have purified yourselves by obeying the truth through the Spirit, you may have faith and hope in God. And how have you purified yourselves? Because by believing in Him who has proclaimed to you the resurrection from the dead to an incorruptible life, you are debtors to Him who, being incorruptible, called you to walk in newness of life.
But if both Peter and Paul say that the Father raised the Lord from the dead, do not be disturbed: for now they are using introductory teachings to say these things. For listen to Christ saying that he raised himself, when he says: "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." (Jn. 2:19) But also Luke: "To whom he also showed himself alive, after he had suffered." (Acts 1:3) And again Christ himself: "I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it again." (Jn. 10:18) Therefore, in a certain dispensation, the Son's resurrection is sometimes referred to the Father, to show the unity of the operation of the Father and the Son.
The sequence of the letters is as follows: He was indeed predetermined before the foundation of the world, but was revealed in these last times for you, who through him believe in God who raised him from the dead and gave him glory: so that you may purify your souls (in fact, ὥστε is taken for 'so that') in obeying the truth, having faith and hope in God. For it is accepted that εἶναι means “to have”, because of the preceding. For if ὥστε is left in its meaning as stated, the sentence will be incoherent and unintelligible.
"Love one another fervently." In this way, it must be said: That you may have faith and hope in God, when you have purified your souls through obedience to the truth, that is, when you have prepared yourselves for obedience to the truth through the Spirit. For the obedience in evils and lies is not through the Spirit, that is, it is not spiritual. Since purification for obedience or preparation, exercise, care, also wishes to attract many other helpers, provided it is spiritual and free from envy: but this is the work of fervent love, making a neighbor a participant in the goods that someone has obtained: therefore, it adds: to love fervently, devoid of hypocrisy. However, this is subjected by deficiency: for it is familiar to the blessed apostles, as it is also found in blessed James, "Who is wise among you and endowed with knowledge?" (James 3:13) And again: "Now you who say, 'Today and tomorrow,'" (James 5:1) and many other similar things. That spiritual ones should, in turn, make others partakers of all good things with utmost diligence, can be learned from what he says elsewhere: "I indeed consider them to be mutual for the provocation of love," (Heb. 10:24) that is, to sharpen and stir it up.
Because all flesh is grass. When Peter said, "not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever," he also adds, by casting down and despising the easy corruption of human glory, and so to speak, its non-subsistence, enticing the listeners to cling to those things which are proposed by themselves, as those which have subsistence and endlessness. However, the subsistence of those things that come to corruption is here called grass and the flower of grass. Moreover, the weakness of the subsistence of grass is brought to a greater faith of the word: with which David compares our life. (Ps. 41:1) Wherever, therefore, it shows our glory to be so worthless, it again repeats and teaches more openly what it is that has regenerated them through the word of God which lives and abides forever, and it says:
"But this is the word that has been announced to you." That which remains forever is confirmed in the same way with the Lord. For He Himself said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away." (Matt. 24:35) Moreover, it must be known that this should be expressed: "Love one another fervently should be expressed in a manner free from all deceit." For such outcomes tend to follow those which are treated and carried out for their sake. Therefore, since mutual love from the world leads to fervent love that is unaware of deceit, it is rightly done that "From the world" precedes, and "To love fervently" follows. It should be noted that the preposition εἰς, that is, “unto”, is translated into διά, that is, “for the sake of”, so that the sense is: for the sake of "Love one another fervently."
