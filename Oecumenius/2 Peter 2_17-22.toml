These are the springs lacking water, the clouds carried by the storm, by which the darkness of gloom has been preserved for eternity. Indeed, where the proud words of vanity have sounded, they ensnare through the lusts of the flesh in their desires, those who have truly fled, who were wandering in error, while promising them freedom, when they themselves are slaves of corruption. For by whom anyone is overcome, to him he is also enslaved. For if, after having fled from the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled and overcome, the latter end has become worse for them than the beginning. For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them. But it has happened to them according to the true proverb: A dog returns to its own vomit, and a pig, having washed, to her rolling in the mud.
While Peter was saying many things, among which he also brought up the example of Balaam, he again took up the discourse about the impure Gnostics, and compared them to sources lacking water, as those who have lost the water of life, that is, the purity of preaching and drinkable water: which when the Lord had, he promised that he would satisfy many who came to it. (Jn. 1:6) But he also compared them to clouds carried by the wind, in a contrary manner: for this reason, he also called the wind a storm, as one that turns and disturbs what is agitated: for this is what a storm usually does. Therefore, they are not radiant clouds like the saints, but mists full of darkness. (Isa. 60:2)
“by which the darkness of gloom has been preserved for eternity” (but it is said to be eternal judgment); and for what reason? Peter added the cause, that through proud words stemming from vanity, they ensnare those who have truly fled and who once wandered in error through fleshly desire in corruption. Therefore, those who commit these acts are subject to impurities, arrogance, and impiety. But also, Peter says, since they are of the aforementioned filth, which he rightly calls corruption, they promise freedom to those who are deceived, not indeed of true life, but of that which is according to indulgence. Therefore, he also adds a reason why they are slaves of sin, saying something remarkable, that whoever is led astray by any passion is also bound to this in slavery. Then Peter again confirms this with another example, showing how one who is overcome by someone else is also a slave to him, and he makes an argument based on this assumption.
"For if, after having fled." In the present discourse, Peter strives to establish two things: that it is necessary for the one who is overcome to serve the one by whom he is overcome; and that those who, after the recognition of the Truth, embrace again the former things, fall into worse conditions than the evil things they previously experienced. He also adds a proverb for support. Therefore, the entire discourse should be arranged in this way: For if, after the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they have fled from the pollutions of the world, and are again entangled and overcome by them, they certainly serve them, and in their servitude they experience worse things than before the knowledge, greatly aided by our adversary Satan, so that they may be dragged down to worse in repayment for their former termination from evil deeds. Therefore, the Apostle also says that since this happens to them, that they sing a retractation of evils, it would have been better for them not to have known the truth at all than to be captured by worse things after they having known it.
For since a dog returns to its own vomit is more abominable. For what nature had hated, and thus had compelled it to reject, this again having in delight, and as if eating those things that corrupt, and as if ejected through a miscarriage of nature, is more abominable. And the pig again seeking to roll in the mud, if it does this, will appear dirtier than the previous filth.
Repetition of the wickedness of heretical men: in which it is also discussed how Christ will suddenly come at the end of this age: therefore it is said that one must be adorned with every virtue.
