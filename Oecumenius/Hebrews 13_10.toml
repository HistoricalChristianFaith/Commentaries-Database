"We have an altar." Since Paul said that we should not observe foods, lest they think our offerings are shameful by being unobserved, he says: For do we not also have observances? But not of foods, rather of our altar, namely, of the unbloody sacrifice of the life-giving body. For even the very high priests of the Jews are not permitted to partake of this; for they who serve in the tabernacle, as it were, in the type and shadow, and not in truth.
"from which those who serve the tabernacle have no authority to eat." Not such as the Jewish ones, Paul says, and ours; so that it is not even lawful for the high priest to partake of them.
