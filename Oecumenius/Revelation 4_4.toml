The twenty-four elders seated on the thrones would be known only by God, the knower of hidden things; and to whom He Himself reveals it. As far as my speculation goes, they were Abel, Enoch, and Noah; Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; Melchizedek and Job; Moses and Aaron; Joshua son of Nun and Samuel; David, Elijah, and Elisha; the twelve minor prophets represented as one figure; Isaiah and Jeremiah; Ezekiel and Daniel; Zechariah and John; James son of Joseph, and Stephen, the witnesses of the new covenant. It could be said that Peter, Paul, and James, the brother of John, whom Herod killed by the sword (Acts 12:2), along with the rest of the holy apostles, if they did not have a promise from the Lord, would not now, but rather in the Renewal of All Things [παλιγγενεσίᾳ], sit upon twelve thrones, distinct from those already mentioned. For this is what the Lord said to them in the Gospel according to Matthew: "Truly I tell you, you who have followed me will, at the Renewal of All Things [παλιγγενεσίᾳ], when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." (Matt. 19:28)

The white garments serve as a symbol of their purity throughout life.

The crowns, in turn, represent victory over passions and spiritual enemies.
