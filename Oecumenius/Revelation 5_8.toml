Having received the little scroll from the Lord, all worshiped it, fully aware of the salvation it is destined to bring to humanity, and the punishment it holds for the impure demons. The elders holding harps signify the harmonious and melodious nature of their confession to God, according to the written word: "Sing to our God, sing." (Ps. 46:7)

The incense symbolizes the offering from all the nations. For Malachi says, in the person of God, to the disobedient Israel: "I do not accept a sacrifice from your hands, because from the rising of the sun to its setting, my name has been glorified among the nations, and in every place incense is offered in my name, and a pure sacrifice." (Mal. 1:10-11) Proclaiming beforehand through these the faith and gift-bearing of the nations.
