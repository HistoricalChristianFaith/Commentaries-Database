If anyone comes to you and does not bring this doctrine, do not receive him into your house, nor greet him. For he who greets him shares in his evil deeds.
"If anyone comes to you" (2 Jn. 10) confirms those to whom he writes. If anyone, he says, comes to you without this confession, not only will he not receive protection from you, but he will also not receive the prayer for salvation from you, rightly and cautiously saying this, as if this prayer for salvation is owed only to those who agree with us in morals and faith. For whom do we pray for salvation, except for those who are of similar morals and faith? Therefore, if such a prayer for salvation is offered by us to the wicked, it is certainly presented as if it were offered to the faithful and those of similar morals, and thus they have been accepted as companions by us, and they have dragged us down to their abyss.
