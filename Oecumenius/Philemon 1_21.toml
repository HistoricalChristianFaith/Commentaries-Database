"confident". Paul said, "You do this not for me, but for Christ."

"confident in your obedience". I did not write to you as one commanding or stubbornly dealing with you, but having confidence "in your obedience". Whom would these things not soften, even if he were made of iron?

"knowing that you will also do more than I say". Paul said this, persuading Philemon in every way to accept Onesimus, if not for any other reason, then at least so as not to destroy his own reputation if he had any with the Apostle.
