And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments. Whoever says, "I know him," but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him. But whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we know that we are in him. Whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
"And by this we know." When John had said above that those who believed in the Lord have fellowship with him (1 Jn. 1:6), he now presents what confirms that fellowship towards him, and he says: "And by this we know that we have come to know him." This divine man often uses similar expressions in the same way: as when he says: "He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him." (Jn. 1:10)
Thus, therefore, John now uses the word "to know." That we know him, that is, that we are mixed with him, from this we know if we observe his commandments. The word γινώσκειν, that is, "to know", signifies two things, especially in sacred Scripture, namely to know something: as when it is said: "I have known that the Lord will execute judgment on the poor." (Ps. 139:1) Moreover, it signifies an all-encompassing connection and confirmation towards someone, which is called knowledge: as when it is said, "The Lord knows the ways of the innocent," (Ps. 37:18) and as Paul says, "That we may know God just as we are also known by Him." (1 Cor. 13:12) Similarly, it must be said about ignorance that it is understood in two ways. For just as it seems to external writers that there is one knowledge of opposites. According to this, therefore, to know is taken in two ways in this context. Indeed, when it says, "By this we know," it is taken for knowing; but when it is said, "That we know him," this means that we are firmly joined with him. For he who has a partnership with someone is also joined and connected to him in what he shares.
Therefore, John also adds, "we keep His commandments." From this, that is also resolved: "The Lord knows who are His," (2 Tim. 2:19) and that: "He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us:" (2 Cor. 5:21) and anything else that is discussed in Sacred Scripture regarding knowledge or ignorance. Then, on the contrary, he confirms the same, using a more abundant proof, and says: Whoever says, "I know him," or "I have fellowship with him," and does not keep his commandments is a liar. For how can it be that the same person is joined to him and yet not joined? Certainly, keeping the commandments indicates obedience, while not observing them indicates that one is by no means a friend.
Therefore, whoever knows God is also known by Him, either having become a partner with God and united with God; and in this, the love of God is evident, through which love he will have the perfection that is in God, and by this, he will judge his closeness to God. For perfect love is indeed exhibited through works. However, since it happens that someone may convey precepts rightly and precisely, while their own affections are sluggish: this is far from God. Therefore, it is said that one who abides in God should also direct the paths of their own life according to Him.
