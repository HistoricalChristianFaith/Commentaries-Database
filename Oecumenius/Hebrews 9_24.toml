Since the Jews were greatly concerned about the temple, see how it is diminished in comparison to heaven. "a mere copy of the true one." For the temple was handmade and was constructed as a type of heaven.

"but he entered into heaven itself." The phrase, "he entered into heaven," should be understood from a common perspective, as if to say, Nor does he frequently offer himself, for he has entered into heaven. For indeed, frequently to offer sacrifices through blood belongs to those who enter into the copies of the true one, but not to him who has entered into heaven itself.
