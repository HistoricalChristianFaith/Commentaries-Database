In the holy Scriptures it is customary to call the tent constructed in the desert by Bezalel, the architect of the things made at that time, the “tent of witness” because it was the tent of the testimonies and ordinances of God. There was in it the ark of the covenant, the mercy seat, the table, the altars either for incense or for fruit offerings, the lampstand and whatever else God commanded holy Moses to provide, saying, “According to all that I show you on the mountain you shall make for me.” Therefore, in view of the image of the ancient tabernacle he has called also the supercelestial temple, which is always a “tent of witness.” From there, it says, “the seven angels came out.” Why was it necessary that the heavenly ministers of God be seen coming out from there rather than from the heavenly temple? They had in their hands, it says, seven plagues that they were going to release against the earth. For at the time of the consummation there will be many signs on the earth of which also Christ made mention in the Gospels when he was teaching about the end. That the angels are clothed in a pure, bright stone is indicative of their rank, purity and brightness, and that they possess a nature wholly given to the good, since they have put on Christ. For the Lord is called “stone” by the divine Scriptures. For example, Isaiah said, “Behold, I am laying for the foundations of Zion a costly and select stone,” and the prophet said, “The stone which the builders rejected, he has become the head of the corner.” The all-wise Paul also exhorts us to put on this stone, saying, “Put on our stone, Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires.” And whoever is enclothed with this [stone] is free from every desire destructive of the soul.
