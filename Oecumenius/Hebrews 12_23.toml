"and to God the judge of all."As if he were saying: They did not even dare to listen to the word; but you, on the other hand, have approached the very judge, that is, Christ. "For the Father," he says, "does not judge anyone, but has given all judgment to the Son." (Jn. 5:22) —
"and to the spirits of the righteous." For you will be with them, who have come to the New Testament. Paul calls them, as those who will then have their perfection, just as he says above: "Lest they be made perfect without us." (Heb. 11:40)
