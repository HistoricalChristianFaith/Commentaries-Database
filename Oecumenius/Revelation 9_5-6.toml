Is this why some of the fathers accepted the restoration of sinners, saying that they were to be chastised so far, but no further, as they had been cleansed by their punishment? But what is to be done, when most of the fathers say this, while the accepted Scriptures say that the punishment of those who were then being chastised is everlasting? What, therefore, should one say, or how should one reconcile these views? One must combine the opinions of both. 

I say this as a suggestion and not as an affirmation; for I associate myself with the teaching of the church in meaning that the future punishments will be everlasting, since this is also what the Lord said in the gospel according to Matthew, “And these will go away into everlasting punishment,” and Isaiah, “Their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched.” 

So this is to be taken as a suggestion, taking a middle path between each view, because up to a certain time, which the present Revelation said is five months, using the number in a kind of mystical way, sinners will be most severely punished as if stung by a scorpion; but after this we shall be punished more gently, though we shall certainly not be entirely unpunished, to such an extent that we may seek death and not find it. For why would those who were not being punished at all need to seek death? 

He says, Death flies from them, for they pass all their life in punishment.
