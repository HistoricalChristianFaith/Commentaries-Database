For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household; and if it begins with us, what will the outcome be for those who do not obey the gospel of God? And, If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner? Therefore, let those who are afflicted according to the will of God entrust their souls to a faithful Creator by doing good.
"For it is time for judgment to begin with God's household." It makes them anxious and terrifies them, driving them away from sloth and a relaxed life; therefore, it also adds: "If the investigation of matters already done begins first with us who are the house of God, what should we think will be the end of those who did not believe? Judgment now does not mean condemnation, but investigation, scrutiny, discussion to choose what is better." However, let it begin first from the house of God, since, according to our Basil the Great, we are more annoyed towards those who are most familiar to us when they sin against us: but to God, there are no others more familiar than the faithful, who complete the house of God, or the Church. Therefore, the Savior also said: "He will say first to those who will be on his right hand." (Matt. 25:34) However, this judgment here refers to the examination, namely the afflictions that the wicked bring upon the faithful: of which the Lord also foretold the instigation when He said: "They will hand you over to councils." etc. (Matt. 5:17)
Then, as if to console them, He adds: And, If it is hard for the righteous to be saved, what will become of the ungodly. And this is confirmed by the Scripture which says: "If the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear?" (Prov. 11:31) However, this is what Scripture intends to signify: If the righteous attain salvation through labor and affliction (for the kingdom of heaven is taken by violence (Matt. 9:12), and through many afflictions one attains it Acts 14:21), what will those who lead a depraved and indulgent life attain? It must be understood in the future age regarding what concerns the wicked. Therefore, if this is so, he says,
who are afflicted according to will of God, so that we do not become sluggish, but rather entrust their souls to a faithful Creator by doing good. He said, according to the will of God, either signifying that our afflictions are not without divine providence but are distributed to us as a test from Him; or that, being afflicted by the will of God, we attribute the outcome to Him. For He is indeed faithful, that is, secure and who does not lie in His promises: nor will He allow us to be afflicted beyond what we can bear. But how should one commit oneself to God? (1 Cor. 10:13)
By doing good, Peter says. And what is that? By the modesty of the soul, committing oneself to Him without exalting oneself because of what one suffers: but the greater the suffering seems, the more firmly one should cling to Him, so that one considers oneself useless and says, "for you are righteous in all the things that you have done to us." (Dan. 3:27) Moreover, the wicked and the sinner differ in this respect: for the wicked is completely alien to God, while the sinner clings to God somewhat, but as one who despises Him and transgresses His laws. However, one can be both wicked and a sinner: for whoever works iniquity acts wickedly, in that he sins, thinking that God does not exist.
