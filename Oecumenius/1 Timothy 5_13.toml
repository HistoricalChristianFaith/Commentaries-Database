And also they learn to be idle, wandering about from house to house; not only idle, but also gossips and chatterers, speaking things they ought not.

— [OECUMENIUS] And also they learn to be idle. How do the idle women learn? Having the men who are brought in to assist them provide what is necessary for their old age, they are negligent about their tasks, but they take care to appear pleasing to the men. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius A f.172v; B f.208r; G f.296r] —

not only idle, but also gossips. For the mind has been created by the Creator for us to work. Therefore, when we do not provide it with good work, it itself takes on absurd tasks.
