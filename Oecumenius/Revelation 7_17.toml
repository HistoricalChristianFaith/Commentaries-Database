He therefore says in the present passage that no trial would harm them any longer; for they are deemed worthy by Christ to be shepherded and to be nourished at the springs of living water.

And God says He will wipe away every tear from their eyes. For those who have therefore lived and struggled with gentleness owe no useless tears, nor "weeping or gnashing of teeth," (Matt. 13:42, 50; 24:51) but all things are good and extraordinary.
