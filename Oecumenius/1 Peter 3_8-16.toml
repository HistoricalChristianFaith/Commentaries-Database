In summary, all of you, be united, compassionate, endowed with fraternal love, merciful, approachable, humility not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead blessing: knowing that you were called to this, that you may inherit a blessing. For whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit; let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it. For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil. And who is he who will harm you if you become followers of what is good? But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you are blessed. And do not be afraid of their threats, nor be troubled, but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts. And always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear: having a good conscience, that when they defame you as evildoers, those who revile your good conduct in Christ may be ashamed.
Free from the ordinances that concerned both men and women, Peter then presents a common exhortation to all men, women, youths, adolescents, kings, leaders, subjects, and those who are governed, foreigners, citizens, the rich, and the poor. Therefore, he adds: "In summary." That is, what is the need to discuss in detail? I say simply to all of you. For this signifies summary/τέλος): and this refers to the goal of salvation proposed to all, and this is the law of love; established for all, from which all virtue proceeds, namely, the modesty of the soul, compassion, mercy, and other similar virtues which he enumerated,
the united indeed being harmony without discrimination about something with a willing spirit:
compassionate, however, is pity towards those who are afflicted as if towards oneself:
fraternal, on the other hand, is the due affection towards relatives as towards brothers.
Again, merciful is the movement from the soul to do good towards those who are in the same condition.
Indeed, approachable or benevolence is kindness and courtesy towards all, which also extends towards those of similar character and towards friends.
Humility, however, or modesty of the soul, is bearing another's insults, acknowledging one's own sins, and enduring accusations, which could also be a form of kindness of the soul.
Indeed, insult arises from a corrupt habit, which is rooted in the reproach of others. With these, Peter says, adorned with the aforementioned virtues, moreover, you should not be easily captured by warfare: furthermore, competitors are also directed by the divine way of living. For he who is blessed by all must certainly also be a competitor. And he brings in David (Ps. 34:12-15) as a witness saying:
For whoever desires to love life? Life, I say, not in which even irrational beings exist, but in which man lives according to God, and days that are not bad, but good. For the days of this age, according to the patriarch Jacob, are few and evil. (Gen. 47:9) But where the prophetic oracle concludes, because it was placed therein:
The eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil: Peter adds to these: If you live in this way, you will have God as gracious and obedient. Therefore, who, with Him standing by you, will boldly attack you? For all things are in His hand; death and life are in the hand of the Lord. Nevertheless, since the afflictions imposed for the sake of faith seemed to some to be evil, the blessed Peter correcting this said: not repaying evil for evil or insult for insult, but instead blessing. For the fear awaiting from men should not be regarded, but it lasts only for a very short time, as it comes from those who themselves pass away very quickly.
For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayers; but the face of the Lord is against those who do evil, threatening destruction to the wicked. Indeed, if these evils were present, surely the distributor of good things would not allow His beloved ones to be afflicted by evils: for He sends evils upon the wicked. Therefore, these are not evils, but afflictions inflicted for the sake of devotion. Furthermore, God commands “to sanctify Him in the hearts,” as Isaiah says (Is. 8:13): this means, do not glory in those things that appear, but in the hidden treasury of your hearts, working the sanctification of the Lord, which consists in the separation of the nations from their abominations or wicked customs;
thus sanctify Him. However, being sanctified, while others glorify Him through your good conduct, just as God and man Himself commands when He says: "Let your light shine before men," etc. (Matt. 5:16) What is said about being ready is connected to the previous part, for example,
"all of you, be united." The word "be" is also attributed to the common understanding, so the meaning is: "May you always be ready." He wants to command that a faithful person should always be prepared regarding the discourse of faith, so that at any time when a reason concerning it is sought from us, we may easily respond;
moreover, in responding, let us do so with meekness, as if God Himself were present: no diligent servant would be arrogant in the presence of his master. It also adds the profit that follows from this, namely, the inquiry of the unbelievers and the kindness of the mind towards us. However, it should be noted that these are not contrary to what has been said by the Lord, for He indeed commands not to be anxious about what we should answer when we are brought before rulers and authorities. (Matt. 10:19) Indeed, the Lord's words about martyrdom were spoken, as He also says that virtue and a more powerful discourse should be given than any human wisdom, and that one who despises the surrounding fears: however, Peter's opinion speaks of doctrine. For without understanding and inquiry, it is worthy of reproach to think one knows something. For the knowledge of the foolish is an unprofitable discourse. (Eccles. 21:21) Moreover, since we were accused of various wicked things, and they also showed that our hope was vain, he says that we should bring forth considered responses about these things, having at the same time a proven life, which he certainly calls conscience.
"knowing that you were called to this." The order is with the aforementioned structure. In summary, or I may say absolutely, may you all be unanimous and so forth, knowing that you have been called to this, to bless, that is, to bless all. For Paul says: “Bless those who persecute you.” (Rom. 12:14) By doing this, you will inherit the name, so that you may be heard by all as those who bless. For it is not just to bring reproach upon anyone who clings to eternal life. Therefore, David also advises to have a pure tongue from reproach for one who is affected with a loving heart towards true life, etc. (Ps. 15:3) Thus, being prepared, you will have the omnipotent and all-seeing inspector kindly observing you, not with a stern or angry mind, as he looks upon those who do evil. If this is the case, who will harm you? And if you are afflicted while you are doers and initiators of good, do not be of little spirit, but rejoice: first of all, because these things are not evil; and also, because you are blessed and not miserable because of these things.
Therefore, sanctify God in your hearts, and do not be afraid of human fear nor be troubled. But always be ready to give a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you. And do this with the demonstration of good actions. For by doing so gently and with kindness, you will confirm that you are well aware of yourselves, and you will shame those who have evil suspicions about you.
"Having a good conscience." That is, while you are well aware of yourselves and not evil, as those who slander you are.
"that when they defame you." That is, those who create trouble with words, harshly investigating.
