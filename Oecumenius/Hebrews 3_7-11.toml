Saying that it is necessary to hope for good things from Christ, he now says that we must not harden our hearts towards this faith and hope, so that we do not suffer the same things as those who, in the desert, became unbelievers. And today, which is always evident, as if he were saying: Whenever and as long as today is, if you hear the voice of the one calling Christ, do not harden your hearts and become stubborn so as not to hear him.
"do not harden your hearts." For the hard and unyielding and stubborn are against the one who speaks to them.
"your hearts." For the Israelites, he says, becoming hard-hearted, provoked the God who was speaking to them.
"On the day of testing." And what is this rebellion that occurred on that day? When, distrusting God, they tested Him. "Will He be able," he says, "to give bread, or prepare a table for His people?" (Ps. 77:19)

"where your fathers tested me." Where, that is, in the desert. Or, where they tested Him in temptation, so that it may be the "where," not the indicative place.

"I was provoked with that generation." That is, I was burdened by it, because they always distrusted and tested Me.
"as I swore in my wrath." To such an extent, he says, they did not know my ways, until they brought me to this point, so that I swore they shall not enter my rest, that is, the land of promise, in which having entered they were to rest from wars.
"If they shall enter into my rest." But those, having been unfaithful and having tempted God, did not enter into Palestine. For this is the rest. But what will be for us, he says, since there is no other rest on earth, of which we are to be deprived by being disobedient to God? Yes, he says, there will be now the true rest, of which that old one was a type, and you will be deprived of this, if indeed you disbelieve in Christ. For there are three rests. One is the Sabbath, in which God rested from his works. The second, the promised land of Palestine. The third, the truly real one, of which the two mentioned were a type, the kingdom of heaven, where all sorrow and pain and sighing have fled away. Therefore, he says, you will be deprived of this by being disobedient to Christ.
