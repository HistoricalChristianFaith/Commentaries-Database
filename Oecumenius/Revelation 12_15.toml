And the serpent is said to have cast water out of his mouth behind the woman like a river, to make her carry the river-borne burden; the divine Scripture allegorizes the temptation as a river, saying that through Jonah he "cast me into the depths of the heart of the sea, and rivers surrounded me" (Jonah 2:3); and through the Lord it says: "the rain came down; the rivers were present; the winds came; yet they did not overthrow the house founded on the rock." (Matt. 7:25) He therefore calls the trial upon the suffering of the Lord a river. Through this, he says, the Virgin is to be drowned; and indeed, the attack reached him and the extreme of sorrow, so that the Dragon was able to fulfill his intention.

What does Simeon say to her? "And a sword will pierce your own soul also, so that thoughts from many hearts may be revealed." (Luke 2:35)
