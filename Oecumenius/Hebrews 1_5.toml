We heard, and we who are men, are true sons through grace. The angels, however, did not hear this, lest their sublimity be thought to be from nature rather than from grace. Christ, however, is not from grace, but from nature.
"I have begotten You." The Father relates the birth of the Son according to the flesh, therefore he said: "today"; Thus says the holy Athanasius.
"I will be to Him a Father."

Again, accept this as the Son's birth according to the flesh, belonging to the Father; for it is clearly said, "I will be to Him a Father, and He shall be to Me a Son according to the flesh."
