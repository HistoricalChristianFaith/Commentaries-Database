Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to come to you searched and investigated carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating when he testified in advance about the sufferings that would come upon Christ and the glories that would follow. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the Gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven; into which angels long to see.
Since Peter had made mention of the salvation of the soul: however, this was not clear, but he brings forth the prophets who inquired and studied about it. For they inquired about future events: as Daniel did, who was called a man of desires by the angel, who gave him divine responses. (Dan. 9:23)
"inquiring what person or time the Spirit." To that, namely the consummation of the age: such as when the Jews, through various captivities, deviating from the perfect worship of God, were constituted towards the mystery of Christ. Note, however, that the spirit of Christ openly contemplates and discusses Christ. Moreover, this Spirit signified the afflictions of Christ, as Isaiah indeed says: "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter." (Isa. 53:7) And through Jeremiah: "Come, let us put wood in his bread." (Jer. 11:19) Moreover, the resurrection through Hosea: "On the third day we will be raised up before Him, and we will pursue Him to know the Lord; as the dawn is ready, we will find Him." (Hos. 6:2-3) However, it has been revealed not for Himself, but for you. Moreover, these two things he does with these words: Peter shows the providence of the prophets, and that those who are now called to the faith of Christ were foreknown by God before the foundation of the world. Indeed, through the foresight of the prophets, he leads them, so that they are not unbelieving regarding those whom the prophets greatly cared for, for their own benefit: for neither do wise sons despise their father's labors. Indeed, if they sought and found these things, when they would not benefit themselves, and committed the findings to books, as if transmitting an inheritance to us, we would act unjustly, he says, if we were negligent in these matters: therefore, do not show our gospel as empty, leading you who announce these things to you, as rejected and insignificant. Therefore, these things are from the providence of the prophets. Through this, however, that they were foreknown by God, they are terrified lest they present themselves as unworthy by divine foreknowledge or by His calling, but they urge and inspire each other, so that they may be deemed worthy of the gift of Christ.
"through those who preached the Gospel to you." If both the prophets and these have effectively worked through the Holy Spirit: indeed, those in prophecy, and these in the Gospel: nothing is different from the prophets for them: therefore, you must bring the same diligence that those who were obedient to the prophets, lest you be subjected to the same punishment as those who were unbelieving towards the prophets.
It must be noted, however, that through this mystery of the Trinity, Peter reveals: the Son and the Spirit when he says "the Spirit of Christ," but the Father in what follows, "from heaven." Moreover, when he says "from heaven," do not take it according to place, but understand it as excellence, because it especially applies to God.
"by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven." Peter speaks of what had happened on the day of Pentecost.
However, that "into which angels longed to see" means that which angels also desire; for this reason, even while such things were happening, they sang out of abundant joy: "Glory to God in the highest." (Luke 1:14)
