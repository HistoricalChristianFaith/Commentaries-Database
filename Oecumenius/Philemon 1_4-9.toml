"I always thank my God, making mention of you in my prayers, hearing of your love and faith which you have toward the Lord Jesus and toward all the saints; that the fellowship of your faith may become effective, in the knowledge of every good thing that is in us for Christ Jesus. For we have great joy and consolation in your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you, brother. Therefore, having great boldness in Christ, I am commanding you what is proper, because of love, I urge you, being such as Paul the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ."

If ever "I" make "mention of you", I always do, "I give thanks to God" for you. Why? "Hearing of your love and faith", he says. Do you see that he does not immediately seek favor from the beginning?

"hearing of your love". which, if it were not great, would by no means be heard from Phrygia all the way to Rome.

"that the fellowship of your faith". It unites him to himself, just as if he said: Fellowship of faith is that which makes one and common. But why do you give thanks to God? So "that the" "fellowship of your faith", he says, "may become effective". But how will it be effective? If it proceeds to every work of virtue. Blessed Paul interprets himself. But how will it be "effective"? By this, that you have "the knowledge" and accomplish "every good thing".

"that is in us". He says that which is now also in us. (Matt. 25:40)

"for Christ Jesus". For whoever does good to someone, does it to Christ, especially to the saints.

"we have great joy". Not only, Paul says, did we rejoice, but such was the pleasure that it even brought us comfort while in bonds.

"because the hearts of the saints". See! He wishes to say: If you grant favors to others, much more grant them to me; thus he does not say; but otherwise more skillfully. For he knows the memory of benefits done to others makes those who are urged more obedient.

"have been refreshed through you". For, Paul says, they find rest in your love. They rest because of you. Since you are such a one toward the saints as to also give them rest, I have the boldness to command you. Having boldness because of Christ; to command you a fitting thing; for this is what is proper. But I said to command, not because I rule over you, but because of the love which I love you and am loved by you, I seem to command, but I do not command. For even if I appear to command you, it is out of love that I do not command but rather encourage. Thus, I do the matter with great regard. Being such a one, as Paul an elder. And I exhort, being such a one as one ought to be, he says, to persuade.

"Paul". And this alone is sufficient to persuade,

"the aged, but now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ". Do you see the motives for persuading?
