to speak evil of no one, to be peaceable, gentle, showing all humility to all people.

to speak evil of no one. Even if he acts badly, even if he makes a mistake in something. For our mouth must generally be free from insult. "For you say, 'Why do you judge your brother?" (Rom.:10" Why do you alter the judgment of God? For he calls the insult against his brother blasphemy.

showing all humility to all people. Both Jews and Greeks, and friends and enemies, and those who wrong you and those who harass.
