The closing and sealing of the little scroll, which contains the names of the people written in it, signifies that it is unalterable, and that their mouths are shut from any justification before God, according to what has been previously stated (Rev. 5:1). Therefore, the gradual removal of the seals signifies the gradual repetition of the boldness and intimacy toward God, which the only begotten One, having become incarnate, has made possible for us by correcting our shortcomings through His own deeds. It must be understood that the breaking of each seal signifies one of the acts performed by the Lord for our salvation, and also those carried out by Him against the spiritual enemies of our souls. For the Lord's providence toward us involves the overthrow of those powers.

Let no one be amazed at those things that will happen, that the Only Begotten existed before becoming incarnate; for the works and deeds before His coming to us are shown to the divine evangelist through vision. Yet, He appears as a Lamb in the revelation, as if slain.

For it is customary that what is seen by the prophets serves as a pre-announcement of things to come. Therefore, a man long ago contended with Jacob (Gen. 32:24), a type of Christ; thus, Isaiah saw the prophetess conceiving in her womb and bearing a son, whose name is also called, "Despoil Quickly, Plunder Rapidly." (Isa. 8:3) Thus Daniel saw the Son of Man, still without flesh, God, the Word coming to the Ancient of Days. (Dan. 7:13)

Therefore, the first blessing, which pertains to our race through our Savior Christ, is the one that opened the first seal of the little scroll and established the beginning of leading us back to where we came from, out of the transgression in Adam, and to recover for us the lost relationship with God and to transfer our previously forbidden access into boldness. This is the bodily birth established by the Lord, which sanctified our birth so that we are no longer conceived in lawlessness and carried in sins by our mothers, but we have a holy birth of Christ through our own birth, by which the human birth is blessed. And a witness to such a noble ambition toward humanity is the divine apostle, who writes: "since your children are unclean, but now they are holy." (1 Cor. 7:14)

When the first seal was opened, he said he saw a white horse coming forth from those spiritual holy beings, holding a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering so that he might conquer. A white horse serves as a symbol of the Gospel, representing the good will to be bestowed upon humanity. The crown, on the other hand, signifies power and victory. It came forth bearing the crown with Christ, as the one who began to conquer the Devil who had enslaved our race. It is said that He came forth so that the one who conquers may be victorious. Christ was the one who conquers, so that he may conquer completely, and the symbol of victory he bore was the crown. This is the first seal.
