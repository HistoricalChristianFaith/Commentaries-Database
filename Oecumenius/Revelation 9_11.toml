And they say there is a "king over them, the angel of the abyss; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon". And the name is either appropriately made and suitable for those who engage in contemplation, or at least not only are they "ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation" according to the divine apostle (Heb. 1:14), but also spirits sent for punishment to those worthy of chastisement; such was also the one who, in one night, struck down one hundred eighty-five thousand Assyrians (2 Kings 19:35; Isa. 37:96), and those who set fire to the five cities of Sodom. (Gen. 19:2)
