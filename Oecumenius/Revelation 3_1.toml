Concerning the seven stars, which are now also called the spirits of God, it has been said in the preceding passages; but now you must listen to what he says about those in Sardis.

He says, I know your works, that you have a name like you are alive, and you have the life according to God, the virtuous life, but you are dead because of your sins. For to be called dead in sins is the custom according to the divine Scripture, as is shown by what is written concerning those who have turned from unbelief to the faith in Christ by the most wise Paul: "And you, being dead in your trespasses, He made alive together with Christ." (Eph. 2:5) And the Shepherd says that some have descended into the water of the pool [baptism], obviously dead, and have risen alive.
