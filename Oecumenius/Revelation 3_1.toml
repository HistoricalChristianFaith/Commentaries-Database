I have discussed above the seven stars which he here calls the “spirits of God.” But now we must listen to what he says concerning those who live in Sardis. “I know your works,” he says, that you possess a name as though you were living a life virtuous in the sight of God, but “you are dead” in sins. For in the holy Scriptures, it is customary that those snared in sins are called “dead,” as, for example, in this passage from the most wise Paul concerning those who have passed from disbelief to faith in Christ: “And you, although dead in trespasses, he made alive together with Christ.” Likewise, the Shepherd says that those who go down into the water of baptism are “dead,” but those who come up are “living.”
