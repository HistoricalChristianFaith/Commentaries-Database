I have written these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you. And as for you, the anointing that you received from him remains in you. And you do not need anyone to teach you, but as his anointing teaches you about all things, and is true and is not a lie, just as it has taught you, remain in him.
"Truly, concerning these things", John adds: "I have written to you about those who deceive you": that is, because of the heresies that have emerged.
Then he again adds what we mentioned before, making it so that his speech is not burdensome to them, "the anointing that you received from him remains in you."
What that is, John already has said, namely that the Holy Spirit speaks. Therefore, since you have the Holy Spirit, you have it firmly within yourselves, you do not need anyone to teach you: but as the anointing or the Spirit itself teaches you about all things, just as it has taught you, abide in Him (verse 28): for it is true, and it is not a lie, that which it has taught you.
"And the anointing that you have received." This is the sequence of the letters: And you, since the anointing which you have received from him remains in you, do not need anyone to teach you.
