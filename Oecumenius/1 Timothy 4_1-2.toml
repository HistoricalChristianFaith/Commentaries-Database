through the hypocrisy. That is, deceitful work. However, it stands that since they know the falseness of their dogmas, they strive to speak falsely. And Paul says that liars are those whose conscience has been seared by an evil life, that is, a depraved life: and because they are aware of much filth within themselves, therefore their conscience bears stubborn marks of a sleazy life. Truly, those who are such, through fear of retribution, pervert true dogmas, persuading themselves of anything rather than that only God is the just judge, the resurrection, and the retribution of good and evil.
