From out of the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, this should not be done. Does the fountain give forth out of one hole sweet and sour water? Can, my brethren, the fig tree yield grapes: or the vine, figs? So neither can the salt water yield sweet.
"From out of the same mouth." This kind of sacred discipline has received nothing bitter to be emitted, nothing ungrateful.
