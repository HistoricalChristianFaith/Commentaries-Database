This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ: not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the Spirit who bears witness, because the Spirit is the truth. For there are three that bear witness: the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three are one.
Since John also remembered the birth of children, saying: "Everything that is born of God" (1 Jn. 5:4): these things, however, happen to us through sacred baptism; therefore he says: "This is he who came by water and blood, Jesus Christ." And for what purpose did he come? To renew us and make us children of God. For this is also understood as a consequent statement, so that this is the meaning. "For whatever is born of God overcomes the world." But how was it born? He says, by water and blood. Indeed, Jesus Christ who came renews through water and blood. John adds again, repeating the statement, saying: not by water only, namely regenerating, but by water and blood. For he wishes first to show the name of Christ who adopted us: since the man who was in him, the first adopted by God, also gave us through his adoption such dignity, which has been demonstrated three times: namely in the baptism in the Jordan, when the heavenly Father testified that he who was being baptized was his beloved Son. (Matt. 3:17)
But who was he that entered the water except the man who was taken up together with the Word of God? Certainly, he who appeared in secret, for he needed a testimony. Therefore, by the water, that is, in the baptism that takes place through water, the Son of God, Jesus, was demonstrated to be so by the testimony of the Father. And by the blood, when he was to be crucified, he said: "Glorify me, Father," (Jn. 17:1) and a voice was heard: "And I have glorified and will glorify again;" (Jn. 12:28) which those who heard thought to be thunder.
By the Spirit, however, when He rose from the dead as God. For it is left to God alone to raise Himself. Furthermore, by the term Spirit, God is signified: since the Spirit is God. (Jn. 4:24) Therefore, since three bear witness to Jesus' adoption, namely baptism, crucifixion, and resurrection, there is no uncertainty in the Lord's adoption: by which adoption He also granted us, as He who was the first fruits of the entire human mass (Rom. 11:16), to be children of God. And these three are united in one Christ: for this is what it signifies, saying: "These three are one," that is, as a testimony concerning Christ. It should be noted that some of the fathers received the Spirit, not because of the resurrection, but the Father Himself when He cried out in the Jordan: "This is my beloved Son (Matt. 17:5);" because God is also called Spirit, as we have predicted.
