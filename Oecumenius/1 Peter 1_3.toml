Blessed be God and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
Peter blesses God, referring this act of thanksgiving for the good things He grants. But what are those things that are given? Hope, not like the promised dwelling in the land of Canaan through Moses, which hope, being corruptible, promises corruptible things: but a living hope. And from where has it received life? From Jesus Christ who rose from the dead. For by the fact that He rose, He grants the same resurrection to those who come to Him through faith. Therefore, the living hope that is given is an incorruptible and undefiled inheritance, not laid up on earth, as it was for the fathers, but in heaven, from where it has also obtained endlessness, which is even greater than the inheritance that is on earth. And for this reason, the preservation and guardianship of the believers: for even this the Lord prayed, saying: "Holy Father, keep them." (Jn. 17:11) But also power. And what is patience? That which endures until the revelation or manifestation of the Lord. For if the protection were not powerful, it would not last for such a long time. Therefore, since there are such great and such things that are given, it is not absurd that joy follows those who receive. However, since the master's promise brings not joy but sorrow by saying: "In the world, you will have tribulation," (Jn. 16:33) he adds a little to the exultation. And because it is sad, he adds "Now," speaking in accordance with his leader, who says: "In the world, you will have tribulation," but your sorrow will turn into joy. Either what he said "Now" or "But," is added for the sake of exultation, as if the exultation that will follow will not last for a little while, but for a long and infinite time. Or "A little," refers to what is sorrowful, so that the sense here is: If it is necessary, we are now sorrowful for a little while through various tribulations. But since afflictions bring about turmoil, he added the reason for afflictions, that through these your faith is made more manifest and more precious than gold, since that which is tested by fire is more valuable to men. Peter also adds: If it is necessary, for not every faithful person is tested through affliction, nor is every sinner. Yet neither does each of these always rejoice: the just are indeed afflicted for the increase of their crowns, while sinners suffer to pay the penalties of their sins. However, not all the just are afflicted, lest you attribute vice to praise and detest virtue. Nor are all sinners afflicted, lest there be a loss of hope in the resurrection, as if all those who are their own receive here.
