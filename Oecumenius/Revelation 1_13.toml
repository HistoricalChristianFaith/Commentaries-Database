He calls him “son of man” who for our sakes humbled himself to the form of a servant, namely, Christ, who became “fruit of the womb,” as the holy psalmist says, that is, the womb of the unwedded and ever-virgin Mary. For since Mary is a human being and our sister, it is appropriate that God the Word, conceived virginally according to the flesh, is also called “son of man.” And he has spoken with precision, for he did not say “son of man” but “like a son of man,” since he is also God and Lord of all,the Emmanuel.
