so that they may train the young women to love their husbands, to love their children, to be self-controlled, pure, homemakers, kind, submissive to their own husbands, so that the word of God may not be reviled.

so that they may train the young women. Paul is not speaking only about their daughters but of women in general, and for the younger to be subordinate to the older.
