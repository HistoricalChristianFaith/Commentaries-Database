And I heard, he says, a voice like harpists singing a new song before the throne and the living creatures and the elders. The music pleasing to God and harmony of the song is indicated by the sound going forth as of those playing the harp; for if praise is not beautiful in the mouth of a sinner according to what is written (Sir. 15:9), certainly it is beautiful and melodious in the mouth of the righteous.
