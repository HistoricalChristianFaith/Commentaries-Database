For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

For there is one God, and one mediator. Note that he did not say, Two, but, One and one, thus avoiding the multiplication of gods. Since the one who was to mediate was absent, to partake of both so that He could also mediate, the Son of God, the eternal Logos [ὁ προαιώνιος Λόγος], having become incarnate, came forth, existing from two natures, namely from divinity and humanity, and is understood and worshiped in one person after the union. For if the Only Begotten had appeared to us in bare divinity, creation would not have shown Him, where the sons of Israel were not able to see the face of Moses. But the phrase "One God" is not placed in opposition to the Son or the Spirit—far from it!—but against those who are not, called gods. It is asked why the Spirit is not mentioned. Because the discussion was about the Greeks. For concerning them is the phrase, "and to come to the knowledge of the truth." (1 Tim. 2:4) Among them there was polytheism, and he carefully guarded the economy of remembering the "Spirit," lest somehow he introduce the appearance of polytheism. Since he converses there with the faithful, he continually remembers Him, often even alone, not bringing to mind the Father and the Son.

the man Christ Jesus. As He was man, so He was also God, indivisibly, inseparably.
