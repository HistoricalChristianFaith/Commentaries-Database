By ‘those who had been beheaded’ he means those who had been killed with an axe. He is speaking figuratively about those who had been put to death their own bodies because of their faith in Christ, and who endured very much because of it. For they expelled them from the synagogues, assaulted them with countless abuses, and plundered their personal possessions, when they put their faith entirely in Christ, as the wise apostle testifies.(Heb. 10:34) The Lord also spoke of them, “blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.(Matt. 5:11)” If you follow the sequence of the argument and subject every thought in obedience to Holy Scripture, you will understand that those who did not worship ‘the beast’ and did not receive ‘its mark or it image’ are those who did not agree with the rest of the Jews in their plots against the Lord, and who refused to obey the propositions of the abominable and blasphemous Devil. For this is to worship him and ‘his image.’ For by the word ‘image’ he means the imprint of the Devil’s will in the hearts of the Jews. He also means that this ‘mark’ includes both control and action. For the head, of which the forehead is a part, stands for control and the hand stands for action.

And I saw the seats... He sees in his vision the holy apostles ‘seated on 12 thrones’ and ‘judging the 12 tribes of Israel, (Mt. 19:28)’ according to the promise made to them. Although this will be more fully effected in the age to come, it has already happened in some way in the time of the incarnation. For those who put their trust in the Lord and so received a share in countless benefits condemned those who refused to hasten to the faith and so, though taught by the grace given to the Apostles, did not attain the true worship of God, but rather devised a cross and death for him.

He explains yet more fully the life of the incarnate Lord, namely, that which now meets us in the vision. For it says, “Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom judgment was committed.” He sees the holy apostles to whom the promise was made that they would “sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” Although this will be fulfilled more completely in the coming age, it did happen partially at the time of the incarnation. For when they believed in the Lord and shared in a multitude of blessings, they condemned those who did not wish to come to the faith and those who, although they had been taught by the grace given to the apostles, did not advance to the same piety but rather plotted his death on the cross.

And it says, “and the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony to Jesus and for the word of God.” These, in common with the others, he saw sitting on thrones and judging the rest of humankind. It says that they were “beheaded,” for they had been killed by the axe. He is speaking figuratively about the members of those who died for the sake of the faith in Christ and especially those who were martyred for the faith. For to be sure, [the Jews] caused them to be thrown outside the synagogues with much revilement and they confiscated for themselves their property, as the wise apostle testifies, for they believed completely in Christ. The Lord also spoke about these persons: “Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.” And following the thought of the narrative and holding captive every idea in obedience to the holy Scriptures, you will consider those who did not worship the beast or receive his mark and his image to be those who did not conspire with the rest of the Jews in their plots against the Lord, nor [did they wish] to obey the suggestions of the devil, who is hated of God. For this would be to worship him and also his image. The imprint of his will upon the hearts of the Jews he calls an “image,” which he also calls a “mark,” which encompasses both their guiding and their active principles. For the head, of which the forehead is a member, is representative of the guiding principle, while the hand is representative of the active principle.

“They came to life and reigned with Christ a thousand years.” He again speaks of a “thousand years” to indicate, as we said above, the sojourn of the Lord on the earth. During this time they lived the spiritual life and reigned with Christ, confronting demons and giving honor to suffering and bringing about a great many miracles. Not that one is only to be present with Christ, the King of glory, one should also reign with him. And so it is spoken by the prophet concerning them: “When the heavenly One scatters kings upon it, they will become white as snow on Zalmon.”
