For he says, And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was given to them. He beholds the holy apostles, according to the promise made to them, "seated upon twelve thrones and judging the twelve tribes of Israel." (Matt. 19:28) Which indeed will be fulfilled more perfectly in the age to come but also occurred to a degree at the time of the Incarnation. For those who had believed in the Lord and been transformed into countless good things judged those who did not willingly run to the faith, nor, having been led by the grace given to the apostles into devotion toward unity, did they ascend, but rather wove for him a cross and death.

And he says, that the souls of those crowned were slain because of the testimony of Jesus and because of the word of God. He saw them sitting together on thrones and judging the rest of mankind.

He says that those who had been beheaded means those who were killed with axes. He speaks metaphorically about the dead who lost their limbs because of faith in Christ, and most of them endured this for that reason. For they were made outcasts, were subjected to countless insults, and had their possessions seized by theft, as the wise apostle testifies (see Heb. 10:34), since they wholly believed in Christ.

Concerning these the Lord also said, "Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you and utter every evil word against you falsely on my account." (Matt. 5:11)

If you follow the continuity of the argument and taking every thought captive to the obedience of the divine Scripture, you will understand that those who do not worship the beast nor receive his mark and his image, as not like-minded with the rest of the Jews in plots against the Lord, nor willing to submit to the suggestions of the God-hating Devil; for this is to worship him and his image. For he calls an image the impressing of his will upon the hearts of the Jews. And he calls it a mark, encompassing their ruling and practical parts; for the form of the ruling part is the head, of which the forehead is a part, and the hand is of the practical part.

And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years. A thousand years again he calls, according to what was said before, the Lord's reign upon earth, by which they lived the spiritual life, and they reigned together with Christ, commanding demons, rebuking passions, and working countless miracles. Not that even the mere thought that he should share the kingship of the glory with Christ is granted to him alone. (see 2 Tim. 2:10-12) Therefore it is also said concerning them by the prophet in the phrase "the heavenly kings upon it shall be whitened in Selmon." (Ps. 68:14)
