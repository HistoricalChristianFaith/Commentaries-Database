By ‘those who had been beheaded’ he means those who had been killed with an axe. He is speaking figuratively about those who had been put to death their own bodies because of their faith in Christ, and who endured very much because of it. For they expelled them from the synagogues, assaulted them with countless abuses, and plundered their personal possessions, when they put their faith entirely in Christ, as the wise apostle testifies.(Heb. 10:34) The Lord also spoke of them, “blessed are you when they revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.(Matt. 5:11)” If you follow the sequence of the argument and subject every thought in obedience to Holy Scripture, you will understand that those who did not worship ‘the beast’ and did not receive ‘its mark or it image’ are those who did not agree with the rest of the Jews in their plots against the Lord, and who refused to obey the propositions of the abominable and blasphemous Devil. For this is to worship him and ‘his image.’ For by the word ‘image’ he means the imprint of the Devil’s will in the hearts of the Jews. He also means that this ‘mark’ includes both control and action. For the head, of which the forehead is a part, stands for control and the hand stands for action.

And I saw the seats... He sees in his vision the holy apostles ‘seated on 12 thrones’ and ‘judging the 12 tribes of Israel, (Mt. 19:28)’ according to the promise made to them. Although this will be more fully effected in the age to come, it has already happened in some way in the time of the incarnation. For those who put their trust in the Lord and so received a share in countless benefits condemned those who refused to hasten to the faith and so, though taught by the grace given to the Apostles, did not attain the true worship of God, but rather devised a cross and death for him.
