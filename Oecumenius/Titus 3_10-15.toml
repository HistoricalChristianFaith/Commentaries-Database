Warn a heretical man once or twice, and then reject him; knowing that such a person is perverted and sins, being self-condemned. When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, make haste to come to me at Nicopolis; for I have decided to spend the winter there. I have earnestly sent Zenas the lawyer and Apollos, so that nothing may be lacking for them. Let our own also learn to devote themselves to good works for necessary needs, so that they may not be unfruitful. All who are with me greet you. Greet those who love us in faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

— [OECUMENIUS] And elsewhere Paul says, "May God not grant them repentance." (2 Tim. 2:25) How then does he here order to cease? There he speaks about correction for those who have hope; here, however, about those suffering incurable diseases. [end of the excerpt by Oecumenius R f. 300r] —

being self-condemned. For Paul has no defense to offer, saying, "No one told me; no one advised me." Being self-condemned means either being without defense or being condemned by oneself and one's own conscience.

make haste to come to me. Why indeed, having established Titus in Crete, does Paul call him back to himself again? In order that he may be better structured and may advise on what is to be done. Nicopolis is a city of Thrace.

— [THEODORET] at Nicopolis. Nicopolis is in Thrace, and it borders on Macedonia. It is therefore clear that Paul wrote the Letter at that time when he was staying in Macedonia and Achaia. [end of the excerpt by Theodoret PG 82.869b] —

I have earnestly sent Zenas the lawyer. Experienced in the Jewish laws. Yet these had not yet been entrusted to the Church. But Apollos was a certain great man, both learned and mighty in the Scriptures.

so that nothing may be lacking for them. In every abundance, provide for them, perhaps with food and clothing.

Let our own also learn. The statement concerning teaching, or concerning instruction, as if Paul said: They themselves showed themselves to be generous towards those in need, and let them draw them to themselves, whether they are in need of teaching or of necessities.

so that they may not be unfruitful. For Paul wishes to benefit those who give rather than those who receive.

Greet those who love us in faith. Or it means those who love him, generally the faithful. And the phrase "in faith," as through faith.

Finished, with divine help, of the Epistle to Titus.

It was written from the city of Nicopolis in Macedonia to Titus, the ordained bishop of the first Church of the Cretans.
