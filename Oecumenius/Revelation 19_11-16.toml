The Evangelist now receives the revelation of the fall of the antichrist and of the arch-evil serpent. He sees moreover the punishment they will receive at the time of the end and their recompense, as well as the fall of those kings who at that time will oppose the servants of Christ. And see what it says: “I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse,” and the rider is faithful and true and just. He sees the Lord as he is about to join the battle and fight for the saints and make war against his adversaries. For this reason the vision depicts him in the form of a general, giving him a horse and a sword and the leadership of armies. “And, behold, a white horse” upon which the Lord was riding. By this the vision reveals that Christ depends upon no others than those who are pure and are not tainted by any stain of sin. For this reason, the Lord also said of that “chosen instrument,” namely, Paul, that he would “carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.” You see, therefore, that Christ depends upon and rides on such persons as Paul. “He who sat upon it,” that is, upon the horse, “is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.” He who is true is also faithful, as the apostle said concerning him: “He remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself,” and so he is the “Faithful” and “True.” And about him two assertions are made which address the same matter. The prophet was witness that he judges righteously and that he makes war on behalf of his servants against their visible enemies: “O God, give your judgment to the king, and your righteousness to the king’s son,” that is, to Christ—for the son of Solomon was Christ according to the flesh, to whom the psalmist was referring—and then it continues, “that he might judge your people with righteousness and your poor with judgment.” That he also makes war [the psalmist] shows when he speaks of him arming himself as a soldier: “Gird your sword upon your thigh, O mighty one, in your comeliness and in your beauty, and bend [your bow] and prosper and reign.” Then he adds, “Your weapons are sharpened, O mighty one, the nations shall fall under you.” 

He says, His eyes are a flame of fire: the fire of his eyes shows his fury against the enemy. 

And on his head, he says, are many diadems, altogether as many as the regiments in heaven and on earth over which he reigns. He has a name, he says, inscribed which no one but he himself knows. 

In the seventh section of Exodus God says to blessed Moses, “I, the Lord, appeared to Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, being their God, but I did not make known to them my name, ‘the Lord,’” as it is clearly greater than anything which can be comprehended by the hearing of a human being. This is why the Lord told his apostles how those who turn to the knowledge of God must be baptized, saying, “baptizing them into the name”; and when he said name he did not use the title “Lord.” For he was not able to utter their title, “Lord,” but instead of calling them “Lord” he gave relational and descriptive names, saying in relational terms, “into the name of the Father and of the Son,” and then adding the descriptive term “and of the Holy Spirit.” So with great accuracy in the Revelation, too, he lets the name “Lord” of the only Son be unknown to all and sundry. 

He says, Clad in a robe sprinkled with blood: for even in the vision the Lord was bearing the marks of his passion, and was showing his all-holy body all but covered with his precious blood. 

And his name is called the Word of God: do you see how after avoiding the name “Lord” above, the vision has now put a descriptive title instead of it, saying, The Word of God? 

And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine white linen, followed him on white horses: for he is the commander-in-chief of the heavenly powers, and thus the Lord has called himself, bearing the title of “Jesus son of Nun,” saying, “As the commander-in-chief of the power of the Lord have I now come.” 

The horses are white for the holy angels, too; for they delight in the pure among humankind, since they are naturally pure and unstained by any defilement. The clothing of pure white linen shows this. 

And from his mouth, that is, from the commander-in-chief, issues a sword: the divine prophet places the sword “upon the thigh” of the Lord in the passage cited a little earlier, while the vision describes it more accurately and places it in his mouth. In this way it is indicated that by the word of God all things have their being, and he who transgresses this in anything will not go unpunished. With which to smite the nations: which nations? Those who march with the Antichrist under his command against the slaves of Christ. 

He says, And he will shepherd them with a rod of iron: for the Lord, being goodness itself and mercy, wished to rule these nations, of whom the account speaks, with a shepherd’s rod of succor, “to bring them into green pastures and to nourish them beside the waters of comfort.” But since they have not wanted this, they will be shepherded with a rod of iron, that is, with one that is harsh and deadly. For those who are not changed by the Word can expect only punishment. 

And because the iron rod indicates harshness and punishment, the prophet, in his desire to hint at the rule of the Romans, of which Daniel said, “Arise, devour much flesh,” spoke in regard to God: “You will shepherd them with a rod of iron, and dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.” When the time was favorable, God ruled them with a shepherd’s rod, but in the last time he will do so with a rod of iron. 

And he himself is treading the wine-press of the wine of the fury of the wrath of God the sovereign Lord of all: the Lord said in the gospels about his own Father, “The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son”; therefore, the Revelation has been very correct in saying that he himself is treading the wine-press of the fury of the wrath of God, for by means of judgment and the requital of the wicked he fulfills his Father’s will, and so becomes the fulfiller of the just wrath of the Father. 

On his robe and on his thigh he has [a name] inscribed, King of kings and Lord of lords: the robe is an allegorical description of the flesh of the Lord, which has been given life by his mind, according to the holy angels speaking in Isaiah: “Why are your robes red, and your garments like those of one who has come from a fully trodden wine-press?” The thigh clearly indicates his physical birth; for it is written in Genesis, “All the souls who entered Egypt with Jacob, those who came from his thighs...” 

The symbolism of the writing on his robe and on his thigh shows “Emmanuel” to be king over all. Although the Word was hypostatically united to the flesh and underwent a physical birth from a virgin, he is no less King and Lord of all things in heaven and upon earth, since his dignity was not diminished by his incarnation; for as such he was God, and is God, and will always be so.
