And when he says that when the thousand years are ended, that is, when the Lord, having fulfilled the economy of his flesh, has returned to the heavens, the bonds of the spiritual powers will be loosed from the Devil, and again he will deceive the nations; for it has been said in what has been spoken before that the Lord's presence among men abolishes the activity of the Devil. But since the Lord has ascended into the heavens, it is the Devil who will exercise his ordinary and habitual powers, and those on earth will use their free will as they used to; for the Devil endeavors to deceive all. Some, however, are persuaded, while others, by resisting, contend against the evil one.

But one might perhaps say: and why, being somewhat restrained and hindered in his natural impulse by the bodily presence of the Lord, was the Devil nevertheless allowed once more to deceive those on earth? For would it not have been better that he be bound, and that men remain unled astray? To this it must be replied: why do you rather ask of him the origin, how the Devil came into being, than, having come and transgressed, why he was not utterly destroyed, so that no opportunity against men might remain to him? And how, then, sir, were the contestants trained if there was no opponent at all? And how, moreover, was the strength of the athletes shown if there was no rival? For the careless are inferior in men and in pleasures, and, with no Devil present to incite them, are altogether foolish on their own; but those who are men of God and brave contestants would be wronged if their courage against the passions were not made public; as happens, that the careless gain nothing when Satan is absent, and the zealous are most greatly wronged. For Satan is in a manner a trainer of men, providing an occasion of crowns to those who struggle. For the sinful, who even without the presence of the Devil, through their own negligence make use of him instead of the Devil, are not even wronged, as has been said. Therefore, he benefits some unwillingly, and does no wrong to others, or very little. But you wished through me and you, the "slaves of sin" (Rom. 6:16) and stripped and fallen, that we be deprived by the activity of the Devil of the glory of patriarchs and prophets, of apostles and evangelists and those who endured even to blood for the witness of Christ and kept what is genuine for him, moreover of confessors and those shepherds esteemed good for the churches and the most steadfast abstainers and all that is righteous and perfected in the faith of Christ, "of whom this world is not worthy." (Heb. 11:38) So that the brave champions of virtue console the punishment of sinners whose brief crimes are judged, for one who succeeds is to be preferred by the God, even when ten thousand reject Him.

Both therefore were brought about in the fairest and most inspired manner, and that in the Lord's presence the impious impulses of the Devil were cut off, and after the Lord's ascent into heaven he was loosed for the testing of men. For if Satan had been allowed to display all his power while the Lord was dwelling on earth, he would not have permitted men even to be hearers of His divine teaching or to learn who is by nature and in truth God, or what religion is acceptable to Him, or what wickedness and what virtue are; indeed he would have prepared the cross for Him beforehand and begun it even before the teaching. Were this to happen, the incarnation of the Lord and so great and so honorable a mystery would have been incomplete and, rather, useless. But after these things were taught on earth under the bondage of the Devil, men were left thereafter to use their own free will and to contend with the adversary by means of those confessed and unknown ways of wickedness and of virtue. For he who knows the good and the not-good, by self-willed impulses chooses one thing or the other at any cost; but he who is ignorant of what he should do, as one wounded in a night-battle and unaware even that he has been struck, does not even know his own ruin. For in the case of one who has knowledge of opposites there is room for self-choice to select what he wishes, but for the ignorant there is no room. God made man free from the beginning and governed him by sovereign planning.

That it is necessary first to know virtue and vice, so that the land may therefore be subject to free choice, see what Moses says to the disobedient people of Israel in Deuteronomy: "Behold, I have set before you this day life and death, the good and the evil," (Deut. 30:15) that you may surely choose the thing which is preferred; and again the same in Exodus: "If you will indeed listen to the voice of my words and do them, he says, all that I shall say to you." (Ex. 23:32) And what says Isaiah, of whom the same teaching is cited at the beginning of his prophecy, speaking from the presence of God: "If you will and will hear me, you shall eat the good of the land; but if you will not and will not hear me, the sword will devour you; for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things." (Isa. 1:19-20)
