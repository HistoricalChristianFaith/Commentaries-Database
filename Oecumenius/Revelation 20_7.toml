He links Gog to the rest of the nations who fought with the Antichrist. The blessed prophet Ezekiel also told us about Gog and Magog, describing the evil end of evil men. These will be some of the nations and their leaders at the end of the age, (Ez. 38-39) but they do not now exist, or they are some of the present nations called by other names in holy Scripture. So these will be allies of detested Satan in his fight against the slaves of Christ.

When the Lord completed the economy according to the flesh and ascended into heaven, the devil was to be released from his spiritual chains again to deceive the nations. It was said in an earlier book that the Lord’s manner of life among men destroyed the work of the devil. But when the Lord had ascended into heaven, the devil once more effected that which is proper and customary to him, and the people upon the earth were again subject to his authority, as was their custom. For the devil attempts to lead all astray. Some are persuaded by him, while others are not persuaded and struggle against the evil one. However, perhaps someone might say, “Why is it that when he was restrained and his own assaults were repulsed by the coming of the Lord in the flesh, he was let loose again against us, to lead those on earth astray? Were it not better had he been bound and humankind left free of [further] deception?” To such a person it must be said, Why do you not rather inquire after the existence of the devil at the very beginning? Or, why do you not inquire why he was not utterly destroyed when he first existed and had become a transgressor, so that he would have no access to mankind?But, O friend, how would athletes continue to receive vigorous exercise were there no one to wrestle against? And how would athletes demonstrate their strength were there no opponent? For those persons who are lazy and subject to pleasures are inherently perverse, whether or not the devil is present and prodding them on. But the people of God who are noble athletes would be wrongly treated were their courage against the passions not put on public display. So, as it happens, the lazy would receive no benefit and the zealous would be very greatly wronged, were there no Satan. In a way, Satan serves as an athletic trainer for humankind, providing for those who contend an opportunity for victories. For as we said, those enamored with sin are in no way harmed, since, even were the devil not present, they would use their own sluggishness in place of him. And so, although unwilling, the devil does good to those [strong athletes], while he harms these not at all, or very little. But for my sake and yours, lest we be further injured by the work of the devil in any manner small or great, you [O friend] were willing that the lovers of sin be left unconstrained [by any discipline] and in a state of defeat and that the patriarchs and the prophets be despoiled of the glory [of their victories], along with the apostles, the Evangelists and those who had remained steadfast even to the point of blood for the witness of Christ and had preserved their nobility for him. Furthermore, you would have the confessors and those pastors who govern the churches well to be deprived of their glory, together with the ascetics, who endure very great hardships, and every righteous person who is perfected by their faith in Christ. “Of none of these is this world worthy.” As a result, those noble and virtuous combatants mitigate to some extent the penalty of sinners who are altogether responsible for their hurts. For one who is upright is honored more by God than are thousands of those who do evil.
Therefore, both of these actions were exceptionally good and inspired, that at the coming of the Lord the impious attacks of the devil were stopped and that after his ascension into heaven the devil was loosed to tempt humankind. For had Satan been allowed to display all of his spiritual power while the Lord sojourned upon the earth, he would not have allowed anyone to become a hearer of the divine teaching. Nor would anyone have learned who is the true God by nature and what is the pure worship of him and what is vice and what is virtue. Rather, [Satan] would have prepared the cross for Christ prematurely, even before the Lord had begun to teach. And had this happened, such a great and admirable mystery as the Lord’s incarnation would have been ineffective and without any benefit.
