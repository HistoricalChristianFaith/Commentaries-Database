Therefore, I will not neglect to remind you always of these things, even though you know and are established in the present truth.
"even though you know." So that they are not seen to be continually admonished about the same things, as if rebuked for living in idleness, and thus become saddened, for this reason Peter adds: even though you know and are established in the present truth. Moreover, giving a reason for the continuous admonition, he added that he knew a release from this body would soon come.
