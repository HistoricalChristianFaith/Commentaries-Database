And the voice that I heard from heaven, I heard it again, he says, speaking to me. What was it saying? “Take the little scroll from the angel.” 

I took it, he says, and ate it, and it was sweet in my mouth, but after eating it was bitter in my stomach. Since the blessed evangelist both saw and heard the punishments imposed on the wicked, in order that it might be instilled by deed and not only by report that the sins of humankind were hated by God, being bitter and abominable, the teaching of the vision is this—for as he was a holy and chaste man he did not know this from experience—that in this way he might know that the wrath of God against the wicked was just. For the little scroll contained both the names and the transgressions of those who had sinned very grievously, as was said earlier. 

Therefore, he was commanded to eat it, that as though by tasting and a kind of spiritual experience he might share through the vision in the bitterness of sins. And when he ate it he found that they were sweet in his mouth, but bitter in his stomach after eating; for that is just like every sin. It is sweet while it is being performed, but bitter when accomplished. It thus provides grounds for punishment, and even in repentance it makes bitter those who have performed it. This was also just like the tree forbidden by God in paradise which all expound allegorically as sin, since it introduced the knowledge of good and evil, of good in the taste, but of evil after the experience. 

He says, And he said to me, “You must again prophesy over many peoples and nations and kings,” just as if he were saying, “Since in a vision you have seen the consummation of the present age and God’s wrath against the wicked, do not now think that the day of consummation is actually present; there is a long time meanwhile for you to prophesy to many nations and kings.” So up till now blessed John has been prophesying by means of his gospel, his general epistles, and the present Revelation. For all that he has said and prophesied has been in the Spirit.
