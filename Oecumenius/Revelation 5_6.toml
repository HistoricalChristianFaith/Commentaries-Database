He has called the Lord a “lamb,” because of his innocence in providing what we need. For just as every year the lamb provides by giving of its wool, so also the Lord “opens his hand and satisfies the desire of every living thing.” And so, prophecy speaks of him in this way, through Isaiah: “As a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearer is dumb”;13 and also through Jeremiah: “I was like an innocent lamb led to the slaughter, and I did not know.” But the lamb [in the vision] had not been slain, but it was “as though it had been slain.” For Christ returned to life, having trampled death and having despoiled hades of all the souls held by it. And so the death of Christ was not a death of inviolate surety; it was as a death cut short by the resurrection. And even after the resurrection the Lord had carried about the trophies of death—the imprint of the nails, his life-giving body made red by his blood, as Isaiah says in front of the holy angels: “Why is your robe red and your garments like his who treads in a full wine press?”—for this reason he was seen in the vision “as though slain.” The seven horns witness to his great power, since the number seven, being perfect, indicates a great amount, as we noted above. And certainly the horns are symbolic of power, as the prophet says, “And all the horns of the sinners I will cut off, and the horn of the righteous will be exalted,” and as Habakkuk says, “His horns are in his hands.” And to be sure, Isaiah has interpreted for us the “seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth,” saying, “And there will rest upon him the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and piety. The spirit of the fear of God will delight him.”
