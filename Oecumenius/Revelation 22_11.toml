quote='''
He says, let the unjust continue to do injustice still, and the filthy be filthy still. He does not command or order that they be unjust or be filthy, but says this: a little more time is still allowed to men; therefore let each one act as he pleases, and use his own free will as he wishes, whether for evil or for good. Therefore he further enjoins the righteous to continue to do righteousness, and the holy be holy still.
