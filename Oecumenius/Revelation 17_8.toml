“The beast that you saw,” it says, “was, and is not, and is to ascend from the bottomless pit.” For the devil “was” before the foundation of the visible world, having been created by God for good works, even as were also the other holy angels. But he “is not” in respect to the events surrounding the consummation of the age which are shown to the Evangelist, in which he will go “into the fire prepared for him and his angels.” For it is certainly so that he is among them and not among them. Accordingly, since by his activity the antichrist will be manifested around the days of the end, it says that “he will ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition.” For through the antichrist the devil will experience an ascent and a kind of increase, since the antichrist will deceive humankind and persuade them to worship, as the many predictions above have indicated. Or you might interpret the phrase “he was and is not” in this way. Writing to the Philippians, the apostle says, “to all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi,” calling the saints those “who are” because they are in Christ and in the possession and memory of God. If, therefore, the saints are those “who are,” the wicked devil “is not” now, although he “was” before he acted arrogantly against God and fell from his rank. It is similar also with the ungodly. Although they appear to exist so far as their substance and essence are concerned, yet they do not exist in regard to the judgment and memory of God. And since this is the case, the book of Genesis gives no genealogy of those who descended from Cain, because they “were not” because of their ungodliness. Rather, it speaks of “perdition” to which he is destined to go, namely, to the just punishment of Gehenna against him. For in Matthew the Lord says that those condemned in it are destroyed: “Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.”

And, it says, “the dwellers on earth will marvel.” Not all dwellers, but those whose names are not in the Book of Life. And why will they marvel? Because the beast was and is not and will come and be destroyed. For those who trusted in him will be amazed at the great change that has come upon him. For desiring to be ruler of the world and manifesting himself in this way, he will not only be stripped of his power but he will also receive a fate corresponding to his depravity.
