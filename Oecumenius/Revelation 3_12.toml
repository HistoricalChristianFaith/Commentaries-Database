Through these names he depicts the joy of God and the blessedness of dwelling in the midst of blessings, which they will have in the coming age. The “new name” has never been heard anywhere, which the saints, who reign with Christ and who are called “friends” and “brothers” and “servants” will obtain. But the new name transcends even these designations. For these names are written in holy Scripture and have been heard by people. But the new name has been unnamed in every place. And that he says “of my God” suggests that he does not deem himself unworthy of the limitations of his condescension or of the humility of his human nature. For if he had disdained these things, who would have compelled him to be personally united to the flesh and so to fashion our salvation?
