And he who overcomes, he says, that he will make them to sit with him always in the sight of God; for this is to become the pillar of the divine temple. For the pillar could never go out for any good reason from the place in which it is fixed.

I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, and My new name. Through all this, the enjoyment of God and dwelling in goodness and blessedness are fully revealed, whatever they will possess in the age to come. And he says that the name is new, one that has perhaps not yet been heard, which the saints reigning with Christ receive, being called friends (Jn. 15:15), brothers (Heb. 2:11), and servants (1 Cor. 4:1). And indeed, he also receives a new name beyond these things. For some have been recorded in the divine Scripture and have come to the hearing of men; but the new name is nowhere named.

And it is not unworthy for him to be called My God, nor are the measures of emptiness or the humility of human nature to be despised. For if he were unworthy, who compelled him to be united with flesh in hypostasis, and thus to weave our salvation? To Him be glory forever and ever.
