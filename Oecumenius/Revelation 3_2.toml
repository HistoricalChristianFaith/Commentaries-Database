quote='''
But he says, Awaken from the sleep of sin and strengthen the things which remain, that are ready to die. Moreover, he says, short tasks and incomplete practices remain for you, having not fully died. Therefore, guard these things while alive, flowing already toward death. For to strengthen means to stabilize and support what is slack and prone to collapse. For none of your efforts is complete, but some have died, and others are about to die. Therefore, how you have received the faith and heard the word concerning it, and some of your works still live in your life. But repent concerning those that have died.
