In which also he went and preached to the spirits who were in prison, who had formerly been disobedient, when the patience of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water. Equivalent to this figure, baptism now saves us, not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the appeal of a good conscience to God, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ, who is at the right hand of God, having gone into heaven, with angels and authorities and powers made subject to Him.
"In which also." Here, ἐν ᾧ is taken causally for "therefore." For when Peter had said that he died for us, the unjust, and from this had shown that he endured death for the salvation of all men, he now says that for this reason also he preached to those who were held in Hades. "O ἄντίτυπον, etc." (The context of the Greek words here is obscure, and therefore rendered in Latin with more words; yet by rendering the Greek expressions literally, it would be arranged thus:) that baptism, corresponding to the figures, now also saves you, which is now not the removal of the filth of the flesh, but the ἐπερώτημα of a good conscience, which is toward God, or according to God. Furthermore, ἐπερώτημα, that is, to the angels, evidently to the united man.
