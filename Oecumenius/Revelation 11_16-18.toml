When the voice was heard, “the elders worshiped God,” bringing their own thanksgiving and saying, “We give you thanks, O God, the Almighty, who is and who was.” The phrases who is and who was are fitting to be used of the holy Trinity, although usually who is is used of the Father and who was of the Son. For “to be” is true of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and we speak rightly when we say “was” of the Father and Son and Holy Spirit. Therefore, the thanksgiving of the elders is ascribed to the holy Trinity. For it says, “You have taken your great power” from those on the earth, and you have taken your rule which you gave to them, and you now alone rule. And since the earthly kingdom is destroyed, naturally “the nations raged,” for they had been deprived of their dominion—by nations he speaks of the ranks of the demons and of unfaithful people. “But your wrath has come,” it says, “and the lot of the nations to be judged and to give reward to your servants the prophets and the saints.” Although, it says, you exercised great long-suffering toward them in the past, they made no use of your kindness, and now, that is, in the day of judgment, you have brought your wrath against them, and that fate that has been determined for the nations has come and is present. And what is this? This, that they are judged and that recompense is given to the saints who had suffered evil from them, and that they who had corrupted the earth by polluting it with their sins be destroyed by the recompense of punishment.
