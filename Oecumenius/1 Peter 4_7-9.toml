The end of all things is at hand. Therefore, be sober and watchful in prayer. Above all, keep fervent in your love for one another, because love covers a multitude of sins. Be hospitable to one another without complaint.
The end, that is, completion, consummation or the end of all the prophets is said to be imminent: however, the true word is Christ, for He is the perfection of all. And not as the Greeks rave, who indeed say that pleasure is the end, like Epicurus, while others say wisdom or contemplation or virtue. Therefore, since perfection has come in Christ, Peter also says, having been made conformable to this perfection, present yourselves in all things without defect in sobriety, in vigilance for prayers (for the prayer of the sober or the watchful, and not of those who are held by the drunkenness of worldly things), in love for one another. Paul, however, says that this is the change of the law (Rom. 13:10): here indeed that it may cover sins. For mercy towards one's neighbor makes God merciful to us. This mercy would never proceed to what is righteous, unless it is out of great love. But where he mentions love, he also adds that those who are endowed with love, namely hospitality, which he commands to be shown without complaint; for this is the essence of true love.
"love covers a multitude." This means persevering and enduring and stretched out over a long period.
