For it is said, "that our Lord arose from Judah." The word "arose" is related to the fleshly birth of our Savior God. A crafted expression referring to the fleshly birth of our Savior, the word "arose," taken from the prophecy of Balaam, "A star shall rise out of Jacob," (Num. 24:17) saying; and also from Malachi (4:2), calling him the sun of righteousness. Through these, it is shown that the coming of the Lord was for the enlightenment of the world.
"of which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood." For Moses was chosen from the tribe of Levi.
