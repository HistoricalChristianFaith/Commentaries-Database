Because all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of the grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls away: but the word of the Lord endures forever. Now this is the word which by the gospel was preached to you.
Because all flesh is grass. When Peter said, "not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible, through the word of God which lives and abides forever," he also adds, by casting down and despising the easy corruption of human glory, and so to speak, its non-subsistence, enticing the listeners to cling to those things which are proposed by themselves, as those which have subsistence and endlessness. However, the subsistence of those things that come to corruption is here called grass and the flower of grass. Moreover, the weakness of the subsistence of grass is brought to a greater faith of the word: with which David compares our life. (Ps. 41:1) Wherever, therefore, it shows our glory to be so worthless, it again repeats and teaches more openly what it is that has regenerated them through the word of God which lives and abides forever, and it says:
"But this is the word that has been announced to you." That which remains forever is confirmed in the same way with the Lord. For He Himself said: "Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away." (Matt. 24:35) Moreover, it must be known that this should be expressed: "Love one another fervently should be expressed in a manner free from all deceit." For such outcomes tend to follow those which are treated and carried out for their sake. Therefore, since mutual love from the world leads to fervent love that is unaware of deceit, it is rightly done that "From the world" precedes, and "To love fervently" follows. It should be noted that the preposition εἰς, that is, "unto", is translated into διά, that is, "for the sake of", so that the sense is: for the sake of "Love one another fervently."
