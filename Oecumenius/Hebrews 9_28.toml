"so Christ." Since he was a man as well as being God, he himself, he says, endured the common lot of humanity. For just as men die once, so Christ, having been offered once, offered himself. For he is not only a high priest but also a victim.

"to bear the sins." Just as in the holy liturgy we bring up the sins and say: Whether unwillingly or willingly we have sinned, forgive us; that is, we first remember them, and then we ask for forgiveness; so He Himself said to the Father: For them I sanctify Myself (Jn. 17:19). Or, He bore the sins of men to the Father, so that He might forgive and erase them.
And why did He say, "of many," and not "of all"? Because not all have believed. For the sins of those who believe are taken away. For He died to save all, yet He forgives the sins only of the faithful. That is, "to bear the sins of many," He says, so that He might also extinguish them, taking the punishment on their behalf.
"willappear a second time, not to deal with sin." Wherever he returns, he does not come to die again for your sins, nor that he will no longer free you from sins, as it now takes away; nor that he will not punish the guilty and those subject to sins, because he was crucified for us.

Or that He says He bore the sins of many on the cross, so that He might also blot them out, giving the penalty on their behalf. Now, having made Himself sin, the Father sent Him; for Christ was indeed very sinful, having taken upon Himself and assumed the sins of the whole world. But He gave the penalty due to sinners through the cross, which belonged to them, and henceforth He will come with the glory of the Father, no longer as a sinner, no longer reckoned among the lawless. For if Christ is sinful, listen: for He who knew no sin, it is said, made sin to be sin, as if sin itself. (2 Cor. 5:21)
