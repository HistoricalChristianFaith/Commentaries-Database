He who has an ear, that is, one who is obedient, and who obeys divine laws, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The Spirit says, either that the things of the Revelation were being accomplished in the Spirit, or that the Spirit refers to Christ, as He is and is understood to be God, just as a servant and the Son of Man speaks as he is and is understood to be a man. For the Godhead has been said to be spirit in general, as the Lord Himself says to the Samaritan woman He was speaking with: "God is spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth." (Jn. 4:24) What then does the Spirit say?

This is a figurative expression; for the tree of life refers to the blessed and everlasting life, which the saints will enjoy in the kingdom of God, which is now called Paradise. For indeed, those here are said to be worthy as victors over the enemy and as avengers in these trials. But indeed, for the Lord to say, of my God, let no one be caused to stumble; for it is necessary, according to the economy of the flesh, that all humble words be observed. For indeed He also said in the Gospel: "I am going to my Father, and your Father, and my God, and your God." (Jn. 20:17) These things were conveyed to the church of Ephesus.
