“He who has an ear,” that is, who is obedient by obeying the divine precepts, “let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.” He says “the Spirit,” either because the visions of the Revelation are effected by the Spirit, or he calls Christ “spirit,” in that he is and is known to be God. Just as he does not fail to be called “Son of man” in that he is and is known to be man. For the Godhead is said to be all together “spirit,” as the Lord himself says in speaking to the Samaritan woman: “God is a spirit, and it is necessary that those who worship him, worship in spirit and in truth.”
