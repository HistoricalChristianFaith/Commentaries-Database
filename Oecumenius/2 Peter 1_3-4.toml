As all things are given to you by His divine power, which pertains to life and godliness, through the knowledge of Him who called us by His glory and virtue, by which precious and great promises have been granted to you, so that through these you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust.
Indeed, a long series has been presented, and this is the understanding: Just as countless good things have been received through the appearance of Christ, by which we may become partakers of the divine nature and be led back to life and godliness: so we must conduct ourselves, so that we may support virtue through faith, and by this means progress towards the promotion of godliness, until we reach the perfection of diligence, which is love. Moreover, we have become partakers of the divine nature through the coming of the Lord and God, who took the first fruits of our nature upon Himself and sanctified it by assuming it. If the first fruits are holy, the mass is also holy. Furthermore, the mass of the first fruits is nothing other than those from which the first fruits come. However, Peter speaks of the corruption that comes from worldly lust, as if it were concerning the corruptible and those things that are corruptible.
