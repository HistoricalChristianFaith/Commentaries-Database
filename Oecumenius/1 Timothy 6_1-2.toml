Those who are under the yoke as slaves should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor; so that the name of God and the teaching may not be blasphemed. And those who have faithful masters should not despise them because they are brothers, but rather serve them all the more, because they are faithful and beloved, sharing in the benefit. Teach and encourage these things.

Paul discusses faithful slaves who have unbelieving masters, saying, so that even these things may be.

so that the name of God may not be blasphemed. For if, Paul says, because the masters are unbelieving, the faithful slaves disobey and act arrogantly, giving their own household members a reason, they provide the masters with grounds to blaspheme Christ and the preaching, as if it were the cause of the slaves' arrogance.

should not despise them because they are brothers. Do not let the fact that you are a brother be the cause of your despising, Paul says, but considering that the masters are faithful and beloved of God, serve more, mixing fear and love. For as much as you do good to the masters who are your brothers, so much more become grateful in serving more. Or because you are benefited by the masters, through being nourished and clothed.

but rather serve them all the more; that is, the slaves. For by hyperbaton it is placed. However, it should be placed in the middle, because they are faithful and beloved, and the word masters should be understood. Simply, as it is written, one must understand sharing in the benefit, that is, the masters who take care to benefit the slaves.

Teach and encourage these things. Therefore, the teacher requires not authority, but gentleness.

According to those who are greedy for gain, and false teachers.
