He says, I saw another angel having great authority: he means that this is the source of the heavenly light that illuminates the earth with its splendor. 

“Fallen is Babylon,” it says. He openly announces the sentence of condemnation that God has rendered against it. He has decreed, it says, that it should suffer these things. “It has become a dwelling place of demons.” For as those who hate humankind and are desirous of blood, these wicked demons search out places in which the blood of people killed in warfare or in some other manner has been shed, and as though rejoicing at what has happened, they make their abode in such places. Therefore, since most will be killed in the city, as we have said, it finally becomes the “dwelling place of demons and a haunt of every foul spirit,” since the place safeguards the hedonistic lifestyle of the demons in it. “And a haunt of every foul bird and every unclean beast,” it says. For such animals flee the abode of people and take possession of abandoned places, keeping them free from those who intend them harm and hunt wild animals. The prophet Isaiah also said something like this concerning Babylon: “And sirens will rest there, and demons will dance there, and satyrs will dwell there, and hedgehogs will make their nests in their houses.”

“For all the nations have drunk from the wrath of her fornication.” By fornication he means their insatiable greed and their love of money, for such is the manner of harlots. For those in the city of which we speak have clung close to all nations, since they have placed them in subjection and commanded that they pay tribute. “And the kings,” it says, namely, those who have become partners with it and companions in its love of money. “And the merchants” who have traded in it “have grown rich from her wantonness.” That is, they have become rich from its arrogance and from its unconstrained, prodigal and slothful way of life, since they put out for sale in it every kind of merchandise.
