For if some must enter, and those who entered have not entered into the rest of the promised land, it again defines a third rest, so that, as he says, some may enter into it. For if God did not have a third rest, He would not have said: "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts," so that there may be a rest into which those should enter who do not harden their hearts. Since obedience would be completely useless if there were neither rest nor reward. You have seen how he confirms it? "Do not harden your hearts so that you may enter into the rest," he says. For by saying that those who hardened their hearts did not enter into the rest, he implies that those who do not harden their hearts will enter. For every command of God has also a future reckoning.
"For if Joshua had given them rest." For if that were the only rest, namely the promised land into which they entered under the leadership of Joshua, he would not have spoken of another day of rest through David. But therefore, he mentions it, saying: Today, and he gave a command, saying: Do not harden your hearts: as if there exists a third rest into which it is necessary for those who are obedient to enter.

“Therefore, a Sabbath-keepingremains.” Sabbath-keeping or rest. For sabbaths are interpreted as rest. Therefore, a certain third rest remains, which is the kingdom of heaven. However, he called it Sabbath-keeping, from the primary rest which was of the Sabbath-keeping.

"for the people of God." He says to the faithful. And how is this evident? From the fact that David commands, saying: Do not harden your hearts. For he would not command this if there were no sabbath and rest. (What benefit would there be for those who obeyed?) Nor would it be commanded to us, not to do the same as the Jews who were in the desert, lest we too be deprived of rest in the same way.
"who has entered."Since they were weary from evils, there was no mention made of the countless goods that were to come, he comforts them by saying that he who has entered into the third rest, which is the rest of the kingdom of heaven, rests from his works, that is, from persecutions, temptations, afflictions, just as indeed God rested from the works He had done in the first rest.

In another way. “rested from his works, as God did from his own.” As if, he rested. Since he has demonstrated that there is a third rest, and that some will enter into it, he comes to the conclusion and says: "From what has been said, it is certainly evident that there is another rest besides the aforementioned, and this is not for everyone, but dedicated to the people of God." Truly, the people of God are those who have believed in Him and keep His commandments.

"And he himself rested." As if he had rested.
