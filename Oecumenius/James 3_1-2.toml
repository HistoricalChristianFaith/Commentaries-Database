Do not become many teachers, my brothers, knowing that we shall receive a greater judgment: for in many things we all stumble.
When James had said and taught the faithful in the above matters that they should possess faith that is not empty of good works, he turned to another commandment similar to this. For indeed, some attempt to teach things which they themselves do not practice: and it is said that their judgment will be harsher, since they have brought no profit. For whoever teaches what is not beneficial, as if possessing it, is condemned just as if he has slipped with his own tongue. Moreover, confirming this abundantly, he says, Although in another way the tongue is prone to slip due to negligence, in the case of those whose judgment will not escape, who has acquired this, as Solomon has it, saying: “Because of the sin of the lips, the sinner falls into a snare”; (Prov. 12:13) much more, however, will he who knowingly and deliberately sins, teaching with his tongue what he has not learned through experience, be unable to escape the inevitable punishment.
The unrefined and chaotic tongue destroys the one who has acquired it: it is necessary to overcome it for the praise and glory of God; in which he also discusses good conduct and without strife of one against another, out of a desire for glory, because of human wisdom; and about divine wisdom: and that quarrels, seditions, and enmities against God arise from laziness and the love of pleasure; and about repentance for salvation, and about not judging one's neighbor.
