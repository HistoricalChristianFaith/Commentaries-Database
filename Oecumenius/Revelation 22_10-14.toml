He says, Do not seal up these words, that is, do not keep them to yourself, nor shut them up and guard them in the treasury of your mind, but reveal them to everyone. 

He says, For the time is near: he means something like this: the time when these words will have to be heard is not very far off, as it once was, but it is not yet here now; nor is the time suitable for earnest prayer to be made as a result of them, for what is the use of making prayers for those who go on striving to act wickedly or virtuously? It is inopportune to teach by words those who are learning by deeds. But why does he say it is near? It is not delaying for long, nor is it already here. 

He says, Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy. He is not commanding or prescribing the doing of evil or being filthy, but he means this: a short time is still available to people; so let all go on doing what they have been accustomed to do, and let them use their own free will as they wish, either for evil or for good. So he goes on to say, Let the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy. 

See, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done: I am coming, says the Lord, in his second coming, bringing with him what he must render to each, whether it is good or evil. 

He says, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and last, the beginning and the end: there has been sufficient comment on this earlier on: so let us pass over it now. 

He says, Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have their right to the tree of life: he calls their bodies robes. Therefore, blessed are those who live well and keep themselves pure from all filth of sin. For they who have lived in this way will have the right to attain to the tree of life and to rest upon it: the Lord is the tree of life, as was said earlier. 

And that they may enter the city by the gates: and by means of the gates, that is, by the apostolic teachings and lessons, they will become partakers of the life and bliss of the saints.
