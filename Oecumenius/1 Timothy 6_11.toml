But you, O man of God, flee these things; pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience, gentleness.

But you, O man of God. Great is the dignity. For all men are servants of God, especially the righteous, not only according to the reason of creation, but also according to that of adoption.

flee these things. Both with emphasis; for Paul did not say, "Avoid this one, but approach that one," but rather, "Flee and pursue."

pursue righteousness. To have no more than is sufficient for life.

godliness. In doctrines.

faith. Without controversies.

love. The offspring of faith, towards God and men. The order of the statement is good. For from faith, love is born; and from love, patience. And patience, as it walks, makes gentleness.
