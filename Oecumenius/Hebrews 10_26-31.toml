"For if we sin willfully." As the involuntary has a lighter punishment.

"if we sin." Note that he did not say 'having sinned,' but used the present tense to indicate the persistence in sin until the end. For from this, it is especially clear that he does not deny repentance.

"after we have received the knowledge." That is, the faith concerning Christ.
"there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins." In order to erase sins. For among the Jews there were victims that were offered for their remission, so that they were not for involuntary sins.
"remains a sacrifice." It does not abolish repentance, may it not be; but it prohibits the existence of a second baptism. For here, it calls the cross and baptism a sacrifice, just as it says elsewhere. "For by one offering He has perfected for all time those who are sanctified." (Heb. 10:14)
"and fiery anger." Just as that fiery, being pierced by some anger, consumes and devours those who are struck. He speaks of opposers, not only of the unbelievers, but also of those who act directly against the commandments of Christ.
"Anyone who has rejected Moses' law." A comparison is made from the lesser. For he wishes to show the destruction by fire justly inflicted against the adversaries. However, he speaks of the law to Moses (Lev. 4:26), because he commanded many things that are contained in the law.
"on the testimony of two or three witnesses."If two or three had testified, there was no longer a place for mercy or pardon, but he would die. Therefore, if someone who has transgressed the law of man, that is, of Moses, dies without pardon after a strong testimony, he says, what should happen to those who have trampled the law of Christ?
“who has trampled the Son of God."How does one trample on the Son of God? When he does not listen to Him, when he who shares in Him commits sins: for that is to trample, namely to despise.
"in the blood of the covenant." He refers to the blood of Christ: for through it we have received the new covenant.
"and having shared." Having shared, as having nothing more excellent than the others, just as those who say that he is a naked man. For they say that he is nothing but blood, in which he differs from ours as far as honor is concerned. Then, showing their ingratitude, he says: by which he was sanctified.
"and insulted the Spirit of grace? " For he who has not received the benefit of the gift insulted the one who gave it. He made you a son of God, but you prefer to become a servant. He came to dwell in you, yet you introduce the Devil within yourself. Are these not injuries and insults against the Spirit?
"For we know Him who said." And that these things are true, God himself testifies who says: "Vengeance is mine." This is with me, to take vengeance: "I will repay, says the Lord." But by saying this, he comforts them about the evils they have suffered from their own fellow citizens. As if he were saying: He said this gently, and he comforts them regarding the evils they suffered from their own fellow citizens, as if he were saying: "Why are you anxious? You have the one who avenges and gives back justice to those who serve you."
