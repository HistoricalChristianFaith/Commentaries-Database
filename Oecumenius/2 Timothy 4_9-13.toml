I urged you to come to me quickly. For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present age, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia; Titus to Dalmatia. Only Luke is with me. Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me for ministry. I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. Bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, and the books, especially the parchments.

For what reason does Paul call Timothy to himself to whom the Church of Ephesus had been entrusted? Since Paul being in prison, he was not able to leave. Therefore, he wishes Timothy to come to him, both because he is alone, and because he had given him certain instructions.

come to me quickly. Paul did not say: Meanwhile, while I am still alive: for he did not want to sadden Timothy.

having loved this present age. Having become safe and secure, as he thought. For Demas preferred to indulge in luxury at home rather than suffer hardships with me. But Paul does not want to slander this man, rather to support us so that we do not become weak.

Crescens to Galatia. They had left of their own accord, therefore he does not say, “The rest.” Moreover, Titus was among the distinguished to whom the bishopric of Crete had been entrusted.

Only Luke is with me. This Luke is the one who wrote the Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. And since he was eager to learn, holy and committed, he was never separated from Paul.

Take Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful to me. Paul said, "Not for my comfort, but for the ministry of the Gospel." Indeed, Paul also called Timothy for this reason, so that after his death the brothers might be comforted.

for ministry. Of the Gospel, Paul says.

I have sent Tychicus. See the unity through all things.

Bring the cloak that I left. Here Paul mentions a certain garment. However, he seeks to ensure that he is not a burden to anyone in need. For this is of the greatest concern to him everywhere.

— [CHRYSOSTOM] In another way. Here the type of clothing is mentioned. Some indeed want it to signify a case in which little books were kept. But what necessity was there for the little books themselves, for one who was soon to depart to God? Certainly, then it was especially necessary to entrust them to the faithful, and for them to have those as their own teaching. Indeed, he was seeking a case so that he would not need to receive it from others. [end of the excerpt by Chrysostom] —

— [THEODORET] especially the parchments. The term "parchments," more commonly known in Roman usage as “scrolls" [εἶλητα], was used moderately according to the custom in Rome, from which Paul was indeed writing the Epistle.  For the ancient Scriptures were contained in scrolls, just as the Jews still mostly possess them up to the present day. [end of the excerpt by Theodoret] —

He referred to books [βιβλία] in a general sense, so that Paul might also have books in another form or format.

especially the parchments. Perhaps, however, these contained certain more useful things within themselves. Nevertheless, those worthy of laughter are those who think that the Apostle here meant a cloak rather than a type of booklet, who did not pay attention to the sequence of letters. For it would have been needless to say: "And books," even if that had been a type of booklet, since it could have been indicated together with others.
