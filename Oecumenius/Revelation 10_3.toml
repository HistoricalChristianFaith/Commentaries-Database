That the holy angel roars like a lion is symbolic of his wrath against the impious. “And when he called out,” it says, “the seven thunders sounded their voices.” He calls the seven ministering spirits “seven thunders.” They were mentioned earlier. Here he mentions them by way of the definite article, “the seven thunders,” referring to those seven spirits who bear the offering. What does it mean that the seven spirits cry out? It means that these also concur fully with the punishments against the sinners and bring forth a hymn of thanksgiving to God, that all that he has done is just. And they cried out together revealing the forms of the punishments.
