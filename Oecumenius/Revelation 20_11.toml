By the words white throne he speaks of a throne that is bright and radiant. By the figure of the flight of the heaven and the earth, the passage indicates their change and transformation. For if “the heavens will pass away with a loud noise,” as the holy Peter says, and as the prophet who says, “In the beginning, O Lord, you did lay the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands; they shall perish, but you remain, and they all shall grow old as a garment, and as a vesture you shall fold them, and they shall be changed,” then certainly the Revelation speaks of their passing away and their destruction, which signify their change, as a “flight,” since no place was found for them. For where would one find that corruption that had been cast off? Therefore, in the present passage he speaks of their change, while a little further on he says that they shall become new.
