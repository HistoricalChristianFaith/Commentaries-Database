And I saw a great white throne and the one who sat on it, and from before his presence the earth and the heaven fled away, and no place was found for them.

He calls the white throne, bright and flashing. The passage alludes to the passing of the heavens and the alternation and transformation of the earth. "For the heavens will pass away with a great noise," (2 Peter 3:10) according to the divine Peter and according to the prophet who says: "At the beginning you founded the earth, O Lord, and the heavens are the work of your hands.

They themselves will perish, but you remain; and all will wear out like a garment, and you will roll them up like a cloak, and they will be changed," (Ps. 101:26-27) fittingly their passing and destruction. Which the Revelation called flight, signifying their change, so that they might not find a place; for where would the ruin they have rejected be found? Now he has spoken of their change, and going on a little, he says that there will be new ones as well. (see Rev. 21:1,5)
