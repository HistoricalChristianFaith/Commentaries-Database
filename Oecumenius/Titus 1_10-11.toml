For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers, especially those from the circumcision. They must be silenced, who overturn whole households, teaching things they ought not for dishonest gain.

Paul said the root of all things, from which the rest also grow. For the disobedient person does not want to yield themselves, but desires to rule and oversee others. Then it is necessary that he who rules with ecclesiastical authority also teaches, but he who teaches before he has learned, because he does not obey others, is rightly found to be a babbler and a deceiver of minds.

especially those from the circumcision. For even Christ reproached them for seeking power: who, even after receiving faith, did not abandon this disease.

They must be silenced. For if a bishop has the care and leadership entrusted to him of others, and does not know how to silence the mouths of babblers and seducers, and to convict them, he becomes the cause of loss for those who perish. And rightly it is said: must be silenced: that is, by the force of rebukes, they should not even be allowed to speak, so that from this there may also be found listeners.

teaching things they ought not for dishonest gain. There is nothing that this passion does not urge to transgress.
