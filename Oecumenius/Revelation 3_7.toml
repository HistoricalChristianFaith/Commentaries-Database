The Holy One is the Son of God. And the seraphim bear witness to this when they ascribe the threefold holiness to the one lordship, as though he possesses nothing earthly nor sinful, and even though the Word became flesh, “He did not sin, nor was any guile found in his mouth,” as the prophet Isaiah says. He is said to be “true,” for he is, and he truly is what he is said to be. He is said to be God, and the title is not false, for he is truly God, Immanuel, even though the accursed Nestorius does not agree to this. He became man, not because he ceased to be God, but he is truly man, even though Eutyches, hated by God, is displeased with this claim. What he is, he is truly, and there is nothing concerning him which is by way of mere ascription, as the Nestorians say, nor is there anything which is mere appearance and fantasy, as the Eutychians would have it, and also that accursed and despicable race of Manichaeans.

Since the key signifies the authority, when he says, “he who has the key of David,” it is clear that just as David ruled the physical Israel, so in addition to the physical Israel, I also rule the spiritual Israel. However, to be sure, the distinction of authority differs by an incomparable superiority. For, what equality does humankind have with God? And this good news the holy angel, Gabriel, spoke to the Virgin concerning the Lord: “And the Lord God will give to him the throne of David, his father, and he will rule over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Therefore, since Christ possessed a likeness to the reign of David, it is appropriate that he speak of “him who has the key of David.”
