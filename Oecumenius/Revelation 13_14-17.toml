“And by signs he deceives those who dwell on earth.” He does signs, beguiling the eyes of those who look on, even as the magicians did in front of Pharaoh, for both they and this one are led by one and the same deceitful demon. And it rightly says that he does signs in the presence of the beast. For since he will set up an image for him, which he will compel all to worship, he will actually perform signs before it, and as though regarding the image as divine, claim that from it he has the power to do these things. “And it was allowed to give breath to the image.” They say that many statues both perspire and seem to speak by the activity of the devil.
