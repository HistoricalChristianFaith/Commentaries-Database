"Consider him.” For if one who reflects on the afflictions of the brethren finds comfort in his own afflictions, how much more will he who weighs the afflictions of the Lord.
"from sinners," for it is greater that even sinners have endured these things. However, he calls contradictions mockery, scourges, ridicules, and whatever opposed his teachings and doctrines: similarly, the shouts with which they cried out under Pilate.
"so that you will not grow weary and lose heart." For if you weigh these things in your mind, you will be hardened against afflictions, knowing that you have become imitators of God.
"you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood." In the above, he testified to them that they had struggled greatly, where he says: You have endured a great race of afflictions: therefore, lest they be exalted by this, he now says: You have not yet contended perfectly; you need something else: which is also a kind of exhortation. For he says: You have come to persecutions, to the plundering of your possessions, but not to death: yet Jesus Christ went even to death.
"In your struggle against sin." It shows that sin passionately breathes and they themselves struggle in opposition. For it says, "resisted," as if in battle, as if also resisting sin.
"and you have forgotten that word of encouragement."Therefore, he said, he is so saddened and disappointed in spirit that he has even forgotten the words that contribute to courage. This, however, signifies that they are very slow in their actions: for those who are like this forget even the things that are in their hands.
"addresses you as sons." For Solomon was not speaking to his own children, but was bringing forth common teaching: therefore he says “as.”
"when he rebukes you." It is the greatest encouragement and comfort to know that afflictions come to us by God's promise for our benefit, since afflictions lead us to divine wisdom [φιλοσοφεῖν]: and if they come by God's permission, they seem to be sent and imposed by Him.
"because the Lord disciplines those he loves." Indeed, no one can show anyone to be righteous without affliction: for "narrow and hard is the way that leads to life." (Matt. 7:14) Therefore, as far as correction is concerned, God calls you, not to punishment. Therefore, in the very fact that they thought they were forsaken by God, namely because of afflictions, He persuades them that they are cared for by God; rather, in the opposite way: You would be forsaken, He says, if you acted without afflictions.
"he accepts as his son." He who takes to himself, who accepts as his son. "Just as the Son offers himself to you, God." (Matt. 20:28) Therefore, since it is a sign of sons to be corrected, endure, he says, affliction. But the righteous are the sons of God.
"If you are not disciplined."Where he had sought from the things themselves, namely with all the saints brought forth who had fought through afflictions, now he strives to persuade even from human reasoning.
"then you are not legitimate, not true sons and daughters at all." If, therefore, the sign of illegitimate children is not to be punished, but legitimate children are punished, it is necessary, he says, to rejoice in punishment.
"and we respected them for it." We heard, he says, and we respected them.
"Father of spirits." Whether of spiritual gifts or of souls or spiritual virtues.
"and live." For this is life, to be subject to God.
