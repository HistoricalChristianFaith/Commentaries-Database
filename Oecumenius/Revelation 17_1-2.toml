Having completed its discourse about the consummation of the present age and what will happen at that time, the vision now reveals to the Evangelist what will befall Rome. He said to me, it says, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the harlot who is seated upon many waters.” By judgment he means that way of life and conduct in which, he has judged, she lived and which she pursued. He calls [Rome] a “harlot” because she had fornicated, that is, apostatized from God. For this is called “fornication” by the divine Scriptures, as in the saying by the prophet to the God of all things: “You have destroyed every one who fornicates from you.” By many waters he refers to the nations that [Rome] rules and governs, as he says later on. “With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,” it says. These are those who ruled among them [the nations]. For these kings of the earth are those who participated in her fornication and the madness of her idolatry. “Those who dwell on the earth have become drunk with the wine of her fornication,” it says. For indeed also the rest [of humankind], over whom she was ruling, apostatized from God along with her. She was sometimes compelling the rest and sometimes leading the way.
