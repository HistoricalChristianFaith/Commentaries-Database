"For I suppose that for this reason he was separated for a while, so that you might have him back forever, no longer as a slave, but more than a slave, a beloved brother, especially to me, how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would me. And if he has wronged you or owes you anything, charge that to me. I, Paul, write this with my own hand—I will repay it—to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well. Yes, brother. May I enjoy refreshment in the Lord; refresh my heart in the Lord."

Since Onesimus has changed his mind from being a wicked one, he himself turns it to the doubtful, as if he said: For perhaps he fled for reasons of caution.

"for this reason he was separated". With a euphemistic name, Paul called it separation, so that the memory of the separation would not provoke the master. Then he also limits the time, calming the anger, or he speaks in terms of a season of the year.

"so that you might have him back forever", you have, that is, you receive.

"But more than a slave". Do you see that escaping brought many benefits? For instead of an hour of escape, you have an eternal one. (For the escape is but one hour compared to eternity.) And instead of a worthless slave, you have received "a beloved brother".

"how much more to you". If to me, much more to you, even in worldly services. For this is "in the flesh." And in spiritual matters. For this is "in the Lord."

"So if you consider me a partner". That is, if you think and wish the same things as I do.

"welcome him as you would me". Wow, how great is the magnitude of those words!

"And if he has wronged you". Paul did not say, "He stole," but the verb is cut short. He says he "wronged" "or owes".

"charge that to me". For it was likely that they themselves had consumed together the things that had been stolen, and Paul says, "charge this to me," that is, charge these things as a debt to me, let the obligation be held against me.

"I, Paul, write". He wrote with spiritual grace, as if he said, But for safe keeping, that I will repay the debt, I have made the letters with my own hand.

"to avoid saying to you that you owe me your own self as well". So that Paul may not seem to insult him by not daring to appeal to him openly on behalf of the runaway slave (for this would show Philemon to be somewhat harsh), it shows that Paul is also very confident in Philemon. For he says not only your own things, but also yourself you owe to me.

"Yes, brother". Again, from what is pleasing it advances to what is serious. "Yes," he said, "brother." What? Accept it yourself. I will take advantage from you in things that are according to Christ.

"May I enjoy". That is, I delight in your excellent works in the Lord. May I see you growing rich in all spiritual blessings.

"refresh my heart". Paul says, Refresh my love for you for the sake of Christ.
