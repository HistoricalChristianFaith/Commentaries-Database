The loosing of the sixth seal effects the completion of our salvation. It dissolves death and brings back life. It dethrones humanity’s conqueror and is openly triumphant in accordance with that which is written: “The Only Begotten ascended on high and led captivity captive and received gifts among men.” And what is this loosing of the sixth seal? It is the cross and death of the Lord. The resurrection and the ascension follow after these, and for these every spiritual and physical creature has prayed, for they “renew for us a new and living way,” that is, the way back from death to life through the curtain of his flesh. And he accomplished this good work, not only for the living but also for those who have gone before. For the Lord “went and preached to the disobedient in hades,” as the divine apostle Peter says, and he also saved those there who believe, as Cyril thought.

The vision clearly depicts for us the signs that occurred at the time of the crucifixion: the earthquake and the turmoil of the earth, the darkness of the sun and the transformation of the full moon into blood. And with complete accuracy did he add the word full to the moon. For the moon was fully visible, not merely partially visible on the day of the crucifixion and so greeted the passion in its fullness.… And, indeed, the prophet Joel foretold that these things were to happen, “The sun shall turn to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and manifest day of the Lord comes.” The stars falling from heaven was perhaps a physical occurrence, but if not, the passage indicates that all lights from heaven ceased and everything became darkened.
