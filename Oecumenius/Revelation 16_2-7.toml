These words could be understood in two ways, either literally of the events that will occur at the time of the end, or allegorically. For when the Lord talked about the signs of the end, he warned his disciples of many of the evils that would then occur. He said, “You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. And nation will rise up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and plagues and earthquakes in various places: all this is the beginning of the sufferings,” and after a few verses, “Then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.” It is with reference to these that the present sayings might be interpreted as having taken place, when each of the seven bowls was being poured out. 

The sores that resulted from the first bowl would then symbolize the tribulations and sufferings which were slowly consuming the souls of human beings at that time on account of rumors of wars, while the blood in the sea would stand for those killed in naval battles, and the blood of the rivers and of the waters probably connotes the murders in battles of those encamped beside the waters. 

He says, And I heard the angel of the waters speaking. God is all-powerful both in showing care for his creation and in supplying what all need for their welfare, so that he does not need anyone to help him in this. For one whose will alone assures the completion of the work, and by whose decree everything has been brought into being—how could such a one stand in need of a fellow-worker and assistant in order to do good? 

But since he is good, he wishes that the holy angels, too, should be shown kindness by giving aid to those in need. For those who help another in need are not benefiting the recipient so much as themselves. None of the angelic powers was in need and required aid from anybody else. So God ordered that those on earth who were in need of any good thing would be supplied by the holy angels. That is why we earlier recognized the angels as the protectors of the churches. So Daniel in his great wisdom wrote of Michael, the ruler of the angels, as taking care of the tribe of the Jews. 

The Revelation now explains for us the angel appointed over the waters. For the earthly creation was constructed from the four elements of air, fire, earth, and water. (Some wanted to hold that the heavens were made by a fifth primal body, which they say was ethereal and circular.) Three of the elements, fire, earth, and air, have been generously mixed together for the needs of breathing and other common uses. But even if they say that the ether is wholly the element of fire, yet its abundance and self-sufficiency on earth lurk hidden in its hollows and stones. There are even some who produce fire out of water contained in vessels of glass when they face the rising sun. The earth is the common mother, tomb, and sure home for all. It is only in the case of fresh water, in springs, fountains, wells, and even rivers, that there is not a plentiful supply for everyone, and in the case of the water which comes from above, which is contained in the clouds on high and by divine command gives us rain in due season and nourishes every living thing on the earth. 

Therefore, since there is not an abundant supply of water for everyone, one of the holy angels is put in charge of it, in order that he may provide those in want with an unfailing sufficiency for their need. When as often it fails or is withheld because of our evil deeds, it results in droughts and famines and the plagues that follow them. 

It is of this angel appointed by God’s providence over the waters, that he says, I heard him say, “You are just, you who are and who were, the Holy One.” “You who are” signifies that God has no end; “you who were” signifies that God has no beginning; “the Holy One” is he who is altogether just in all things. 

When he says, because of your judgments, he means that those who poured out the blood of the saints should drink blood. For those in war who are encamped by the side of the waters and rivers cannot but drink the water that has been befouled by blood from the bodies of the dying. 

In harmony with the angel those around the heavenly altar render their thanksgiving to God. The words, I heard the altar saying this, denote those ministering at the altar. 

May it be that we, being set free from all possible afflictions, may render a hymn of thanksgiving to Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
