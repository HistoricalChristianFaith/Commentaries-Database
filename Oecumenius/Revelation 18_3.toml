For from of the fury of her fornication all the nations have been drunk. By "fornication" here he means their greed and love of money; for such is the manner of prostitutes. For those in the aforesaid city have indeed grown wealthy by all the nations, and after conquering them they ordained that they should pay tribute. And the kings say that the inhabitants of it have become partners and sharers of its love of money, and the merchants who trade there, it is said, grew rich from its wealth, that is, from its arrogance and unbridled, lavish and degenerate way of life, loading and disposing all kinds of cargo there.
