He says, and he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven. It is said that the blasphemies against God are of the apostate. By the tabernacle of God he means the holy angels because God dwells in them. For if it has been said concerning men, "I will dwell in them and walk among them," (2 Cor 6:16; see Lev. 26:11) what would one say about the heavenly powers, that God has them as a dwelling?
