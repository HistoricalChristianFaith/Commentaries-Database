Therefore I want the men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without anger or disputing.

How then did Christ forbid praying openly? "For He says, 'Go into your room.'" (Matt. 6:6) Christ did not forbid praying in every place, but He said this to turn away from praying for show; just as in "Let not your left hand know what your right hand is doing," (Matt. 6:3) He does not speak about hands, but about doing good deeds without empty glory and not for display. It is not the place that makes the difference, but everywhere He cared that we do not show off. Furthermore, the Apostle also makes this clear: Just as it was not permitted for the Jews to offer sacrifices outside the temple, so it is also with us to pray. For He says that every place is suitable for us, only if we lift up holy hands, that is, hands cleansed from impure grasping, greed, and murder, purified through almsgiving.

without anger. Without bitterness, without cursing anyone. For true anger is not even wishing harm to befall one's brother.

or disputing. So will God hear me? Or do I pray simply and in vain? For one must be convinced that God will listen, if we ask Him for things dear to Him while being pure.
