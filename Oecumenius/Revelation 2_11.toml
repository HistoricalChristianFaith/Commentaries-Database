He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be harmed by the second death. What has been said is very precise; for in the first death, which is the separation of the soul from the body, all alike, both the righteous and the sinners, become prisoners, so that the divine decree may reach its end: "you are dust, and to dust you shall return." (Gen. 3:19) But in the second death, which the Lord calls sin, saying, "Let the dead bury their own dead," (Matt. 8:22) the victors over temptations would not be wronged.
