“He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.” This is a very apt statement. For, while all, the just and the sinner alike, are subject to the first death, which is the separation of the soul from the body, so that the divine judgment might be enforced: “You are earth and to earth you will return,” those who have overcome temptations should not be harmed by the second death, which is the result of sin, and which the Lord specified when he said, “Let the dead bury their own dead.”
