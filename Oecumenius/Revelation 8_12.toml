We have been taught by Joel the prophet that "the sun" will turn "into darkness, and the moon into blood before the coming of the day of the Lord, the great and glorious day." (Joel 2:31) This will happen when all these things take place. And Peter said in the second of his epistles: "The day of the Lord will come like a thief, during which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved by fire." (2 Peter 3:10) But the Lord himself, according to Matthew (24:29), says that "immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven."

These things are now also taught through Revelation to occur at the end of the present age. But what does it mean that not all things on the earth, and in the sea and rivers, and also the elements in the heavens mentioned, will endure suffering, but only a third of them? This too is a precise demonstration of God's love for humanity, calling to repentance those people then living who are affected partially, not all the elements; and for those who do not turn back, it brings about total destruction thereafter. Such a thing the prophet also says: "he made a path by his anger, not sparing their souls from death." (Ps. 78:50) For the partial and gradual manifestation of God's wrath, as if proceeding along a road, is a door opened by repentance, calling people through the fear of what is happening to change their minds. But if this does not advance among them, he does not spare their souls from death.
