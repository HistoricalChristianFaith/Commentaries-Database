We have been taught by Joel the prophet that “the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the great and glorious day of the Lord comes.” … And in his second letter, Peter said, “The day of the Lord will come as a thief, on which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be dissolved with fire.” And the Lord himself also says in Matthew, “Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven.” And now we are taught in this Revelation that these things will occur at the consummation of the present age. And why is it said that only a third of what is on the earth and in the sea and rivers and also [a third] of the heavenly bodies endure these calamities? This is certainly a proof of the goodness of God toward humankind that he calls to repentance the people [who live at] that time by the partial dissolution of the elements, rather than effecting their total destruction. Upon those who do not repent he finally brings a complete destruction. And the prophet says something similar, “He made a path for his anger; he did not spare them from death.” For, since the wrath of God is partial and advances and progresses as though on a road, God is opening a door for repentance and is calling people to a change of heart through fear of that which is coming to pass.
