Since the Jews were greatly concerned about the temple, see how it is diminished in comparison to heaven. "a mere copy of the true one." For the temple was handmade and was constructed as a type of heaven.

"but he entered into heaven itself." The phrase, "he entered into heaven," should be understood from a common perspective, as if to say, Nor does he frequently offer himself, for he has entered into heaven. For indeed, frequently to offer sacrifices through blood belongs to those who enter into the copies of the true one, but not to him who has entered into heaven itself.

"now to appear." With the flesh, he says, it appears.
"in the presence of God." What do you say? Unless he had entered into heaven, he would not appear in the sight of the Father, who is present everywhere and fills all things? Do you see that these are humble matters of privilege?
"on our behalf." When the victim of his own body ascended to appear before the Father for us, this is to reconcile us to himself. Indeed, having made mention of the flesh, blessed Paul speaks boldly of all things humble.
"Nor was he to offer himself repeatedly," he says, this is what it means to ascend to heaven. For the offering of many sacrifices in blood is for those who enter into the copies of the true things, but not for the one who has entered into heaven itself.
"as the high priest." Do you see the difference? This one does it annually, but Christ once.
"with blood not his own." This one in the blood of others, of bulls and goats, but Christ in his own.
"For then he would have had to suffer repeatedly." For if it were necessary for him to offer a sacrifice more often, he would have had to suffer frequently since the foundation of the world was laid, as he would have to offer his own blood.
"he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages." Here something also is revealed concerning the mystery, why at the end of the ages, after many sins. For if death had come from the beginning itself, when sin was not yet so widespread, then no one would have believed, (there would have been no need to die a second time,) all would have been in vain. But now, since later the sins were many, it is fitting that at the end of the ages, that is, at the very fulfillment of the ages, and at the very end, it has been revealed; that is, with the flesh in the world; it has been revealed for the annulment of sin, that is, to annul and wipe out the sin of the world through His sacrifice, which He offered for us, that is, through the death of His flesh. Such a thing He also said elsewhere: “Where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.” (Rom. 5:20)
"to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.” That is, together with the flesh in the world.
“And just as it is appointed for men.”Now he also speaks of the cause, through which Christ died once for all; for, he says, he became the ransom for one death. For it is appointed to men once to die. Therefore, this once, Christ died for us. What then? Do we not die now? Yes, but we are not held by death, as before, which in its power is not even to die.

"so Christ." Since he was a man as well as being God, he himself, he says, endured the common lot of humanity. For just as men die once, so Christ, having been offered once, offered himself. For he is not only a high priest but also a victim.

"to bear the sins." Just as in the holy liturgy we bring up the sins and say: Whether unwillingly or willingly we have sinned, forgive us; that is, we first remember them, and then we ask for forgiveness; so He Himself said to the Father: For them I sanctify Myself (Jn. 17:19). Or, He bore the sins of men to the Father, so that He might forgive and erase them.
And why did He say, "of many," and not "of all"? Because not all have believed. For the sins of those who believe are taken away. For He died to save all, yet He forgives the sins only of the faithful. That is, "to bear the sins of many," He says, so that He might also extinguish them, taking the punishment on their behalf.
"willappear a second time, not to deal with sin." Wherever he returns, he does not come to die again for your sins, nor that he will no longer free you from sins, as it now takes away; nor that he will not punish the guilty and those subject to sins, because he was crucified for us.

Or that He says He bore the sins of many on the cross, so that He might also blot them out, giving the penalty on their behalf. Now, having made Himself sin, the Father sent Him; for Christ was indeed very sinful, having taken upon Himself and assumed the sins of the whole world. But He gave the penalty due to sinners through the cross, which belonged to them, and henceforth He will come with the glory of the Father, no longer as a sinner, no longer reckoned among the lawless. For if Christ is sinful, listen: for He who knew no sin, it is said, made sin to be sin, as if sin itself. (2 Cor. 5:21)
