We do not advise you to leave the one who entrusted you with the care of the holy churches of God, but only to look after your own soul in the fear of God. Do not accept gifts from anyone, do not waver in judgment, do not be ashamed before a powerful person, do not declare innocent the guilty or condemn the innocent. Keep away from avarice, which is the root of all evils; in fact, it is called, and it is, a second kind of idolatry. And do not pride yourself, so that you may be a disciple of the apostle who says, "Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly."
Do not try to please people, for you know what happens to people who do this. They become estranged from the service of Christ. In fact, the apostle says, "For if I were still pleasing people, I would not be the servant of Christ." And submit to the Lord, who says, "Learn from me, for I am meek and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls." Extinguish anger and chase it far from you, for it is the ruin of a person; do everything according to God and you will find him as your helper. Always fear death, for it is necessary that it comes to us all. Remember the hour of your departure, and do not sin against God. And if you arrive at the point of calmness, you will find rest and grace wherever you decide to withdraw. - "Book of Letters 789"
