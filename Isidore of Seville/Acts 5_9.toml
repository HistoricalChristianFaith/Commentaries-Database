The punishment by death from the wisest Peter against those who erred is not out of madness but out of teaching of prescient, letting go the many transgressions of mankind. For at that time they began sowing the seeds of the gospel, and knowing that darnels appeared besides naturally, they wisely plucked them out forthwith; it was taken care of by the future fire so as to burn lest they be gathered with the wheat.
