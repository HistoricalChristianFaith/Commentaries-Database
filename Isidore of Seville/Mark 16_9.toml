The sacredness of the Lordâ€™s Day is apparent from the holy Scripture. This was the first day of the world. On this day the elements of the creation were formed. On this day the angels were created. On this day Christ rose from the dead. On this day the Holy Ghost came down from heaven on the apostles. On this same day the manna in the wilderness was first given.
