In consoling his people through the prophet, God accordingly promises to judge their enemies.… For the wickedness of the evil ones who customarily tear at the chosen of God with their own teeth. When this happens, the life of the unrighteous is undone while that of the righteous is not, but rather it flourishes. Meanwhile, however, the evil ones are educating the righteous through the training of tribulation so that they will hate this present life and long for the life to come.
