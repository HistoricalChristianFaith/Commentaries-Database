Gabriel is translated from Hebrew into our tongue as “might of God.” Wherever God’s power or might is shown, Gabriel is sent. Therefore, also at that time, when the Lord was about to be born and triumph over the world, Gabriel came to Mary and announced him who had humbly agreed to come to defeat the powers of the air.
