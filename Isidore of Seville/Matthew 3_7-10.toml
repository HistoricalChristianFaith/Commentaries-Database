(Orig. viii. 4.) The Pharisees and Sadducees opposed to one another; Pharisee in the Hebrew signifies 'divided;' because choosing the justification of traditions and observances they were 'divided' or 'separated' from the people by this righteousness. Sadducee in the Hebrew means 'just;' for these laid claim to be what they were not, denied the resurrection of the body, and taught that the soul perished with the body; they only received the Pentateuch, and rejected the Prophets.
