Here Paul shows that the reason we no longer sin is not that after baptism we are no longer made of flesh. Up to this point, we claim Christ’s perfection by faith only and not by experience. For we have not yet become impassible or immortal…. Therefore Paul does not say: “Do not sin,” but rather: “Let not sin reign in your mortal bodies.” .
