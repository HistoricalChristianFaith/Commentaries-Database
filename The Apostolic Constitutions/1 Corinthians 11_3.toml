Let the wife be obedient to her own proper husband, because "the husband is the head of the wife."
For, had it been necessary for women to teach, He Himself had first commanded these also to instruct the people with us. For "if the head of the wife be the man".
Therefore we do not advise you to it; for it is dangerous, or rather wicked and impious. For if the "man be the head of the woman"
