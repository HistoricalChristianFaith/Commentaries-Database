You shall not speak evil; for he says, “Love not to speak evil, lest you be taken away.” You shall not be mindful of injuries, for “the ways of those that remember injuries are unto death.”? You shall not be doubleminded or doubletongued, for “a man’s own lips are a strong snare to him,” and “a talkative person shall not be prospered upon the earth.” Your words shall not be vain, for “you shall give an account of every idle word.” You shall not tell lies, for he says, “You shall destroy all those that speak lies.” You shall not be covetous or rapacious, for he says, “Woe to him that is covetous toward his neighbor with an evil covetousness.”
