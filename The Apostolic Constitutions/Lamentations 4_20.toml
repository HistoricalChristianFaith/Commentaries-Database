For even now, on the tenth day of the month Gorpiaeus, when they assemble together, they read the Lamentations of Jeremiah, in which it is said, “The Spirit before our face, Christ the Lord, was taken in their destructions,” and they read Baruch, in whom it is written, “This is our God; no other shall be esteemed with him. He found out every way of knowledge and showed it to Jacob his son and Israel his beloved. Afterwards he was seen on earth and conversed with people.” And when they read them, they lament and bewail—as they themselves suppose—that desolation that happened through Nebuchadnezzar. However, as the truth shows, they unwillingly make a prelude to that lamentation that will overtake them. But after ten days from the ascension, which from the first Lord’s day is the fiftieth day, you are to keep a great festival, for on that day, at the third hour, the Lord Jesus sent on us the gift of the Holy Spirit, and we were filled with his energy, and we “spoke with new tongues, as that Spirit did suggest to us”; and we preached both to Jews and Gentiles that he is the Christ of God, who is “determined by him to be the judge of living and dead.” …
Concerning him Jeremiah also did prophesy, saying, “The Spirit before his face, Christ the Lord, was taken in their snares, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the Gentiles.” Ezekiel also, and the following prophets, affirm everywhere that he is the Christ, the Lord, the King, the Judge, the Lawgiver, the Angel of the Father, the only-begotten God. He is the one therefore who we also preach to you and declare to be God the Word, who ministered to his God and Father for the creation of the universe. By believing in him, you shall live, but by disbelieving you shall be punished. For “he that is disobedient to the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him.”
Therefore, after you have kept the festival of Pentecost, keep one week more festival, and after that fast; for it is reasonable to rejoice for the gift of God and to fast after that relaxation.… Therefore fast, and ask your petitions of God. We enjoin you to fast every fourth day of the week and every day of the preparation, and whatever you have left over because of your fast bestow on the needy. Every sabbath day excepting one, and every Lord’s day, hold your solemn assemblies, and rejoice, for he will be guilty of sin who fasts on the Lord’s day, being the day of the resurrection, or during the time of Pentecost, or, in general, who is sad on a festival day to the Lord. For on them we ought to rejoice and not to mourn. - "Constitutions of the Holy Apostles 5.3.20"
