For even if women among them [the Montanists] are appointed to the office of bishop and presbyter by appealing to Eve, they hear the Lord saying: “Your resort shall be to your husband, and he shall rule over you.” And the apostolic word has also escaped their notice: “I do not permit a woman to teach in such a way as to exercise authority over men. She is to preserve the virtue of quietness.” And again, “For man is not from woman, but woman from man.”
