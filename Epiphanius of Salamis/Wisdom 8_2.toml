There is wisdom and there is wisdom. The apostle knew various kinds: that of which he spoke when he said, “The world does not know God with the wisdom of God.” And that which he spoke of saying, “God condemned as foolishness the wisdom of the world,” or when he said that he spoke “not with the power of the flesh but by the power of God.” Solomon, by contrast, spoke of that wisdom of whose charm he was enamored and that he made his bride (Job asked himself, “Where can she be found, in what place of wisdom?”17). But did he speak of that “despised wisdom of the poor person,” of the “wisdom guided by God” or of the “Wisdom of the Father, the only-begotten”?
