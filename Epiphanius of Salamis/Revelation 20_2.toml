Now, as is evident, the thousand-year period is written about in the Revelation of John, and most people, including Origen, believe in the book. But most people, including the reverent, when they read the book, since they are familiar with spiritual realities and take the things that have a spiritual meaning in it in a spiritual way, believe indeed that they are true, but that their explanation lies deep beneath the surface of the text. For this is not the only passage whose meaning lies deep; there are many others.
