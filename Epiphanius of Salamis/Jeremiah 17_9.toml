How can they declare the Savior a mere man, conceived of a man’s seed? How will he “not be known,” as Jeremiah says of him, “he is man, but who shall know him?” For the prophet, describing him, said, “Who shall know him?” But if he meant a mere man, surely his father would know him, and his mother, his relatives and neighbors, those who lived with him and his fellow townspeople. But that which came to birth is born of Mary, while the divine Word came from above. He was truly begotten not in time and without a beginning, not of a man’s seed but of the Father on high. But in the last days39 he consented to enter a virgin’s womb and fashion his flesh from her, patterned after himself. This is why Jeremiah says, “And he is man, but who shall know him?” He came from above as God, the only-begotten, divine Word.
