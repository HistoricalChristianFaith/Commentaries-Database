What need is there for the holy apostle to make use of the law, if the new covenant is foreign to the old legislation? He wants to show both covenants are from the one Lord. They are best perceived as sharing the same intent. The fulfillment of the law is through the love of oneâ€™s neighbor, because love is that which effects the perfect good. He therefore says that love is the fulfilling of the law.
