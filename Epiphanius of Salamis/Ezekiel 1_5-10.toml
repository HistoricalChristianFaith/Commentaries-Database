Four living creatures with four forms stand announcing the coming of Christ: the form of the man for one of them, because Jesus Christ was born at Bethlehem, as the Evangelist Matthew tells us; the form of the lion for another, as Mark proclaims him as having come from the Jordan, like the royal lion, as it is written, “Behold, like a lion coming up from the jungle of the Jordan”; the form of the bull for another, because Luke proclaims—and not only him, but all the Evangelists also—that at the appointed time, until the ninth hour, he was sacrificed on the cross as the ox for the world; the form of the eagle for the last, because John proclaims the Word that has come down from heaven and became flesh and has gone to heaven like an eagle, for a complete resurrection, full of the divine nature.
