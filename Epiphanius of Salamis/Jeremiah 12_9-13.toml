Dearly beloved, it is fitting that we should not abuse our rank as clergy, so as to make it an occasion of pride, but diligently keep and observe God’s commandments, to be in reality what in name we profess to be. For if the Holy Scriptures say, “Their lots shall not profit them,” what pride in our clerical position will be able to help us who sin not only in thought and feeling but also in speech?
