We are all descendants of Adam, according to an order of succession that has reached to us. Nor are the works of God to be understood allegorically: Adam did exist, the fig leaves existed, the fig tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree set in the middle of the garden, the serpent, the disobedience, the obedience. The rivers existed, as did Eve. And everything was truly made by God, because “to him all things are possible,” he who can make corruptible things incorruptible and earthly things perfect in incorruptibility. No one should wonder at this. Indeed, he gave us proof of this when he clothed his divinity with corruptible flesh, to offer us a model of incorruptibility in the flesh he assumed. “Who will oppose what he has done?” Let us now examine another exegetical aspect. The Scripture says that God cast them out of the garden, placing two cherubim with flaming swords to guard the entrance to the tree of life, so that Adam and Eve took up their dwelling opposite the garden, barred from Paradise. But this notwithstanding—let no one deceive you with empty words—“God, who can raise up his children from stones,” was able to change corruptible beings into incorruptible, and he can do so at any time that he wants to make of the earth a place of peace, a paradise. In fact, earth and heaven do not have a different God, but everything is his, and he lavishes the gift of incorruptibility on every being as he wishes.
