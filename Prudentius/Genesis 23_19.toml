This is the lodging place of the Lord, where an oak branch at Mamre
Covered the pastoral roof of the ancient seer; in this hospice
Sarah laughed at the joy of bearing a child in her old age
And at the faith her venerable husband could have in the marvel.
Abraham purchased a field wherein he might bury his wife’s bones,
Inasmuch as justice and faith on the earth dwell as strangers:
This is the cave for which he expended a great sum of money,
To prepare a fit resting place for his wife’s holy ashes.
