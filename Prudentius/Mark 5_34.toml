Members filled with leprous ulcers,
flesh corrupted and decayed,
“Go and wash them, I command you”;
what he ordered then is done;
Wounds are healed by pious cleansing,
swollen flesh grows smooth again.
Now on eyes, by lifelong darkness,
shrouded from the light of day
Thou dost spread a clay of healing, made
with nectar from thy lips;
Soon the blinded orbs are opened and
rejoice in late-found sight.
Thou dost chide the angry tempest
and the savage hurricane,
Which upheave the tossing billows
and beset the fragile boat;
At thy bidding winds are subject,
and the rolling waves are stilled.
Then a woman, weak and timid, touched
his sacred garment’s hem:
Instant was the blessed healing, and
the pallor left her cheek,
As the hemorrhage she had suffered
through so many years was stopped.
Lazarus for four days buried, hidden in
the sunless tomb,
He restores to life and vigor, giving
power to breathe again,
And the soul returning, enters flesh
now crumbling to decay.
