Five loaves and fishes two he orders placed
As food before the people thronging round
Their master, by their hunger undeterred,
Who mindful not of food forgot their towns,
Their forts, their markets, hamlets, trading-posts
And cities, glad to feed upon his words.
The festive gathering swarms upon the plain;
By hundreds they recline in friendly bands,
And round the countless boards they range themselves
To dine on two small fish and scanty crusts
He multipliesâ€”know now that he is God!
