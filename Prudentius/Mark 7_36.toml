[[commentary]]
quote='''
Deafened ears, of sound unconscious,
every passage blocked and closed,
At the word of Christ responding,
all the portals open wide,
Hear with joy friendly voices and
the softly whispered speech.
Every sickness now surrenders,
every listlessness departs,
Tongues long bound by chains of silence
are unloosed and speak aright,
While the joyful paralytic
bears his pallet through the streets.
