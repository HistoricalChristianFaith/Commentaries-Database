Behold, a legion hurls headlong the swine
Of Gerasenes, and once enchained in tombs,
It loudly grunts with pain. From lips possessed
It had cried out: “O Jesus, Son of God,
Offspring of David’s royal line, we know
Who you are and why you have come, what power
Expels us, at your coming filled with dread.”
Has not this voice, Judea, reached your ears?
True, but it has not pierced your darkened mind
And, driven back, has from the threshold fled.
Now sets the evening sun, where he who beholds
The rosy dawn beholds the Lord’s advent.
The fervent gospel word
Has thawed the Scythian frosts and Hyrcanian snows,
So that Rhodopeian Hebrus, freed from ice,
Flows from Caucasian cliffs, a gentler stream.
