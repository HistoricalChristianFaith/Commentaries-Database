Lo, the house of the wicked blasphemer,
Caiaphas, has fallen,
Where the sacred face of the Christ
was cruelly smitten.
This destruction will be the lot
of all reprobate sinners,
For their life will lie buried
in crumbling ruins forever.
In this house the Lord stood upright,
bound and tied to a pillar,
And submitted his back as a slave
bound and tied to a pillar,
Worthy of reverence, this pillar still
stands, supporting a temple,
And instructing us how to lead our lives.
free from all scourges

Do not the quarried stones of Solomon
Now lie in ruins, that temple built by hand?
Why so? The mortal hand of mason wrought
That short-lived work. It rightly lies in ruins,
Since every work of art returns to nought.
All that is made is doomed one day to fall.
Learn what our temple is, if you would know;
It is one that no artisan has built,
A structure not of riven fir or pine,
Nor reared with blocks of quarried marble fair.
Its massive weight no columns high support
Beneath the arches of a gilded vault.
By God’s Word it was formed, not by his voice,
But by the everlasting Word, the Word made flesh.
This temple is eternal, without end,
This you attacked with scourge and cross and gall.
This temple was destroyed by bitter pains.
Its form was fragile from the mother’s womb,
But when brief death the mother’s part dissolved,
The Father’s might restored it in three days.
