[[commentary]]
quote='''
The Savior once to Peter showed
What hidden power this bird may have,
And warned that ere the cock would crow
Himself three times must be denied.
For evil deeds are ever done
Before that herald of the dawn
Enlightens humankind and brings
An end to error and to sin.
Forthwith he wept his bitter fall
Whose lying lips denied the Christ,
The while his heart was innocent,
And steadfast faith his soul preserved.
And never more such word he spoke,
By slip of tongue or conscious fault,
For mindful of the crowing cock,
The just man ceased from ways of sin.
Hence all now hold in firm belief
That in the stillness of the night
When loudly crows the joyful cock
Our Lord came back from hellâ€™s dim shore.
