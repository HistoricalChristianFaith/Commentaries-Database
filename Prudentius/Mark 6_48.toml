Simon, surnamed Peter,
Chief disciple of Christ the Lord,
On a day at the set of sun
When the evening sky grows red,
Unloosed his anchorâ€™s hook,
And filled his sails with the swelling winds,
And made ready to cross the sea.
But night roused up a contrary gale
That stirred up the deeper waves
And buffeted the floundering boat.
Shouts of fishermen struck the sky,
With shrieks and despairing groans
Amid the creak of swaying ropes.
Nor did any have hope of escape
From shipwreck and a watery death,
When the oarsmen all wan with fear
Saw Christ himself not far away
Treading surely upon the surge,
Just as though on the barren shore
He walked over the solid ground.
