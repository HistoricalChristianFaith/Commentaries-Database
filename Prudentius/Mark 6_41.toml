Thou, our bread, our true refreshment,
    never failing sweetness art;
He can nevermore know hunger,
    who is at thy banquet fed,
Nourishing not our fleshly nature,
    but imparting lasting life. …
Every sickness now surrenders,
    every listlessness departs,
Tongues long bound by chains of silence
    are unloosed and speak aright,
While the joyful paralytic
    bears his pallet through the streets.
