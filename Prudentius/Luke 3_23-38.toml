What do you say about the sacred words of Luke
When he the genealogy repeats,
The fleshly line retracing through old sires?
Up generations seventy-two
Christ mounts—so many teachers into the world
He sent—and by the steps down to his birth
Goes back to Adam, head of earthly flesh.
The Father then receives his Son and us,
And Adam son of God becomes through Christ.
Nothing now remains but that you deem this race
Unreal, Levi, Judah, Simeon,
King David, other mighty kings, unreal,
The virgin’s swelling womb itself grown big
With lying vapor, flimsy clouds and mist.
That airy blood dissolves, the bones grow soft
And melt, the trembling muscles disappear.
That every deed the idle wind dispels,
The breezes scatter, all an empty tale.
