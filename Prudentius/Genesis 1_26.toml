[[commentary]]
quote='''
The inspired historian makes it very clear
That at earth’s dawn the Father not alone
Nor without Christ his new creation formed.
“God fashioned man,” he says, “and gave to him
The face of God.” What but to say that he
Was not alone, that God stood by God’s side
When the Lord made man in image of the Lord?
