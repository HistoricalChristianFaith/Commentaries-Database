The sky above, the earth and ocean’s mightydepths,
The orbs presiding over day and over night,
The winds and tempests, lightnings, showers of rain and clouds,
The polar stars, the star of evening, heat and snow,
The fountains, hoarfrosts, precious veins of ore and streams,
One in their might one both the Father and the Son,
And that one splendor generated by one light
With all the Godhead’s plenitude of brightness shone.
In God one undivided being operates,
And by one power was created all that is,
The rugged cliffs and level plains and mountain dells,
Wild beasts, the fowl of air and reptiles, all that swim,
The beasts of burden, cattle, oxen, mammoth brutes,
The flowers and shrubs, the vines, the herbs and woodland groves,
All plants that shed their fragrance, plants that food supply.
