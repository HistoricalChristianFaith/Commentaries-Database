Behold a stone is set for us, a stumbling block,
Against which vanity may strike,
A sign unto the faithful, scandal to the lax,
The one it fells, the other guides.
The blind one feels his way with slow uncertain step
And runs into what’er he meets.
The lamp of faith alone must shine before our feet,
That footsteps may unswerving be.
The foe assails and carries off the wanderers
Who in the darkness go astray,
A demon who devours the wheat speeds on the way
For pilgrims passing to and fro,
A thief who tampers with the fertile fields of Christ
By sowing in them barren oats.
A demon who devours the wheat spread on the way
For pilgrims passing to and fro,
A thief who tampers with the fertile fields of Christ
By sowing in them barren oats.
