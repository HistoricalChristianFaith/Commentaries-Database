Behold a stone is set for us, a stumbling block,
Against which vanity may strike,
A sign unto the faithful, scandal to the lax,
The one it fells, the other guides.
The blind one feels his way with slow uncertain step
And runs into whatâ€™er he meets.
The lamp of faith alone must shine before our feet,
That footsteps may unswerving be.
The foe assails and carries off the wanderers
Who in the darkness go astray,
A demon who devours the wheat speeds on the way
For pilgrims passing to and fro,
A thief who tampers with the fertile fields of Christ
By sowing in them barren oats.
A demon who devours the wheat spread on the way
For pilgrims passing to and fro,
A thief who tampers with the fertile fields of Christ
By sowing in them barren oats.
