After this war one work remains for us,
O leaders, that which Solomon achieved,
The peaceful scion and the unarmed heir
Of a warlike realm, whose father’s weary hand
Was sullied by the ardent blood of kings.
The blood effaced, a temple is upraised
And golden altar, house sublime of Christ.
Jerusalem then by its temple crowned,
Received its God, now that the wandering ark
On the marble altar found repose.
In our camp let a sacred temple rise,
that God may in its sanctuary dwell.
What profits it to have repelled the hosts
Of earthborn vices, if the Son of man
From heaven descending, enter the body cleansed,
But unadorned and not a temple fair?
Thus far we have engaged in fierce conflict:
Now let white-vestured Peace perform its tasks,
And youth unarmed build up a sacred house.
