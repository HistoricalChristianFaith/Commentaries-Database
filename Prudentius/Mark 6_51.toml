[[commentary]]
quote='''
O mighty is the power of God,
The power that all things did create,
That calmed the waters of the sea
When Christ upon its surface walked,
So that in treading on the waves,
He moved dry-shod across the deep,
Nor ever did he wet his soles
As light he skimmed the surging flood.
