He had to be redeemed: my Spirit came down
And impregnated flesh made from the dust
With the divine nature; God has assumed
Humanity, joining it with divinity,
And kindled in men’s hearts new love of me.

When God’s coming draws near, the angel Gabriel advances
From the Father’s high throne and enters the house of the Virgin.
“Mary,” he says, “the Holy Spirit will render you fruitful,
And you shall give birth to the Christ, O glorious Virgin.”
