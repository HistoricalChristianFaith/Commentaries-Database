“Do not look at me,” it says, “because the sun has not regarded me.” The prophet Ezekiel proved that the sun is Christ when he said, “upon you who fear the Lord, the sun of righteousness will rise,” who is Christ. For, as I have often said, before the advent of the Son of God, the church of the Gentiles was dark because it had not yet believed in him. But when it was illuminated by Christ the true sun, it was made extremely lovely and decorous, such that the Holy Spirit would say to it through David: “the king desired your beauty.”
