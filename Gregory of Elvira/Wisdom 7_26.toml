If, about what we all profess, you wanted to suggest some similitude in God, I am not sure if you could specify your comparison more clearly. For example, if you were to say “light from light” and had to explain it in detail, I would ask you how you conceive of this light from light. Perhaps like a lamp from a lamp, or a sun from the sun? Or would this example lead you to deduce that there are two lamps or two suns, as though there were two gods? Or would you understand the light from light as the effect of the light of the lamp itself or as the brilliance of the sun shining from the sun itself, comparing the figure of the Father with the source of the light and the Son with the brightness of its radiation? In fact, of this the prophet said, “In you is the source of life, and in your light we see light.” Or Solomon, when he says, “She is a reflection of the eternal light, a spotless mirror of the majesty of God and an image of his goodness.” The apostle also preached that our Savior is the image of the invisible God, because the image of the sun is its light, which proceeds from the sun itself.
