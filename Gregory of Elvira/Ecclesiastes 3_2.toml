“A time to live and a time to die”: you can see, therefore, beloved brothers, that this was said concerning the time of the Lord’s birth and death. Thus you must accept his virgin birth if we are to believe not only that the Word in the beginning who was called “is” was born, but, as I said, also that the humanity which he adopted and put on was born, both Lord and man. For it says, “what is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the spirit is spirit.” Yet, what suffered, died, was buried, and resurrected was not God but man, since he raised man to God, not God to man.
