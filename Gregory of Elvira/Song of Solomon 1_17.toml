Kedar, from the Hebrew, is translated by the Latin word for dark (accordingly, Kedar among the city of the Gentiles at that time seethed with idolatry), for nothing is more forbidding than serving demons. Thus the Lord scolded the people of Israel through the prophet Jeremiah for abandoning the Lord and for worshiping idols made by Gentiles.… And Christ spoke in a prophetic way from the voice of the church that was to be gathered from the Gentiles, saying, “I am dark like the tents of Kedar,” that is, like the gathering of Gentiles.
