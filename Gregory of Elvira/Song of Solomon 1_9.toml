“My horses are with Pharaoh’s chariots,” it says. The horses of the Lord, that is, the people of the Gentiles, were formerly with Pharaoh’s chariots, that is, in the power of the devil, since they had not yet believed in Christ. He forewarns them, therefore, not to submit themselves again to that yoke through contempt of the faith. For, as I have already said, the people of the Gentiles who required horses were held under the Pharaoh’s yoke, that is, with the chariots of the devil, before the Lord’s advent, even though the Lord already foreknew them to be his own. But there is no doubt that the Pharaoh is the devil, for the devil tyrannizes the world like the Pharaoh did Egypt. Moreover, just as the Pharaoh persecuted the sons of Israel, so does the devil persecute the saints in this world.… Yet, now liberated by the grace of Christ from the yoke of tyrannical servitude, having been made sons of God through faith, and destined for celestial glory with a pure heart and true devotion in all holiness and righteousness, let us hold firmly to the same faith through which we live and are saved.
