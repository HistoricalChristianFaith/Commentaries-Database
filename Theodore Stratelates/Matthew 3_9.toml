If from “stones children are given to Abraham,” this is not by their possessing his flesh and spirit but by their sharing his virtue. Therefore the people of God are able to call Abraham “father.” How so? Consider the following: Stones are employed by the Gentiles not only for building but also for idolatry. Besides this, remember this: the heart of the dragon is said to be as hard as a stone.
