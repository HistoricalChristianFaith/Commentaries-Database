We need to observe how the Lord, out of his benevolence, foretells all things before they happen. When he threatens doom, this is so that his servants, afraid of what might happen, will turn and repent and manage to deflect the terrible trials. Again, blessings are promised, and these promises strengthen the souls of those who act justly, providing them with hope before God. But there is never any necessity on God to carry out these things. For when people repent there is no need for anger, or, when they do not persevere in doing good, he will not [necessarily] bring to an end the promised blessings either, we ourselves being the ones who provide the reasons for God to execute the promised harm.And these events can be discovered if one looks, for instance, at when Cyrus and then Darius rebuilt Jerusalem. Also, no less a person than Alexander was impressed by the sacred vestment and turned anger into worship.
