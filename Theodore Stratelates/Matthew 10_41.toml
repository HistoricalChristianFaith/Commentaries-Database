The one who receives people sent by anyone gladly honors the one who sent them, and vice versa. Or alternately: the one who receives the apostles who preach the Trinity receives “the fullness of deity” itself. And I think it likely that even in our days we receive them in spirit, if we receive their counsels with an open mind.
