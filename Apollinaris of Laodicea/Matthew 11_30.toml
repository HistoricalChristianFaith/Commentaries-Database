If the yoke is easy and the burden light, why did he call “the way” “narrow”? It is narrow to the careless, for to the zealous the Lord’s tasks are light. For even if they involve bodily suffering for a little while, yet the one who is now nourished with good hopes is the devout one who easily bears these pains.
