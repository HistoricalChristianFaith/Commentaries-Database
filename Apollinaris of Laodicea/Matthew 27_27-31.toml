It was not as though those men had the power [to do these deeds]. Rather, it seemed good to God that these events occur for the redemption of humanity. The “Lord of glory” was treated shamefully for us because of the dishonor due to us. He is now glorified while the day of the righteous is always mocked by the ignorant. Since the cloak was tinged with the color of blood, those murdering him dressed him with it, though they did not realize the significance of what they were doing. Instead, they clothed Jesus … in scarlet cloth and bound his hand with the symbol of one of the sons of Tamar and Judah. The cloak itself [represents] the blood shed by the world and by the people in it. The Savior was put to death for the salvation of all. But they who are choked by “worries, wealth and pleasure” have received the word of God but have not borne fruit. They weave thorns together and crown Jesus with them, dishonoring him.… Those who deemed his kingdom to be of little value placed a reed in his right hand.
