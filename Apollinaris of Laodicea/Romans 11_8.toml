This quotation was taken directly from the Hebrew by the apostle himself. The Septuagint edition has “God has put a spirit of stupor in you.” The version of Aquila more clearly has “virulence” and that of Symmachus has “pride.” … In effect, because of the ignorance of the people, the prophetic writings will be a sealed book to them, and they will be incapable of reading them.
