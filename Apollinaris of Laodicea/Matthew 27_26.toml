The floggings [are] for the sins of the world, because the sinner is flogged many times, according to the prophecy that says, “I gave my back to the whips.” And so is fulfilled [the saying] that the righteous [will give himself] for sinners. The height of goodness is also fulfilled when “the righteous [suffered] for the unrighteous,” so that “by his wounds we might be healed,” as Isaiah says.
