Even Paul was not above the need of comfort. For right speech comforts the speaker as well. By this means Paul is teaching his followers not to be proud if they are called to teach. They are not giving what merely belongs to them when they teach. They come to realize that they not only minister to others’ needs but that they have needs themselves. For this is the fruit of the gospel. It is a blessing to those who preach it.
