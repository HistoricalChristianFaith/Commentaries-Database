The unbelievers’ disagreement with the believers will produce a distinction. Now since the unbelievers think that peacemaking is their proper duty, they say, “Do not believe that it is best under all circumstances to be saved, for you owe it as a duty to be at peace with all.” But there are some who are preparing for battle against our peace, and you should not let their false peace rule. For the only true concord is according to God … and this above all is peace.
