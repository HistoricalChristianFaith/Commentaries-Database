The teacher must remain in subjection to the prophets, according to the established order, for the prophets are second (after the apostles) and the teachers are third. In fact, teachers are interpreters of the prophetic word, because they have heard and understood it with their ears and seen it with their eyes. For the prophets themselves called those whom they had taught to serve in the ministry of teaching.
