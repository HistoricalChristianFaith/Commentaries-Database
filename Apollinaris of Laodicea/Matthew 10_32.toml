The prize is superior insofar as it comes from God. It is not the same thing to acknowledge in a human manner and to be acknowledged in God’s manner.… The believer then must acknowledge God with both heart and mouth. “For one believes with one’s heart and so is justified, and one confesses with his one’s lips and so is saved.”
