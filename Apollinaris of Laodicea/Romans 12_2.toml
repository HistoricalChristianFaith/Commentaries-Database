This is what the prophet Jeremiah meant when he talked about writing the law of God on the heart. For in the pursuit of God the spiritually minded heart will know what is good and acceptable and perfect, and it will only like the things which are pleasing to God. Filled with the goodness of the good Father it will want to do his will and will try to encourage everyone to do good.However, it is not enough merely to do good; one must resist evil as well. For it is the rejection of evil which represents true progress toward the good.
