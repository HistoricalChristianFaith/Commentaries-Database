This is also the beginning of the translation of souls into the heavens. For whatever souls follow Christ are translated. Stephen made this plain when he said, “Lord Jesus Christ, receive my spirit.” Paul also writes, “It is better to depart and be with Christ.” Such was not the case with those of ancient times. It was said concerning the dead that each was handed over “to his people.” This proceeding was below, as was the detention of souls. The Lord changes the direction of the journey from below to above by means of himself.
