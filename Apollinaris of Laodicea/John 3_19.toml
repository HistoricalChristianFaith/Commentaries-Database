Those who love darkness instead of the light have no excuse. They did not fail to believe Christ because of their ignorance but because they wanted to do what is evil, which Christ’s teaching would not permit. Then, whenever we hear “they could not believe,” let us understand this as not referring to the ability of their nature or to their subjugation to someone else but to their own free reason, which enslaved them to dishonorable passions, not wanting to let them revolt from their very base habits. For these know “the light,” but do not come to it, in case they might be convicted for their hypocrisy for saying that they know God while denying him by their actions.
