If wisdom is pleasant in the knowledge of created things, how much more pleasant will be the Wisdom that created all things from nothing? If a great abundance of pleasures are found in pleasant things, what, and how great, will the pleasure be in him who made pleasant things? O, for the one who will enjoy this good! What will he have, and what won’t he have? He will surely have everything he will want and nothing that he won’t want. In that place there will truly be the goods of body and soul, “those things that eye has not seen or ear heard, nor have they even entered the human heart.” Poor person, why then do you wander here and there seeking what is good for your body and soul? Love the one good in which all good things are, and that is enough. Desire that simple good that is every good, and that is enough. What do you love, my flesh? What do you desire, my soul? Everything that you love is there. Everything you desire is there. If beauty delights you, “The righteous will shine like the sun.” If it is swiftness, strength or a freedom of the body that nothing can hinder, “They will be like the angels of God,” since “a natural body is sown, and a spiritual body is raised”5—by his power, of course, and not by nature. A long, healthy life is already an object of delight. There, there will be an eternity without evils, and eternal health, since “the righteous will live forever” and “the salvation of the righteous comes from the Lord.” If one speaks of fullness, they will be filled when the glory of the Lord appears. If of intoxication, “They will be filled with the abundance of the Lord’s house.” If of melody, up there the choirs of angels sing endlessly to God in unison. If of any kind of pure desire, the Lord will give them to drink of the stream of the delights of his divinity. If of wisdom, “They will all be taught by God” in such a way that wisdom itself will teach them. If of friendship, they will love God more than themselves and one another as themselves. And God will love them more than they love themselves, since they will love him, loving themselves and one another in him, and he will love them in himself. If one speaks of harmony, they will all have a single will, because they will have only the will of God. If of power, they will enter into the power of the Lord, and their wills will be almighty, like that of God.
