Do you want to love? Love wisdom, desire fervently to acquire it. Put the inner person in order, so that its appearance will not horrify you. As lustful eyes seek the beauty of the body, so you should seek that of the heart. And this beauty will not come from your riches, because wisdom hates the proud and those who in some way or another want to boast of what they have. “What do you have that has not been given to you?” Wisdom will give you what pleases her. Love her greatly, and she will care for you. “Hold her close and she will exalt you, honor her and she will embrace you. She will put a graceful crown on your head.” “Wisdom is radiant and unfading; she is easily contemplated by those who love her and found by those who seek her.”
