Certainly, every year we celebrate the day of the coming of the Holy Spirit. However, we must act in such a way as to invite him, with pure actions and feelings, so that he comes to us every day. We must be pure and clean in our senses and in our thoughts, and we must dedicate ourselves to watching over our speech and our hearts, so as to render ourselves always worthy of his visitations and his illumination and so that it may be evident that we are free from all impurity in our thoughts. He has said in fact that “perverse thoughts separate people from God.” Let us make every effort to be free from all backbiting and malice, because “wisdom will not enter a deceitful soul or dwell in a body enslaved to sin.” By their anger and pride, the hearts of the careless find themselves without the vigilance and protection of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, let us not sadden the Holy Spirit by these passions. Rather, let us invoke him, that with the grace of humility and the mildness of peace he would enter our hearts and that we would gladden him by our works and our initiatives. He himself has said, “With whom will I make my resting place? With the humble one, who has a contrite spirit and trembles at my word.”
