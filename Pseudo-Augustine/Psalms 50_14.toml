God desires and seeks nothing more from us than that, through our actions, his name is magnified by all, as it is written: “Offer to God the sacrifice of praise.” This is the sacrifice that God seeks and loves in preference to all victims, namely, that through the works of our justice, his name may be glorified everywhere and that, by the actions and works of his servants, he may be proved to be the true God. They love God in truth who perform only actions by which his name may be glorified.
