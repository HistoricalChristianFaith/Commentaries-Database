In Wisdom it says, "He who created the world from formless matter," and the opposite, "We were made from nothing." The sense of Scripture affirms that God created the elements all at once, with darkness also mixed in with them. And God called this confusion of elements (that is, air, fire, water, land and darkness) formless matter, as it says in Genesis: "The earth, moreover, was invisible and formless." And from this confusion he then created the world, also establishing the firmament, so that, once the waters were gathered in a single place, it might be the dwelling of the human race. Having distinguished and separated the elements, he made an inhabitable dwelling in the cavity that remained. - "Questions from the Old Testament 2.20"
