The Lord is true and merciful, and he does not delight in the destruction of the living. What is the ruin of the living if not death? But the death of the living who live badly, who will perish in the second death, not that of the living who are righteous, that is, who seek God and are not subject to the second death but only to the first, which is a result of the sin of Adam with which they were born. If then God were the author of death, he should rejoice in the destruction of the living as though it were one of his good works, since it is written, “The Lord will rejoice in his works,” and he made nothing out of hate, but everything that he made was very good, as it is written, “Since you love everything that exists, and you despise nothing that you have created. If you had hated something, you would not have created it.”
