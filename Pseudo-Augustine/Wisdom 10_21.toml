If only I could sing like the choirs of angels! Oh, with what devotion I would pour myself out in your praises, reciting unceasingly and most excellently the hymn of your glory in the middle of the assembly! Will I perhaps keep silent because I cannot sing like them? Lord, woe to those who keep silent on your account, because “you open the mouth of the mute and loosen the tongue of infants.” Since infants can only babble your praises, I ask you to accept the sacrifice from the tip of my tongue, from the love of my heart.
