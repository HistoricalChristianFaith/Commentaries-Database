We will show that the Scriptures say that the Son is almighty like the Father, so that not only reason, but the divine witness as well, would persuade the shameless minds of heretics. The Father is called almighty, because the prophet says, “Thus says the almighty God.” The Son is called almighty when the apostle John says in Revelation, “From Jesus Christ our Lord, who is, who was and who is to come, the almighty.” The Holy Spirit is also called almighty: “The Spirit of the Lord fills the universe, and he who embraces all things, knows.” Is it possible that the one who encompasses everything not be almighty?
