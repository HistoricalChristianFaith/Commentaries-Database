Similarly, in the book of Wisdom it says, “Because the grace of God is in his saints.” It is said as a general rule that no one has ever been or is holy without the grace of God. But so this grace might be in the saints, to confirm them, they receive it freely through the faith that comes from God. They did not have it prior to faith. As David says, “You will save them without price.”
