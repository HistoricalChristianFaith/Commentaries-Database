How then is “greater” to be understood? Does it pertain to the size of bodies? Or does it mean “more advanced” in age? Or does it mean “adorned with more virtue”? But all these things can be quantified—whatever can be perceived and measured. But in God there is nothing that can be perceived or measured. Thus, the words greater and less cannot be spoken concerning the Word of God or concerning the Father. For by nature God cannot be measured or quantified. But if you say that the Father is greater since he is unbegotten while the Son is begotten, we reply that these words speak of their natures, not of their properties of existence. And especially in the cases of those incorporeal beings one does not diminish the value of those of the same substance by granting more or less to this one or to that one. For by nature Absolute Being cannot be measured in essence or in knowledge simply by any measure or quantity of size. Then why did [Christ] say these things?The Savior in one word set forth a double manner of teaching, for the meaning of the word he spoke is twofold. It is just as in the phrases “the one sending me” and “I depart”: he alluded to the body embraced by definite locations, inasmuch as it is circumscribed by them, and he did not refer to the uncircumscribed divine nature that embraces all things. By analogy, then, when he says “greater,” he indicates that his divinity can be equaled to that of the Father, since he is of the same substance with him, but the Father is greater because the Son accepted a body, since the Son’s nature is understood to be less than that of the Father inasmuch as the Son has become man. And do not marvel that the Savior says that he is less than the Father since he became man, since he also has said that he became lower than the angels, as in this verse: “We see Jesus made lower than the angels for a little time because of the suffering of his death, but now crowned with glory and honor.” He was also said to be lower than his own disciples, for he said, “I am in your midst as your servant” and as the least. Therefore, things that are compared share the same substance, but things that are undivided (whether in our knowledge or by their essence) cannot admit of “greater” and “less.” Now if you wish to understand the sentence, “The Father who sent me is greater than me,” to apply to the divinity of the Son apart from considering that he has taken on flesh, you will have to suppose that he is enclosed in and restricted to certain places and that he was sent where he had not previously been and removed from where he had been. But this makes no sense.
