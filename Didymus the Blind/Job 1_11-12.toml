“[God’s] hand” must be understood in a variety of ways. It is either the power that punishes or serves punishment, usually referred to in the Scripture as “tools of wrath,” or the protecting and guarding power in the Scripture, “No one can snatch them out of the Father’s hand.” Even the Son can be shielded by the hand which protects and supports those who are under it, in accordance with the word, “The right hand of the Lord [has] exalted [me]; the right hand of the Lord acts valiantly.” The quoted words prove that no one is tempted without God’s permission. For God says, “See, I have given everything into your hand.” But in order to show that this permission is given [only] with restrictions, it is added, “Only do not stretch out your hand against him.” Thus afflictions occur neither due to fate nor arbitrarily but due to God’s permission, in order—as mentioned in the beginning—to proclaim Job’s virtue, but sometimes for other reasons, concerning which we will speak later on.
