There are a number of differences that distinguish a man who is studious, sophisticated and urbane from a man who is none of these things. We say then of this latter type that by comparison with one who is a city person and a man of science, he is a simpleton, a rustic or “man of the country,” and that by comparison with an educated and cultivated individual, he is uneducated or at least of low education. The fruit engendered by virtue is a style of life conformed to laws. So the person who does not live as a citizen according to the laws of the “city of the living God,” of the heavenly city, is a man of the country. For, since he is not able to live up to the constitution of this city, he lives in the country and not yet in the city. And it is well that the text says not only that he is “of the country” but also that he is “a man,” for a share in the Word of God is not yet given to one who is just beginning. This will not happen until he has made some progress—for those whom Scripture called “godly” are those into whom the Word of God has entered. It is then that he will be a citizen of the heavenly city. Appropriately of such people, in fact, the wise Paul writes these words in the epistle to the Hebrews: “To the mountain of Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.” For it is there that they will be inscribed. The Savior indeed says, “Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you; but rejoice that your names are written in heaven.” This is certainly not to be taken in the sense that these names composed of syllables are literally written in heaven. But these are names relative to virtue, and as such they have in heaven an inscription that will perpetuate their memory. Such are the people who are inscribed in heaven, but those who are of contrary mind, who are concerned only with earthly things, have not managed to do more than inscribe their names on earthly things. Jeremiah rightly says in their regard: “Those who turn away from thee shall be written in the earth.”
