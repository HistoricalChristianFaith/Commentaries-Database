Since Zophar does not recognize Job’s virtue and the goal of his consistent remarks, he says to Job, “Do not talk much.” The word of holy Scripture teaches us to control our words. It says, “When words are many, transgression is not lacking.” Here Scripture calls the utterance of inappropriate things “many words.” But it is not the number of uttered words that make a babbler. The apostle shows this when he “continued speaking until midnight.” One can, however, be astonished about Zophar’s audacity toward Job. Although he answered Job, Zophar claimed that there was no one to answer him. Thereby Zophar shows one should not speak too audaciously, yet he does so himself in maintaining that Job is suffering due to his personal wickedness.
