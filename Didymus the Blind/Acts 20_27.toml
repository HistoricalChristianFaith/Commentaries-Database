If a teacher, in educating those who are able to profit, harms none of these students, even in this does he imitate Paul. He will say that he is clean of the blood of all his students, meaning that by his teaching he has not slaughtered any through error, as if he had poured out the vital force of his soul, which is allegorically called blood. In addition to this he declares openly that he has set out and announced to them the entire counsel of God. But understood simply the entire counsel of God is incomprehensible to creatures, “for who knows the mind of the Lord?” So we must find out what meaning this passage bears. Now, since we have here the phrase “I announced to you,” it means something different, namely, that [Paul] calls that “entire counsel” what it was possible for humans to say and hear. This interpretation is in agreement with his sentiment that “we know in part,” and this very knowledge is, in relation to the coming age, partial in itself, be it of any sort and of the greatest fullness. It is possible that “the entire counsel of God” means the plan concerning the giving of the law and the prophets and the gospel.
