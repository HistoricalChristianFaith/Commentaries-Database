While Scripture’s spirit witnesses on behalf of Job that he has not committed any folly against God, Eliphaz incorrectly understands the reason behind what has been imposed upon Job. Eliphaz believes that Job suffers because of trespasses, and he thinks the words Job has spoken were motivated by his unacceptable behavior. “Is not your fear founded in folly,” since you think you are righteous, “your hope also, and the mischief of your way?” Folly, Eliphaz says, is also the hope that you will be considered righteous. For such punishments are not imposed upon a righteous person. Eliphaz calls Job’s way the “way of wickedness.” He continuously thinks that the holy man suffers due to sins. This is also why Eliphaz ascribes folly to him.
