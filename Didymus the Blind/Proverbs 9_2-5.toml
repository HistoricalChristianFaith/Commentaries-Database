The same food is called “meat,” “bread,” “milk” and “wine.” However, fools say that they take it as [simply] bread and mixed wine. But if it were really taken in that manner, how would we interpret the words: “So men ate the bread of angels”? Now “bread,” it seems to me, should be understood as the firm commandments of God and “wine” as the knowledge of God through meditation on holy Scripture; similarly also [the knowledge of] his divine body and his precious blood.
