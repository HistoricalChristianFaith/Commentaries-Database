It is written, “Not a messenger or an angel but the Lord himself saved them.” He forgave them, for no other reason than that he loved them. Indeed, it says “forgive,” as with his own children, according to that verse that is referred to in another book, “You have compassion on all things, Lord, lover of souls, because they are yours, nor do you nourish hatred toward the beings you have created.” For their salvation, therefore, the Father, not sparing his own Son, gave him over to death, so that by the death of his own Son, having reduced to powerlessness him who had power over death, that is, the devil, he would free all those who were subject to him through the bonds of slavery. For this reason it is added, “He himself rescued them, he comforted them and raised them up.” He in fact comforts and exalts those who are saved and lifts the redeemed on wings of virtue toward the most sublime heights. He dwells in them and with them, through both instruction and knowledge of the truth, not only for a day or two but for all the days of eternity, communicating life to them “until the end of the world,” because he is the cause of salvation.
