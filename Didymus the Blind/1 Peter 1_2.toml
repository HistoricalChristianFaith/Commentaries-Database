What Peter says agrees with the statements of Paul, such as: “He has chosen us in himself before the foundation of the world, to be holy and spotless before him in love, predestinating us to be adopted as sons.” … Foreknowledge is not to be regarded as anything other than the contemplation of the future. It becomes knowledge as the things which are foreseen come to pass. Therefore, although the people to whom Peter was writing had once been chosen according to God’s foreknowledge, by the time he was writing to them their election had already taken place.
