The Lord gives to each person according to his deeds; against those who sin greatly and often he is very angry indeed, but he is angry in a mild way against those who do wrong in a few things and only for a short time. He has also said concerning the instruments of his wrath that are his punishments, “I was not all that angry, but they insisted on doing evil.” And they who charge themselves with transgressions make a loud cry to the merciful and compassionate Lord, “Do not be exceedingly angry with us.” For as he “judges with justice, strength and magnanimity, without extending his wrath from day to day,” he moderates his anger against those he judges, not counting up all their faults.
