“Bird” can here mean the Savior in his human nature.…But also the message of truth itself can be called “bird” for this time. It can be compared for this time with a bird that comes from on high, from where truth came to the listeners. Since, however, now even the perfect listeners are lifted up and strive for what is above the earth, the “bird on the roof” calls to them. Standing above the cosmos it has announced the perfect, the encounter with truth “from face to face.”

“The daughters of song” are false teachers, the daughters only of the voice but not of the spirit, not of wisdom, not of knowledge, not of light. Because of their unmanliness and their feminization in the treatment of the perishable they are called daughters.They will be brought low. Like darkness ends when light appears, they will be unveiled as nothing when the “call of the bird,” that is, of the “market” or the Savior or the divine teacher, the “rising” [human being], is here. It turns out that the teaching [of the daughters of song] is valid only for this present life and that—to say briefly what has been treated extensively by people elsewhere—human wisdom, which promises a program of nice speeches and good rhetoric, lasts only as long as the voice. Since, however, this voice will vanish, because no air is moving any more when they rise above the sphere of the air, they will be brought low. The “daughters of song” will be seen as nothing, since the wise teachers are not called daughters or daughters of song, but “sons of light,” and “sons of wisdom.”
