Previously Bildad said that the teaching is passed on from the ancestors and fathers to the following generations. Now he supports this with an example. He says, “As papyrus does not prosper without water and reeds do not grow if they are not watered … likewise someone cannot produce useful fruit whose spirit has not received nourishment from higher authorities.” But one can also say that human affairs are watered by providence as with water; if water is not added, they easily decrease and vanish. If, therefore, someone is hit by hardships but recovers from them, this happens with thanks to Providence. Even if what humans do seems to have a human root, it still does not last if Providence does not preside over it. Similarly the psalmist says beautifully, “Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain.” [Bildad then comments], “They wither before any other plant.” This means the same as Bildad’s earlier comment but is said about every plant. He seems to mean that, big or small, everything in life is subjected to Providence and withers if it does not pay attention to it.
