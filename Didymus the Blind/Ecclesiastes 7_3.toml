quote='''
Take the case that someone has subjects, for example, children or slaves. If he is angry with them and in a fury so that he limits the evil, then his anger is good, not anger as such, but the anger of a father over his child, of a guardian’s anger over his charge.…He calls that kind of anger good that prevents sins from becoming so big that punishment has to follow.
