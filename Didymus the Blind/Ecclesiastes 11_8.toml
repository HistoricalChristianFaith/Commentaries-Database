In the spiritual sense [this saying] is even more valid, for “young men” are those who are strong because they have the Word of God and because they have power against evil. John, for example, writes, “I write to you, young people, because you are strong and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.” He certainly does not write to a certain age group in a physical sense but to a soul made young, since it has “clothed [itself] with the new self.”
