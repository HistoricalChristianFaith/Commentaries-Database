Anyone can see that God is here announcing Abraham’s departure from this life. As for the anagogical [mystical] sense, one could say the following: The wise person leaves this life in peace, while the sinner does so with troubled thoughts and an agitated soul. And the way death takes one, so is one judged. One who has already attained peace here below takes leave also in peace. But one who has nothing but disturbance and agitation in his or her thoughts will be judged also in this way. This is clear from the saying in Ecclesiastes: “In the place where the tree falls, there it will lie.” Things do not occur this way in historical reality, because a tree does not necessarily always lie where it falls. Often it is cleared away. But it is evidently humankind who is symbolically represented by the tree, namely, a person who will be judged as he or she is found.In peace, then, as is fitting, Abraham will depart to his fathers. Being pleasing to God, he shares in their promise: “First Christ, then those who are of Christ.” And for the just themselves, there are different promises and different dwellings, because “there are many mansions” with the Father. The person full of zeal will go to be with his spiritual fathers, whose son he is through a moral likeness, even if, according to the flesh, he had fathers who were bad men.
