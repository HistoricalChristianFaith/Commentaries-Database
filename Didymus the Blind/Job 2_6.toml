The Lord allows even this for our best, so that Job should be presented as an expression and image of perseverance—like a marked pillar—and that he may be for his contemporaries and his successors an example of such virtue. Indeed, this did happen. From the fighter and athlete himself one can hear the words, “I know that I shall be vindicated.” When the Lord surrendered him, he said, “Only spare his life.” This phrase can be understood in the following way: often we see madness and confusion of mind in people. God alone, who knows the hidden, knows the reasons why these people have been surrendered [to testing] in such a way. What the Lord, therefore, wants to say is this: Do not numb or confuse Job’s mind. You may have what you demanded. Touch his flesh and bones. Consider whether “Only spare his life” might mean, “Do not kill him!”
