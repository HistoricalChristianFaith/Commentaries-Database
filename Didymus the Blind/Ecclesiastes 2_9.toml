The wise person always finds himself “increasing” when he prospers. But in life, it is the last and the first thing to reach perfection. In Scripture it is said, “When human beings have finished, they are just beginning.” Of course, even if human beings reach the perfection possible in this life, still, as it is said, “We know only in part.” In the activity of “increasing” there is always something virtuous.… [The prophets and Moses] prophesied what Jesus would do and teach. But Jesus fulfilled the prophecy. The actualization of potentialities is always an “increase.” These prepared the way, but he has perfected the way when he declared about himself: “I am the way, the truth.” And he says to his disciples: “Unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees.” In this you see that Jesus’ disciples had more righteousness than the previous ones.
