Job wants to reveal their wrong perceptions with the words, “But I have understanding as well as you,” and still I do not think the same thoughts as you. Or do you think that your thinking is unsurpassed? I am reasonable too, and reason is not different from reason, but the difference is in the application. So it is said for example about the evil ones, “Listen to me, you stubborn of heart,” for not the creature but its evil activity he calls “stubbornness of heart.”
