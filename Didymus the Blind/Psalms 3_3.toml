Since the psalm is spoken from the person of the Lord, it must be said that even the head of him who is lifted up is of God, since really his deity is made manifest to the faithful through external demonstration. The word head in this place indicates “chief.” Christ, therefore, the chief of holy people, deservedly is their king, and it is his head that is lifted up.
