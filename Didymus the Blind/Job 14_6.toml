Since God is with Job through the hardships he lays upon him, Job says, “Look away!” in the sense of “Bring your anger to an end!” God approaches in different ways by allowing participation and through anger. The friends had come to the conclusion that Job suffers for his sin. He therefore harshly responds that “The human being has a short life and is like a withered flower and a shadow” and “God sees him.” In this Job was demonstrating for them that he was not suffering because of sin. He says, “Look away!” If God delivers someone into such a flood of afflictions, the human being has no calm for remorse. Job therefore teaches his friends that their opinion is unreasonable. For he says, “Look away from him and desist, that he may enjoy, like a hireling, his day.” In such affliction he would not be able to have calm or to enjoy his life.…But Job spoke this to his friends so that it might be clear that God grants a break in order for remorse to occur. This is why Paul says, “Or do you despise the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience? Do you not realize that God’s kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?” That “desist” is said instead of “end your wickedness and be virtuous” becomes plain in the words “If you have sinned, desist!” And “the earth feared and was still when God rose up to establish judgment.” When people realize that God is judge, they desist from sinning.
