The devil himself may be called the way of sinners. Let the one who stands in this way be warned lest he tarry there. Recall what the Scripture says: “Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.” For the one who will not stand in the devil’s way will come to the Lord, who says, “I am the way.” Truly the one who follows this way, traveling the way to the end, will receive a reward.
