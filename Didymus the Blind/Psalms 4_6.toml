Many individuals read it in this way: “A certain one will show us good things.” For it is not that the many show good things but that the One shows good things; that is, the only begotten Son of God. To those who understand it this way, the word who indicates a provider of a certain distinguished nature, an individual and a being singular in number. They use this witness: “A certain noble man.” For in this passage the word certain denotes someone who is especially distinguished.
