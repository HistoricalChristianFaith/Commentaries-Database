This word anticipates the sojourn of the people in Egypt, for they were to sojourn as it were in a land not their own. They would be reduced to slavery by the Pharaoh and mistreated in many ways by him and by the Egyptians. There is no discrepancy between what is said here and what is written in Exodus. There it is said, “After 430 years, the army of the Lord left the land of Egypt.” Here: “After four hundred years.” It should be noted that it is not said that they left when four hundred years were completed but rather after four hundred years, which leaves room for the thirty years.And the promise “I will judge the nation to which you will be enslaved” was realized in the very way described in Exodus: God afflicted the Egyptians with ten plagues, and in the end “they sank as lead in the mighty waters.” Finally, they were to leave “with much baggage,” as history would show. From this we learn that if God maltreats someone for a time, he does this not as a matter of indifference but only for some good purpose.
Consider too whether this passage might also allude to the sojourn of the saints.
