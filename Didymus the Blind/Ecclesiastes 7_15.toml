There is an absolute righteousness and a righteousness that is only righteous for one.… A righteous person can get lost in what is only righteous for him. Those, however, who are really righteous … do not remain in what is righteous for them alone and do not trust in this as their own right. This is why he does not perish in absolute righteousness, as the psalmist says: “In your righteousness I will live.” Paul, for example, who was a great man who lived in Christ and for whom truth was revealed, said, “I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted.”
