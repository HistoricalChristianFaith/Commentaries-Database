These words are spoken to the leaders of the church so that, in addition to the other things, they might judge themselves imitators of Paul by refusing to accept money. This is quite obvious from the words that follow: “I have given you example in all things that those who toil must come to the help of the weak” and provide for them. If the words of the Lord should be remembered, they will provide the principle: “It is better to give than to receive.” Let giving be preferred by bishops.
