When the torches had passed over the divided animals, the covenant was made. God said to Abraham, “To your descendants I will give this land,” and he described in detail how far the land extended in each direction. But, through an anagogical [mystical] transposition consistent with our above remarks, we must understand that this land is given to the holy man’s spiritual posterity. The Savior too promises it to those who practice gentleness. This is a promise that applies to the true children and not to all who descend from Abraham, for “it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are reckoned as descendants.” It is “the one who does the works of Abraham” who is in fact his child.The phrase “from the river to the river” is also well put, for the promise that belongs to the posterity of the holy man is virtue, which is placed between flowing things. Flowing things, of course, do not make up virtue but are its very borders, in the sense that if one departs from virtue, one encounters them immediately. But it is possible too that the rivers represent the trials that come to virtuous persons, since they are placed among people who oppress them, and yet the virtuous triumph over them.
