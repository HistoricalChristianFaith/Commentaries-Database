This is the reason why the sinner provokes the Lord, because he does not keep him before his eyes, because he turns himself away from God. The one who sins conducts himself in this way. Concerning all of this, God says, “They have shown me their backs and not their faces.” Cain, the offspring of this wickedness, “departed from the face of the Lord God.” That is, he turned himself away from him. Inasmuch as these words are spoken about people being sinners, even more so do they speak about the devil. “His ways are profaned at all times.” For of which people are the ways profaned for all time, since even the wicked often live with much honesty? He enters without permission to draw people to corrupt deeds and even to deny the providence of God. And so he persuades many to believe that the world is without the direction of God, and later he falls away from right ideas concerning the governing of God and the knowledge of judgment.
