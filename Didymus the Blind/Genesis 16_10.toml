It is not implausible that one who is living the life of a beginner should also be judged worthy of a blessing, for, if his progress continues toward the appropriate goal, he will arrive at perfection. But notice that when the text was talking about virtue—for it is from virtue that the true seed of Abraham comes—after God had led him outside and said to him, “Look toward heaven, and number the stars if you can count them,” he had added, “So shall your descendants be.” But notice that in the case of Hagar it is not said, “Your descendants will be like the stars,” but only “They will not be able to be numbered for their multitude.” Can you not conclude from this a difference: that the progeny of that which is perfect is luminous and that which pertains to the introductory level is not?
