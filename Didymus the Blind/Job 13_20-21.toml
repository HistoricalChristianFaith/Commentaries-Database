The lack of clarity in the text could be explained in the following way. Job says, “If you want to treat me as the friends say, as if you wanted to show my wickedness, I will hide from your face.” But if I am right, then “withdraw your hand far from me, and do not let your dread terrify me!” Every sinner hides from God’s face, since he does unworthy things. Thus Adam was hiding from God’s face. The opposite of this is to be hidden by God according to the word, “In the shelter of your presence you hide them from human plots.” This brings salvation since God protects the righteous so that he is not stumbling due to human confusion. The “hiddenness of God’s face” in contrast to the revealed might be the mystical thoughts. To gain insight from the works of Providence and God’s creation does not happen in hiddenness but in the open. It is written, “For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. Ever since the creation of the world his eternal power and divine nature, invisible though they are, have been understood and seen through the things he has made.” To be hidden by God, as mentioned, is bringing salvation. But to hide oneself as Adam did is ruinous. Since this is not true for Job, because he had no sin, he says, “Withdraw your hand from me” so that the friends may experience that I am not suffering because of sin. For the friends did not believe anything else but that Job suffered for his sins.
