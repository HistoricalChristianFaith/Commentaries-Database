Since weeping has different meanings, laughing needs to be understood accordingly; for weeping does not have only one meaning, nor does laughing. And since laughing is split in two meanings—sometimes praiseworthy, sometimes reprehensible—even weeping must be seen in this way, so that praiseworthy laughing corresponds to praiseworthy weeping and the same with reprehensible laughing and weeping.Often, thus, a life which is prone more to lust than to the love of God is laughing in such a way that the laughter itself is made into a god. And as some consider their stomachs divine and others consider them mammon, so a third person who loves entertainment and wants to be witty and so on, builds altars for laughter by making it divine so that he sacrifices to it. One sacrifices to it if one teaches what is suitable for laughing or what excites laughter.
That kind of laughter is reprehensible. It is blissful to abandon this kind of laughter and to devote one’s self to the weeping opposed to it. This is what the virtuous one was striving for when he said, “Every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.”
There is, however, also a praiseworthy laughter. It is said that God “will yet fill your mouth with laughter”—with (of course) praiseworthy laughter. This corresponds to the fruit of the Spirit, which is joy, for “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace.” Laughter, therefore, that corresponds with joy is praiseworthy.
Any weeping that is opposed to this kind of laughter and to the condition that opposes the joy of the Holy Spirit is reprehensible. That kind of weeping did not help Jerusalem. … And why was that so? It is because it did not repent at the time when it should have repented, but after it was too late.…
Now, we want to look for the spiritual meaning: The ascetical life, which is appropriate for pious people, is called weeping; the uninhibited life, however, which is prone more to lust than to the love of God, is laughter. Those who weep in this life will laugh later on, so that they are even blessed: “Blessed are you who weep now.” … But those who have laughed here, because they lived prone more to lust than to the love of God, will weep, after the punishment that will follow, so that the following is said to them: “There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.” Those, however, who here greatly weep out of repentance pray to God with the words: “You have fed them with the bread of tears, and given them tears to drink in full measure.”
