Whoever is great necessarily does great things. But the one who does great things is not necessarily great. The disciples who did great things received their ability from God. Taking an example from the human realm, I want to say that the grammarian writes correctly; but not everyone who writes correctly does so because of studies in grammar. Rather, he does so by chance and habit. Job demonstrates regarding greatness that only the one who is great makes great the things he does. Analogously and in accordance with our ability, we perceive God in the greatness of creatures and so receive an idea of God. He says this, however, so that his friends—who think there is only one reason for hardship—may consider that he who does great and dreadful things also has deep and unfathomable resolutions that are glorious. These things are filled with glory, so to speak. Paul writes something similar when he says, “O the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways! For who has known the mind of the Lord?”
