Think about the one on whom the sun of righteousness has arisen, expressing praise because of his grateful spirit to the author of the light. “In the morning,” he says, “you will hear my voice.” For to whom is it necessary to have gratitude for so much good, unless to you, Lord, who has brought the light to me, which is the source for the greatest illumination to me?
