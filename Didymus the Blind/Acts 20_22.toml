The one who has been united to the Holy Spirit has been bound in him so that he does not separate from the Spirit in any way. The person of such a disposition is a captive of Christ whose Spirit he has. For if whoever does not have the Spirit of Christ is not of Christ, who has the Spirit, it is clear that whoever has Christ is in the Spirit. Whoever is bound and decorated with these chains begets, by both the gospel’s and his own chains, those he teaches.… This verse must be read in respect to the following, which says that the apostle is ready to be clothed with chains because of his beliefs. When it is said to him that he must not go up to Jerusalem, since there he will certainly be covered with chains and afflictions, he says that he is bound in the Spirit now to make his way to Jerusalem in full knowledge of what would befall him there. His words, “Daily I die,” are a manifestation of this determination of his, as are his words, “Ever are we, while living, handed over to death because of Christ Jesus.” To this you can add the words of the psalmist, “I am ready to be scourged.”
