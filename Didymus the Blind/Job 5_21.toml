Again Eliphaz says this about the one who has been rebuked by the Lord, whereby he follows his own principle. Not even what Eliphaz says is stringent. Too often many righteous people have been vilified. Among them are Joseph, whom the Egyptian woman charged with excess in spite of his modesty, and Susanna, who suffered as a hostage the humiliations from the “lawless elders.” Consequently, if he understands by “hidden from the scourge of the tongue” that one is neither humiliated nor vilified, this word is unfounded. It is more accurate to say that the one who lives after the will of God cannot be harmed by humiliation or vilification, called “scourge of the tongue.” Virtue protects him from being found guilty of the false allegations. Nor does such a person fear expected destruction, since he says with Saint Paul, “Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will hardship, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril or sword?” Over all this he prevails through virtue’s abundance. Likewise, he is protected from the intrigues of false wisdom, since God “takes the wise in their own craftiness.” … The same meaning as “you shall not fear destruction when it comes” has the following word from the prophet: “The calamity will come from far away.” This must be understood like this: The good comes from us. For it is said, “The kingdom of God is within you.” Thus we have an inclination toward virtue that Christ called “kingdom.” But the punishment and damage and dishonor of sin come from the outside. For the human, who is created “after God’s image,” carries the seed of the good within. But if he deviates from the right path, he encounters evil, without having received such an inclination from God.
