Consider if this does not refer to the following words, “But ask the animals, and they will teach you.” The sequence of these two thoughts makes it clear that it is not given to unreasonable animals or soulless things to understand the resolutions of Providence, but it is given to reason. There is an example, as the palate judges food, so reason judges what is said and what is in the nature of the cosmos. “Consider also this yourselves,” he says to his friends, “and you will find out the nature of what happened to me.”
