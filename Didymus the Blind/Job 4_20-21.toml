Eliphaz, still clinging to the same principle … that Job’s critical circumstances were due to Job’s own sins, adds these words, “Since they could not help themselves through virtue by repenting of their evils, these afflictions befell them.” And Eliphaz suggests that he fully comprehends this situation. They perished since they could not drive away the most fearful accidents because of their weakness, demonstrating human power’s worthlessness.
