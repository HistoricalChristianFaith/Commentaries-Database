Even this happened to test Job. For the absence of friends in the midst of suffering is no small pain. Even the holy David sang as he experienced similar suffering, “Look on my right hand and see—there is no one who takes notice of me.” Consider whether Job desired to show here that even the invisible holy powers “passed away” above him, so that his virtue may appear to be even greater. This interpretation fits for the one that has been given the words “the providence of the Lord has looked after me.” For the Lord of all did not neglect Job out of hate but in order to show the adversary that his wickedness is useless against human virtue. Likewise, perhaps the divine powers do not protect Job and allow him to struggle so that the righteous behavior of the saint would become even more visible, for one must assume that they know God’s will.
