Who is that one except he who says, “There is no one who can save except me,” the one who has come to seek and to save that which has been lost13 and to give his soul as a ransom for many? These things show that God the Father saves through God the Son. Through this the deity of the Father and the Son must not be distinguished by the words above and must not be seen as different from one another.
