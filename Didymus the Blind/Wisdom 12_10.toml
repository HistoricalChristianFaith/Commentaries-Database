In the time of judgment, which is to say always, he judges everyone, sometimes calling this time the “time of judgment,” sometimes “the day of wrath” and “the day of rendering account.” “Until” this “punishment arrives,” while “the punishment has not yet come,” repent. There is “room for repentance.” “The Lord does not delay in fulfilling his promise, as some believe, but is patient toward you, not wanting that anyone should perish but that all should come to repentance.” Since therefore an extension is given to you for repentance, repent before “the punishment comes.”
