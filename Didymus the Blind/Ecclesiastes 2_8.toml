In many places of the divine teaching the Spirit and spiritual things are expressed by the image of gold, the spoken word and its virtue by the image of silver. “The tongue of the righteous is choice silver,” that is, his spoken word and everything which he teaches by this spoken word. In the same way the following saying is to be understood: “The promises36 of the Lord are promises that are pure, silver refined in a furnace on the ground.” But the spirit is gold.

As the choir directors assign a place and a pitch to each male and female member of the choir so that a harmony of sound emerges, so those who sing to God and do so in harmony have the Savior himself as choir director. Or the [choir director could also be the] wise man, who here is Solomon, if we understand him in his role as wise man.
