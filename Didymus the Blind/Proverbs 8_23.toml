[Solomon] says, “He laid down both the cause and foundation of creation.” Also it is written, “He created all things in himself, and he is before all things.” And the Lord says as well, “I am the beginning of the creation of God.” Indeed, desiring to be the foundation of the church, he submitted to becoming human so that the church might be constituted firmly in him. Desiring to give existence to creation, he adjusted himself to its rule by introducing the relationship we mentioned above, when he was made the beginning and cause of future things. However, it says, even if he was created according to these things, still “God begat me before everything,” the very one who is his Son.
