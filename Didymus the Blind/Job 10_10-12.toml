The seed from which life emerges he calls “milked milk,” for as milk curdles and becomes cheese, so the seed becomes “nature” when it curdles. This is a condition before the embryo. For the seed that sinks into the channels of the vagina becomes “nature” when it curdles like cheese. This formation is further developed or, as Scripture says, “formed out of an image” and takes on shapes … when the limbs are formed and every part emerges and finally moves. Just as the hand or foot of a living being, the delivery of the embryo brings the creature to the light of day. It is clear that “skin and flesh” here signify the body, for he adds in what follows with what holds it together and says, “knit me together with bones and sinews.” The whole procedure and the harmony of the formation of the body he proclaims in the previous [section] and in what is quoted here. It is remarkable that these seem to be words from his soul; for it is [the soul] that is “clothed with skin and flesh” and “knit together with bones and sinews.” That makes it clear that [the soul] is before the clothing and dressing, for it is clothed (already) as that which is the basis. Since skin and flesh, bones and sinews do not live by themselves but move due to the presence of the soul—if it leaves, they do not have life anymore—he says, “You have not only formed me, made flesh, skin, bones and sinews for me and clothed me with them, but you have also given me life and love.”
