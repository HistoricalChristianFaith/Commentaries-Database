Job’s friends came to do both things, since he had suffered both. On the one hand, Job’s possessions and his children were taken from him, and on the other hand his entire body was covered with leprosy. They arrived “together” at Job’s place. Their simultaneous arrival was either due to their great zeal or because they who lived in different places had agreed to meet. They wanted to arrive together to comfort him. They realized that the evil had not yet ceased but was active at that time. - "Commentary on Job 2.11"
