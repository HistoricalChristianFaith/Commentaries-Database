In the literal sense the following is said: The law prescribes that Israel’s judges have to investigate the behavior of the people; and if someone was found to have done prohibited things, he was to be convicted to be stoned.…Now, we relate the verse to rebuke instead of stoning. The wise teacher knows whom he has to rebuke and whom not, and in a certain way he throws the rebuke like stones in order to dissuade the rebuked from a bad way of life. If the person improves through the rebuke, the rebuke is gathered in and no more stones are thrown against him. Paul indicates this when he says, “Convince, rebuke and encourage!” By rebuking and convincing he was throwing stones. After seeing the one who was rebuked improve, he encourages and gathers the stones together. The following is meant: There is a time to punish and a time not to punish.

“A time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing.” In the literal sense this means men who live together with their wives have a time when they get together with them and a time when they do not.… When it is time for prayer, when it is a day on which one has to remain clean and send up prayers, one has to avoid embraces. When the days of prayer are over, they come together and embrace.…According to a superficial explanation, but perhaps also against it, the following remark is valid. “The appointed time has grown short,” Paul writes; “from now on, let even those who have wives be as though they had none.” He says, Since time has grown short and humankind has increased to a large number, it is not necessary any more to increase it; one has to cease.… When it was necessary that humankind increase, it was a time to embrace. But after the population had become numerous and the begetting of the faithful spread, one needed to avoid embracing.…
In the spiritual sense this is the meaning: Some have acquired God’s wisdom as a wife, like the one who says, “I became enamored of her beauty” and took her home as a spouse. About her it is said: “She will honor you if you embrace her.” Then wisdom embraces the wise by communicating to him her character, and the wise man embraces her.
When therefore this wife is with a person from whom she can beget insight and thoughts and works of insight—for “wisdom begets insight for a man”—then it is the time to embrace. This time, however, is not interrupted by breaks. One can always embrace wisdom. This time is eternal.
