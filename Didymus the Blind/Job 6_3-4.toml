Eliphaz believed that Job said all this out of desperation. Since Eliphaz’s first words to Job were trustworthy—words that insisted that Job suffered because of sin—Job responds, “It seems my words are valueless and lack faith.” Consequently, Job adds the reason why Eliphaz does not believe in him when he says, “For the arrows of the Almighty are in me,” thus making the following clear, “This is why my words are valueless. The Lord’s arrows are in my body.” For most people usually disregard words uttered by people in distress, those aggrieved by poverty, even if their words are understandable. This is expressed in the words, “The poor person speaks and they say, ‘Who is this fellow?’ ”
