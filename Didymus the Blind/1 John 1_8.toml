Since God is light, there is no darkness in him at all, and he has nothing to do with darkness. The person who is enlightened by his light walks in the light, according to the words of the Savior himself: “While you have the light, walk in the light, lest the darkness take hold of you.” Anyone who walks in the darkness of sin but claims that his mind is not darkened and that he has a relationship with God is lying.
