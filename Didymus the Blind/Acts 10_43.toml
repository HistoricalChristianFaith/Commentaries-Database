If one repents from the evil things he has done and believes in the name of the Lord, he receives absolution from the sins that he has sincerely recognized. All the prophets, whose teaching is brought to the people of the Jews, have spoken according to their trust and faith in their Father. Therefore it will be universally admitted that all the prophets testify that the absolution from sin is given to those who believe in the Lord.
