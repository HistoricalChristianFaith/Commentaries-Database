If we think about “eyes” in the visible sense, then (one can say) that both the foolish and the wise have eyes in their head. The wise [person], insofar as he is wise, turns upwards to Christ, his head. Thus it is written: “Christ is the head of every man.” The head of the wise is the mind; therefore it is written: “But we have the mind of Christ.”
