Only God is declared to be wise. He is defined as wise because he does not receive wisdom from another, nor does he participate in the wisdom of another. Many in fact are called wise, not by their nature but by the fact that wisdom is communicated to them. God, by contrast, who did not become wise by participation in the wisdom of another or by having gotten it somewhere else, is called the only wise, who generates wisdom and makes others wise. This wisdom is our Lord Jesus Christ, who is called the power and the wisdom of God. But the Holy Spirit is also proclaimed to be wisdom. In fact, even in the books of the Old Testament it is said that Joshua, son of Nun, was full of the spirit of wisdom. Only God, therefore, is wise, in that he does not receive wisdom from another principle but makes wise and generates wisdom. He alone is wise, as opposed to the other beings who are considered wise by his gift (“An abundance of wise people is the salvation of the world,” and, further, “Those who know themselves are wise” and, finally, “If you walk with the wise, you will become wise”4). Likewise the Holy Spirit, because he does not receive wisdom from another principle, is called the Spirit of wisdom. His very being is Spirit of wisdom, and his nature is none other than Spirit of truth6 and Spirit of God.
