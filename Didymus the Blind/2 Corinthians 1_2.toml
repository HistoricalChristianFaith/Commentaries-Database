The works that the Father does the Son also does, and the gifts that the Father gives, the Son also gives. It is to be understood from this that although we know God as Father, we are still servants of Jesus Christ. We do not call him “brother” but Lord. For he is the only begotten Son by nature, not by adoption, and is Lord of all those who have been made children of God.
