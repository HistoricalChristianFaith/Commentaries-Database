Even Bildad is confused in his speech and is pulled in different directions by various doctrines, when he says, “If you yourself have not sinned, your sons have.” Thereby he does not believe one is punished for someone else. But he may be included (in his reasoning), for he delivered the transgression into their hand due to their own sin. In so doing, he alludes to the collapse [of the house], through which Job’s children died. “Son” he says, referring to the superior part in his speech, because Job had also daughters. Thus he indicates, since the sons, who had great value for Job, have sinned, obviously the daughters have sinned as well.
