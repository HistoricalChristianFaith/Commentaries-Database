[Solomon] indicates here those people who have no strength but nonetheless store up treasures for eternal life on account of their good works.… The rock, in fact, is the refuge of badgers in which they live. You too, he says, even though you are weak, run to the rock of true faith, and with it restore life. The one who is supported by deeds enters the kingdom. Therefore, he says, do not despair of the kingdom of heaven because of the weakness of your faith; but believing in the promises, hasten to those works which are commanded. Christ is the lion: indeed all rational things are cattle in comparison with him. Moses, in fact, said, “I am a child.” Because of its natural alacrity, the lion is said to walk unhindered.
