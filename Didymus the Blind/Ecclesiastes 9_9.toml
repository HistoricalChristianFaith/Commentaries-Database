The time of the days has an end and a definite number. The psalmist as well says, “Lord, let me know my end, and what is the measure of my days; let me know how fleeting my life is.” …The days of life which are given under the sun are days of vanity. Even if our lives which we live now are good and filled with illumination, they will be replaced with greater joys, about which God says: “I will satisfy him through the length of the days.”
