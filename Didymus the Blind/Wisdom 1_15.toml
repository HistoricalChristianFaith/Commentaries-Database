I saw a godless person who said, “By the power of my own hand I have acted, and with my wisdom, for I am shrewd. I have removed the boundaries of the peoples, and I have pillaged their treasures.” I saw him exalted. I went forward in my thoughts to the next life and considered the arrangements of Providence. I saw him no longer, nor did I find his place, even though I looked for it. Godlessness will come to an end and will be no more. It is not included in what is immortal, as is said of righteousness, “Righteousness is immortal.”

When I prospered, sowing in righteousness and reaping the fruits of righteousness, I was in such a state that I could never waver. If “whoever does the will of God remains forever” and his “righteousness is immortal,” I indeed said this when I received the fruits of righteousness and prospered. I spoke thus to my soul, just as with the word according to which “no one can say ‘Jesus is Lord’ …” I confessed this with my soul and with my life when I prospered and bore fruits of virtue, because I will never waver, according to the word: “Whoever believes, and whoever lives and believes, will never die,” and “The righteousness of the Lord remains forever.”
