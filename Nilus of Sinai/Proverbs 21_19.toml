“It is better to dwell in the wilderness than with a contentious and an angry woman.” You wives, therefore, demonstrate your piety by your modesty and meekness to all outside the church, whether they are women or men, in order to their conversion and improvement in the faith. And since we have warned you and instructed you briefly, whom we do esteem our sisters, daughters and members, as being wise yourselves, persevere all your lives in a blameless course of life. Seek to know such kinds of learning whereby you may arrive at the kingdom of our Lord, and please him, and so rest for ever and ever.
