Do not fall into despair because of stumblings. I do not mean that you should not feel contrition for [your sins], but that you should not think them incurable. For it is more expedient to be bruised than dead. There is, indeed, a Healer for the person who has stumbled, even He Who on the Cross asked that mercy be shown to His crucifiers, He Who pardoned His murderers while He hung on the Cross. … For a brief moment of mourning He pardoned Simon, who had denied Him.… Christ came in behalf of sinners, to heal the broken of heart and to bandage their wounds. “The Spirit of the Lord,” He says, “is upon Me, to preach good tidings to the poor.” … And the Apostle says in his epistle, “Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners.”
