They will be withdrawn from the comely glory of their nature, and their bodies will become a desolate place. Recollect at all times that lamentable sight of corruption, that formless dispersion of your senses, that ruin of the edifice of your body, and how your wholesome constitution will become mud in Sheol. Blessed is the man who greets the recollection of this destruction with joy! Blessed is he who with good hope awaits that deed so replete with mystery wherein is concealed the wonder of the Creatorâ€™s power!
