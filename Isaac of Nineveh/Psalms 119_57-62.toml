Prayer offered up at night possesses a great power, more so than the prayer of the daytime. Therefore all the righteous prayed during the night, while combating the heaviness of the body and the sweetness of sleep and repelling corporeal nature. And this the prophet also says, “I toiled in my groaning; every night I will wash my bed, with tears will I water my couch,” while he sighed in fervent prayer. And again, “At midnight I arose to give thanks unto Thee for the judgments of Thy righteousness.” And for every entreaty for which they urgently besought God, they armed themselves with the prayer of night vigil, and at once they received their request.
