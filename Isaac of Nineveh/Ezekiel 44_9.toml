When the mind is longingly involved with one of these stirrings—this depends on the urgency of the matter at the time of supplication and is the result of great eagerness—the gaze of its stirring is drawn by the eye of faith inside the veil of the heart, and the entries of the soul are fenced off, keeping out alien thoughts, which are called “strangers,” who are not permitted by the law to enter inside the tent of witness. This is what they describe as “an acceptable sacrifice of the heart” and “pure prayer.” Prayer’s boundaries reach this point: afterwards it is not to be named prayer.
