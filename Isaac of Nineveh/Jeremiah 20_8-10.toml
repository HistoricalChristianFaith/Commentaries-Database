For they do not make their journey upon the royal highway as other men, but these giants select for themselves short-cuts, whereby gloriously they journey swiftly to the Heavenly mansions. For this hope so inflames them, as with fire, that they cannot rest from their incessant and headlong course on account of their joy. There comes to pass in them what was spoken by the blessed [Jeremiah], “I said, ‘I shall not remember Him nor speak His name.’ And there was in my heart as it were a flaming fire and it entered into my bones.” Such is the recollection of God in the hearts of people who are drunk with hope on his promises.
