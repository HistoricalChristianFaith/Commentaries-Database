Whenever [those who are lazy] pray to Him, He does not quickly hearken to them, but waits until they grow weary and have learned in no uncertain manner that these things befell them because of their slothfulness and negligence.â€¦ Even if this was said of others also, nonetheless it is written especially about those who have abandoned the way of the Lord. - "Ascetical Homilies 5"
