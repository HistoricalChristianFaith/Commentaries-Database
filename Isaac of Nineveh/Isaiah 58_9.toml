quote='''
Whenever you keep the ways of the Lord and do His will, then put your hope in the Lord and call on Him.…When temptation overtakes the iniquitous person, he has no confidence wherewith to call upon God, nor to expect salvation from Him, since in the days of his ease he stood aloof from God’s will.
