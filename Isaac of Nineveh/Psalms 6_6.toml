Prayer offered up at night possesses a great power, more so than the prayer of the day-time. Therefore all the righteous prayed during the night, while combating the heaviness of the body and the sweetness of sleep and repelling corporeal nature.… And for every entreaty for which they urgently besought God, they armed themselves with the prayer of night vigil, and at once they received their request.
