Prayer offered up at night possesses a great power, more so than the prayer of the day-time. Therefore all the righteous prayed during the night, while combating the heaviness of the body and the sweetness of sleep and repelling corporeal nature.â€¦ And for every entreaty for which they urgently besought God, they armed themselves with the prayer of night vigil, and at once they received their request.
