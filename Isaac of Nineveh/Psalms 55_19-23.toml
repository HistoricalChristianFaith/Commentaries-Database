If you believe that God makes provision for you, why be anxious and concerned about temporal affairs and the needs of your flesh? But if you do not believe that God makes provision for you, and for this reason you take pains to provide for your need separately from Him, then you are the most wretched of all men. Why even be alive or go on living in such a case? “Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He will nourish thee,” and you shall never be dismayed at any terror that overtakes you.
