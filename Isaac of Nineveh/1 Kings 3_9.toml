Do not be foolish in the request you make to God, otherwise you will insult God through your ignorance. Act wisely in prayer so that you may become worthy of glorious things. Ask for things that are honorable from him who will not hold back so that you may receive honor from him as a result of the wise choice your free will has made. Solomon asked for wisdomâ€”and along with it he also received the earthly kingdom, for he knew how to ask wisely of the heavenly King, that is, for things that are important.
