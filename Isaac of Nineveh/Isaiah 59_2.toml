But since we say that God is plenteous in mercy, why is it that when amidst temptations we unceasingly knock and pray, we are not heard and He disregards our prayer? This we are clearly taught by the Prophet when he says, “The Lord’s hand is not little, that it cannot save; nor is He hard of hearing, that He cannot hear: but our sins have separated us from Him.” … Remember God at all times, and He will remember you whenever you fall into evils.
