On account of its great intensity, this reflection is sometimes mingled with wonder. For the heart of those who see the Lord will rejoice. Seek the Lord, O sinners, and be strengthened in your thoughts because of hope. And seek his face through repentance at all times, and you will be sanctified by the holiness of his presence, and you will be purified of your iniquity. Hasten to the Lord, O sinners; he remits iniquity and removes sins. For he has sworn, “I have no pleasure in the death which the sinner dies,” so that the sinner may repent and live. “I have spread out my hands all day toward a quarrelsome and disobedient people.” And “Why would you want to die, O house of Jacob?” “Turn to me, and I will turn to you.”
