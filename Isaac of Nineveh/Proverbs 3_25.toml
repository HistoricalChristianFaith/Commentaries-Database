If you believe that God makes provision for you, why be anxious and concerned about temporal affairs and the needs of your flesh? But if you do not believe that God makes provision for you, and for this reason you take pains to provide for your need separately from Him, then you are the most wretched of all men. Why even be alive or go on living in such a case? “Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He will nourish thee,” and you shall never be dismayed at any terror that overtakes you.A man who has dedicated himself once and for all to God goes through life with a restful mind. Without nonpossessiveness the soul cannot be freed from the turmoil of thoughts; and without stillness of the senses she will not perceive peace of mind. Without entering into temptations, no man will ever gain the wisdom of the Spirit; and without assiduous reading, he will know no refinement of thoughts. Without tranquility of thoughts the intellect will not be moved in hidden mysteries; and without the confidence that comes through faith, the soul cannot dare to withstand temptations with boldness. Moreover, without actual experience of God’s protection, the heart cannot hope in Him; and if the soul does not taste Christ’s sufferings consciously, she will never have communion with Him.
