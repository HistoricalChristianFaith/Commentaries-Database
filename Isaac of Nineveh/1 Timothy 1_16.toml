We bring to mind how the holy apostle Paul recounts his transgressions and puts his soul in the last and nethermost place, saying, “Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.” … When and at what time did he say this? After great struggles, after mighty works, after the preaching of the gospel of Christ which he proclaimed throughout the whole world, after continual deaths and manifold tribulations which he suffered from the Jews and from the heathen. Even then he saw himself as only making a beginning. He was of the opinion not merely that he had not yet attained to purity of soul but that he would not even number himself among the disciples of Christ, as was fitting.
