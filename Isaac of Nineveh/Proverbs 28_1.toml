[The righteous] will fear none of the things here enumerated, as it is written, “The righteous man is bold as a lion,” daring all things through faith, not as one who tempts the Lord but as one who has confidence in Him, and as one who is armed and arrayed in the power of the Holy Spirit. And because God is his constant concern, God will also say concerning him, “I am with him in affliction, and I will rescue him, and glorify him.”
