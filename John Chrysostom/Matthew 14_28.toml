What then says Peter, everywhere ardent, and ever starting forward before the rest?

He said not, Pray and entreat, but, bid. Do you see how great his ardor, how great his faith? Yet surely he is hereby often in danger, by seeking things beyond his measure. For so here too he required an exceedingly great thing, for love only, not for display. For neither did he say, Bid me walk on the water, but what? Bid me come unto You. For none so loved Jesus.

This he did also after the resurrection; he endured not to come with the others, but leapt forward. John 21:7 And not love only, but faith also does he display. For he not only believed that He was able Himself to walk on the sea, but that He could lead upon it others also; and he longs to be quickly near Him.
