To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good. All these spring from love. They become good, and keepers at home, from affection to their husbands.

Obedient to their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.
She who despises her husband, neglects also her house; but from love springs great soberness, and all contention is done away. And if he be a Heathen, he will soon be persuaded; and if he be a Christian, he will become a better man. Do you see the condescension of Paul? He who in everything would withdraw us from worldly concerns, here bestows his consideration upon domestic affairs. For when these are well conducted, there will be room for spiritual things, but otherwise, they too will be marred. For she who keeps at home will be also sober, she that keeps at home will be also a prudent manager, she will have no inclination for luxury, unseasonable expenses, and other such things.

That the word of God, he says, be not blasphemed.
See how his first concern is for the preaching of the word, not for worldly things; for when he writes to Timothy, he says, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty 1 Timothy 2:2; and here, that the word of God, and the doctrine, be not blasphemed. For if it should happen that a believing woman, married to an unbeliever, should not be virtuous, the blasphemy is usually carried on to God; but if she be of good character, the Gospel obtains glory from her, and from her virtuous actions. Let those women hearken who are united to wicked men or unbelievers; let them hear, and learn to lead them to godliness by their own example. For if you gain nothing else, and do not attract your husband to embrace right doctrines, yet you have stopped his mouth, and dost not allow him to blaspheme Christianity; and this is no mean thing, but great indeed, that the doctrine should be admired through our conversation.
