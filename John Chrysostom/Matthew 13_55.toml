How then, one may say, are James and the others called His brethren? In the same kind of way as Joseph himself was supposed to be husband of Mary. For many were the veils provided, that the birth, being such as it was, might be for a time screened. Wherefore even John so called them, saying, "For neither did His brethren believe in Him."

He is moreover continually frequenting the synagogues, lest if He were always abiding in the wilderness, they should the more accuse Him as making a schism, and fighting against their polity. Being amazed therefore, and in perplexity, they said, Whence has this man this wisdom, and these powers? either calling the miracles powers, or even the wisdom itself. Is not this the carpenter's son? Matthew 13:55 The greater then the marvel, and the more abundant the ground of amaze.
