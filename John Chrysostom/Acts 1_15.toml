“Men, brothers,” says Peter. If even the Lord called them brothers, all the more should Peter when they were all present. What dignity of church, what angelic condition! There was no distinction then, neither male nor female. I wish the churches were like that now. No one had his mind full of worldly matter; no one was anxiously thinking about household concerns. In this way even temptations may become a benefit and afflictions an advantage.
