And do you say, How is it possible for one that is human not to mourn?… Do not say then, “he is perished and shall no more be”; for these are the words of unbelievers; but say, “He sleeps and will rise again,” [or] “He is gone a journey and will return with the King.” Who speaks like this? He that has Christ speaking in him. “For,” Paul says, “if we believe that Jesus died and rose again,” and revived, “even so God will bring with him those also who sleep in Jesus.” If then you seek your son, seek him where the King is, where the army of the angels is; not in the grave; not in the earth; lest while he is so highly exalted, you yourself remain groveling on the ground.
