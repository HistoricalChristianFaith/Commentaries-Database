He calls them while actually working at their employment, to show that to follow Him ought to be preferred to all occupations. They were just then casting a net into the sea, which agreed with their future office.

It is no small sign of goodness, to bear poverty easily, to live by honest labour, to be bound together by virtue of affection, to keep their poor father with them, and to toil in his service.

He made no promise to them when He called them, as He had to the former, for the obedience of the first had made the way plain for them. Besides, they had heard many things concerning Him, as being friends and townsmen of the others.
