See how he takes away all of their excuses: … You maintain that you believe in Moses in what you dare to do against me, he says. I, on the contrary, show that this is the worst kind of misbelief in Moses you can think of. I am so far from opposing that law that he who shall accuse you is none other than the man who gave you the law. In other words, he says now of Moses what he had said of the Scriptures above, “In them you think you have eternal life.” And so here he speaks of Moses as someone “in whom you trust.” Jesus is always answering them from their own authorities.
