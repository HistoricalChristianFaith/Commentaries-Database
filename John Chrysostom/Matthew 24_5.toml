Luke speaks of one enquiry, that concerning Jerusalem, as though the disciples supposed that Christâ€™s coming should be then, and the end of the world should be when Jerusalem should be destroyed. Whereas Mark does not state them all to have asked concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, but Peter, James, John, and Andrew, as having more bold and free speech with Christ.
