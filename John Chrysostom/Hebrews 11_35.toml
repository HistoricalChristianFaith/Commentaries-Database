"Women received their dead raised to life again." [Hebrews 11:35] He here speaks of what occurred in regard to the prophets, Elisha, [and] Elijah; for they raised the dead.

5. [Hebrews 11:35] "And others were tortured,  not accepting deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection." But we have not obtained a Resurrection. I am able however, he means, to show that they also were cut off, and did "not accept [deliverance], that they might obtain a better resurrection." For why, tell me, when it was open to them to live, did they not choose it? Were they not evidently looking for a better life? And they who had raised up others, themselves chose to die; in order "to obtain a better resurrection," not such as the children of those women.

Here I think he alludes both to John and to James. For beheading is called "torturing."  It was in their power still to behold the sun. It was in their power to abstain from reproving  [sinners], and yet they chose to die; even they who had raised others chose to die themselves, "that they might obtain a better resurrection."
