And what will be said, if instructing others, someone neglects his own family, though he has greater capacities and a higher obligation to benefit those near? Will it not be said: “Aha! These ‘Christians’ are affectionate indeed, who neglect their own relatives!” “He is worse than an infidel.” So what? One who does not benefit those far away benefits even less those nearer. What is meant is this: The law of God and of nature is violated by him who does not provide for his own family.
