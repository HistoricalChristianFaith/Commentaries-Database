But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.

But when he continued knocking, and when they had opened, and saw him, they were astonished. But he beckoning to them with his hand made them keep quiet, to hear all that had happened to him. He was now an object of more affectionate desire to the disciples, not only in consequence of his being saved, but by his sudden coming in upon them and straightway departing. Now, both his friends learn all clearly; and the aliens also learn, if they had a mind, but they had not. The same thing happened in the case of Christ. "Tell these things," he says, "to James, and to the brethren." How free from all vainglory! Nor did he say, Make known these things to people everywhere, but, "to the brethren. And he withdrew to another place:" for he did not tempt God, nor fling himself into temptation: since, when they were commanded to do this, then they did it. "Go," it was said, "speak in the temple to the people." But this the Angel said not here; on the contrary, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him free permission to withdraw - and this too is done, that we may learn that many things are providentially brought about after the manner of men - so that he should not again fall into peril.

And he said, Tell James and the brethren. That they may rejoice: that they may not be anxious. Through these those learn, not those through him: such thought had he for the humbler part!

For that they may not say, "It was his Angel," after he was gone, they say this first, and then they see himself overthrowing their notion of the matter. Had it been the Angel, he would have knocked at the door, would not have retired to another place. And what followed in the day, make them sure.
