They did not mean that our Lord was going to the Gentiles for their harm but rather to teach them. Their anger had subsided, and they believed what he had said. Otherwise, they would not have thought of asking each other what the saying was, [i.e., “You shall seek me, and shall not find me” and “Where I am, you cannot come.”]
