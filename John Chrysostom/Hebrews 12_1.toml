3. [Hebrews 12:1] "Wherefore" (he says) "we also being compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses." In many places the Scripture derives its consolation in evils from corresponding things. As when the prophet says, "From burning heat, and from storm, and rain." [Isaiah 4:6] This at least he says here also, that the memory of those holy men, reestablishes and recovers the soul which had been weighed down by woes, as a cloud does him who is burnt by the too hot rays [of the sun.]

And he did not say, "lifted on high above us," but, "compassing us about," which was more than the other; so that we are in greater security.

What sort of "cloud"? "A load of witnesses."  With good reason he calls not those in the New [Testament] only, but those in the Old also, "witnesses" [or "martyrs"]. For they also were witnesses to the greatness of God, as for instance, the Three Children, those with Elijah, all the prophets.

"Laying aside all things." "All": what? That is, slumber, indifference, mean reasonings, all human things.

"And the sin which does [so] easily beset us"; εὐπερίστατον], that is either, "which easily circumvents us," or "what can easily be circumvented,"  but rather this latter. For it is easy, if we will, to overcome sin.

"Let us run with patience" (he says) "the race that is set before us." He did not say, Let us contend as boxers, nor, Let us wrestle, nor, Let us do battle: but, what was lightest of all, the [contest] of the foot-race, this has he brought forward. Nor yet did he say, Let us add to the length of the course; but, Let us continue patiently in this, let us not faint. "Let us run" (he says) "the race that is set before us."

4. In the next place as the sum and substance of his exhortation, which he puts both first and last, even Christ. [Hebrews 12:2] "Looking" (he says) "unto Jesus the Author and Finisher of our Faith"; The very thing which Christ Himself also continually said to His disciples, "If they have called the Master of the house  Beelzebub, how much more them of His household?" [Matthew 10:25] And again, "The disciple is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord." [Matthew 10:24]
