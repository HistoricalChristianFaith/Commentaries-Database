And he does not say, Behold your well doing, behold your labors, but, "Behold the goodness of God" toward man, to show that the whole comes of grace from above, and to make us tremble. For this reason for boasting should make you to fear: since the Lord (δεσπότης]) has been good unto you, do thou therefore fear. For the blessings do not abide by you unmovable if you turn listless, as neither do the evils with them, if they alter; "For thou also," he says, "unless thou continue in the faith, will be cut off."
