7. "For such an High Priest also  became us, who is holy, harmless, unde  filed, separate from the sinners." You see that the whole is said with reference to the manhood. (But when I say 'the manhood,' I mean [the manhood] having Godhead; not dividing [one from the other], but leaving [you] to suppose  what is suitable.) Did you mark the difference of the High Priest? He has summed up what was said before, "in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin." [Hebrews 4:15] "For" (he says) "such an High Priest also became us, who is holy, harmless." "Harmless": what is it? Without wickedness: that which another  Prophet says: "guile was not found in His mouth" [Isaiah 53:9], that is, [He is] not crafty. Could any one say this concerning God? And is one not ashamed to say that God is not crafty, nor deceitful? Concerning Him, however, in respect of the Flesh, it might be reasonable [to say it]. "Holy, undefiled." This too would any one say concerning God? For has He a nature capable of defilement? "Separate from sinners."
