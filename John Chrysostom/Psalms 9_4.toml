He speaks in rather human terms by mentioning throne and seat, whereas the phrase “giving right judgment” is customary with God and expresses something remarkable of his essence. I mean, it is not something you can say in connection with human beings. They do not consistently give right judgments, you see, even if they are righteous over and over, ignorant as they are of what is righteous, sometimes from incompetence, sometimes from laziness. God, on the contrary, is free of all these impediments; knowing and willing a righteous verdict, he delivers it. So the phrase “you have sat on your throne” means God has judged, prosecuted, taken vengeance.
