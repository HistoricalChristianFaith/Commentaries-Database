These things, He says, I have spoken to show that it becomes not you, being murderers, to call God your Father; so that I have spoken them through honor for Him, and for His sake do I hear these reproaches, and for His sake do ye dishonor Me. Yet I care not for this insolence ; to Him, for whose sake I now hear these things, you owe an account of your words. For 'I seek not My own glory.' Wherefore I omit to punish you, and betake Myself to exhortation, and counsel you so to act, that you shall not only escape punishment, but also attain eternal life.

I have said these things to you, he says, to show that you murderers should not be allowed to call God your Father. And so, I have spoken these words to honor the Father, and it is for his sake that I bear these reproaches and that you dishonor me. And yet, I am not concerned about your abuse, for you are accountable to him.
