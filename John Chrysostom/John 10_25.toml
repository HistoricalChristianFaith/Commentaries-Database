2. A remark which the more tolerable among them continually made to one another; A man that is a sinner cannot  do such miracles. And again, A devil cannot open the eyes of the blind: and, No man can do such miracles except God be with him. John 3:2 And beholding the miracles that He did, they said, Is not this the Christ? Others said, When Christ comes, will He do greater miracles than those which this Man has done? John 7:31 And these very persons as many as then desired to believe in Him, saying, What sign do you show us, that we may see, and believe you? John 6:30 When then they who had not been persuaded by such great works, pretended that they should be persuaded by a bare word, He rebukes their wickedness, saying, If you believe not My works, how will you believe My words? So that your questioning is superfluous.
