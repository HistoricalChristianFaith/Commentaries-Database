And he, who, when he saw his Master laid hands on, drew his sword and cut off the ear, now when he sees Him enduring such insults becomes a denier, and cannot withstand the taunts of a mean servant girl. A damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

But not once, but twice and thrice did he deny within a short time.

To show that the sound did not keep him from denial, nor bring his promise to mind.

Oh strange and wonderful acts! When indeed he saw his master seized, Peter was so fervent as both to draw his sword and to cut off the man’s ear! But when it was natural for him to be more indignant and to be inflamed and to burn, hearing such revilings, then he became a denier. For who would not have been inflamed to indignation by the things that were then done? Yet the great disciple, overcome by fears, so far from showing indignation, even denies and cannot even stand the threat of a tiny and lowly servant girl.This happens not only once but a second and third time. He denies the Lord. In a short period and even before judges, he denies him. For it was “when he went out to the porch” that they asked him whether he was the man who “was with Jesus of Nazareth.” And he was not even aware of his own lying. Luke says that Christ looked upon him, and this made it clear that he had denied him and was not even aware of how far he had fallen into forgetfulness. This happened even though the cock had crowed. He needed a further remembrance from his Master. Jesus’ look was greater than any voice. Peter was so full of fear. Mark says that when he had once denied the Lord, then first the cock crowed, but then it did so for a second time and a third time. He shows us more particularly the weakness of the disciple, that he was utterly dead with fear. Mark had learned these things from the eyewitnesses, for he himself was a follower of Peter. One marvels at Mark in that, so far from hiding his teacher’s faults, he declared them more distinctly than the rest. On this very account he was a true disciple.
Why does Matthew affirm that “Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, ‘Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times,’ ” while Mark declares after the third denial that “the cock crew the second time”? Both are in harmony. At each crowing the cock is inclined to crow both a third and a fourth time. Mark showed that not even the sound of the rooster checked him and brought him to recollection. So that both things are true. For before the cock had finished the one crowing, Peter had denied a third time. And not even when reminded of his sin by Christ did he dare to weep openly, lest he should be betrayed by his tears. Then “he went out and wept bitterly.”
