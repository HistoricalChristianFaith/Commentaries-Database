And he, who, when he saw his Master laid hands on, drew his sword and cut off the ear, now when he sees Him enduring such insults becomes a denier, and cannot withstand the taunts of a mean servant girl. A damsel came unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.

But not once, but twice and thrice did he deny within a short time.

To show that the sound did not keep him from denial, nor bring his promise to mind.
