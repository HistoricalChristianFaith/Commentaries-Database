And he foretells two things; both that they must be cast upon an island, and that though the ship would be lost, those who were in it should be saved— which thing he spoke not of conjecture, but of prophecy— and that he must be brought before Cæsar. But this that he says, God has given you all, is not spoken boastfully, but in the wish to win those who were sailing in the ship: for (he spoke thus), not that they might feel themselves bound to him, but that they might believe what he was saying. God has given you; as much (as to say), They are worthy indeed of death, since they would not listen to you: however, this is done out of favor to you. But when the fourteenth night had come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the shipmen deemed that they drew near to some country; and sounded, and found it twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found it fifteen fathoms. Then fearing lest they should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day. And as the shipmen were about to flee out of the ship, when they had let down the boat into the sea, under color as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship, Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, you cannot be saved. Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
