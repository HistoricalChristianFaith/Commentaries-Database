In good season again does He speak of the passion, when He had reminded them of the kingdom, and of the recompense there, and of the deathless punishment; as though He had said, Why are you afraid at the dangers that are for a season, when such good things await you?

When he had reminded them of the kingdom, he spoke again of the season of his suffering and of final judgment. It was as though he had said, “Why are you afraid of the dangers that are only for a season when such good things await you?” Notice how he has thrown into the shade what was most painful to them. For he does not say, “You know that after two days I am betrayed,” but “You know that after two days is the Passover feast,” to show that what is done is a mystery. A feast and celebration is being kept for the salvation of the world. With foreknowledge he is prepared to suffer all. So then, as though this were sufficient consolation for them, he did not even say anything to them now about a resurrection. He had already spoken about it, and did not need to speak about it again. And moreover, as I said, he shows that even his suffering itself is a deliverance from countless evils, having by the Passover reminded them of the ancient benefits received in Egypt. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily
