"For as the woman is of the man, so is the man also by the woman."

He said not, "of the woman," but he repeats the expression, [from 1 Corinthians 11:7] "of the man." For still this particular prerogative remains entire with the man. Yet are not these excellencies the property of the man, but of God. Wherefore also he adds, "but all things of God." If therefore all things belong to God, and he commands these things, do thou obey and gainsay not.
