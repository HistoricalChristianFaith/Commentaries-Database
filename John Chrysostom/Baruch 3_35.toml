It is ordained that not only we human beings but also the angels, the archangels, the celestial nations and all we who are on earth give praise. “Bless the Lord,” it says, “all you works of his.” His good works are no small achievement; rather, they exceed all speech, intellect and human understanding. The prophets announce these things every day, each in various ways publishing this splendid triumph. One says, “You have gone up on high, you have led captivity captive, and you have received gifts among people.” And, “The Lord strong and powerful in battle.” And another says, “He will divide the spoils of the strong.” For this is why he came, in order to announce freedom to the prisoners and the recovery of sight to the blind. And raising aloud the cry of victory against over death, he said, “Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O grave, is your sting?” And another, in its turn, announcing good news of the most profound peace, said, “They will forge their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks.” And while one invokes Jerusalem, saying, “Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion, because your king comes to you, meek, riding on a beast of burden, a young colt,” another proclaims his second coming, thus saying, “The Lord, whom you seek, will come, and who will abide the day of his coming? Leap as calves set free from their bonds.” And another again, amazed at such similar events, said, “This is our God; no other will be compared with him.”
