"But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean." This was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, "I have never eaten": not being himself afraid - far be the thought from us - but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived by the Providence of God.

Wherefore did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, "Not so, Lord," etc. not gainsaying - just as to Philip also He said, "How many loaves have ye?" Not to learn, but tempting, or "proving him."
