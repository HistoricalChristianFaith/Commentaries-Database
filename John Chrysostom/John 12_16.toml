But observe the wisdom of the Evangelist, how he is not ashamed to parade the disciplesâ€™ former ignorance. He writes how they were ignorant of what was happening. For it would have offended them if, as a king, they found out that he was about to suffer such things and be betrayed like he was. Besides, they could not have immediately absorbed the knowledge of the kingdom of which he spoke. For another Evangelist says that they thought the words were spoken of a kingdom of this world.
