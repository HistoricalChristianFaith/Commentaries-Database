"And after that many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him." The Jews again resort to that valid argument of theirs, not now seeking false-accusers and false-witnesses; they cannot wait for these now: but what do they? They set about it by themselves. For as they see the affair on the increase, they do not even use the form of a trial.

Therefore "after many days" this happens: viz. the Jews "took counsel to kill him. And their laying await was known of Saul." What does this mean? It is likely that for awhile he did not choose to depart thence, though many, perhaps, besought him; but when he learnt it, then he permitted his disciples: for he had disciples immediately.
