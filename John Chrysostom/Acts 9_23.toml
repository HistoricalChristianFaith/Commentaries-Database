The Jews again resort to that valid argument (ἰ σχυρὸν συλλογισμόν) of theirs, not now seeking false-accusers and false-witnesses; they cannot wait for these now: but what do they? They set about it by themselves. For as they see the affair on the increase, they do not even use the form of a trial. But their laying await was known of Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
