See how great is the wisdom of the Baptist in his preaching? Note how he states his case without compromise, unafraid of alarming his hearers and filling them with anxiety. Yet his very next words are mild, speaking of that which is apt to make them recover. He does not dwell on the axe alone or the tree that is cut down, burned and thrown into the fire, or the wrath to come, but also speaks of the remission of sins, the removal of punishment, righteousness, sanctification, redemption, adoption and community, a partaking of the inheritance and an abundant supply of the Holy Spirit. For to all these remedies John implicitly pointed when he said, “He shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” At once, by this very figure of speech, John witnessed to the abundance of grace. He did not say “He will give you the Holy Spirit” but “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” Then to specify the volatile and uncontrollable quality of divine grace he adds, “and with fire.”
