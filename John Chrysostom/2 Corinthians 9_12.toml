What he says is this; 'in the first place ye not only supply the wants of the saints, but you are abundant even;' that is, 'ye furnish them with even more than they need: next, through them ye send up thanksgiving to God, for they glorify Him for the obedience of your confession.' For that he may not represent them as giving thanks on this account solely, (I mean, because they received somewhat,) see how high-minded he makes them, exactly as he himself says to the Philippians, Not that I desire a gift. Philippians 4:17 'To them too I bear record of the same thing. For they rejoice indeed that you supply their wants and alleviate their poverty; but far more, in that you are so subjected to the Gospel; whereof this is an evidence, your contributing so largely.' For this the Gospel enjoins.

And for the liberality of your contribution unto them and unto all. 'And on this account,' he says, 'they glorify God that you are so liberal, not unto them only, but also unto all.'

'For,' says he, 'they do honor , not to their own concerns only, but also to those of others, and this although they are in the extremest poverty; which is an evidence of their great virtue. For nothing is so full of envy as the whole race of such as are in poverty. But they are pure from this passion; being so far from feeling pained because of the things ye impart to others, that they even rejoice over it no less than over the things themselves receive.'

For they long after this, not for the money's sake, but that they may be witnesses of the grace that has been bestowed upon you.' Do you see Paul's wisdom, how after having exalted them, he ascribed the whole to God by calling the thing grace? For seeing he had spoken great things of them, in that he called them ministers and exalted them unto a great height, (since they offered service while he himself did but administer ,) and termed them 'proved ,' he shows that God was the Author of all these things. And he himself again, along with them, sends up thanksgiving,
