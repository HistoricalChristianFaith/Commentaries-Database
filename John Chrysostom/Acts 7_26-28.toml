"And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?" Do you mark with what mildness he addresses them? He who had shown his wrath in the case of the other, shows his gentleness in his own case. "But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us? Wilt thou kill me, as thou didst the Egyptian yesterday?" Mark; the very words which they said to Christ: "Who made Thee ruler and judge over us?" So habitual a thing was it for Jews to wrong their benefactors when in the act of receiving benefits! And again, mark the atrocious baseness: "As thou didst the Egyptian yesterday!"
