What he means by “walk by the Spirit” is “let us be content in the power of the Spirit, and let us not seek to augment it with the law.” Then, having shown that those who introduce circumcision are doing this through ambitious motives, he says, “Let us not become proud, which is the cause of evils, calling one another out to factiousness and strife, in jealousy of one another.
