Do not thou on any account suppose, He says, that I order your matters after a single rule. And this He did to withdraw them from  their unseasonable sympathy for each other; for since they were about to receive the charge of the world, it was necessary that they should no longer be closely associated together; for assuredly this would have been a great loss to the world. Wherefore He says unto him, You have had a work entrusted to you, look to it, accomplish it, labor and struggle. What if I will that he tarry here? Look thou to and care for your own matters. And observe, I pray you, here also the absence of pride in the Evangelist; for having mentioned the opinion of the disciples, he corrects it, as though they had not comprehended what Jesus meant. Jesus  said not, he tells us, that 'he shall not die, but, If I will that he tarry.'
