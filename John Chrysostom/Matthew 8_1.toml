When Jesus came down from the mountain, a leper came to him and said, “Lord, if you will, you can make me clean.” How respectful was the understanding and faith of the leper in drawing near. For he did not interrupt the teaching or break into the gathering. He waited for the proper time and approached him only after “he came down.”
