Earlier he had said, “Where I go you shall come” and “In my Father’s house there are many mansions.” But since this was a long time off, he gives them the Spirit in the intervening time. They did not know what that [Spirit] was, however, and so they derived little comfort from what he said.… And so he promises them what they required most: his own presence. He says, “I will come to you.” But he intimates at the same time that they are not to look for the same kind of presence all over again. “Yet a little while, and the world sees me no more,” as if he said, I will come to you but not to live with you every day as I did before.
