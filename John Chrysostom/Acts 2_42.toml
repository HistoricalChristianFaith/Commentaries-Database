And they continued” it is written, “steadfastly in the doctrine” (or, “teaching”) “of the Apostles” for it was not for one day, no nor for two or three days that they were under teaching as being persons who had gone over to a different course of life. [“And they continued with one accord in the Apostles’ doctrine,” etc.] The expression is not, ὁμοὕ “together,” but ὁμοθυμαδὸν, “with one accord;” (“and daily,” he says [afterwards], “they were continuing with one accord in the temple,”) i.e. with one soul. And here again in his conciseness, he does not relate the teaching given; for as young children, the Apostles nourished them with spiritual food.
