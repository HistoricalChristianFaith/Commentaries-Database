"This is the stone," he says, "which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner." He reminds them also of a saying which was enough to frighten them. For it had been said, "Whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder."

"This," says he, "is the Stone which was set at naught by you builders;" and then he goes on to teach them, saying in addition, "Which is made the head of the corner"; that is to say, that the Stone is indeed approved! Great was the boldness they now had, in consequence of the miracle.
