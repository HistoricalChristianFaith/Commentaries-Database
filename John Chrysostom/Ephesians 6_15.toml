This war against the demonic puts an end to the previous war against God. As we are making war with the devil, we are making peace with God. Have no fear, beloved, the victory is already won. This is the good news. .

And having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace. It is more uncertain in what sense this was said. What then is its meaning? They are noble greaves, doubtless, with which he invests us. Either then he means this, that we should be prepared for the gospel, and should make use of our feet for this, and should prepare and make ready its way before it; or if not this, at least that we ourselves should be prepared for our departure. The preparation, then, of the gospel of peace, is nothing else than a most virtuous life; according to what the Prophet says. You will prepare their heart, you will cause your ear to hear. Psalm 10:17 Of the gospel, he says, of peace, and with reason; for inasmuch as he had made mention of warfare and fighting, he shows us that this conflict with the evil spirits we must needs have: for the gospel is the gospel of peace; this war which we have against them, puts an end to another war, that, namely, which is between us and God; if we are at war with the devil, we are at peace with God. Fear not therefore, beloved; it is a gospel, that is, a word of good news; already is the victory won.
