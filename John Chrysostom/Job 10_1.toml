But he also said above, “God would not hearken to him, so that he should answer to one of his charges or of a thousand.” How can Job speak so here? “In the bitterness of my soul,” he says. Therefore it is not him who speaks but his bitterness, insofar as the reflections of Job allow us to express what he means. “Would that one were present who should hear the cause between both” not in order to examine his life in detail and to show that he is unjustly suffering. He does not say that actually, as in the previous passages. He has often said that it is “because of his iniquity.” He wants to demonstrate that the persisting oppression overwhelms him. And this is what Isaiah says, “You became angry, and we, we are distraught,” and in another passage, “Why did you lead us astray from your path?” “I fear, [Job] says, lest I fall or capsize; I am afraid to be forced, one day, to blaspheme or to commit suicide.” - "Commentary on Job 9.32b–10.1"
