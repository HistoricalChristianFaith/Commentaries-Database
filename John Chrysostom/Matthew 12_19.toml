The prophet celebrated in advance both the Savior’s meekness right alongside his unspeakable power. Thereby he opened to the Gentiles a great and effective door. Isaiah also foretold the ills that were to overtake the Jews. He foreknew the Son’s oneness with the Father: “Israel is my chosen, my soul has accepted him; I have put my Spirit upon him.” For it is not as an adversary that Christ transcends the law, as if he were an enemy of the Lawgiver, but as though he were of one mind with the Lawgiver and held to the very same purposes. Then, proclaiming the Lord’s meekness, Isaiah said, “He shall not cry nor lift up his voice.” For his desire indeed was to enable healing in their presence. But since they pushed him away, he did not contend any further against their opposition. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

Then proclaiming His meekness, he says, He shall not strive nor cry. For His desire indeed was to heal in their presence; but since they thrust Him away, not even against this did He contend.
