"And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews." Again they entered into the synagogues. See how far they were from becoming more timid! Having said, "We turn unto the Gentiles," nevertheless by going into the synagogues they superabundantly fortify their own justification with their Jewish brethren. "So that," it says, "a great multitude both of Jews and Greeks believed." For it is likely they discoursed as to Greeks also.
