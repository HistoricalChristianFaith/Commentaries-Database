since you have not used it as it ought to be used. These are not words of imprecation, but of chastisement. To you, he says, be it (to you): being such. As if one should say, Let it perish along with your purpose. Have you so mean conceptions of the gift of God, that you have imagined it to be altogether a thing of man? It is not this. (a) Wherefore also Peter well calls the affair a gift: You have thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money. Do you observe how on all occasions they are clean from money? For your heart is not right in the sight of God.

Why had not these received the Holy Ghost, when baptized? Either because Philip kept this honor for the Apostles; or, because he had not this gift (to impart); or, he was one of the Seven: which is rather to be said. Whence, I take it, this Philip was one of the Apostles. But observe; those went not forth: it was Providentially ordered that these should go forth and those be lacking, because of the Holy Ghost: for they had received power to work miracles, but not also to impart the Spirit to others: this was the prerogative of the Apostles. And observe (how they sent) the chief ones: not any others, but Peter [and John ]. And when Simon, it says, saw that through laying on of the Apostles' hands the Holy Ghost was given. He would not have said, And having seen, unless there had been some sensible manifestation. Then laid they their hands on them, etc. Just as Paul also did, when they spoke with tongues. Acts 19:6 Observe the execrable conduct of Simon. He offered money, with what object? And yet he did not see Peter doing this for money. And it was not of ignorance that he acted thus; it was because he would tempt them, because he wished to get matter of accusation against them. And therefore also Peter says, You have no part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God because you have thought, etc.

Your money with you to perdition Acts 8:20: since you have not used it as it ought to be used. These are not words of imprecation, but of chastisement. To you, he says, be it (to you): being such. As if one should say, Let it perish along with your purpose. Have you so mean conceptions of the gift of God, that you have imagined it to be altogether a thing of man? It is not this.
