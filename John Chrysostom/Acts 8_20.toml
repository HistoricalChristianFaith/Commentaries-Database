Therefore Peter does well to call it a gift. “You thought,” he says, “you could obtain the gift of God with money.” Do you see how they are always free from money? “For your heart,” he says, “is not right before God.” Do you see how Simon does everything out of malice? In fact, simplicity was the thing needed.… For if it had been done with simplicity, they would even have accepted his eagerness. Do you see how having mean conceptions of great things is to sin doubly? Two things, accordingly, he urges him to do, “Repent and pray that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.”
