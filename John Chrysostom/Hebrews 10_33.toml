Then he also enumerates them particularly, amplifying his discourse, and multiplying his praise. How? Partly (he says) while you were made a gazing-stock by reproaches and afflictions; for reproach is a great thing, and calculated to pervert the soul, and to darken the judgment. For hear what the prophet says: While they daily say unto me, Where is your God? Psalm 42:10 And again, If the enemy had reproached me, I would have borne it. Psalm 55:12 For since the human race is exceedingly vainglorious, therefore it is easily overcome by this.

And he did not simply say by reproaches, but that even with great intensity, being made a gazing-stock. For when a person is reproached alone, it is indeed painful, but far more so when in presence of all. For tell me how great the evil was when men who had left the meanness of Judaism, and gone over, as it were, to the best course of life, and despised the customs of their fathers, were ill treated by their own people, and had no help.

I cannot say (he says) that you suffered these things indeed and were grieved, but you even rejoiced exceedingly. And this he expressed by saying, Whilst ye became companions of them that were so used, and he brings forward the Apostles themselves. Not only (he means) were ye not ashamed of your own sufferings, but you even shared with others who were suffering the same things. This too is the language of one who is encouraging them. He said not, 'Bear my afflictions, share with me,' but respect your own.
