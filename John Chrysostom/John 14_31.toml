1. ' Ignorance' makes the soul timid and unmanly, just as instruction in heavenly doctrines makes it great and sublime. For when it has enjoyed no care, it is in a manner timid, not by nature but by will.  For when I see the man who once was brave,  now become a coward, I say that this latter feeling no longer belongs to nature, for what is natural is immutable. Again, when I see those who but now were cowards all at once become daring, I pass the same judgment, and refer all to will. Since even the disciples were very fearful, before they had learned what they ought, and had been deemed worthy of the gift of the Spirit; yet afterwards they became bolder than lions. So Peter, who could not bear the threat of a damsel, was hung with his head downwards, and was scourged, and though he endured ten thousand dangers, would not be silent, but enduring what he endured as though it were a dream, in such a situation spoke boldly; but not so before the Crucifixion. Wherefore Christ said, Arise, let us go hence. But why, tell me? Did he not know the hour at which Judas would come upon Him? Or perhaps He feared lest he should come and seize them, and lest the plotters should be upon him before he had furnished his most excellent teaching. Away with the thought! These things are far from His dignity. If then He did not fear, why did He remove them, and then after finish  ing His discourse lead them into a garden known to Judas? And even had Judas come, could He not have blinded their eyes, as He also did when the traitor was not present?  Why did He remove them? He allows the disciples a little breathing time. For it was likely that they, as being in a conspicuous place, would tremble and fear, both on the account of the time and the place, (for it was the depth of night,) and would not give  heed to His words, but would be continually turning about, and imagining that they heard those who were to set upon them; and that more especially when their Master's speech made them expect evil. For, yet a little while, He says, and I am not with you, and, the ruler of this world comes. Since now when they heard these and the like words they were troubled, as though they should certainly be taken immediately, He leads them to another place, in order that thinking themselves in safety, they might listen to Him without fear. For they were about to hear lofty doctrines. Therefore He says, Arise, let us go hence. Then He adds, and says,  I am the Vine, you are the branches. What wills He to imply by the comparison? That the man who gives no heed to His words can have no life, and that the miracles about to take place, would be wrought by the power of Christ. My Father is the Husbandman. How then? Does the Son need a power  working within? Away with the thought! This example does not signify this. Observe with what exactness He goes through the comparison. He says not that the root enjoys the care of the Husbandman, but, the branches. And the foot is brought in in this place for no other purpose, but that they may learn that they can work nothing without His power, and that they ought to be united with Him by faith as the branch with the vine.

For they who now trembled and feared, after they had received the Spirit sprang into the midst of dangers and stripped themselves for the contest against steel, and fire, and wild beasts, and seas, and every kind of punishment. And they, the unlettered and ignorant, spoke so boldly as to astonish their hearers. For the Spirit made them men of iron instead of men of clay, gave them wings and allowed them to be cast down by nothing human. For such is that grace: if it finds despondency, it disperses it; if evil desires, it consumes them; if cowardice, it casts it out and does not allow one who has partaken of it to be afterward a mere person but, as it were removing him to heaven itself, causes him to imagine to himself all that is there.
