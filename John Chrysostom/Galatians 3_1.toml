Having established himself as a trustworthy teacher, he speaks from now on with greater personal authority, drawing a comparison between the law and faith. Earlier he had said: “I am amazed that you have so quickly departed.” Now he says: “O foolish Galatians.” Then he was pregnant with indignation. Now, having made his defense of what pertained to him, he lets it burst into the open and brings it forth afterward for demonstration. And if he calls them fools, do not be surprised. In doing this, he does not transgress Christ’s law, which forbids one to call his brother a fool, but rather is protecting them. For who could have more justly deserved this term, when after so many great things they held to the former ways as though nothing had happened?

Since Christ was crucified not in the Galatians’ territory but in Jerusalem, what does he mean by this phrase “before whose eyes?” He is illustrating the power of faith, which is able to see even things far off. And he said not “crucified” but “portrayed as crucified,” showing that with the eyes of faith they saw more accurately than those who were there and witnessed the events.… And he says this both to reprimand and to commend them. He commends them for having received the facts with such enthusiasm. He blames them because, having seen Christ stripped, crucified, nailed, spat on, mocked, drinking vinegar, insulted by thieves, pierced with a spear … they have forsaken this man and run back to the law, showing no awareness of Christ’s sufferings.
