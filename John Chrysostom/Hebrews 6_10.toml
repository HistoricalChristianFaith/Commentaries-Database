"For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and  the love, which you have showed toward His name, in that you have ministered unto the saints and do minister." O how did he here restore their spirit, and give them fresh strength, by reminding them of former things, and bringing them to the necessity of not supposing that God had forgotten. (For he cannot but sin who is not fully assured concerning his hope, and says that God is unrighteous. Accordingly he obliged them by all means to look forward to those future things. For one who despairs of present things, and has given up exerting himself, may be restored by [the prospect of] things future.) As he himself also said in writing to the Galatians, "You did run well" [Galatians 5:7]: and again, "Have ye suffered so many things in vain? If it be yet in vain." [Galatians 3:4]

And as in this place he puts the praise with the reproof, saying, "When for the time ye ought to be teachers" [Hebrews 5:12], so also there, "I marvel that you are so soon removed." [Galatians 1:6] With the reproof is the praise. For respecting great things we marvel, when they fail. You see that praise is concealed under the accusation and the blame. Nor does he say this concerning himself only, but also concerning all. For he said not, I am persuaded, but "we are persuaded better things of you," even good things (he means). He says this either in regard to matters of conduct, or to the recompense. In the next place, having said above, that it is "rejected and near unto a curse," and that it "shall be for burning," he says, we do not by any means speak this of you. "For God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and love." [Hebrews 6:10]
