See how whatever the good man longed for the Lord promises him, and in fact much more. That is to say, in his generosity he exceeds our requests out of fidelity to his characteristic love. “Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt,” he says. Because Jacob dreaded the length of the journey, accordingly he says, “Have no regard for the weakness of your old age—I will make you into a great nation there. I will accompany you and make everything easy for you.” Notice the considerateness of the expression: “I will go down with you to Egypt.” What could be more blessed than to have God as traveling companion? Then he spoke the consoling thought that the old man had particular need of: “Joseph’s hands will close your eyes in death.” That dearly beloved son of yours will personally prepare your body for burial, and his hands will close your eyes in death.So, quite happy and free from all concern, Jacob took to the road. Consider at this point, I ask you, with what cheerfulness the good man makes the journey, being so reassured by God’s promise.
