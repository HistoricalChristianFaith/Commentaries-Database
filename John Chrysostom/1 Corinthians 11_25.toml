Why does Paul mention that the cup is that of the new covenant? Because there was also a cup of the old covenant, which contained the libations and the blood of animals. For after sacrificing, the priests used to catch the blood in a chalice and bowl and then pour it out. But now, instead of the blood of beasts, Christ has introduced his own blood.
