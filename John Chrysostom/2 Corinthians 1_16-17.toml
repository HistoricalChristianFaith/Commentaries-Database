"And by you to pass into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Jud√¶a. When I therefore was thus  minded, did I show fickleness?"

Here in what follows, he directly does away with the charge arising out of his delay and absence. For what he says is of this nature. "I was minded to come unto you." 'Wherefore then did I not come? Is it as light-minded and changeable?' for this is, "did I show fickleness?" By no means. But wherefore? "Because what things I purpose, I purpose not according to the flesh." What is, "not according to the flesh?" I purpose not 'carnally.'
