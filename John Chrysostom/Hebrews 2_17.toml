Wherefore it behooved [Him] in all things to be made like His brethren. What is this, in all things? He was born (he means), was brought up, grew, suffered all things necessary, at last He died. This is, in all things to be made like His brethren. For after he had discoursed much concerning His majesty and the glory on high, he then begins concerning the dispensation. And consider with how great power [he does this]. How he represents Him as having great zeal to be made like us: which was a sign of much care. For having said above, Inasmuch then as the children were partakers of flesh and blood, He also Himself in like manner took part of the same; in this place also he says, in all things to be made like His brethren. Which is all but saying, He that is so great, He that is the brightness of His glory, He that is the express image of His person, He that made the worlds, He that sits on the right hand of the Father, He was willing and earnest to become our brother in all things, and for this cause did He leave the angels and the other powers, and come down to us, and took hold of us, and wrought innumerable good things. He destroyed Death, He cast out the devil from his tyranny, He freed us from bondage: not by brotherhood alone did He honor us, but also in other ways beyond number. For He was willing also to become our High Priest with the Father: for he adds,

That He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things pertaining to God. For this cause (he means) He took on Him our flesh, only for Love to man, that He might have mercy upon us. For neither is there any other cause of the economy, but this alone. For He saw us, cast on the ground, perishing, tyrannized over by Death, and He had compassion on us. To make reconciliation, he says, for the sins of the people. That He might be a merciful and faithful High Priest.

What is faithful? True, able. For the Son is a faithful High Priest, able to deliver from their sins those whose High Priest He is. In order then that He might offer a sacrifice able to purify us, for this cause He has become man.

Accordingly he added, in things pertaining to God,â€” that is, for the sake of things in relation to God. We had become altogether enemies to God, (he would say) condemned, degraded, there was none who should offer sacrifice for us. He saw us in this condition, and had compassion on us, not appointing a High Priest for us, but Himself becoming a High Priest. In what sense He was faithful, he added [viz.], to make reconciliation for the sins of the people.
