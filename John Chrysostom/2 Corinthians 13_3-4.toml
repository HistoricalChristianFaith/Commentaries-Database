Then, as I said, by transferring the argument from himself to Christ, he enhances their fear, he increases his threat. And what he says is this; "for even supposing I should do something and chastise and take vengeance on the guilty ones, is it I that chastise and take vengeance? it is He that dwelleth in me, Christ Himself. But if ye do not believe this, but are desirous of receiving a proof by deeds of Him that dwelleth in me, ye shall know presently; For he is not weak to you-ward, but is even powerful." And wherefore added he "to you-ward," seeing He is mighty everywhere? for should He be minded to punish unbelievers, He is able; or demons, or anything whatsoever. What then is the import of the addition? The expression is either as shaming them exceedingly by remembrance of the proofs they have already received; or else as declaring this, that meanwhile He shows His power in you who ought to be corrected.

As he said also in another place, "For what have I to do to judge them also that are without?" "For those that are without," he says, "He will then call to account in the day of judgment, but you even now, so as to rescue you from that punishment." But nevertheless even this instance of his solicitude, although arising from tender affection, observe how he combines with fear and much anger, saying, "Who to you-ward is not weak, but is powerful in you."
