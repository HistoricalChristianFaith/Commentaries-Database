Ver. 3. "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine."

Before they grow stiffnecked,  preoccupy them all. For this reason he says, "in season, out of season"; do everything, so as to have willing disciples.

"But after their own lusts," he says, "shall they heap to themselves teachers."

Nothing can be more expressive than these words. For by saying "they shall heap to themselves," he shows the indiscriminate multitude of the teachers, as also by their being elected by their disciples. "They shall heap to themselves teachers," he says, "having itching ears." Seeking for such as speak to gratify and delight their hearers.
