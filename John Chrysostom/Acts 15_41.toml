And this also is a work of Providence. For the Cyprians had exhibited nothing of the like sort as they at Antioch and the rest: and those needed the softer character, but these needed such a character as Paul's. Which then, say you, did well? He that took, or he that left? *** (c) For just as a general would not choose to have a low person always to his baggage-bearer, so neither did the Apostle. This corrected the other's, and instructed (Mark) himself. Then did Barnabas ill? say you. And how is it not amiss (ἄ τοπον), that upon so small a matter there should arise so great an evil? In the first place then, no evil did come of it, if, sufficing each for whole nations, they were divided the one from the other, but a great good. And besides, they would not readily have chosen to leave each other. But admire, I pray you, the writer, how he does not conceal this either. But at any rate, say you, if they must needs part, let it be without exasperation. Nay, but if nothing more, observe this, that in this too is shown what was of man (in the preaching of the Gospel). For if the like behooved to be shown (even) in what Christ did, much more here. And besides, the contention cannot be said to be evil, when each disputes for such objects (as here) and with just reason. I grant you, if the exasperation were in seeking his own, and contending for his own honor, this might well be (reproved): but if wishing, both the one and the other, to instruct and teach, the one took this way and the other that, what is there to find fault with? For in many things they acted upon their human judgment; for they were not stocks or stones. And observe how Paul impeaches (Mark), and gives the reason. For of his exceeding humility he reverenced Barnabas, as having been partner with him in so great works, and being with him: but still he did not so reverence him, as to overlook (what was necessary). Now which of them advised best, it is not for us to pronounce: but thus far (we may affirm), that it was a great arrangement of Providence, if these were to be vouchsafed a second visitation, but those were not to be visited even once.

(a) Teaching and preaching the word of the Lord.

Mark the wisdom of Paul: he does not go to other cities before he has visited them which had received the Word. For it is folly to run at random. This let us also do: let us teach the first in the first place, that these may not become an hindrance to them that are to come after.

“And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.” This too is part of the divine plan. For the Cyprians had shown nothing of the kind as was shown by those in Antioch and elsewhere. Those needed the softer character, but these needed such a character as Paul’s.… For just as a general would not choose to always have a lowly baggage carrier, neither did the apostle. This both taught the others and instructed [Mark] himself. Did Barnabas act badly then? Not at all. It is out of place to even think such a thing. For how is it not out of place to say because of such a small thing that he acted badly? Look, in the first place, nothing bad happened if they, each sufficient for entire nations, separated from one another. Rather, a great good took place. Second, if this had not happened, they would not easily have chosen to leave each other. Please appreciate how the writer does not conceal this at all. But if they had to separate, could it not be done without sharp contention? But it is through this especially that he shows what was human [in the preaching of the gospel]. For if this had to happen in the case of Christ, then all the more so here. Besides, the sharp contention was not trivial, since each argued on behalf of such things and with just reason. Had one of them been looking after himself and seeking his own glory, well then! But on the contrary, each wishing to educate and to teach, one went one way and the other another. What is there to find fault with? In many things, indeed, they acted with human judgment; for they were not made of stone or wood.
