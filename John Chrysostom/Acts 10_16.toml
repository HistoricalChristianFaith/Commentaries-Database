What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The man was uncircumcised: and — for he had nothing in common with the Jews— they would all accuse him as a transgressor: you went in to men uncircumcised, and ate with them: Acts 11:3 this was a thing altogether offensive to them: observe then what is providentially managed. He himself also says, I have never eaten: not being himself afraid— far be the thought from us— but it is so contrived by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the Law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are contrived (by the Providence of God).

I said, says he, Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean.— And the voice came unto him, What God has cleansed, that call not thou common. ch. 11:8, with 10:14 It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the whole is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these.

What God has cleansed, says it, call not thou common. Great daring! Wherefore did he object? That none may say that God was proving him, as in the case of Abraham, this is why he says, Not so, Lord, etc. not gainsaying— just as to Philip also He said, How many loaves do you have? Not to learn, but tempting, or proving him. And yet it was the same (Lord) that had discoursed above (in the Law) concerning things clean and unclean. But in that sheet were also all the four-footed beasts of the earth: the clean with the unclean. And for all this, he knew not what it meant. Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there. But while Peter, it says, doubted in himself
