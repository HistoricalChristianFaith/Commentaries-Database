"As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing." For by those that are without, indeed, we are suspected of being in despair; but we give no heed to them; yea, we have our pleasure at the full. And he said not "rejoicing" only, but added also its perpetuity, for he says, "alway rejoicing." What then can come up to this life? wherein, although dangers so great assault, the joy becometh greater. "As poor, yet making many rich." Some indeed affirm that the spiritual riches are spoken of here; but I would say that the carnal are so too; for they were rich in these also, having, after a new kind of manner, the houses of all opened to them.

"As having nothing, and yet possessing all things." And how can this be? Yea rather, how can the opposite be? For he that possesseth many things hath nothing; and he that hath nothing possesseth the goods of all. And not here only, but also in the other points, contraries were to have all things, let us bring forth this man himself into the midst, who commanded the world and was lord not only of their substance, but of their very eyes even. "If possible," he says, "ye would have plucked out your eyes, and have given them to me."

Now these things he says, to instruct us not to be disturbed at the opinions of the many, though they call us deceivers, though they know us not, though they count us condemned, and appointed unto death, to be in sorrow, to be in poverty, to have nothing, to be (us, who are in cheerfulness) desponding: because that the sun even is not clear to the blind, nor the pleasure of the sane intelligible to the mad. For the faithful only are right judges of these matters, and are not pleased and pained at the same things as other people. For if any one who knew nothing of the games were to see a boxer, having wounds upon him and wearing a crown; he would think him in pain on account of the wounds, not understanding the pleasure the crown would give him. And these therefore, because they know what we suffer but do not know for what we suffer them, naturally suspect that there is nought besides these; for they see indeed the wrestling and the dangers, but not the prizes and the crowns and the subject of the contest.

What then were the "all things" which Paul possessed, when he said, "As having nothing, and yet possessing all things?" Things temporal, things spiritual. For he whom the cities received as an angel, for whom they would have plucked out their own eyes and have given them to him, he for whom they laid down their own necks, how had he not all things that were theirs? But if thou desirest to see the spiritual also, thou wilt find him in these things also especially rich. For he that was so dear to the King of all as even to share in unspeakable things with the Lord of the angels, how was not he more opulent than all men, and had all things? Devils had not else been so subject to him, suffering and disease had not so fled away.
