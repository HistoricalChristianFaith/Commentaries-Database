for since they spoke nothing contrary to what had been decreed, nor made any commotion in the city, they bring them under a different charge: saying that there is another king, one Jesus. And they troubled the people, etc.

Oh! What an accusation! Again they get up a charge of treason against them, saying, there is another king (one) Jesus. And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things. And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go. (v. 8, 9.) A man worthy to be admired, that he put himself into danger, and sent them away from it. And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming there went into the synagogue of the Jews. These were more noble, it says, than they of Thessalonica: more noble, i.e. more gentle (ἐ πιεικέστεροι) (in their behavior): in that they received the word with all readiness, and this not inconsiderately, but with a strictness wherein was no passion, searching the Scriptures whether these things were so.
