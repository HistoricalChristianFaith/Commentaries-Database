"For as often as you eat this bread, and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death till He come."

For as Christ in regard to the bread and the cup said, "Do this in remembrance of Me," revealing to us the cause of the giving of the Mystery, and besides what else He said, declaring this to be a sufficient cause to ground our religious fear upon:— (for when you consider what your Master has suffered for you, you will the better deny yourself:)— so also Paul says here: "as often as you eat ye do proclaim His death." And this is that Supper. Then intimating that it abides unto the end, he says, "till He come."
