Some say that he [Paul] did not know that he was the high priest. Then why does he defend himself as if there was an accusation and adds, “You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.” For if he was not the ruler, was he then to be abused? Paul himself says, “When we are cursed we bless; when we are persecuted, we endure it.” But here he does the opposite. He not only reviles but also curses him. These are words of boldness rather than anger. He did not wish to appear contemptible to the tribune. For the tribune himself had refrained from scourging him, since he was about to be handed over to the Jews. Had he been struck by the servants, it would have rather emboldened the tribune. For this reason he directs his attack not at the servant but at the one who gave the order. The words “you whitewashed wall” and “you are sitting to judge me according to the law” stand for “you are responsible,” as if he had said, “you deserve ten thousand lashes.” See how they were thunderstruck by his boldness. The point was to undermine him completely, but they commended him instead.

This is well said. For to kill one who had done no wrong and moreover does not deserve punishment is a violation of the law. For his words could not be called abusive unless one also called Christ’s words abusive, when he said, “Woe to you, teachers of the law and Pharisees! You are like whitewashed walls.” True, you will say. But since [Paul] spoke before he was struck, it was not out of anger but out of boldness. But I have mentioned the reason for this. Indeed, Christ often insulted the Jews, when he himself had been abused by them, as when he said, “Do not think I will accuse you before the Father.” But [Paul’s words] are not abuse; God forbid. See with what gentleness he addresses these men: “I did not know that he was the high priest of God.” And to show that he was not being ironic, he adds, “You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.” [Paul] even acknowledges that he is still a ruler. Let us learn the gentleness as well as the boldness, so that we may be complete in both. For much exactness is needed to learn what each of them is. Exactness, because these virtues have their attendant vices: near boldness stands audacity, near gentleness, cowardice.
