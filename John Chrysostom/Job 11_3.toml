Zophar means, “Is there none to answer you?” meaning other than we ourselves. Or it could mean: “There is nobody who knows your misfortunes, apart from God, and if he had wanted to disgrace you, then you would have been already dead.” Notice that, since Job does not say anywhere that he is unjustly suffering and that he has no faults, this is exactly what they resentfully bring up to him.
