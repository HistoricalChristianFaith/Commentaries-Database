"And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them." O the irrational conduct! They did not examine, did not allow them to speak. And yet, such a miracle having taken place, ye ought to have worshipped them, ought to have held them as saviors and benefactors. For if money was what ye wished, why, having found so great wealth, did ye not run to it? This makes you more famous, the having power to cast out demons than the obeying them. Lo, even miracles, and yet love of money was mightier.

But observe them, Paul and Silas, how they do not answer, nor plead for themselves; "For when," saith he, "I am weak, then am I strong. My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness": so that by reason of their gentleness also they should be admired.
