(b) and, from the fact that the being called was itself a matter of God's fore-ordering, (a) they neither thought great things of themselves as if the triumph were their own, nor were terrified as being responsible (for all). But how comes it that he said, That we should go unto the heathen, and they unto the circumcision Galatians 2:9, and yet discoursed to the Jews? (α) He did this as a thing over and above. (β) For he did other things also more than he was obliged. For instance, Christ ordained that they should live by the Gospel 1 Corinthians 9:14; 1:17, but our Apostle did it not: Christ sent him not to baptize, yet he did baptize. Mark how he was equal to all. Peter to the circumcision, he to the Gentiles, to the greater part. (α) Since if it was necessary for him to discourse to Jews, how said he again: For He that wrought effectually in him toward the circumcision, the same was mighty also in me toward the Gentiles Galatians 2:8? In the same way as those Apostles also had intercourse with the Gentiles, though they had been set apart for the circumcision, so likewise did our Apostle. The more part of his work indeed was with the Gentiles: still he did not neglect the Jews either, that they might not seem to be severed from them. And how was it, you will ask, that he entered in the first place into the synagogues, as if this were his leading object? True; but he persuaded the Gentiles through the Jews, and from the things which he discoursed of to the Jews. And he knew, that this was most suitable for the Gentiles, and most conducive to belief. Therefore he says: Inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles. Romans 11:13 And his Epistles too all fight against the Jews.— That the Christ, he says, must needs have suffered.

so that the Gentiles were more in number. The Jews thought not themselves enough to raise the disturbance: for because they had no reasonable pretext, they ever effect such purposes by means of uproar, and by taking to themselves base men. And when they found them not, it says, they haled Jason and certain brethren.
