"And all that believed were together, and had all things common." Consider what an advance was here immediately! For the fellowship was not only in prayers, nor in doctrine alone, but also in social relations. "And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need." See what fear was wrought in them! "And they parted them," he says, showing the wise management: "As every man had heed." Not recklessly, like some philosophers among the Greeks, of whom some gave up their land, others cast into the sea great quantities of money; but this was no contempt of riches, but only folly and madness. For universally the devil has made it his endeavor to disparage the creatures of God, as if it were impossible to make good use of riches.

"And all that believed were together, and had all things in common," etc. They are all become angels on a sudden; all of them continuing in prayer and hearing, they saw that spiritual things are common, and no one there has more than other, and they speedily came together, to the same thing in common, even to the imparting to all. "And all the believing," it says, were together: and to see that this does not mean that they were together in place, observe what follows "And had all things common". "All," it says: not one with the exception of another. This was an angelic commonwealth, not to call anything of theirs their own. Forthwith the root of evils was cut out.

Once more, the unanimity, the charity, which is the cause of all good things!
