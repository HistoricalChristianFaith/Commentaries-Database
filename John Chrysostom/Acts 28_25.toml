The expression “the Spirit said” is unremarkable, for angels too are said to say what the Lord says. “The Holy Spirit,” he says, “was right in saying.” This is no longer unremarkable. When someone describes the speech of the angels, he does not say, “The angel was right in saying” but “The Lord was right in saying” or “The Spirit was right in saying.” That is, it is not me that you disbelieve, but God has known this from the beginning.
