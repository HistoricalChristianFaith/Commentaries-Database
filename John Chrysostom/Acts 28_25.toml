See again how not by miracles but by Law and Prophets he puts them to silence, and how we always find him doing this. And yet he might also have wrought signs; but then it would no longer have been matter of faith. In fact, this (itself) was a great sign, his discoursing from the Law and the Prophets. Then that you may not deem it strange (that they believed not), he introduces the prophecy which says, Hearing you shall hear and not understand, more now than then: and you shall see and not perceive

The expression “the Spirit said” is unremarkable, for angels too are said to say what the Lord says. “The Holy Spirit,” he says, “was right in saying.” This is no longer unremarkable. When someone describes the speech of the angels, he does not say, “The angel was right in saying” but “The Lord was right in saying” or “The Spirit was right in saying.” That is, it is not me that you disbelieve, but God has known this from the beginning.
