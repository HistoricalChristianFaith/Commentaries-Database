In Jerusalem the number increased. It is wonderful that where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! Not only did it not happen that some people were offended in the case of Ananias, but the awe became even greater; all the while some were flogged, others threatening, others tempting the Spirit and others murmuring. Notice, if you please, under what circumstances the number increased. It was after the trials—not before—that the number increased. And see how great is the mercy of God. The chief priests who were shouting such things, who were indignant, highly vexed, who said, “he saved others. He cannot save himself.” It was from the ranks of these that many [priests], it says, “were obedient to the faith.”
