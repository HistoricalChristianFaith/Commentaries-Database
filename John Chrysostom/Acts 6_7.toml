"And the word of God increased: and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith." It is not for nothing that he says this: it shows how great is the virtue of alms and good order. And as he is about in the sequel to enlarge upon the affair of Stephen, he puts first the causes which led to it. "And many," he says, "of the priests were obedient to the faith." Wonderful, where Christ was slain, there the preaching increased! And not only was it not the case that some were offended, but the awe became even greater: while these are scourged, those threatening, those tempting the Spirit, those murmuring.

"And the number of disciples was multiplied in Jerusalem." In Jerusalem the multitude increased. And mark under what circumstances the multitude increased: after these trials, then it was that the multitude increased, and not before. Mark also how great the mercy of God. Of those chief-priests, of the very men who had indignation and sore displeasure and so cried out and said, "He saved others, Himself He cannot save;" of these same, "Many," it says, "were obedient unto the faith."
