The preaching had already reached Sicily. See how it ran: in Puteoli they found some brothers and met them and others. The affection of the brothers was such that they were not troubled by the fact that Paul was in chains.

See, when the judgment is right, and not preoccupied by some passion, how immediately it gets right judgings, and gives sound verdicts. "And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli."
