These words mean, I do not speak so out of envy or jealousy. Even though the three friends said the same things as him, they did not do so in the same spirit or in order to defend God. Indeed also Judas and the eleven disciples expressed the same opinion about the vase of perfume, but not in the same spirit. Therefore, let us not examine the words but the intention with which each expresses himself. How the first wanted to overthrow him, whereas the latter wanted the opposite. Take heed: Elihu, who speaks last, expresses the thoughts that God is about to express, so that God may justify himself even better, once Job has heard the same remarks from his companions in bondage that he will afterwards hear from the Master.
