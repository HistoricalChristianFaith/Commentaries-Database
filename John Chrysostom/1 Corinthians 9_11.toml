6. "If we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?"

Lo, he adds also a fourth argument for the duty of yielding support. For since he had said, "What soldier ever serves at his own charges?" and, "who plants a vineyard?" and, "who feeds a flock?" and introduced the ox that treads the grain; he points out likewise another most reasonable cause on account of which they might justly receive; viz. having bestowed much greater gifts, no more as having labored only. What is it then? "if we sowed unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter if we shall reap your carnal things?" Do you see a most just allegation and fuller of reason than all the former? For "in those instances," says he, "carnal is the seed, carnal also is the fruit; but here not so, but the seed is spiritual, the return carnal." Thus, to prevent high thoughts in those who contribute to their teachers, he signified that they receive more than they give. As if he had said, "Husbandmen, whatsoever they sow, this also do they receive; but we, sowing in your souls spiritual things, do reap carnal." For such is the kind of support given by them. Further, and still more to put them to the blush.
