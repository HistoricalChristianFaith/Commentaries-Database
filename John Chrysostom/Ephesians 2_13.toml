Is this then the great privilege, it may be said, that we are admitted into the commonwealth of the Jews? What are you saying? He has summed up all things that are in heaven, and that are in earth, and now do you tell us about Israelites? Yes, he would say. Those higher privileges we must apprehend by faith; these, by the things themselves. But now, says he, in Christ Jesus, you that once were far off, are made near, in reference to the commonwealth. For the far off, and the near, are matters of will and choice only.
