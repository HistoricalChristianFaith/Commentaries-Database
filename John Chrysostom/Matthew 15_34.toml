Why had he earlier said to his disciples, “Send away the multitude,” but now he does not send them away, even though three days had passed? It may be that they themselves had changed and improved by this time. Or it may be that since the people were glorifying God for what had been done, they had no great sense of hunger.Observe in this instance that he does not proceed immediately to the miracle but calls them out even into the desert. The multitudes who had come for healing were not even daring to ask for food. But he is here seen to be the benevolent and provident one who gives even to those that do not ask. He said to his disciples, “I have compassion and will not send them away hungry.” And lest someone might say that they came having provisions for the way, he noted, “They have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat, so that even if some came with provision, it has by now been consumed.” Therefore Jesus did not do this on the first or second day but only when everything had been entirely consumed, in order that having first been in need, they might more eagerly receive the miracle of food. He offered them compassion, saying, “Lest they faint in the way”; he implied that both the distance to food was great and that they had nothing left. Then disciples asked, if you are not willing to send them away hungry, “Where are we to get bread enough in the desert to feed so great a crowd?” Jesus responded, in order to stimulate their faith and make them more compassionate: “How many loaves have you?” But even then they did not fully understand the motive of his question. Hence afterwards he said to them, as Mark relates, “Are your hearts so hardened? Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear?”
