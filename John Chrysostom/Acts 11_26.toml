Verily this is the reason why it was there they were appointed to be called Christians, because Paul there spent so long time! And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the Church, and taught much people. And the disciples were first called Christians at Antioch. No small matter of praise to that city! This is enough to make it a match for all, that for so long a time it had the benefit of that mouth, it first, and before all others: wherefore also it was there in the first place that men were accounted worthy of that name. Do you observe the benefit resulting (to that city) from Paul, to what a height that name, like a standard (σημεἵον), exalted it? Where three thousand, where five thousand, believed, where so great a multitude, nothing of the sort took place, but they were called they of the way: here they were called Christians. And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.

Surely they were called Christians because Paul spent such a long time among them. “For a whole year,” it says, “they met with the church and taught a large company of people; and in Antioch the disciples were for the first time called Christians.” This is no small praise for the city, but enough to match it against all cities. For Antioch was the first city, before all the others, to have the benefit of listening to Paul for so long, and because of this the people there were the first to be deemed worthy of the name. Look at the success of Paul, to what heights it raised, like a standard, that name! Elsewhere, three thousand or five thousand or so great a number believed, but nothing like this. Elsewhere, the believers were called “they of the way”; here, they were given the name Christians.
