Then with much anger and vehement indignation against those who make a mock of him as weak, and ridicule his presence, and say, "his presence is weak, and his speech of no account;" aiming his efforts at these men, he says, "Seeing that ye seek a proof of Christ that speaketh in me." For he said this, dealing at once a blow at these, and at the same time lashing those also. Now what he means is this; "Since ye are desirous of proving whether Christ dwelleth in me, and call me to an account, and on this score make a mock of me as mean and despicable, as I were destitute of that Power; ye shall know that we are not destitute, if ye give us occasion, which God forbid."

What then? tell me. Dost thou therefore punish, because they seek a proof? "No," he says; for had he sought this, he would have punished them at the first on their sinning, and would not have put off. But that he does not seek this, he has shown more clearly as he proceeds, saying, "Now I pray that ye do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that ye may be approved, though we be as reprobates."

He doth not employ those words then as assigning a reason, but rather in indignation, rather as attacking those that despise him. "For," he says, "I have no desire indeed to give you such a proof, but if you yourselves should furnish cause and should choose to challenge me, ye shall know by very deeds." And observe how grievous he makes what he says. For he said not, "Since ye seek a proof of me," but "of Christ that speaketh in me," showing that it was against Him they sinned. And he did not say merely, "dwelling in me," but "speaking in me," showing that his words are spiritual.

But if he doth not display His power nor punish, (for thenceforward the Apostle transferred what he said from himself to Christ, thus making his threat more fearful,) it is not from weakness; for He can do it: but from long suffering. Let none then think His forbearance to be weakness. For why marvellest thou that He doth not now proceed against sinners, nor in his forbearance and long suffering exacts satisfaction, seeing that He endured even to be crucified, and though suffering such things punished not?
