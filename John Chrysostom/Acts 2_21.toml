“Everyone,” he says (not yet revealing the meaning), be he priest, slave, free. There is no male, no female in Christ Jesus, no slave, no free, for all these are but shadow. For if in the palaces of kings there is no highborn or lowborn, but each arrives through his deeds, and if in craftsmanship each is shown by his works, all the more so it should be in the pursuit of wisdom.
