Again he engages (ἐ πιστρέφει) them from another quarter, from the things which should come after: as when he says, We wrestle not against flesh and blood. After my departing, he says, grievous wolves shall enter in among you Ephesians 6:12; twofold the evil, both that he himself would not be present, and that others would assail them. Then why depart, if you know this beforehand? The Spirit draws me, he says. Both wolves, and grievous, not sparing the flock; and what is worse, even from among your own selves: the grievous thing (this), when the war is moreover an intestine war. The matter is exceeding serious, for it is the Church of the Lord: great the peril for with blood He redeemed it: mighty the war, and twofold. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
