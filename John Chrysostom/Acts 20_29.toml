therefore, not to overpower them, and make them lose all self-possession, observe the consolation (he gives). And now, he says, as always, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace: that is, to His grace: it is grace that saves. He constantly puts them in mind of grace, to make them more earnest as being debtors, and to persuade them to have confidence. Which is able to build you up. He does not say, to build, but, to build up, showing that they had (already) been built. Then he puts them in mind of the hope to come; to give you an inheritance, he says, among all them which are sanctified. Then exhortation again: I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.

What then, someone might say, thinkest you yourself so great? If you should depart, are we to die? I say not this, he replies, that my absence causes this: but what? That there should rise up against you certain of another sort: he says not, because of my departing, but after my departing: that is, after his going on his journey.— And yet this thing has happened already: much more (then will it happen) hereafter. Then we have the cause, to draw away disciples after them.

Again he engages (ἐ πιστρέφει) them from another quarter, from the things which should come after: as when he says, We wrestle not against flesh and blood. After my departing, he says, grievous wolves shall enter in among you Ephesians 6:12; twofold the evil, both that he himself would not be present, and that others would assail them. Then why depart, if you know this beforehand? The Spirit draws me, he says. Both wolves, and grievous, not sparing the flock; and what is worse, even from among your own selves: the grievous thing (this), when the war is moreover an intestine war. The matter is exceeding serious, for it is the Church of the Lord: great the peril for with blood He redeemed it: mighty the war, and twofold. Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.
