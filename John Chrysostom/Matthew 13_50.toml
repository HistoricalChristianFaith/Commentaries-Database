In the foregoing parables He has commended the Gospel preaching; now, that we may not trust in preaching only, nor think that faith alone is sufficient for our salvation, He adds another fearful parable, saying, “Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net cast into the sea.”.
Wherein does this parable differ from the parable of the tares? There, as here, some perish and some are saved; but there, because of their heresy of evil dogmas; in the first parable of the sower, because of their not attending to what was spoken; here, because of their evil life, because of which, though drawn by the net, that is, enjoying the knowledge of God, they cannot be saved. And when you hear that the wicked are castaway, that you may not suppose that this punishment may be risked, He adds an exposition shewing its severity, saying, “These shall it be in the end of the world; the angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the just, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire, there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth. "Though He elsewhere declares, that He shall separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats; He here declares, that the Angels shall do it, as also in the parable of the tares.

And this parable He interprets without so much as being asked, but of His own motion He explained it by one part of it, and increased their awe. For lest, on being told, They cast the bad away, you should suppose that ruin to be without danger; by His interpretation He signified the punishment, saying, They will cast them into the furnace. Matthew 13:50 And He declared the gnashing of teeth, and the anguish, that it is unspeakable.

Do you see how many are the ways of destruction? By the rock, by the thorns, by the wayside, by the tares, by the net. Not without reason therefore did He say, Broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go away by it. Matthew 7:13
