And this parable He interprets without so much as being asked, but of His own motion He explained it by one part of it, and increased their awe. For lest, on being told, They cast the bad away, you should suppose that ruin to be without danger; by His interpretation He signified the punishment, saying, They will cast them into the furnace. Matthew 13:50 And He declared the gnashing of teeth, and the anguish, that it is unspeakable.

Do you see how many are the ways of destruction? By the rock, by the thorns, by the wayside, by the tares, by the net. Not without reason therefore did He say, Broad is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be which go away by it. Matthew 7:13
