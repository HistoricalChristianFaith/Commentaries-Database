Look at how unbelievably wise Paul is. After pointing out the need and showing them an example, Paul leaves the Corinthians to do as much as they can, letting the example of the Macedonians do its own work of persuasion. He knew that imitation was a more powerful incentive than exhortation.

"For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man has, not according as he has not."

See wisdom unspeakable. In that (having pointed out those who were doing beyond their power, I mean the Thessalonians, and having praised them for this and said, "I bear them record that even beyond their power;") he exhorts the Corinthians to do only "after" their power, leaving the example to do its own work; for he knew that not so much exhortation, as emulation, incites unto imitation of the like; wherefore he says, "For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according as a man has, not according as he has not."

'Fear not,' he means, 'because I have said these things, for what I said was an encomium upon their munificence , but God requires things after a man's power,' "according as he has, not according as he has not." For the word "is acceptable," here implies 'is required.' And he softens it greatly, in confident reliance upon this example, and as winning them more surely by leaving them at liberty.
