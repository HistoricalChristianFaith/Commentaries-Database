He means, that no new thing has happened, but just what the Lord foretold. But there was no need to baptize? (Comp. p. 158.) But the baptism was completed already. And he does not say, I ordered them to be baptized: but what says he? Forasmuch then as God gave them the like gift as He did unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ; what was I, that I could withstand God?
