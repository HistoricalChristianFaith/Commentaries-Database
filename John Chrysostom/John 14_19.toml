As though He had said, I come indeed to you, but not in the same way as before, ever being with you day by day. And lest they should say, How then did You say to the Jews, Henceforth you shall not see Me? He solves the contradiction by saying, to you alone; for such also is the nature of the Spirit.

Because I live, you shall live also.

For the Cross does not finally separate us, but only hides for a little moment; and by life He seems to me to mean not the present only, but the future also.
