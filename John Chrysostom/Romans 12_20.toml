In so doing, says the Scripture, thou shall heap coals of fire on his head. And yet, for all that this is the consequence, it bids us go and be reconciled and do good offices - not that we may heap coals of fire, but that our enemy knowing that future consequence, may be assuaged by the present kindness, that he may tremble, that he may fear our good offices rather than our hostilities, and our friendships rather than our ill designs. For one does not so hurt his hater by showing his resentment as an enemy, as by doing him good and showing kindness. For by his resentment, he has hurt both himself and perhaps the other also in some little degree: but by doing good offices, he has heaped coals of fire on his head. Why then, you will say, for fear of thus heaping coals one ought not to do this but to carry on the enmity to greater lengths. By no means: it is not you that cause this, but he with his brutish disposition. For if, when you are doing him good, and honoring him, and offering to be reconciled, he persists in keeping up the enmity, it is he has kindled the fire for himself, he has set his own head on fire; you are guiltless.
