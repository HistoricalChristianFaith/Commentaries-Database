Nothing can be clearer or bolder than truth.… It neither seeks concealment nor avoids danger, it fears no plots or cares for popularity. It is subject to no human weakness.… Our Lord went up to Jerusalem at the feasts to teach the people and help them through his miracles. After the festival he often visited the crowds who were gathered at the Jordan, choosing the most crowded places, not ostentatiously or out of love of honor but because he wanted to help the greatest number of people.

The Evangelist says further on that Jesus did not baptize, but his disciples did.… He had not yet given the Spirit, and so there was a good reason why he did not baptize. But his disciples did because they wanted to bring as many to faith as possible.
