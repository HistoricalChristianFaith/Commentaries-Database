Therefore, let us not conceal the wonders of God, but to our own advantage, let us parade them with zeal, for the edification of others. He is to be admired for choosing to be imprisoned but even more for not withdrawing before he had reported everything to his friends. And he said, “Tell this to James and to the brothers,” so that they might rejoice and not worry about him. And it is through these that those find out, not those through this. Thus did he take thought for the humbler part!

Look how much they achieved by praying at night. How great a good is affliction. How much it awakened them. Did you notice the gain from Stephen’s death? Or how great a benefit this prison conferred? For it is not by taking vengeance on those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the gospel. Rather, it is in the wrongdoers themselves, without their suffering anything terrible, that he shows the greatness of afflictions in themselves by themselves, so that we would in no way seek deliverance from them, not even vengeance for the wrongs done us.
