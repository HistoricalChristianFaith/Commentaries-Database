it says: viz. where he was, or, that he must not without more ado depart but requite his Benefactor: he came to the house of Mary the mother of John. Who is this John? Probably he that was always with them: for this is why he adds his distinctive name (τὸ παράσημον), whose surname was Mark. But observe, praying in the night, how much they got by it: what a good thing affliction is; how wakeful it made them! Do you see how great the gain resulting from the death of Stephen? Do you see how great the benefit accruing from this imprisonment? For it is not by taking vengeance upon those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the Gospel: but in the wrong-doers themselves, without any harm happening to those, he shows what a mighty thing the afflictions in themselves are, that we may not seek in any wise deliverance from them, nor the avenging of our wrongs. And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. For joy, it says, she opened not.

Then let us not hide God's marvels, but for our own good let us study to display these abroad for the edifying of the others. For as he deserves to be admired for choosing to be put into bonds, so is he worthy of more admiration, that he withdrew not until he had reported all to his friends. And he said, Tell James and the brethren.

Observe how Peter does not immediately withdraw, but first brings the good tidings to his friends. And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness,— Mark even the servant-girls, how full of piety they are—but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.

Therefore, let us not conceal the wonders of God, but to our own advantage, let us parade them with zeal, for the edification of others. He is to be admired for choosing to be imprisoned but even more for not withdrawing before he had reported everything to his friends. And he said, “Tell this to James and to the brothers,” so that they might rejoice and not worry about him. And it is through these that those find out, not those through this. Thus did he take thought for the humbler part!

Look how much they achieved by praying at night. How great a good is affliction. How much it awakened them. Did you notice the gain from Stephen’s death? Or how great a benefit this prison conferred? For it is not by taking vengeance on those who wronged them that God shows the greatness of the gospel. Rather, it is in the wrongdoers themselves, without their suffering anything terrible, that he shows the greatness of afflictions in themselves by themselves, so that we would in no way seek deliverance from them, not even vengeance for the wrongs done us.
