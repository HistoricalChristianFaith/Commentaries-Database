But the disciples, out of regard for the dignity of Christ, forbade those who brought them. And this is what is added: “And His disciples rebuked those who brought them.” But our Saviour, in order to teach His disciples to be modest in their ideas, and to tread underfoot worldly pride, takes the children to Him, and assigns to them the kingdom of God. Wherefore it goes on: “And He said unto them, Suffer the little children to come unto Me, and forbid them not. "Origin, in Matt., XV, 7: If any of those who profess to hold the office of teaching in the Church should see a person bringing to them some of the foolish of this world, and low born, and weak, who for this reason are called children and infants, let him not forbid the man who offers such an one to the Saviour, as though he were acting without judgment. After this He exhorts those of His disciples who are already grown to full stature to condescend to be useful to children, that they may become to childrenas children, that they may gain children ; for He Himself, when Hewas in the form of God, humbled Himself, and became a child. One which He adds: “For of such is the kingdom of heaven.”.
For indeed the mind of a child ispure from all passions, for which reason, we ought by free choice to do those works, which children hate by nature.
Vict. Ant, e Cat. in Marc. Fitly does He take them up into His arms to bless them, as it were, lifting into His own bosom, and reconciling Himself to His creation, which in the beginning fell from Him, and was separated from Him. Again, He puts His hands upon the children, to teach us the working of his divine power; and indeed, He puts His hands upon them, as others are wont to do, though His operation is notas that of others, for though He was God, He kept to human ways of acting, as being very man.
