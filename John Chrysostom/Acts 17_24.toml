"God that made the world and all things therein, He being Lord of heaven and earth" - for, that they may not imagine Him to be one of many, he presently sets them right on this point; adding, "dwelleth not in temples made with hands" - do you observe how, little by little, he brings in the philosophy? how he ridicules the heathen error?

"God," he says, "that made the world." He uttered one word, by which he has subverted all the doctrines of the philosophers. For the Epicureans affirm all to be fortuitously formed and by concourse of atoms, the Stoics held it to be body and fire. "The world and all that is therein." Do you mark the conciseness, and in conciseness, clearness? Mark what were the things that were strange to them: that God made the world! Things which now any of the most ordinary persons know, these the Athenians and the wise men of the Athenians knew not. "Seeing He is Lord of heaven and earth": for if He made them, it is clear that He is Lord. Observe what he affirms to be the note of Deity - creation. Which attribute the Son also hath.

For the Prophets everywhere affirm this, that to create is God's prerogative. Not as those affirm that another is Maker but not Lord, assuming that matter is uncreated. Here now he covertly affirms and establishes his own, while he overthrows their doctrine. "Dwelleth not in temples made with hands." For He does indeed dwell in temples, yet not in such, but in man's soul. He overthrows the corporeal worship. What then? Did He not dwell in the temple at Jerusalem? No indeed: but He wrought therein.
