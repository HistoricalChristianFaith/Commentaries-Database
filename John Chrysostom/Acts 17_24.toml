He says that “the world and everything in it” is the work of God. Do you notice the conciseness and, in the conciseness, the clearness? And what was strange to them? The fact that God made the world. These things, now known to anyone, the Athenians did not know, not even the wise among them. For if he made them, it is clear that he is Lord. Notice what [Paul] affirms as the mark of divinity: creation, which the Son also has.
