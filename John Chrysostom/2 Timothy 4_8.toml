The martyr's own struggles surpass our mortal nature. The prizes they won go beyond our powers and understanding. They laughed at the life lived on earth. They trampled underfoot the punishment of the rack. They scorned death and took wing to heaven. They escaped from the storms of temporal things and sailed into a calm harbor. They brought with them no gold or silver or expensive garments. They carried along no treasure which could be plundered but the riches of patience, courage and love. Now they belong to Paul's choral band while they still await their crowns, because they have escaped henceforth the uncertainty of the future.

"Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness." Here again he calls virtue in general righteousness. Thou shouldest not grieve that I shall depart, to be invested with that crown which will by Christ be placed upon my head. But if I continued here, truly thou mightest rather grieve, and fear lest I should fail and perish. "Which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day, and not to me only, but to all that love His appearing." Here also he raises his mind. If "to all," much more to Timothy. But he did not say, "and to thee," but "to all"; meaning, if to all, much more to him. But how, it may be asked, is one to "love the appearing" of Christ? By rejoicing at His coming; and he who rejoices at His coming, will perform works worthy of His joy; he will throw away his substance if need be, and even his life, so that he may obtain future blessings, that he may be thought worthy to behold that second coming in a fitting state, in confidence, in brightness and glory. This is to "love His appearing." He who loves His appearing will do everything to ensure, before His general coming, a particular coming to himself. And how, you will say, is this possible? Hear from Christ, who says, "If a man love Me, he will keep My words, and My Father and I will come unto him, and make Our abode with him." (John xiv. 23.)
