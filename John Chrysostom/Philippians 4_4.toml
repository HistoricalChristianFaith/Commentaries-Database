Blessed are they that mourn, and woe unto them that laugh Matthew 5:4; Luke 6:25, says Christ. How then says Paul, Rejoice in the Lord always? Woe to them that laugh, said Christ, the laughter of this world which arises from the things which are present. He blessed also those that mourn, not simply for the loss of relatives, but those who are pricked at heart, who mourn their own faults, and take count of their own sins, or even those of others. This joy is not contrary to that grief, but from that grief it too is born. For he who grieves for his own faults, and confesses them, rejoices. Moreover, it is possible to grieve for our own sins, and yet to rejoice in Christ. Since then they were afflicted by their sufferings, for to you it is given not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for him Philippians 1:29, therefore he says, Rejoice in the Lord. For this can but mean, If you exhibit such a life that you may rejoice. Or when your communion with God is not hindered, rejoice. Or else the word in may stand for with: as if he had said, with the Lord. Always; again I will say, Rejoice. These are the words of one who brings comfort; as, for example, he who is in God rejoices always. Yea though he be afflicted, yea whatever he may suffer, such a man always rejoices. Hear what Luke says, that they returned from the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be scourged for His name. Acts 5:41 If scourging and bonds, which seem to be the most grievous of all things, bring forth joy, what else will be able to produce grief in us?

Again I will say, Rejoice. Well has he repeated. For since the nature of the things brought forth grief, he shows by repeating, that they should by all means rejoice.

This rejoicing is not separable from grief, for indeed it is rather deeply connected with grief. The one who grieves for his own wrongdoing and confesses it is joyful. Alternatively it is possible to grieve for one’s own sins but rejoice in Christ.… On this account he says “Rejoice in the Lord.” For this is nothing if you have received a life worthy of rejoicing.… He is right to repeat himself. For since the events are naturally grievous, it is through the repetition that he shows that in all cases one should rejoice.
