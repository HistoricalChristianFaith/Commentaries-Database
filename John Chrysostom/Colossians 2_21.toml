You are not in the world, he says, how is it you are subject to its elements? How to its observances? And mark how he makes sport of them, touch not, handle not, taste not, as though they were cowards and keeping themselves clear of some great matters, all which things are to perish with the using.

Henceforth it is but a doctrine of men, after the time has come. Or, because they adulterated it, or else, he alludes to the Gentile institutions. The doctrine, he says, is altogether of man.
