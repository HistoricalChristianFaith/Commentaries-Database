Look! This is what God does, so the weak may hope for happiness and the powerful may not become proud. In fact, he said above, “Call for help in order to see whether you will be listened to,” so that you may not think that there are things that escape providence.… Eliphaz dedicates the beginning of his speech to the defeat of Job.
