If you are willing, you will have more success with each other than we can have. For you both are with one another for a longer time, and you know more than we of each other’s affairs. Further, you are not ignorant of each other’s failings, and you have more freedom of speech, and love and intimacy. These are no small advantages for teaching but great and opportune moments for it. You will be more able than we both to reprove and exhort. And not this only, but because I am but one, whereas you are many; and you will be able, however many, to be teachers. Therefore I entreat you, do not “neglect this gift.”

He speaks here not of presbyters but of bishops. For presbyters cannot be supposed to have ordained a bishop.
