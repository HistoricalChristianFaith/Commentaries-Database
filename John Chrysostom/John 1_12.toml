Why, then, did he not say that “he made them sons of God,” instead of “he gave them power to become sons of God”? He did so to show how much zeal is needed to keep the image of sonship that was impressed on us at baptism and to keep it all the way through without spot or soiling. At the same time, he also wanted to show that no one will be able to take this power from us, unless we first deprive ourselves of it.… For even in these mystical blessings, it is, on the one hand, God’s part, to give the grace, on the other, a person’s to supply faith. What follows needs much perseverance. In order to preserve our purity, it is not sufficient for us merely to have been baptized and to have believed; we must display a life worthy of it if we want to continually enjoy this brightness. This then is God’s work in us.
