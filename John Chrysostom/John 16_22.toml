Again He proves nothing else by these words, but that He is from God. For then you shall for the time to come know all things. But what is, You shall not ask Me? You shall need no intercessor, but it is sufficient that you call on My Name, and so gain all things.

Verily, verily, I say unto you, Whatsoever you shall ask My Father in My Name. 

He shows the power of His Name, if at least being neither seen nor called upon, but only named, He even makes us approved  by the Father. But where has this taken place? Where they say, Lord, behold their threatenings, and grant unto Your servants that with boldness they may speak Your word Acts 4:29-31, and work miracles in Your Name. And the place was shaken where they were.
