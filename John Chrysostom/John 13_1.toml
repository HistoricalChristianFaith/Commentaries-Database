1. A grievous thing, beloved, a grievous thing it is to come to the depths of wickedness; for then the soul becomes hard to be restored. Wherefore we should use every exertion not to be taken at all;  since it is easier not to fall in,  than having fallen to recover one's self. Observe, for instance, when Judas had thrown himself into sin, how great assistance he enjoyed, yet not even so was he raised. Christ said to him, One of you is a devil John 6:71; He said, Not all believe John 6:65; He said, I speak not of all, and, I know whom I have chosen John 13:18; and not one of these sayings does he feel. Now when He had washed their feet, and taken His garments, and sat down, He said, Know ye what I have done unto you? He no longer addresses Himself to Peter only, but to them all.

1.  Be imitators of me, said Paul, as I also am of Christ. 1 Corinthians 11:1 For on this account He took also flesh of our substance,  that by means of it He might teach us virtue. For (God sending His own Son) in the likeness of sinful flesh, it says, and for sin condemned sin in the flesh. Romans 8:3 And Christ Himself  says, Learn of Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart. Matthew 11:29 And this He taught, not by words alone, but by actions also. For they called Him a Samaritan, and one that had a devil, and a deceiver, and cast stones at Him; and at one time the Pharisees sent servants to take  Him, at another they sent plotters against Him; and they continued  also insulting Him themselves, and that when they had no fault to find, but were even being continually benefited. Still after such conduct He ceases not to do well to them both by words and deeds. And, when a certain domestic smote Him on the face, He said, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil, but if well, why do you smite Me? John 18:23 But this was to those who hated and plotted against Him. Let us see also what He does now towards the disciples, or rather what actions He now exhibits  towards the traitor. The man whom most of all there was reason  to hate, because being a disciple, having shared the table and the salt, having seen the miracles and been deemed worthy of such great things, he acted more grievously than any, not stoning indeed, nor insulting Him, but betraying and giving Him up, observe in how friendly sort He receives this man, washing his feet; for even in this way He desired to restrain him from that wickedness. Yet it was in His power, had He willed it, to have withered him like the fig-tree, to have cut him in two as He rent the rocks, to have cleft him asunder like the veil; but He would not lead him away from his design by compulsion, but by choice. Wherefore He washed his feet; and not even by this was that wretched and miserable man shamed.

Before the feast of the Passover, it says, Jesus knowing that His hour had come. Not then knowing, but (it means) that He did what He did having known long ago. That He should depart. Magnificently  the Evangelist calls His death, departure. Having loved His own, He loved them unto the end. Do you see how when about to leave them He shows greater love? For the, having loved, He loved them unto the end, shows that he omitted nothing of the things which it was likely that one who earnestly loved would do. Why, then did He not this from the beginning? He works  the greatest things last, so as to render more intense their attachment, and to lay up for them beforehand much comfort, against the terrible things that were about to fall on them. St. John calls them His own, in respect of personal attachment, since he calls others also His own, in respect of the work of creation; as when he says, His own received Him not. John 1:11 But what means, which were in the world? Because the dead also were His own, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and the men of that sort,  but they were not in the world. Do you see that He is the God both of the Old and New (Testament)? But what means, He loved them unto the end? It stands for, He continued loving them unceasingly, and this the Evangelist mentions as a sure proof of great affection. Elsewhere indeed He spoke of another (proof), the laying down life for His friends; but that had not yet come to pass. And wherefore did He this thing now? Because it was far more wonderful at a time when He appeared more glorious in the sight of all men. Besides, He left them no small consolation now that He was about to depart, for since they were going to be greatly grieved, He by these means introduces also comfort to the grief.

This was not his first inkling that his hour had come. He had known long before that he was going to depart. The Evangelist is most eloquent in calling his death a departure.… Being so near to leaving his disciples, he shows greater love for them. “Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end,” means that he left nothing undone that one who greatly loved should do. Why then didn’t he do this from the beginning? He reserved this for the end so that their love might be increased by it and to prepare them by this consolation for the terrible things that were coming. John calls them “his own” in the sense of personal attachment.… The word was used in another sense in the beginning of the Gospel, “His own received him not.”
