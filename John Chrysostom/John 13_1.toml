This was not his first inkling that his hour had come. He had known long before that he was going to depart. The Evangelist is most eloquent in calling his death a departure.… Being so near to leaving his disciples, he shows greater love for them. “Having loved his own which were in the world, he loved them to the end,” means that he left nothing undone that one who greatly loved should do. Why then didn’t he do this from the beginning? He reserved this for the end so that their love might be increased by it and to prepare them by this consolation for the terrible things that were coming. John calls them “his own” in the sense of personal attachment.… The word was used in another sense in the beginning of the Gospel, “His own received him not.”
