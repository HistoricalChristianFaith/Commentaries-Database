Peter seizes his advantage, and notice the argument he makes of it: “Can anyone forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?” Mark the conclusion to which he brings it; how he has been travailing to bring this forth. So entirely was he of this mind! “Can anyone,” he asks, “forbid water?” It is the language, we may almost say, of one triumphantly pressing his advantage against such as would forbid, such as should say that this ought not to be. The whole thing, he says, is complete, the most essential part of the business, the baptism with which we were baptized. “And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ.” After he has cleared himself, then, and not before, he commands them to be baptized: teaching them by the facts themselves.

That the need of water is absolute and indispensable, you may learn in this way. On one occasion, when the Spirit had been poured out before the water was applied, the apostle did not stay at this point, but, as though the water were necessary and not superfluous, observe what he says: “Can any one forbid water for baptizing these people who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?”
