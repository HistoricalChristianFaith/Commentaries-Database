"A ship of Alexandria," it says. It is likely that both those in the former ship would bear to Asia the report of what had befallen Paul, and that these would do the same in Lycia. See how God does not innovate or change the order of nature, but suffers them to sail into the unfavorable winds. But even so the miracle is wrought. That they may sail safely, He did not let them go out in the open sea, but they always sailed near the land.
