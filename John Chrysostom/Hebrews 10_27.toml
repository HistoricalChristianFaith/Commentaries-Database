For, says he, if we sin willfully. See how he is disposed to pardon. He says, if we sin willfully, so that there is pardon for those [who sin] not willfully. After the knowledge of the truth: He either means, of Christ, or of all doctrines. There remains no more sacrifice for sins, but what? A certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries. By Adversaries he means not the unbelievers, but those also who do what is against virtue; or [else he means] that the same fire shall receive them of the household also, which [receives] the adversaries. Then expressing its devouring nature, he says, as if giving it life, fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries. For as a wild beast when irritated and very fierce and savage, would not rest till it could lay hold on some one and eat him up; so also that fire, like one goaded by indignation, whatever it can lay hold of does not let go, but devours and tears it to pieces.

Next he adds also the reason of the threat, that it is on good grounds, that it is just; for this contributes to confidence, when we show that it is just.
