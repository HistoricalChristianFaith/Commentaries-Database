"And she fell at His feet." She is more ardent than her sister. She regarded not the multitude, nor the suspicion which they had concerning Him, for there were many of His enemies, who said, "Could not this man, which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died?"; but cast out all mortal things in the presence of her Master, and was given up to one thing only, the honor of that Master.

(Hom. lxiii. 1) She is more fervent than her sister. Forgetful of the crowd around her, and of the Jews, some of whom were enemies to Christ, she threw herself at her Master's feet. In His presence all earthly things were nought to her; she thought of nothing but giving Him honour.
