And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a damsel came to hearken, named Rhoda. And when she knew Peter's voice, she opened not the gate for gladness. Mark even the servant-girls, how full of piety they are. But ran in, just as we are wont to do, she was eager to be herself the bringer of the good tidings, for good news it was indeed.

And mark how the very servant-girls were henceforth upon an equality with them. "For joy," it says, "she opened not." This too is well done, that they likewise may not be amazed by seeing him at once, and that they may be incredulous, and their minds may be exercised.
