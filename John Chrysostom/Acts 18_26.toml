If this man knew only the baptism of John, how is it that he was fervent in the Spirit, for the Spirit was not given in that way? And if those after him needed the baptism of Christ, much more would he need it. Then what is to be said? For it is not without a meaning that the writer has strung the two incidents together. It seems to me that this was one of the hundred and twenty who were baptized with the Apostles: or, if not so, then the same that took place in the case of Cornelius, took place also in the case of this man. But neither does he receive baptism. That expression, then, they expounded more perfectly, seems to me to be this, that he behooved also to be baptized. Because the other twelve knew nothing accurate, not even what related to Jesus. And it is likely that he did in fact receive baptism. But if these (disciples) of John, after that baptism again received baptism, was this needful for the disciples also? And wherefore the need of water? These are very different from him, men who did not even know whether there were a Holy Ghost. He was fervent, then, in the Spirit, knowing only the baptism of John: but these expounded to him more perfectly. And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him; who, when he had come, helped them much which had believed through grace.

The boldness of the man was great: he spoke precisely about Jesus, but he was in need of precision, of other further teaching. And still, in this way, even though [Apollos] did not know all, he had, because of his eagerness, drawn to himself the Holy Spirit, just as those at the house of Cornelius.

It was not for nothing that [Paul] left them at Ephesus. For Apollos’s sake the Spirit planned this, so that he might advance upon Corinth with greater force.
