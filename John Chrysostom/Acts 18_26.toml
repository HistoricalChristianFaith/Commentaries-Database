The boldness of the man was great: he spoke precisely about Jesus, but he was in need of precision, of other further teaching. And still, in this way, even though [Apollos] did not know all, he had, because of his eagerness, drawn to himself the Holy Spirit, just as those at the house of Cornelius.

"And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto them, and expounded unto him the way of God more perfectly." It was not for nothing that Paul left them at Ephesus, but for Apollos' sake, the Spirit so ordered it, that he might come with greater force to the attack upon Corinth. What may be the reason that to him they did nothing, but Paul they assault? They knew that he was the leader, and great was the name of the man. Great was the boldness of the man. He taught diligently the things concerning Jesus, but he needed more diligent teaching.
