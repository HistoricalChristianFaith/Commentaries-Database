Why did they not say, Because they cast out the demon, they were guilty of impiety against God? For this was a defeat to them: but instead of that, they have recourse to a charge of treason (ἐ πὶ καθοσίωσιν): like the Jews when they said, We have no king but Cæsar: whoso makes himself a king speaks against Cæsar. John 19:14 (c) And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat them.

by doing what? Then why did you not drag them (hither) before this? Being Jews: the name was in bad odor. And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans. Acts 16:21 They made a charge of treason of it (εἰς καθοσίωσιν ἤγαγον).
