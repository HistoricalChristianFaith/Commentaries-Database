And there was no temple! And yet the Gentiles also had been driven out: for that is why he mentions this: Whom God drove out, he says, before the face of our fathers. Whom He drove out, he says: and even then, no Temple! And so many wonders, and no mention of a Temple! So that, although first there is a Tabernacle, yet nowhere a Temple. Until the days of David, he says: even David, and no Temple!
