And what does he now call his country? As it seems to me, Nazareth. “For he did not do many mighty works there,” it is said, but in Capernaum he did miracles. Thus Jesus also said, “And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You shall be brought down to hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day.”
