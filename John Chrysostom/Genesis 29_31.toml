See God’s creative wisdom. Whereas one woman by her beauty attracted her husband’s favor, the other seemed to be rejected because she lacked it. But it was the latter God awoke to childbirth while leaving the other’s womb inactive. He thus dealt with each in his characteristic love so that one might have some comfort from what was born of her and the other might not triumph over her sister on the score of charm and beauty.
