Although My trouble urges Me to say this,  yet I say the opposite, 'Glorify Your Name,' that is, Lead Me henceforth to the Cross; which greatly shows His humanity, and a nature unwilling to die, but clinging to the present life, proving that He was not exempt from human feelings. For as it is no blame to be hungry, or to sleep, so neither is it to desire the present life; and Christ indeed had a body pure from sin, yet not free from natural wants, for then it would not have been a body. By these words also He taught something else. Of what kind is that? That if ever we be in agony and dread, we even then start not back from that which is set before us; and by saying,  Glorify Your Name He shows that He dies for the truth calling the action, glory to God. And this fell out after the Crucifixion. The world was about to be converted, to acknowledge the Name of God, and to serve Him, not the Name of the Father only, but also that of the Son; yet still as to this He is silent.

There came therefore a Voice from Heaven, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.

When had He glorified it? By what had been done before; and I will glorify it again after the Cross. What then said Christ?

He teaches us here that if we ever are in agony and dread, we should not shrink back from what is set before us.… He shows us that he is dying for the truth, calling the action “glory to God.” And this is indeed how things happened after the crucifixion. The world was about to be converted and to acknowledge the name of God.
