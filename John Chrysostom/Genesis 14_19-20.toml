He not only blessed him but also praised God. In the words “blessed be Abraham by God the most high, who created heaven and earth,” he also highlighted to us God’s power as distinguished from his creatures. If he in fact is God, Creator of heaven and earth, those worshiped by human beings would not be gods; Scripture says, remember, “Let those gods perish who did not make heaven and earth.” The text reads, “Blessed be God, who delivered your enemies into your hands.” Notice, I ask you, how he not only celebrates the just man but also acknowledges God’s assistance. After all, without grace from above he could not have prevailed over the might of those besetting him. “Who delivered your enemies,” the text says, namely, he it is who caused everything, he it is who rendered the strong powerless, he it is who brought down the armed hordes through those unarmed. From that source is the grace coming forth that provides you with such power.
