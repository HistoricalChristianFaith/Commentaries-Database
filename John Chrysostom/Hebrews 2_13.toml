This indeed he brings forward naturally. But this "I will put my trust in Him" [2 Samuel 22:3], what does it mean? For what follows this is also [introduced] naturally. "Behold, I and the children which God has given Me." [385 8:18] For as here He shows Himself a Father, so before, a Brother. "I will declare Your name unto My brethren," He says.

And again he indicates the superiority and the great interval [between us], by what follows [Hebrews 2:14]: "Since then the children," he says, "are partakers of flesh and blood" you see where he says the likeness is? In reference to the flesh), "in like manner He also Himself took part of the same." Let all the Heretics be ashamed, let those hide their faces who say that He came in appearance and not in reality.  For he did not say, "He took part of these" only, and then say no more; although had he said thus, it would have been sufficient, but he asserted something more, adding "in like manner," not in appearance, he means, or by an image (since in that case "in like manner" is not preserved) but in reality; showing the brotherhood.
