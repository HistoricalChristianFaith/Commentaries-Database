Now that the Lord had given sufficient proof of His virtue, and the cross was at hand, even at the door, Hedid those things which were about to excite them against Him with a greater openness; therefore although He had so often gone up to Jerusalem, He never however had done so in such a conspicuous manner as now.Theophlyact: That thus, if they were willing, they might recognize His glory, and by the prophecies, which were fulfilled concerning Him, know that He is very God; and that if they would not, they might receive a greater judgment, for not having believed so many wonderful miracles. Describing therefore this illustrious entrance, the Evangelist say, "And when they came nigh unto Jerusalem, and Bethany, at the mount of Olives, he sendeth forth two of His disciples.”.
Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Not indeed that He was compelled by necessity to ride on a colt from the mount of Olives to Jerusalem, for He had gone over Judaea and all Galilee on foot, but this action of His is typical. It goes on: “And many spread their garments in the way;” that is, under the feet of the colt; “and others cut down branches off the trees, and strawed them in the way.”.
Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: Thus then they give glory to God, saying, “Blessed is he that cometh in the name of the Lord.” They also bless the kingdom of Christ, saying, “Blessed by the kingdom of our father, David, which cometh.”.
Cat. in Marc. Oxon.: And further, they give glory to God, when they add, “Hosanna in the highest,” that is, praise and glory be to the God of all, Who is in the highest.
