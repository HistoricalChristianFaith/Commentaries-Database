And see how admirably Paul has put it. He did not say, 'Esteeming heaven, and the things in heaven,' 'greater riches than the treasures of Egypt,' but what? The reproach of Christ. For the being reproached for the sake of Christ he accounted better than being thus at ease; and this itself by itself was reward.

Choosing rather (he says) to suffer affliction with the people of God. For you indeed suffer on your own account, but he chose [to suffer] for others; and voluntarily threw himself into so many dangers, when it was in his power both to live religiously, and to enjoy good things.

Than (he says) to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season. He called unwillingness to suffer affliction with the rest sin: this, he says, [Moses] accounted to be sin. If then he accounted it sin not to be ready to suffer affliction with the rest, it follows that the suffering affliction must be a great good since he threw himself into it from the royal palace.

But this he did, seeing some great things before him. Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt. What is, the reproach of Christ? It is being reproached in such ways as you are, the reproach which Christ endured; Or that he endured for Christ's sake: for that rock was Christ 1 Corinthians 10:4; the being reproached as you are.

But what is the reproach of Christ? That [because] we repudiate the [ways] of our fathers we are reproached; that we are evil-entreated when we have run to God. It was likely that he also was reproached, when it was said to him, Will you kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday? Exodus 2:14 This is the reproach of Christ, to be ill-treated to the end, and to the last breath: as He Himself was reproached and heard, If Thou be the Son of God Matthew 27:40, from those for whom He was crucified, from those who were of the same race. This is the reproach of Christ when a man is reproached by those of his own family, or by those whom he is benefiting. For [Moses] also suffered these things from the man who had been benefited [by him].

In these words he encouraged them, by showing that even Christ suffered these things, and Moses also, two illustrious persons. So that this is rather the reproach of Christ than of Moses inasmuch as He suffered these things from His own. John 1:11 But neither did the one send forth lightnings, nor the Other feel any [anger], but He was reviled and endured all things, while they wagged their heads. Matthew 27:39 Since therefore it was probable that they [the readers] also would hear such things, and would long for the Recompense, he says that even Christ and Moses had suffered the like. So then ease is [the portion] of sin; but to be reproached, of Christ. For what then do you wish? The reproach of Christ, or ease?
