For as before the resurrection it was necessary that many signs should be done, in order that they might believe that he was the Son of God, so it was also necessary after the resurrection, in order that they might admit that he had arisen. Another reason why he added “In the presence of his disciples” is because he conversed with them alone after the resurrection. Therefore he also said, “The world sees me no more.”
