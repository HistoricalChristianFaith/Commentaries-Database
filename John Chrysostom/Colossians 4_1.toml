What is "just"? What is "equal"? To place them in plenty of everything, and not allow them to stand in need of others, but to recompense them for their labors. For, because I have said that they have their reward from God, do not thou therefore deprive them of it. And in another place he says, "forbearing threatening" [Ephesians 6:9], wishing to make them more gentle; for those were perfect men; that is, "with what measure you measure, it shall be measured unto you." [Matthew 7:2] And the words, "there is no respect of persons," are spoken with a view to these,  but they are assigned to the others, in order that these may receive them. For when we have said to one person what is applicable to another, we have not corrected him so much, as the one who is in fault. "You also," along with them, he says. He has here made the service common, for he says, "knowing that you also have a Master in heaven."
