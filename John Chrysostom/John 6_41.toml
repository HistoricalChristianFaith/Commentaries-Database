His meaning is, “You must hear spiritually what relates to me, for he who hears carnally neither profits nor gathers any advantage.” It was carnal to question how Jesus came down from heaven, to consider him as the son of Joseph, to ask, “How can he give us his flesh to eat?” All this was carnal when, instead, they ought to have understood the matter in a mystical and spiritual sense. “But,” says someone, “how could they understand what ‘eating flesh’ might mean?” Then it was their duty to wait for the proper time and enquire, and not to abandon him.
