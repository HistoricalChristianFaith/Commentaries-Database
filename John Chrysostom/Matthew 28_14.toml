They were correct in saying earlier that “the last fraud will be worse than the first.” They were in effect making this declaration against themselves. After so much violent conduct they ought to have repented, but rather they strove to outdo their former lunacies, feigning absurd fictions. When he was alive, they purchased his blood. When he was dead and risen again, they again by money were striving to undermine the evidence of his resurrection.
