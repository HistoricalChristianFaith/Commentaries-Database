And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates: and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans. And they came and besought them, and brought them out, and desired them to depart out of the city. They feared, it says: because the men were Romans, not because they had unjustly cast them into prison. And besought them to depart out of the city: begged them as a favor. Observe how diversely grace manages things: how Peter went out, how Paul, though both were Apostles.
