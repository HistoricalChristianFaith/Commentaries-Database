5. "But I will come to you," says he, "when I shall have passed through Macedonia." This he had said also above; then however with anger: at least he added, [1 Corinthians 4:19] "And I will know not the speech of them that are puffed up, but the power:" but here, more mildly; that they might even long for his coming. Then, that they might not say, "Why is it that you honor the Macedonians above us?" he said not, "When I depart," but, "When I shall have passed through Macedonia; for I do pass through Macedonia."
