The Evangelists distributed the periods among themselves. Matthew, having cut short his notice of the time before John the Baptist was bound, hurries to that which follows, while the Evangelist John not only does not cut short this period but dwells on it the most. Matthew, after the return of Jesus from the wilderness, says nothing about the intervening period as John does. He says nothing about what the Jews send and said. He skips over all of this and passes immediately to John’s imprisonment. “For,” he says, “Jesus having heard” that John was betrayed, “withdrew from there.” But John does not [say this]. He is silent about the journey into the wilderness described by Matthew. Instead, he relates what followed the descent form the mountain, and after having gone through many circumstances, he then adds, “For John was not yet cast into prison.”

Why does Jesus come to him now? Why does he come not merely once, but this second time also? Matthew says that his coming was necessary because of baptism since Jesus adds that he did this “to fulfill all righteousness.” But John says that he came again after his baptism when he says, “I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it rested upon him.” Why then did he come to John, since he did not come casually but went expressly to him?… Since John had baptized him with many [others], he came so that no one might think that he had hurried to John for the same reason as the rest, that is, to confess his sins and wash in the river for repentance. He comes, in other words, to give John an opportunity of setting this opinion right again. For by saying, “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world,” he removes the whole suspicion. For it is obvious that one pure enough to be able to wash away the sins of others does not come to confess sins but to give an opportunity to that marvelous herald to impress what he had said more definitely on those who had heard his former words.
