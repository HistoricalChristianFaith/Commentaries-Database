How then, when the judge said, “You take him, and judge him according to your law,” did you reply, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,” while here you flee to the Law? And consider the charge, “He made himself the Son of God.” Tell me, is this the ground of your accusation, that is, that he who performed the deeds of the Son of God should call himself the Son of God? And so what does Christ do? While they held this dialogue with each other, he held his peace, fulfilling that saying of the prophet that “he opens not his mouth. In his humiliation his judgment was taken away.”
