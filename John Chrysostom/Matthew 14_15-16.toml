Note carefully the Teacher’s skill. Observe with what discretion he draws them toward believing. Observe how deliberately this unfolds. For he did not simply say, “I will feed them.” The deeper significance of that would have not been easily understood. So what does he say? “They need not go away; you give them something to eat.”He did not say “I give them” but “you give them.” For at this point their regard for him was essentially as to a man. They said to him, “We have only five loaves here and two fish.” At this point Mark adds, “They did not understand the saying, for their heart was hardened.”
