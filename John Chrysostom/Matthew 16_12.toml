He had not uttered that interpretation.

See how much good His reproof wrought. For it both led them away from the Jewish observances, and when they were remiss, made them more heedful, and delivered them from want of faith.

Because the disciples still grovelled about Jewish observances, the Lord sharply rebukes them for the benefit of all; whence it follows, “But Jesus knowing their thoughts said unto them, O ye of little faith, why consider yeamong yourselves because ye have no bread?”.
This He does that He may put away from them all care for food. But why did Henot reprove them, when they said, “Whence should we have so much bread in the wilderness?” for that seemed a more fitting occasion. He did not blame them at that time that He might not seem to be by that urged on to do miracles, and Hewas unwilling to find fault with them before the people. Also there was more reason in the charge, when after two miracles of multiplication of loaves, they had anxiety about food. Observe with what mildness He rebukes them; He makes an excuse in answer Himself, saying, “Do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves?”.
By this calling to mind what was past, and rousing their attention to what wasto come.
