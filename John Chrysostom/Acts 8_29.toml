Not now the Angel but the Spirit urges him. Why is this? Then, the vision took place, in grosser form, through the Angel, for this is for them that are more of the body, but the Spirit is for the more spiritual. And how did He speak to him? Of course, suggested it to him. Why does not the Angel appear to the other, and bring him to Philip? Because it is likely he would not have been persuaded, but rather terrified. Observe the wisdom of Philip: he did not accuse him, not say, I know these things exactly: did not pay court to him, and say, Blessed are you that readest. But mark his speech, how far it is from harshness alike and from adulation; the speech rather of a kind and friendly man. Do you understand what you read?
