And the Spirit said unto him. Not now the Angel but the Spirit urges him. Why is this? Then, the vision took place, in grosser form, through the Angel, for this is for them that are more of the body, but the Spirit is for the more spiritual. And how did He speak to him? Of course, suggested it to him.
