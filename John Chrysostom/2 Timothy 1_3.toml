Paul speaks of his blameless life, for he everywhere calls his life his conscience. Even when he was a persecutor, he understood himself as sustaining a good conscience in what he sought. Hence he says, “I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief,” all but saying, “Do not suspect that it was done of wickedness.” Here he commends his own disposition, that he not appear insincere in his love. What he is, in effect, saying is: “I am not false. I do not think one thing and profess another.”

How then, you will say, were unclean persons considered worthy of the gospel? Because they wished and longed for it. Among these, some, though in error, were attracted to him because they were not made unclean through disordered loves. Then there are others who were not rejected because they sought God of their own accord. In these ways, many even from their ancestors have received the true religion.
