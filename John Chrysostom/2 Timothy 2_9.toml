For just as it is not possible to bind a sunbeam or to shut it up within the house, so neither can the preaching of the word be bound. And what was much more, when the teacher was bound, the word flew abroad. He inhabited the prison, and yet his teaching winged its way everywhere throughout the world!

Any cloud passing over our skies may from time to time make us gloomy. But Paul’s heart had no such storms sweeping over it. Or better, there did sweep over him, and often, many storms, but his day was not darkened. Rather in the midst of the temptations and dangers the light shone out. Thus when bound with his chain he kept exclaiming, “The word of God is not bound.” Thus continually by means of that tongue the Word was sending forth its rays.

For what could be better than those bonds which always in his Epistles he prefers to all things else, saying, "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ:" and again, "On this account I am bound with this chain, but the word of God is not bound;" and, "Even unto bonds, as an evil-doer." The punishment was twofold. For if indeed he had been so bound, as with a view to his good, the thing would have carried with it some consolation: but now he is bound both "as an evil-doer," and as with a view to very ill consequences; yet for none of these things cared he.
