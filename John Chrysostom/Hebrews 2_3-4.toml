“How then shall we,” Paul says, “escape if we neglect so great a salvation?” Here he signifies that the other salvation was no great thing.… For it is not from wars, Paul says, that Christ will now rescue us, nor will he bestow on us the earth and the good things that are in the earth; rather it will be the dissolution of death, the destruction of the devil, the kingdom of heaven, everlasting life. For all these things he has briefly expressed by saying, “if we neglect so great a salvation.”

Why then ought we to “pay the closer attention”? Lest at any time, Paul says … we should fall away. And here he shows the grievousness of this falling away, in that it is a difficult thing for that which has fallen away to return again, inasmuch as it has happened through willful negligence. And he took this form of speech from the Proverbs. For Solomon says, “My son, take heed lest you fall away,” showing both the easiness of the fall and the grievousness of the ruin. That is, our disobedience is not without danger. And while by his mode of reasoning he shows that the chastisement is greater, yet again he leaves it in the form of a question and not as a conclusion. For indeed this is to make one’s discourse inoffensive, when one … leaves it in the power of the hearers to draw their own conclusions and thus be more greatly persuaded. The prophet Nathan does the same in the Old Testament11 as Christ does in Matthew, saying, “What will he do to the tenants” of that vineyard? In doing so he compels them to draw the conclusion themselves, for this is the greatest victory.

Even without a gift, the mere consciousness of a pure life would be sufficient to lift up a person; much more when the grace is added also. It was to the humble, to the simple, that it was given, and especially to the simple, for it is said, “with glad and generous hearts.” Hereby he urged them on, and, if they were growing negligent, gave them a spur. For the humble and those who imagine no great things concerning themselves become more earnest when they have received a gift, in that they have obtained more than they rightly deserve and think that they are not worthy of such a gift. But those who think they have done well, believing the gift to be something they deserve, are puffed up. This is why God dispenses this profitably, as one may see also in the church; for some have the word of teaching, while others do not have power to open their mouths. Let no one, he says, be grieved because of this. For “to each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.” For if the householder knows to whom he should entrust something, much more will God, who understands the mind of humans … One thing only is worthy of grief: sin; there is nothing else. Do not say, “Why am I not rich?” or “If I were rich, I would give to the poor.” You cannot know that you would not covet riches if you had any. For now indeed you say these things, but, if you were put to the test, you would be different. So also, when we are satisfied, we think that we are able to fast; but, when we have gone without food for a time, other thoughts come into us. Again, when we are away from strong drink, we think that we are able to master our appetite, but it is no longer so when we are caught by it.Do not say, “Oh, that I had the gift of teaching,” or “If I had it, I would have edified innumerable souls.” You cannot know whether or not this gift of teaching would be to your condemnation. You cannot know whether envy or sloth would not have disposed you to hide your talent.

You have a child, you have a neighbor, you have a friend, you have a brother, you have relatives. And, though publicly before the church you are not able to draw out a long discourse, to these you can exhort in private. Before them there is no need of rhetoric or elaborate discourse. Prove in this way that if you had skill of speech, you would not neglect it. But if in the small matter you are not faithful, how shall I trust you concerning the great? That every person can do this, hear what Paul says, how he charged even lay people. “Build one another up,” he says, “just as you are doing,” and, “Comfort one another with these words.” God knows how God should distribute gifts to every person. Are you better than Moses? Hear how he shrinks from the hardship: “Am I,” he says, “able to bear them? For you said to me, ‘Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries the sucking child.’ ” What then did God do? He took some of Moses’ spirit and gave it to the others, showing that, even when Moses bore them, the gift was not his own but was of the Spirit.

This is a great and trustworthy thing, as Luke also says in the beginning of his Gospel: “As they were delivered to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word.” One may ask, “How then was it confirmed? What if those that heard were forgers?” Paul rejects this objection and shows that the grace was not human. If they had gone astray, God would not have borne witness to them; for Paul continued, “God also bore witness.” Both they indeed bear witness and God bears witness too. How does God bear witness? Not by word or by voice, though this also would have been worthy of belief, but how? “By signs and wonders and various miracles.” He appropriately said, “various miracles,” declaring the abundance of the gifts, which was not so in the former dispensation—neither so great signs, nor so various. That is, we did not believe simply the eyewitnesses but signs and wonders; therefore, it is not they whom we believe, but God.
