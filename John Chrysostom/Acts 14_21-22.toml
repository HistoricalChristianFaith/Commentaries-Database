Then they went over all the cities in which they had been in danger. "And on the morrow," it says, "he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God." This they said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only by the Apostles, but by the disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the might of the preaching, and that they must themselves also suffer such things, that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles, but much more ready for the trials. Therefore also the Apostle himself said, "Having the same conflict which ye saw in me and heard." Persecutions succeeded to persecutions: wars, fightings, stonings.

These things, not less than the miracles, both made them more illustrious, and prepared for them a greater rejoicing. The Scripture nowhere says that they returned rejoicing because they had done miracles, but it does say that they rejoiced, that "they were counted worthy for that Name to suffer shame." And this they were taught of Christ, saying, "Rejoice not that the devils obey you." For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer aught for Christ's sake. "And that through much tribulation:" what sort of cheering is this? how did they persuade them, by telling them at the outset of tribulations?

"Then on the morrow," etc. And observe, first he goes forth to Derbe, and then comes back to Lystra and Iconium and Antioch, giving way to them while their passions are roused, but when they have ceased, then attacking them again. Do you mark, that it was not by supernatural grace that they managed all that they did, but by their own diligence? "Confirming," it says "the souls of the disciples:" "further establishing;" so that they were established, but they added more thereto. "And that we must," etc.: they foretold this, that they might not be offended.
