Ver. 2. "Grace, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and Christ Jesus our Lord."

These things which he before prayed for, he again invokes upon him. And observe how, at the very beginning, he excuses himself for not having come to him, nor seen him. For his words, "Till I come," and, "Hoping to come to you shortly," had led Timothy to expect his coming soon. For this he excuses himself, but he does not immediately mention the cause of his not coming, lest he should grieve him mightily. For he was detained in prison by the emperor. But when at the end of the Epistle he invited him to come to him, then he informed him of it. He does not at the outset plunge him into sorrow, but encourages the hope that he shall see him. "Greatly desiring to see you," and "Do your diligence to come unto me shortly." [2 Timothy 1:4, and 4:9] Immediately therefore he raises him up, and proceeds to praise him.
