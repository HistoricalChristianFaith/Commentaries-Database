Not only did he reply with restraint and continue on as well, but also he showed us the virtue in his own behavior by issuing an invitation in those words—the minister, the barbarian, seated in his chariot, inviting the man of lowly mien, despicable in attire, to mount and ride with him.

Observe again his piety; that though he did not understand, he read, and then after reading, examines. And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. Do you mark the eagerness, the longing desire? But should any say he ought to have waited for Philip to speak, the answer is, he does not know what is the matter: he could not in the least tell what the other was going to say to him, but supposed merely that he was about to receive some lesson of prophecy. And moreover, this was more respectful, that he did not draw him into his chariot, but besought him.
