Observe again his piety; that though he did not understand, he read, and then after reading, examines. And he desired Philip that he would come up and sit with him. The place of the Scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His generation? For His life is taken from the earth. And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray you, of whom speaks the prophet this? Of himself, or of some other man? Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same Scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.

Do you mark the eagerness, the longing desire? But should any say he ought to have waited for Philip (to speak), (the answer is), he does not know what is the matter: he could not in the least tell what the other was going to say to him, but supposed merely that he was about to receive some (lesson of) prophecy. And moreover, this was more respectful, that he did not draw him into his chariot, but besought him. And Philip, we have read, ran to him, and heard him reading; even the fact of his running, showed that he wished to say (something). And the place, it says, of the Scripture which he read was this: As a sheep He was led to the slaughter.

For it was necessary that he should ask, that he should desire it. Philip showed that he knew that the other man knew nothing, when he asks, “Do you understand what you are reading?” At the same time he shows that great indeed is the treasure within. It speaks well of the eunuch that he paid no attention to outward appearance. He did not ask, “Who are you?” He did not find fault with him or make false pretenses; he did not claim to know but confessed his ignorance. Therefore he learns. He shows his wound to the doctor. He saw at a glance that Philip both knows the matter and is willing to teach. Look how free he is from haughtiness! No splendor was presaged by his outward appearance. So desirous was he of learning and so attentive to the teachings that the saying, “He who seeks, finds,” was fulfilled in him.

Not only did he reply with restraint and continue on as well, but also he showed us the virtue in his own behavior by issuing an invitation in those words—the minister, the barbarian, seated in his chariot, inviting the man of lowly mien, despicable in attire, to mount and ride with him.
