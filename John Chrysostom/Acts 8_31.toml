For it was necessary that he should ask, that he should desire it. Philip showed that he knew that the other man knew nothing, when he asks, “Do you understand what you are reading?” At the same time he shows that great indeed is the treasure within. It speaks well of the eunuch that he paid no attention to outward appearance. He did not ask, “Who are you?” He did not find fault with him or make false pretenses; he did not claim to know but confessed his ignorance. Therefore he learns. He shows his wound to the doctor. He saw at a glance that Philip both knows the matter and is willing to teach. Look how free he is from haughtiness! No splendor was presaged by his outward appearance. So desirous was he of learning and so attentive to the teachings that the saying, “He who seeks, finds,” was fulfilled in him.
