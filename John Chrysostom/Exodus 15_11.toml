The Old Testament … says, “Who is like to you among the gods, O Lord?” What do you mean, Moses? Is there any comparison at all between the true God and false gods? Moses would reply, “I did not say this to make a comparison; but since I was talking to the Jews, who had a lofty opinion of demons, I condescended to their weakness and brought in the lesson I was teaching in this way.” Let me also say that since my discussion is with the Jews, who consider that Christ is mere man and one who violated their law, I compared him with those whom the pagan Greeks admire.
