3. Then again there is another consolation if indeed He who is hereafter to have all put in subjection under Him, has Himself also died and submitted to sufferings innumerable. [Hebrews 2:9] "But," he says, "we see Him who was made a little  lower than the angels, even Jesus, for the suffering of death" — then the good things again —"crowned with glory and honor." Do you see, how all things apply to Him? For the [expression], "a little," would rather suit Him, who was only three days in Hades, but not ourselves who are for a long time in corruption. Likewise also the [expression] "with glory and honor" will suit Him much more than us.

Again, he reminds them of the Cross, thereby effecting two things; both showing His care [for them] and persuading them to bear all things nobly, looking to the Master. For (he would say) if He who is worshipped of Angels, for your sake endured to have a little less than the Angels, much more ought thou who art inferior to the Angels, to bear all things for His sake. Then he shows that the Cross is "glory and honor," as He Himself also always calls it, saying, "That the Son of Man might be glorified" [John 11:5]; and, "the Son of Man is glorified." [John 12:23] If then He calls the [sufferings] for His servants' sake "glory," much more should you the [sufferings] for the Lord.

Do you see the fruit of the Cross, how great it is? fear not the matter: for it seems to you indeed to be dismal, but it brings forth good things innumerable. From these considerations he shows the benefit of trial. Then he says, "That He by the grace of God should taste death for every man."

"That by the grace of God," he says. And He indeed because of the grace of God towards us suffered these things. "He who spared not His Own Son," he says, "but delivered Him up for us all." [Romans 8:32] Why? He did not owe us this, but has done it of grace. And again in the Epistle to the Romans he says, "Much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ, has abounded unto many." [Romans 5:15]

"That by the grace of God He should taste death for every man," not for the faithful only, but even for the whole world: for He indeed died for all; But what if all have not believed? He has fulfilled His own [part].

Moreover he said rightly "taste death for  every man," he did not say "die." For as if He really was tasting it, when He had spent a little time therein, He immediately arose.

By saying then "for the suffering of death," he signified real death, and by saying "superior to angels," he declared the resurrection. For as a physician though not needing to taste the food prepared for the sick man, yet in his care for him tastes first himself, that he may persuade the sick man with confidence to venture on the food, so since all men were afraid of death, in persuading them to take courage against death, He tasted it also Himself though He needed not. "For," He says, "the prince of this world comes and finds nothing in Me." [John 14:30] So both the words "by grace" and "should taste death for every man," establish this.
