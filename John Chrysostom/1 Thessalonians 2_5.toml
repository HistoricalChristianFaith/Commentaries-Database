For neither at any time, he says, were we found using words of flattery; that is, we did not flatter, which is the part of deceivers, who wish to get possession and to domineer. No one can say that we flattered in order to rule, nor that we had recourse to it for the sake of wealth. Of this, which was manifest, he afterwards calls them to be witnesses. Whether we flattered, he says, ye know. But as to what was uncertain, namely, whether it were in the way of covetousness, he calls God to witness. Nor seeking glory of men, neither from you, nor from others, when we might have been burdensome, as Apostles of Christ; that is, not seeking after honors either, nor boasting ourselves, nor requiring attendance of guards. And yet even if we had done this, we should have done nothing out of character. For if persons sent forth by kings are nevertheless in honor, much more might we be. And he has not said, that we were dishonored, nor that we did not enjoy honors, which would have been to reproach them, but we did not seek them. We therefore, who, when we might have sought them, sought them not, even when the preaching required it, how should we do anything for the sake of glory? And yet even if we had sought them, not even in that case would there have been any blame. For it is fit that those men who are sent forth from God, as ambassadors now coming from heaven, should enjoy great honor.

But with an excess of forbearance we do none of these things, that we may stop the mouths of the adversaries. And it cannot be said, that to you we act thus, but not so others. For thus also he said in his Epistle to the Corinthians: For you bear with a man if he brings you into bondage, if he devours you, if he takes you captive, if he exalts himself, if he smites you on the face. 2 Corinthians 11:20 And again, His bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account. 2 Corinthians 10:10 And again, Forgive me this wrong. 2 Corinthians 12:13 He shows there also that he was exceeding humble from his suffering so many things. But here he also says concerning money, when we might have been burdensome, as Apostles of Christ.
