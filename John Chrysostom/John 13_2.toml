This the Evangelist has said  amazed, showing that Jesus washed the man who had already chosen to betray Him. This also proves his great wickedness, that not even the having shared the salt restrained him, (a thing which is most able to restrain wickedness;) not the fact that even up to the last day, his Master continued to bear with him.

The Evangelist inserts this as if in astonishment, showing that our Lord was about to wash the feet of the very person who had resolved to betray him. This also proves the great wickedness of Judas that even partaking of the same table, which checks the behavior of even the worst people, did not stop him.
