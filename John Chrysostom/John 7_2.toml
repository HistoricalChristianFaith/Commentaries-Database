It appears here that a considerable time had passed since the last events. For when our Lord sat upon the mount, it was near the feast of the Passover, and now, it is the Feast of Tabernacles. In the five intermediate months, then, the Evangelist has related nothing but the miracle of the loaves and the conversation with those who ate of them. As our Lord was unceasingly working miracles and holding disputes with people â€¦ the Evangelists could not relate all [events] but only aimed at giving those in which complaint or opposition had followed on the part of the Jews, as was the case here.
