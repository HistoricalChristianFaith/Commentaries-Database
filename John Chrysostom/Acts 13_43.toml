"And when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and worshipping proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas" - after this point he puts Paul first - "who, speaking unto them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God." Do you observe the eagerness, how great it is? They "followed" them, it says. Why did they not baptize them immediately? It was not the proper time: there was need to persuade them in order to their steadfast abiding therein.

See the Apostles on all occasions exhorting, not merely accepting men, nor courting them, but, "speaking unto them," it says, "they persuaded them to continue in the grace of God."
