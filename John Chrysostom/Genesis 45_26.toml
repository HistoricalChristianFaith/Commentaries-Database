Who could describe the joy he experienced then on learning that Joseph was alive and in fact enjoyed such wonderful fame? You know, of course, that it is unexpected blessings that give rise to the keenest surge of enjoyment. Well, in this case the person he thought for so many years had become the prey of wild beasts he now learned had attained complete authority over Egypt; so how could he fail to be dumbfounded by the greatness of his joy? After all, what is caused by excessive despair is often the effect also of extreme rejoicing. We can see many people shedding tears from exceeding joy, whereas others are frequently rendered speechless when they see things they did not expect to happen, and suddenly behold alive those they thought to be dead.
