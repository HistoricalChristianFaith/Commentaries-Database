[God] will glorify him “by means of” himself, not by means of another. And he “will immediately glorify him,” that is, … not at some distant time after the resurrection. His glory will appear immediately while he is still on the cross. And indeed, the sun was darkened, the rocks split open, the veil of the temple was parted in two, many bodies of saints that slept arose, the tomb had its seals, the guards sat by, and while a stone lay over the body the body rose.… This happened not through the agency of angels or archangels, not by any other power, but by himself.
