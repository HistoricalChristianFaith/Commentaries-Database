“Treasures bring no profit to the unrighteous.” What then? Did not many avoid death by paying money? Certainly, but they did not get free from sin and in fact they prepared for themselves a life much worse than death. Therefore let us not put our confidence in wealth but in virtue. Indeed when justice comes to deadly sins, people are taken away by death. Would they not rather receive profit from being righteous than from treasures amassed on the earth, “where they grow rusty and moth-eaten, and thieves break in to steal them?” Thus, justice not only saves those who possess it but also leads many others to desire it, and always transports them from death to eternal immortality.
