And observe how everywhere they make it of great importance that the Passion should first be confessed. "Whom God Raised Up," says he. This was the great thing; and observe how he sets it in the middle of his discourse: for the former matters had been confessed; both the miracles and the signs and the slaying. "Whom God," says he, "raised up, having loosed the pains of death, because it was not possible that He should be kept in its power." It is something great and sublime that he has hinted at here. For the expression, "It was not possible," even itself is that of one assigning something. It shows that death itself in holding Him had pangs as in travail, and was sore bestead: whereas, by pains, or, travail-pangs, of death, the Old Testament means danger and disaster: and that He so rose as never more to die. For the assertion, "Seeing that it was not possible that He should be holden of it," means this, that His rising was not common to the rest.

"Having loosed the pangs of death." He that gives Death trouble, may much more give trouble to them that crucified Him: however, nothing of the kind is here said, as that He had power to slay you. For one that is in pain like a woman in travail, does not hold the thing held, and is not active but passive; and makes haste to cast it off. For it is always a point of great importance with them to show that He was once dead. Though ye should deny it, says he, those present will bear witness to the fact.
