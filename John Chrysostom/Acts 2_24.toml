“But God raised him up, having freed him from the pangs of death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.” Here he hinted at something great and sublime, for the expression “it was impossible” is in itself that of one assigning something. It shows that even death itself, when it held him, experienced birth pangs and suffered terribly (by pangs of death the Old Testament means danger and disaster). It also shows that he so rose as never again to die. For the words “because it was impossible for him to be held in its power” mean that his resurrection was not common to the rest.
