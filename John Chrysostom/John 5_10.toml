Hear what he says ("He that made me whole . . ."), all but saying, You are silly and mad who bid me not to take Him for my Teacher who has delivered me from a long and grievous malady, and not to obey whatever He may command.  Had he chosen to act in an unfair manner, he might have spoke differently, as thus, I do not this of my own will, but at the bidding of another; if this be a matter of blame, blame him who gave the order, and I will set down the bed. And he might have concealed the cure, for he well knew that they were vexed not so much at the breaking of the Sabbath, as at the curing of his infirmity. Yet he neither concealed this, nor said that, nor asked for pardon, but with loud voice confessed and proclaimed the benefit. Thus did the paralytic; but consider how unfairly they acted. For they said  not, Who is it that has made you whole? on this point they were silent, but kept on bringing forward the seeming transgression.
