Paul specifies that it was fourteen years before in order to show that he would not normally have spoken about it at all had he not been provoked. And even then, notice that there are some things he is still ignorant about. He knows that he was in paradise, but whether he was in the body or not he cannot tell. Why did this happen to him? I think it was probably so that he would not feel inferior to the other apostles, who had all been with Christ while he was on earth.
