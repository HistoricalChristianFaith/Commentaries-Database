And as before He threatens punishment to such as do not receive them, here He defines also a certain refreshment for the good. And to teach you His greater care for them, He said not simply, He that receives a prophet, or He that receives a righteous man, but subjoined, in the name of a prophet, and, in the name of a righteous man; that is, if not for any worldly preferment, nor for any other temporal thing, he receive him, but because he is either a prophet or a righteous man, he shall receive a prophet's reward, and a righteous man's reward; such as it were meet for him to have, that has received a prophet, or a righteous man; or, such as that other is himself to receive. Which kind of thing Paul also said: That your abundance may be a supply for their want, that their abundance also may be a supply for your want. 2 Corinthians 8:14
