Consider … in this instance, I ask you, the servant’s great prudence. What in fact did he say? “I will not eat until I have said my piece.”“Whereas you have made a show of your resources,” he says, “I, for my part, will not attach any importance to resting until I inform you of the reason why I was sent on this mission, why I arrived here from Canaan, and how I was guided to your house. Thus, by learning everything, you will give evidence of your own good dispositions toward my master.”

See how the servant narrates everything to them with precision: “I am servant of that man Abraham,” he says, “whom you know; so, learn that he enjoyed such blessing from the Lord of all as to arrive at great wealth.” Then, to teach them the abundance of his wealth, he said, “Sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and asses” came his way. Take heed, you people of wealth, you who acquire such and such acres of land day in and day out, building baths and walkways and splendid buildings—see in what lay the good man’s riches: no property, no buildings, no empty display of luxury, but rather sheep and cattle, camels and asses, servants male and female. The text added in another place that they were all born in the household, so that you could learn how Abraham gained so many servants. “So this master of mine came into such great wealth and enjoyed great favor from on high; when he had reached old age Sarah bore him a son, and, having this only child, he has already made him heir of everything. He has given him everything he owned.”
