There is no praise like this, being unblamable, and giving no handle in the things of God. For when he says, "approved in Christ," he includes the whole list of virtues.

For so far as he is addressing, and that too one along with another, and in the same letter, he honors them all alike.

He does not excite envy by honoring one and not the other, but neither does he cater to cynicism by praising them all in exactly the same way.
