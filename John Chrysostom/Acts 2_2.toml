As of a rushing mighty wind:
this betokens the exceeding vehemence of the Spirit, but not for the apostlesâ€™ sake, but because of the Jews who were then present. Observe how it is always, "as of"; and rightly: that you may have no gross sensible notions of the Spirit, therefore it was not a wind.
