Thus Moses was the greatest of the prophets, yet he, when others were to receive the Spirit, suffered diminution himself. But here it is not so. For just as fire kindles as many lamps as it will, so here the abundance of the Spirit was shown. Each one received a spring of Spirit, just as he himself said, that those who believe in him shall have “a spring of water gushing up to eternal life.” And it was justly so. For they were not going forth to argue with the pharaoh but to wrestle with the devil. The wonderful thing is this: they made no objections when they were sent; they did not say they were “weak in voice and slow of speech.” For Moses had taught them better. They did not say they were too young. Jeremiah had made them wise. And yet they heard many fearful things, much worse than what was in former times, but they were afraid to object. For they were angels of light and the servants of things on high. No one from heaven appeared to people of former times, because they were in pursuit of matters on earth. But when man ascended on high, the Spirit descends from on high, “like the rush of a mighty wind.” Through this it is made clear that nothing will be able to stand against them and they will blow away all adversaries like a heap of dust.

For in the case of the apostles too, there was a “sound of a mighty wind,” and visions of fiery tongues appeared, but not for the apostles’ sake, but because of the Jews who were then present. Nevertheless, even though no sensible signs take place, we receive the things that have been once manifested by them. Since the dove itself at that time therefore appeared, that as in place of a finger (so to say) it might point out to them that were present, and to John, the Son of God. Not however merely on this account, but to teach you also, that upon you no less at your baptism the Spirit comes. But since then we have no need of sensible vision, faith sufficing instead of all. For signs are “not for them that believe but for them that believe not.”
