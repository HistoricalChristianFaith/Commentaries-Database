How then says He, I have many things to tell you, but you cannot bear them now? John 16:12 By the all and the hearing He shows nothing else, but that He uttered nothing alien, but only what was of the Father. And since to speak of secrets appears to be the strongest proof of friendship, you have, He says, been deemed worthy even of this communion. When however He says all, He means, whatever things it was fit that they should hear. Then He puts also another sure proof of friendship, no common one. Of what sort was that?
