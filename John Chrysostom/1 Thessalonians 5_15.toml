"See that none render unto any one evil for evil; but alway follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all."

If we ought not to render evil for evil, much less evil for good; much less, when evil has not been previously done, to render evil. Such an one, you say, is a bad man, and has aggrieved me, and done me much injury. Do you wish to revenge yourself upon him? Do not retaliate. Leave him unpunished. Well, is this the stopping-place? By no means; "But alway follow after that which is good, one toward another, and toward all."

This is the higher philosophy, not only not to requite evil with evil, but to render good for evil. For this is truly revenge that brings harm to him and advantage to thyself, or rather great advantage even to him, if he will. And that thou mayest not think that this is said with respect to the faithful, therefore he has said, "both one toward another and toward all."
