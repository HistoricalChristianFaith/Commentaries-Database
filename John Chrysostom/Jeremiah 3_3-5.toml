And this again is the peculiarity of harlots that they are his who gives the gold. Even if he is a slave or a gladiator, or any person whatever, yet if he offers their hire they receive him. But the free, even should they be nobler than all, they do not accept without the money.… For that shamelessness makes harlots, hear the prophet saying, “You were shameless toward all. You had a harlot’s countenance.” This may be said to the covetous also, “You were shameless toward all,” not toward these or those, but “toward all.”

What then is one to do?… We ought not to apply punishment merely to the scale of the offense. Rather, keep in view the disposition of the sinner so that, while wishing to mend what is torn, you do not make the rent worse. Because you do not wish, in your zealous endeavors to restore what is fallen, to make the ruin greater. Weak and careless characters are addicted for the most part to the pleasures of the world. If they have the opportunity to be proud of their birth and position, they may yet, if gently and gradually brought to repent of their errors, be delivered, partially at least, if not perfectly, from the evils by which they are possessed. But if anyone were to inflict the discipline all at once he would deprive them of this slight chance of amendment. When the soul has been forced to put off shame, it lapses into a callous condition. It neither yields to kindly words, nor bends to threats nor is susceptible of gratitude but becomes far worse than that city that the prophet reproached, saying, “You had the face of a harlot, refusing to be ashamed before all men.”
