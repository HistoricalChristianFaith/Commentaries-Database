When John says, “I am not the Christ,” the Pharisees try to conceal what they were plotting within by asking him about Elijah and the prophet. But when he said that he was not any of these either, they leave behind any pretense and clearly show their treacherous intention, saying, “Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ?” And then again, wishing to throw some obscurity over the whole thing, they add “Elijah” and “the prophet.” For when they were not able to trip him up by their flattery, they thought that by an accusation they could compel him to say something he was not.What foolishness, insolence and ill-timed interference! You were sent to learn who John was and where he came from, not to involve him in an accusation. This too was the conduct of people who would compel him to confess himself to be the Christ. Still, he is not angry even now, nor does he, as might have been expected, say anything to them like, “Do you give orders and make laws for me?” But again he shows great gentleness toward them.
