Look, once again they pass a sentence in his favor. After saying “you are mad,” they release him not only from the death sentence but also from his chains. Indeed, they would have released him altogether had [Paul] not appealed to Caesar. But this happens providentially, likewise his departure in chains. “Even to the point of being chained like a criminal.” For if his Lord “was counted with the lawless ones,” all the more so ought he (Paul) to be. But just as the Lord had nothing in common with the character of those men, neither did Paul. For the wonder is then apparent: although he was mixed up with these men, in no way was he harmed by them.
