4. Wherefore "exhort ye one another daily, while it is called today." That is, edify one another, raise yourselves up: lest the same things should befall you. "Lest any one of you be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin." Do you see that sin produces unbelief? For as unbelief brings forth an evil life, so also a soul, "when it has come into a depth of evils, becomes contemptuous"  [Proverbs 18:3], and having become contemptuous it endures not even to believe, in order thereby to free itself from fear. For "they said" (one says), "The Lord shall not see, neither shall the God of Jacob regard." [Psalm 94:7] And again, "Our lips are our own: who is Lord over us?" [Psalm 12:4]; and again "Wherefore has the wicked man provoked God to wrath?" [Psalm 10:13]; and again, "The fool has said in his heart, there is no God; they are corrupt and become abominable in their doings." [Psalm 14:1] "There is no fear of God before his eyes, for he was deceitful before Him, to find out  his iniquity and to hate." [Psalm 36:1-2] Yea and Christ also says this same thing, "Every one that does evil, hates the light and comes not to the light." [John 3:20]

He said “today,” that they might never be without hope. “Exhort one another daily,” he says. That is, even if persons have sinned, as long as it is “today,” they have hope; let them not then despair so long as they live. Above all things indeed, he says, “Let there not be an evil, unbelieving heart.” But even if there should be, let no one despair, but let that one recover; for as long as we are in this world, the “today” is in season.
