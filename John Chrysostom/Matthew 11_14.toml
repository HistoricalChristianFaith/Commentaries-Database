Then He states also another infallible sign, saying, If you will receive it, he is Elias, which was for to come. For I will send you, it is said, Elias the Tishbite, who shall turn the heart of the father to the children. This man then is Elias, if you attend exactly, says He. For I will send, says He, my messenger before Your face.

And well has He said, If you will receive it, to show the absence of force. For I do not constrain, says He. And this He said, as requiring a candid mind, and showing that John is Elias, and Elias John. For both of them received one ministry, and both of them became forerunners. Wherefore neither did He simply say, This is Elias, but, If you are willing to receive it, this is he, that is, if with a candid mind ye give heed to what is going on. And He did not stop even at this.
