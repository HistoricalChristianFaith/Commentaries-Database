Do not be amazed when I tell you that Job did not speak these words. I mistake him for another. These are words that I lend to Job and are contrary to his benevolence and profound goodness. In fact, Job had no desire to say anything of the sort. He suffered righteously what he was suffering, so that he reasonably and wisely said that “he was not born.” This is exactly what Christ himself said about Judas: “It would have been better for that man if he had not been born.” And Job says much the same thing: “Why was I born? It would have been better if I had not been born.”
