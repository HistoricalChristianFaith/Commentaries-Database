Many meanspirited people, when we exhort them not to be overly concerned about burial or to give highest priority to having the remains of the dead brought back from foreign parts to their native land, quote this story to us, claiming that the patriarch also gave attention to it. First of all, however, as I said before, it must be remembered that the same set of values is not to be looked for at that time as it is with people of today. Second, the good man wanted this done not without reason but to let his descendants have a glimpse of the real prospect of returning themselves some day to the Promised Land …. I mean, for proof that future events become visible to the eyes of faith, listen to Jacob already calling death sleeping; he said, remember, “I want to sleep with my forebears,” Hence Paul also said, “By faith these people passed on without having received what was promised but having seen it from afar and greeted it.” How? By the eyes of faith. So let no one think Jacob’s instruction came from meanness of spirit. It was due to the times and the vision of the return that would be theirs. Acquit the good man of any blame. I mean, today when there has been a deepening of our values in the wake of Christ’s coming, it would be proper for someone to be blamed for worrying about things such as burial. Let him not think it a misfortune for someone to end his days in a foreign land or to pass from this life in solitude. After all, it is not such a person who deserves to be thought unfortunate, but the one who dies in sin, even if he dies in bed, at home, in the bosom of his family …. For proof that nothing of the kind causes any harm to the virtuous person, learn that good people generally—I mean the prophets and the apostles—with few exceptions were buried we know not where. Some, you see, were beheaded; others were stoned and so departed this life; others suffered countless punishments of different kinds for the sake of religion, while all were martyrs for Christ. No one would dare say about such people that their death was without honor; instead, it would be in keeping with those words of sacred Scripture, “Honorable in the sight of the Lord is the death of his holy ones.” Just as it called the death of holy people honorable, so listen also to Scripture calling the death of sinners wretched: “The death of sinners is wretched.” … So even if one ends one’s life at home, in the presence of wife and children, with relatives and friends at hand, but in fact one is bereft of virtue, such a person’s death would be wretched …. Even if the person endowed with virtue falls among brigands, even if he becomes the food of wild beasts, his death would be honorable. Tell me, after all, was not the son of Zacharias beheaded? Was not Stephen the first to be BDEcked in the martyr’s garland, stoned and so ended his life? Peter and Paul too: was not one beheaded, while the other, on the contrary, underwent the punishment of crucifixion and departed this life in that manner? Are they not for that reason in particular celebrated and eulogized everywhere in the world? With all this in mind let us neither lament those who meet their end in exile nor declare blessed those who depart this life at home. Instead, following the norm of sacred Scripture, let us declare blessed those who have passed away after a life of virtue and lament those who have died in sin …. It behooves us, then, as we ponder these truths, to be attentive to virtue and strive in this present life as though in a gymnasium so that, once the contest is over, we may succeed in donning the bright crown and not have futile regrets. As long as the contest lasts, you see, it is possible, if we wish it, to shake off indifference and cling to virtue so as to succeed in attaining the crowns laid up for us.
