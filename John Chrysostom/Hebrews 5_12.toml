At all events observe him continually travailing to introduce the discourse concerning the High Priest, and still putting it off. For hear how he began: "Having a great High Priest that is passed into the heavens"; and omitting to say how He was great, he says again, "For every High Priest taken from among men, is appointed for men in things pertaining to God." And again, "So Christ also glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest." And again after saying, "Thou art a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedech", he again puts off the subject, saying, "Who in the days of His Flesh offered prayers and supplications." When therefore he had been so many times repulsed, he says, as if excusing himself, The blame is with you. Alas! how great a difference! When they ought to be teaching others, they are not even simply learners, but the last of learners. "For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need again that some one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God." Here he means the Human Nature of Christ. For as in external literature it is necessary to learn the elements first, so also here they were first taught concerning the human nature.

Thou seest what is the cause of his uttering lowly things. So Paul did to the Athenians also, discoursing and saying, "The times of this ignorance God winked at: but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent, because He hath appointed a day in the which He will judge the world in righteousness by that Man whom He hath ordained, whereof He hath given assurance unto all men, in that He hath raised Him from the dead." Therefore, if he says anything lofty, he expresses it briefly, while the lowly statements are scattered about in many parts of the Epistle. And thus too he shows the lofty; since the very lowliness of what is said forbids the suspicion that these things relate to the Divine Nature. So here also the safe ground was kept.

"And are become such as have need of milk, not of strong meat." He always calls the lowly doctrine "milk," both in this place and in the other. "When," he says, "for the time ye ought to be teachers": because of that very thing, namely the time, for which ye ought especially to be strong, for this especially ye are become backsliding. Now he calls it "milk," on account of its being suited to the more simple. But to the more perfect it is injurious, and the dwelling on these things is hurtful. So that it is not fitting that matters of the Law should be introduced now or the comparison made from them, such as that He was an High Priest, and offered sacrifice, and needed crying and supplication. Wherefore see how these things are unhealthful to "us"; but at that time they nourished them being by no means unhealthful to them.

So then the oracles of God are true nourishment. "For I will give unto them," he saith, "not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord."

"I gave you milk to drink, and not meat"; He did not say, I fed you, showing that such nourishment as this is not food, but that the case is like that of little children who cannot be fed with bread. For such have not drink given them, but their food is to them instead of drink.

Moreover he did not say, "ye have need," but "ye are become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat." That is, ye willed it; ye have reduced yourselves to this, to this need.
