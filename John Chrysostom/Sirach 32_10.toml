What is the head of the virtues? Humility. He therefore begins with it, saying, “Blessed are the poor.” This head has neither tresses nor curls but a beauty such as to attract God to itself. “On whom,” he says, “will I turn my gaze but on the meek, humble one who fears my words?” And, “My eyes are on the meek of the earth.” And, “The Lord is near to the contrite of heart.” This head, instead of having hair and tresses, offers sacrifices pleasing to God. It is an altar of gold, a spiritual altar. “A contrite spirit, in fact, is a sacrifice to God.” This is the mother of wisdom. If someone has this, he will have the rest as well. Have you seen a head that you have never seen before? Do you want to see, indeed to know, the face as well? Observe first its red, blooming color, with many graces, and learn where these come from. Well, where do they come from? From decency and from blushing. For this reason someone said, “Grace precedes a modest person.” It sheds a great beauty even on the other members. Even if one mixes colors beyond number, they will not attain such beauty. If you want to see the eyes as well, observe that they are precisely delineated by modesty and temperance. They become so beautiful and perceptive that they are able to see even the Lord. Indeed, he says, “Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”
