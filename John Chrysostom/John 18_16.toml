But the wonder is that Peter, even though he was so afraid, still came even as far as the hall when the others had retreated. His coming this far was caused by love. He did not enter, however, because he was distressed and afraid. For the Evangelist has recorded these things to pave the way for excusing his denial. But with regard to himself, he does not set it down as any great matter that he was known to the high priest. And yet, since he had said that he alone went in with Jesus (in case you might think he was bragging), he also gives the reason why he went in. And that Peter would have also entered, had he been permitted, he shows by what happens next. For when John went out and asked the servant girl who kept the door to bring in Peter, he immediately came in. But why didnâ€™t John bring him in himself? It was because he clung to Christ and followed him. This is why he asked the woman to bring Peter in.
