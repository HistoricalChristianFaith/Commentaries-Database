"And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timotheus abode there still." See how he at one time gives way, at another presses on, and in many things takes his measures upon human considerations.

Why did he not stay? For if at Lystra, where he was stoned, he nevertheless stayed a long time, much more here. Why? The Lord did not wish them to be always doing signs; for this is itself a sign, not less than the working of signs - that being persecuted, they overcame without signs. So that just as now He prevails without signs, so was it on many occasions His will to prevail then. Consequently neither did the Apostles run after signs: as in fact he says himself, "We preach Christ crucified" (1 Cor. i. 23) - to them that crave signs, to them that crave wisdom, we give that which cannot even after signs persuade, and yet we do persuade! So that this was a mighty sign. See then, how when the preaching is extended, they are not in a hurry to run after signs.

"And immediately," it says, "the brethren sent away Paul." Here now they send Paul alone: for it was for him they feared, lest he should suffer some harm, the head and front of all being in fact none other than he. "They sent him away," it says, "as it were to the sea:" that it might not be easy for them to seize him. For at present they could not have done much by themselves; and with him they accomplished and achieved many things. For the present, it says, they wished to rescue him.
