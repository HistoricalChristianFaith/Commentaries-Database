And let us also that have money listen to these things. For not unto teachers only does He discourse, but also unto the rich. For either sort were entrusted with riches; those that teach with the more necessary wealth, you with what is inferior. When then at the time that the teachers are scattering abroad the greater, you are not willing to show forth your liberality even in the less, or rather not liberality but honesty (for you give the things of another), what excuse will you have? But now, before the punishment of them that do the contrary things, let us hear the honor of him that approves himself. For verily I say unto you, He will set him over all His goods.

What can be equal to this honor? What manner of speech will be able to set forth the dignity, the blessedness, when the King of Heaven, He that possesses all things, is about to set a man over all His goods? Wherefore also He calls him wise, because he knew, not to give up great things for small, but having been temperate here, has attained to Heaven.

Let everyone who is entrusted with riches listen carefully. He is not only speaking to teachers but to those who manage money. In both cases they are entrusted with riches. Those who teach are entrusted with a wealth that is far more necessary than those who deal with money. There are times when teachers have difficult times. If in these times you who have money are not willing to demonstrate your generosity, what excuse will you have? You need to exhibit both generosity and honesty, for the two go together.It is an honor to be entrusted with the responsibility of someone else’s resources. This happens to the faithful: “Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions.” What can be equal to this honor? What sort of speech would be fitting to this dignity? What sort of blessedness would accompany it? Here we are speaking of nothing less than the King of heaven who possesses all things. It is he who is setting a person “over all his possessions.” This is why he calls him to be wise. He must not spend large sums for small benefits. It is only having been responsible here in this life that he will receive the riches of heaven.
