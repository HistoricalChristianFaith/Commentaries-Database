To live in luxury does not seem in itself to be a manifest and admitted crime. But then it brings forth in us great evils—drunkenness, violence, extortion and plunder. For the prodigal and sumptuous liver, bestowing extravagant service on the belly, is often compelled to steal, and to seize the property of others and to use extortion and violence. If, then, you avoid luxurious living, you remove the foundation of extortion, and plunder, and drunkenness, and a thousand other evils, cutting away the root of iniquity from its extremity. Hence Paul says that “she who lives in pleasure is dead while she lives.”

It is not possible, not possible at all, for those who enjoy an easy life and freedom from want in this world, who continually indulge themselves in every way, who live randomly and foolishly, to enjoy honor in the other world. For if poverty does not trouble them, still desire troubles them and they are afflicted because of this, which brings more than a little pain. If disease does not threaten them, still their temper grows hot, and it requires more than an ordinary struggle to overcome anger. If trials do not come to test them, still evil thoughts continually attack. It is no common task to bridle foolish desire, to stop vain glory, to restrain presumption, to refrain from luxury, to persevere in austerity. A person who does not do these things and others like them cannot be saved. As testimony that those who live luxuriously cannot be saved, hear what Paul says about the widow: “she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.”

But since many who have children choose the state of widowhood, not to cut off the occasions of a worldly life, but rather to enhance them, that they may do what they will with the greater license, and indulge the more freely in worldly lusts: therefore he says, "She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth." Ought not a widow then to live in pleasure? Surely not. If then when nature and age is weak, a life of pleasure is not allowable, but leads to death, eternal death; what have men to say, who live a life of pleasure? But he says with reason, "She that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth."
