He did not say, note, “when their glory is increased,” but “the glory of their house.” All these things that I enumerated, after all—fountains, walkways and baths, gold and silver, horses and mules, carpets and clothes—are the glory of the house, not of the person living in the house. A person’s glory, in fact, is virtue, which takes the journey from here with its possessor. A house’s glory, by contrast, itself remains here, or rather, far even from remaining, it disappears along with the house, doing no good to the one who lived in it. It did not belong to him, after all.
