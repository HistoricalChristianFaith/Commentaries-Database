There are always people among us who want to diminish the force of words. When Paul clearly says that covetousness is idolatry, they immediately argue that this is an exaggerated saying and in this way compromise all the commandments. It is to these that the blessed Paul is alluding when he writes to the Ephesians, “Be sure of this, that no one who is covetous, that is, an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom.” Empty words are words that are for a moment attractive but in no way are proved by deeds. They become a flimsy deceit. .
