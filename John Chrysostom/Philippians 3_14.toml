See how great a distance this is that must be run over! See how great an ascent! Thither we must fly up with the wings of the Spirit, otherwise it is impossible to surmount this height. Thither must we go with the body, for it is allowed. For our citizenship is in heaven Philippians 3:20, there is the prize; do you see the runners, how they live by rule, how they touch nothing that relaxes their strength, how they exercise themselves every day in the pal√¶stra, under a master, and by rule? Imitate them, or rather exhibit even greater eagerness, for the prizes are not equal: many are those who would hinder you; live by rule: many are the things which relax your strength; make its feet agile: for it is possible so to do, it comes not naturally, but by our will. Let us bring it to lightness, lest our swiftness of foot be hindered by the weight of other things. Teach your feet to be sure, for there are many slippery places, and if you fall, straightway you lose much. But yet if you fall, rise up again. Even thus may you obtain the victory. Never attempt slippery things, and you will not fall; walk upon firm ground, up with your head, up with your eyes; these commands the trainers give to those who run. Thus your strength is supported; but if you stoop downward, you fall; you are relaxed. Look upward, where the prize is; the sight of the prize increases the determination of our will. The hope of taking it suffers not to perceive the toils, it makes the distance appear short. And what is this prize? No palm branch; but what? The kingdom of heaven, everlasting rest, glory together with Christ, the inheritance, brotherhood, ten thousand good things, which it is impossible to name. It is impossible to describe the beauty of that prize; he who has it alone knows it, and he who is about to receive it. It is not of gold, it is not set with jewels, it is far more precious. Gold is mire, in comparison with that prize, precious stones are mere bricks in comparison with its beauty. If you have this, and takest your departure to heaven, you will be able to walk there with great honor; the angels will reverence you, when you bear this prize, with much confidence will you approach them all. In Christ Jesus. See the humility of his mind; this I do, says he, in Christ Jesus, for it is impossible without an impulse from Him to pass over so vast an interval: we have need of much aid, of a mighty alliance; He has willed that you should struggle below, on high He crowns you. Not as in this world; the crown is not here, where the contest is; but the crown is in that bright place. See ye not, even here, that the most honored of the wrestlers and charioteers are not crowned in the course below, but the king calls them up, and crowns them there? Thus too is it here, in heaven you receive the prize.
