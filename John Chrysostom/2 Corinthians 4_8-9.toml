We are pressed on every side, yet not straitened; perplexed, yet not unto despair; pursued, yet not forsaken.

He still dwells upon proving that the whole work is to be ascribed to the power of God, repressing the highmindedness of those that glory in themselves. 'For not this only,' says he, 'is marvelous, that we keep this treasure in earthen vessels, but that even when enduring ten thousand hardships, and battered  on every side, we [still] preserve and lose it not. Yet though there were a vessel of adamant, it would neither have been strong enough to carry so vast a treasure, nor have sufficed against so many machinations; yet, as it is, it both bears it and suffers no harm, through God's grace.' For, "we are pressed on every side," says he, "but not straitened." What is, "on every side?"

'In respect of our foes, in respect of our friends, in respect of necessaries, in respect of other needs, by them which be hostile, by them of our own household.' "Yet not straitened." And see how he speaks contrarieties, that thence also he may show the strength of God. For, "we are pressed on every side, yet not straitened," says he; "perplexed, yet not unto despair;" that is, 'we do not quite fall off. For we are often, indeed, wrong in our calculations , and miss our aim, yet not so as to fall away from what is set before us: for these things are permitted by God for our discipline, not for our defeat.'

2 Corinthians 4:9. "Pursued, yet not forsaken; smitten down, yet not destroyed." For these trials do indeed befal, but not the consequences of the trials. And this indeed through the power and Grace of God. In other places indeed he says that these things were permitted in order both to their own  humble-mindedness, and to the safety of others: for "that I should not be exalted overmuch, there was given to me a thorn," [2 Corinthians 12:7] he says: and again, "Lest any man should account of me above that which he sees me to be, or hears from me;" and in another place again, "that we should not trust in ourselves:" [2 Corinthians 1:9] here, however, that the power of God might be manifested. Do you see how great the gain of his trials? For it both showed the power of God, and more disclosed His grace. For, says He, "My grace is sufficient for you." [2 Corinthians 12:9] It also anointed them unto lowliness of mind, and prepared them for keeping down the rest, and made them to be more hardy. "For patience," says he, "works probation, and probation hope." [Romans 5:4] For they who had fallen into ten thousand dangers and through the hope they had in God had been recovered , were taught to hold by it more and more in all things.
