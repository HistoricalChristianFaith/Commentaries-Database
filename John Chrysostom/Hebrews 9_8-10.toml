“This is a symbol for the present age,” the apostle says. What does he mean by “the present”? That time before the coming of Christ, for, after the coming of Christ, it is no longer a present age. How could it be, having arrived and being ended? There is something else as well that he indicates when he says, “which is symbolic for the present age,” that is, became the type. “Gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper.” You see now what is the meaning of “The law made nothing perfect,” and “If that first covenant had been faultless.” How? As pertaining to “the conscience.” For the sacrifices did not put away the defilement from the soul but still were concerned with the body: “after the law of a carnal commandment.”
