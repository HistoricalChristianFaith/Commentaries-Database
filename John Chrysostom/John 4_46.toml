The Evangelist reminds the hearer of the miracle to exalt the praise of the Samaritans. The men of Cana received Him by reason of the miracles which He had done in Jerusalem and in that place; but not so the Samaritans, they received Him through His teaching alone.

That He came then to Cana, the Evangelist has said, but he has not added the cause why He came.  Into Galilee He had come because of the envy of the Jews; but wherefore to Cana? At first He came, being invited to a marriage; but wherefore now? Methinks to confirm by His presence the faith which had been implanted by His miracle, and to draw them to Him the more by coming to them self-invited, by leaving His own country, and by preferring them.

And there was a certain nobleman whose son was sick at Capernaum.

On a former occasion our Lord attended a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Now he goes there to convert the people and confirm by his presence the faith that his miracle had produced. He leaves his own country of Capernaum and goes to Cana as a self-invited guest this time, showing his preference for Cana as he tries to draw them closer to him.
