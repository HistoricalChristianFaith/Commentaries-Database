On a former occasion our Lord attended a marriage in Cana of Galilee. Now he goes there to convert the people and confirm by his presence the faith that his miracle had produced. He leaves his own country of Capernaum and goes to Cana as a self-invited guest this time, showing his preference for Cana as he tries to draw them closer to him.
