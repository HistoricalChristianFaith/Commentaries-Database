6. "So then, neither is he that plants anything, neither he that waters, but God that gives the increase."

Do you observe the manner in which he soothes them, so that they should not be too much irritated, on hearing, "Who is this person," and "Who is that?" "Nay, both are invidious, namely, both the saying, 'Who is this person? Who the other,'" and the saying, that "neither he that plants nor he that waters is anything." How then does he soften these expressions? First, By attaching the contempt to his own person, "Who is Paul, and who Apollos?" and next, by referring the whole to God who gave all things. For after he had said, "Such a person planted," and added, "He that plants is nothing," he subjoined, "but God that gives the increase." Nor does he stop even here, but applies again another healing clause, in the words.
