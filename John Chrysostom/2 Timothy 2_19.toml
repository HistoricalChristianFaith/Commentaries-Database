These are the distinguishing marks of the foundation. A foundation is firm. The letters are inscribed upon the stone so that the letters may be seen. But these letters are shown by works, “Having,” he says, “this seal fixed thereon, let every one that names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity.” Thus if any one is unrighteous, he is not of the foundation. So it belongs to the seal not to do wrong.
