“He removes mountains,” Job says, “and they do not know it.” The mountains, he says, and they do not notice it. And this is in perfect accordance with what David said: “He touches the mountains, and they smoke.” In this passage he speaks about the power of God by stating that God can do anything through his avenging power. In fact, Job has testified to his justice and, at the same time, testifies to his power. - "Commentary on Job 9.5"
