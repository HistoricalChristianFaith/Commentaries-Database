(Hom. lxxvi. 2) Our Lord showed above, that those who plotted against them should be burned, inasmuch as they abode not in Christ: now He shows that they themselves would be invincible, bringing forth much fruit; Herein is My Father glorified, that ye bear much fruit: as if He said, If it appertains to My Father's glory that ye bring forth fruit, He will not despise His own glory. And he that bringeth forth fruit is Christ's disciple: So shall ye be My disciples.

(Hom. lxxvi. 2) If then I love you, be of good cheer; if it is the Father's glory that ye bring forth good fruit, bear no evil. Then to rouse them to exertion, He adds, Continue ye in My love; and then shows how this is to be done: If ye keep My commandments, ye shall abide in My love.

(Hom. lxxvii. 1) Then because the Passion was now approaching to interrupt their joy, He adds, These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy may remain in you: as if He said, And if sorrow fall upon you, I will take it away; so that ye shall rejoice in the end.
