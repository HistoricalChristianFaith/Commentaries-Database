With this in mind, dearly beloved, let us who live in the age of grace imitate the man who lived before the law, not burn with desire for more and heap up for ourselves to a greater and more intense degree the fire that cannot be extinguished and the flame that is intolerable. We will hear, in fact, if we persist in such awful deeds of injustice and avarice, the words spoken to that notorious rich man, “Fool, this night they are looking for your soul from you; but as for what you have put aside, whom will it belong to?” I mean, what is the reason, dearly beloved, that you are anxious to amass so many things that you will shortly leave here, due as you are to be snatched away from the scene, not only powerless to gain any advantage from them but even saddled with the burden of sins on your own shoulders, at this stage too late for worthwhile repentance? While the goods you have amassed with avarice oftentimes finish even in the hands of enemies, you yourself will be required to give an account of them. So what folly would it be to labor for others’ benefit and pay the price for them yourself?

Even if in the past, however, we have to this degree managed our affairs with indifference, now at least let us plan for what is needful and not simply be anxious to bedeck ourselves with the trappings of wealth, but rather pay much attention to doing good. After all, our being will not come to an end with this present life, nor shall we be always in exile; instead, before long we shall reach our true homeland. So let us do everything in the hope of not being found wanting there. I mean, what good is it to leave behind great wealth in foreign parts while wanting for bare necessities in our true country? Consequently let us strive, dearly beloved, while there is still time, to transfer there what we own in this foreign country. Although in fact the distance may be great, nevertheless the transfer is quite easy. You see, there are those ready to make the transfer, to travel there safely and deposit in a secure treasury whatever we are able to send ahead by means of them. I mean, the hands of the poor lay up in the treasuries of heaven what is given them by us. Since then the ease and security are so great, why do we delay and not rather with all haste act on this so that we will have those things at our disposal in the place where we most have need of them?
