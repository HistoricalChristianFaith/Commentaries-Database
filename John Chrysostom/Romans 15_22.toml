"For which cause also I have been much hindered from coming to you."

Observe again, how he makes the end of the like texture with the introduction. For while he was quite at the beginning of the Epistle, he said, "Oftentimes I purpose to come unto you, but was let hitherto." But here he gives the cause also by which he was let, and that not once, but twice even, aye, and many times. For as he says there, "oftentimes I purposed to come to you," so here too, "I have been much (or often) hindered from coming to you." Now it is a thing which proves a very strong desire, that he attempted it so often.
