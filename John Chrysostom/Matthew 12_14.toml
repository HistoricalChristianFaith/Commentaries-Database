What then did they? They go forth, it is said, and take counsel together to slay Him. For the Pharisees, says the Scripture, went out and held a council against Him, how they might destroy Him. They had received no injury, yet they went about to slay Him. So great an evil is envy. For not against strangers only, but even against our own, is it ever warring. And Mark says, they took this counsel with the Herodians. Mark 3:6

By this he makes clear that deluded souls are not even persuaded by miracles. And he shows how his disciples also had been wrongly blamed by them without cause. Note how vehement his detractors have suddenly grown, and this happens especially when they see others benefiting from his ministry! When they see someone delivered either from disease or iniquity, then that immediately cues them to further find fault. They become like wild beasts. According to this pattern they repeatedly demeaned him, as when he was about to save the prostitute, and again when he was eating with publicans, and now again, when they saw the withered hand restored.Note carefully how he does not cease in his tender care for the infirm yet softens the envy of his adversaries. Hence “great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all; and he charged those that were healed that they should make him known to no one.” But the multitudes seemed more ready to admire him and trail after him than to change their decadent ways.
