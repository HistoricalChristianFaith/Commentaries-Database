“No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.” This was permitted for a good reason. They were to see the thing and utter the thought, so that when it took place, the miracle would not be disbelieved. See how respectfully they speak among themselves, how natural judgment is clearly expressed even among barbarians, and how they did not condemn without giving a reason.
