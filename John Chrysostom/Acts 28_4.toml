Then a viper "fastened on his hand. And when the barbarians saw the venomous beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet vengeance suffereth not to live." Well also was this permitted, that they should both see the thing and utter the thought, in order that, when the result ensued, there might be no disbelieving the miracle. Observe their good feeling towards the distressed, in saying this not aloud, but among themselves - observe also the natural judgment clearly expressed even among barbarians, and how they do not condemn without assigning a reason.

"No doubt," say they, "this man is a murderer." They do not simply pronounce their judgment, but say, "No doubt," that is, as any one may see, "and vengeance," say they, "suffereth him not to live." Why then, they held also the doctrine of a Providence, and these barbarians were far more philosophic than the philosophers, who allow not the benefit of a Providence to extend to things "below the moon:" whereas these barbarians suppose God to be present everywhere, and that although a guilty man may escape many a danger, he will not escape in the end. And they do not assail him forthwith, but for a time respect him on account of his misfortune: nor do they openly proclaim their surmise, but speak it "among themselves: a murderer;" for the bonds led them to suspect this.
