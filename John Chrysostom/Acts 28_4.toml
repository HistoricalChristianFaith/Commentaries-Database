They do not simply pronounce their judgment, but say, No doubt, (i.e.) as any one may see and vengeance, say they, suffers him not to live. Why then, they held also the doctrine of a Providence, and these barbarians were far more philosophic than the philosophers, who allow not the benefit of a Providence to extend to things below the moon: whereas (these barbarians) suppose God to be present everywhere, and that although a (guilty) man may escape many (a danger), he will not escape in the end. And they do not assail him immediately, but for a time respect him on account of his misfortune: nor do they openly proclaim their surmise, but speak it among themselves: a murderer; for the bonds led them to suspect this. They showed no small kindness, and yet (some of them) were prisoners. Let those be ashamed that say, Do not do good to those in prison: let these barbarians shame us; for they knew not who these men were, but simply because they were in misfortune (they were kind): thus much they perceived, that they were human beings, and therefore they considered them to have a claim upon their humanity. And for a great while, it says, they expected that he would die.

Well also was this permitted, that they should both see the thing and utter the thought, in order that, when the result ensued, there might be no disbelieving the miracle. Observe their good feeling (towards the distressed), in saying this (not aloud, but) among themselves— observe (also) the natural judgment clearly expressed even among barbarians, and how they do not condemn without assigning a reason. And these also behold, that they may wonder the more. And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm. Howbeit they looked when he should have swollen, or fallen down dead suddenly: but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.

“No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, justice has not allowed him to live.” This was permitted for a good reason. They were to see the thing and utter the thought, so that when it took place, the miracle would not be disbelieved. See how respectfully they speak among themselves, how natural judgment is clearly expressed even among barbarians, and how they did not condemn without giving a reason.
