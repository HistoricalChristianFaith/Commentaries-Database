observe this man also, how he utters nothing boastful, but just as Peter said in the case of the lame man, Why look ye on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made him to walk, Acts 3:12 so here also he says, Jesus, Who appeared unto you. (b) Or, (he says it) that the other may believe: and he says not, He that was crucified, the Son of God, He that does wonders: but what? He that appeared unto you: (speaking) from what the other knew: as Christ also added no more, neither said, I am Jesus, the Crucified, the Risen: but what? Whom you persecute. Ananias said not, The persecuted, that he may not seem as it were to rave over him (ἐ πενθουσί& 139visibly) appear, but was seen by the things done. And immediately he added, wishing to draw a veil over the accusation: That you may receive your sight. I came not to reprove the past, but to bestow the gift: that you may receive your sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost. (a) With hands laid on, he spoke these words. And immediately there fell from his eyes, etc.

As he said this, he laid his hands upon him. And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales.
