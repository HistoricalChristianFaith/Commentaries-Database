"And Ananias went, and entered into the house, and laid his hands upon him, and said, Brother Saul"-he straightway addresses him as a friend by that name-"Jesus, Who appeared unto thee in the way in which thou camest"-and yet Christ had not told him this, but he learnt it from the Spirit-"hath sent me unto thee, that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."

"Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus"-he saith not, "Who made thee blind," but, "Who appeared with thee in the way, hath sent me unto thee that thou mayest receive thy sight": observe this man also, how he utters nothing boastful, but just as Peter said in the case of the lame man, "Why look ye on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made him to walk," so here also he saith, "Jesus, Who appeared unto thee." Or, he saith it that the other may believe: and he saith not, He that was crucified, the Son of God, He that doeth wonders: but what? "He that appeared unto thee:" speaking from what the other knew: as Christ also added no more, neither said, I am Jesus, the Crucified, the Risen: but what? "Whom thou persecutest." Ananias said not, "The persecuted," that he may not seem as it were to rave over him, to deride him, "Who appeared unto thee in the way:" and yet He did not visibly appear, but was seen by the things done. And immediately he added, wishing to draw a veil over the accusation: "That thou mayest receive thy sight." I came not to reprove the past, but to bestow the gift: "that thou mayest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Ghost."
