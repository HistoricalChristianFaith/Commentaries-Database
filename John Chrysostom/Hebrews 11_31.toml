By faith, the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed not, having received the spies with peace. It would then be disgraceful, if you should appear more faithless even than a harlot. Yet she [merely] heard what the men related, and immediately believed. Whereupon the end also followed; for when all perished, she alone was preserved. She did not say to herself, I shall be with my many friends. She did not say, Can I possibly be wiser than these judicious men who do not believeâ€”and shall I believe? She said no such thing, but believed what had taken place, which it was likely that they would suffer.
