The tribune ought to have questioned more closely whether the things that Paul said were so—even if he had to question the Jews, and if these things were not so, and only then to order that he be scourged, “to find out why they shouted thus against him.” Moreover, he ought to learn from those who were shouting and to ask if they had even heard anything that was said. Instead, he simply used his power and acted according to their pleasure. For he was not trying to do something just but only to stop their rage, unjust as it was.
