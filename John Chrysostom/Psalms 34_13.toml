Let us train therefore our tongue to speak good words. For “refrain,” it is said, “your tongue from evil.” For God gave it not that we should speak evil, that we should revile, that we should calumniate one another, but to sing hymns to God, to speak those things that “give grace to the hearers,” things for edification, things for profit.
