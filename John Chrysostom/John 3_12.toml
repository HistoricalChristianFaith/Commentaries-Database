Do not be surprised that he calls baptism earthly, for he calls it this either because it is performed on earth or as comparison with his own most awesome birth. For though this birth of ours is heavenly, yet compared with that true birth that is from the substance of the Father, it is earthly.And he has not said, “You have not understood,” but “You have not believed.” For when the understanding cannot take in certain truths, we attribute it to our own natural deficiencies or to ignorance. But when a person does not receive things that cannot be apprehended by reasoning but only by faith, the charge against him is no longer lack of understanding but unbelief.… These truths, however, were revealed so that posterity might believe and benefit from them, even though the people then did not.
