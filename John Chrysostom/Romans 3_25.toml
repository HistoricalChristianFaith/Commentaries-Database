Paul calls the redemption an expiation to show that, if the Old Testament type had such power, much more did its New Testament counterpart have it.… What does it mean “to show God’s righteousness”? It is like declaring his riches not only for him to be rich himself but also to make others rich.… Do not doubt, for righteousness is not of works but of faith.
