Someone may be bewildered and uncertain, and say, “So how is it that the Jews do not believe today?” … Listen to what follows; he added, “the beauty of Jacob, which he loved.” Here in fact he seems to me to be referring to the believers, as Paul indicated in saying, “It is not, however, as though the word of God had failed: not all of Israel belong to Israel; … it is not the children of the flesh who are children of God, but the children of the promise who are counted as descendants.” Now, the believers are rightly spoken of as the people’s beauty; what could be more appealing, after all, than those who have come to faith?
