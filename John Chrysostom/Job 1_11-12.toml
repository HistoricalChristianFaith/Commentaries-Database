[Satan] himself willed and desired to receive power over Job, but he did not dare to say so. “But you,” he says, “stretch out your hand.” Then, so that he may not say, “you indulgently struck him as though he was a household servant,” God does not do that which the devil asked. Certainly God could, in doing that, justify himself by saying, “I did what you wanted; it is you who told me to touch him.”
