Paul sounds here like the father who asks a son who despises his parents and prefers wicked companions: “What are you doing? Do you not realize that you are much nobler and better than they are?” He will detach his son more easily from such people by appealing to his self-respect rather than by demeaning him. In the same way, Paul appeals to the Corinthians, not mentioning himself or God but appealing directly to their sense of who they are in themselves.
