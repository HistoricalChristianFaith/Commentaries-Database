"And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?" Why did they not plead for him before this? Do you observe, how, when the passions give way, the truth is discovered? Where is the crime, say they, if an angel has spoken to him, or a spirit? Paul gives them no handle against him.

"And the scribes," etc. Look; the tribune also hears that the Pharisees have acquitted him of the charges, and have given sentence in his favor, and with greater confidence carries him off by force.
