For if we suffer evil by human hands, we cut off no small part of our debt by nobly bearing what is done to us. Therefore we receive no injury; for God reckons the ill treatment towards our debt, not according to the principle of justice but of his lovingkindness; and for this cause he didn’t relieve the one who suffered evil.… And when he bore with Shimei cursing him, David said, “Let him alone, that the Lord may see my abasement and requite me [with] good for this day.” For when he doesn’t aid us when we suffer wrong, then we are advantaged most of all; for he sets it to the account of our sins, if we bear it thankfully.
