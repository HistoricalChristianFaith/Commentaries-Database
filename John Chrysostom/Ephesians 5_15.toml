He is still cleansing away the root of bitterness, still cutting off the very groundwork of anger. For what is he saying? Look carefully how ye walk. They are sheep in the midst of wolves, and he charges them to be also as doves. For you shall be harmless, says he, as doves. Matthew 10:16 Forasmuch then as they were both among wolves, and were besides commanded not to defend themselves, but to suffer evil, they needed this admonition. Not indeed but that the former was sufficient to render them stronger; but now that there is besides the addition of the two, reflect how exceedingly it is heightened. Observe then here also, how carefully he secures them, by saying, Look how ye walk. Whole cities were at war with them; yea, this war made its way also into houses. They were divided, father against son, and son against father, mother against daughter, and daughter against mother. What then? Whence these divisions? They heard Christ say, He that loves father or mother more than me, is not worthy of me. Matthew 10:37 Lest therefore they should think that he was without reason introducing wars and fightings, (since there was likely to be much anger produced, if they on their part were to retaliate,) to prevent this, he says, See carefully how ye walk. That is to say, Except the Gospel message, give no other handle on any score whatever, for the hatred which you will incur. Let this be the only ground of hatred. Let no one have any other charge to make against you; but show all deference and obedience, whenever it does no harm to the message, whenever it does not stand in the way of godliness. For it is said, Render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute, custom to whom custom. Romans 13:7 For when among the rest of the world they shall see us forbearing, they will be put to shame.

Not as unwise, but as wise, redeeming the time.
It is not from any wish that you should be artful, and versatile, that he gives this advice. But what he means is this. The time is not yours. At present you are strangers, and sojourners, and foreigners, and aliens; seek not honors, seek not glory, seek not authority, nor revenge; bear all things, and in this way, redeem the time; give up many things, anything they may require. Imagine now, I say, a man had a magnificent house, and persons were to make their way in, on purpose to murder him, and he were to give a large sum, and thus to rescue himself. Then we should say, he has redeemed himself. So also have you a large house, and a true faith in your keeping. They will come to take all away. Give whatever they may demand, only preserve the principal thing, I mean the faith.
