He shows that it was not necessary to do this upon principle - whence also they obtain his compliance - but that it was economy and condescension. This vow appears to have been the Nazarite vow described in Numbers 6:1-21, taken by the apostle as an accommodation to Jewish prejudices and to allay the suspicions of the legal party in Jerusalem. This was done upon the recommendation of James, the "Bishop" of the church, and his associates. The significance of Paul's paying the expenses is, perhaps, that the period during which the others' vow had run was on this condition reckoned to his account also.
