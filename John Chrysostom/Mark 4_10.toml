Suppose a physician excised a portion from the side of an organism, even in that small part you would find all the elements out of which the whole is composedâ€”nerves and veins, bones, arteries and blood, and a sample, as one might say, of the whole lump. So likewise with regard to the organic unity of the Scriptures. In each distinct portion of what is written, one may see the connection with the whole clearly appearing.
