"And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all quarters, he came down also to the saints which dwelt at Lydda." Like the commander of an army, he went about, inspecting the ranks, what part was compact, what in good order, what needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about, foremost. When an Apostle was to be chosen, he was the foremost: when the Jews were to be told, that these were "not drunken," when the lame man was to be healed, when harangues to be made, he is before the rest: when the rulers were to be spoken to, he was the man; when Ananias, he: when healings were wrought by the shadow, still it was he. And look: where there was danger, he was the man, and where good management was needed; but where all is calm, there they act all in common, and he demands no greater honor than the others. When need was to work miracles, he starts forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil.
