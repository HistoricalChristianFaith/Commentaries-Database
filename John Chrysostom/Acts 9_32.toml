Like a general [Peter] went around inspecting the ranksâ€”which part was well-trained, which in good order and which needed his presence. See how on all occasions he goes about first. When an apostle had to be chosen, he was first; when the Jews had to be told that these were not drunk, he was first; when the lame man had to be healed, he was first; when the crowd had to be addressed, he was before the rest; when the rulers had to be addressed, he was the man; when Ananias had to be addressed, when healings were worked by the shadow, still it was he. And look, where there was danger, he was the man; where the situation is calm, all of them act in common. He did not seek a greater honor. When there was need to work miracles, he leaps forward, and here again he is the man to labor and toil.
