With those hands, he says, with which You have opened eyes, and cleansed lepers, and raised the dead? For this (question) is very emphatic; wherefore He needed not to have said any more than the, Thou; for even of itself this would have sufficed to convey the whole. Some one might reasonably enquire, how none of the others forbade Him, but Peter only, which was a mark of no slight love and reverence. What then is the cause? He seems to me to have washed the traitor first, then to have come to Peter, and that the others were afterwards instructed from his case.  That He washed some one other before him is clear from its saying, But when He came  to Peter. Yet the Evangelist is not a vehement accuser,  for the began, is the expression of one implying this. And even if Peter were the first,  yet it is probable that the traitor, being a forward person, had reclined even before the chief.  For by another circumstance also his forwardness is shown, when He dips with his Master in the dish, and being convicted, feels no compunction; while Peter being rebuked but once on a former occasion, and for words which he spoke from loving affection, was so abashed, that being even distressed and trembling, he begged another to ask a question. But Judas, though continually convicted, felt not. John 13:24 When therefore He came to Peter, he says unto Him, Lord, dost Thou wash my feet?
