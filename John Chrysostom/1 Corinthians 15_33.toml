"Be not deceived: evil company doth corrupt good manners."

Then that he might not make his discourse too rough, he dwells not long upon his "reductio ad absurdum," but again turns his discourse to exhortation, saying, "Be not deceived: evil company doth corrupt good manners."

And this he said, both to rebuke them as without understanding, (for here he by a charitable expression, calls "good" that which is easily deceived,) and also, as far as he could, to make some allowance to them for the past with a view to their return, and to remove from them and transfer to others the greater part of his charges, and so by this way also to allure them to repentance. Which he doth likewise in the Epistle to the Galatians, saying, "But he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be."
