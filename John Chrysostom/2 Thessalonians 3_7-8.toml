And yet even if they had eaten, it would not have been for nought. "For the laborer," he says, "is worthy of his hire." [Luke 10:7]

"But in labor and travail, working night and day, that we might not burden any of you. Not because we have not the right, but to make ourselves an ensample unto you that you should imitate us. For even when we were with you, this we commanded you, If any will not work, neither let him eat."

See how in the former Epistle indeed he discourses somewhat more mildly concerning these things; as when he says, "We beseech you, brethren — that you would abound more and more — and that you study" [1 Thessalonians 4:1-11]— and nowhere does he say, "we command," nor "in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ," which was fearful and implied danger, but that "you abound," he says, and "study," which are the words of one exhorting to virtue; "that you may walk honestly" (becomingly), he says. [1 Thessalonians 4:12] But here is nothing of this kind, but "if any one will not work," says he, "neither let him eat." For if Paul, not being under a necessity, and having a right to be idle, and having undertaken so great a work, did nevertheless work, and not merely work, but "night and day," so that he was able even to assist others — much more ought others to do this.
