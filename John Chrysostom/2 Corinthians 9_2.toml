"For I know your readiness of which I glory on your behalf to them of Macedonia." Now it was a great thing that he even knew it himself, but much greater, that he also published it to others: for the force it has is greater: for they would not like to be so widely disgraced. Seest thou his wisdom of purpose? He exhorted them by others' example, the Macedonians, for, he says, "I make known to you the grace of God which hath been given in the Churches of Macedonia." He exhorted them by their own, for he saith, "who were the first to make a beginning a year ago not only to do, but also to will." He exhorted them by the Lord's, for "ye know" he saith, "the grace of our Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes He became poor." Again he retreats upon that strong main point, the conduct of others. For mankind is emulous. And truly the example of the Lord ought to have had most power to draw them over: and next to it, the consideration of the recompense: but because they were somewhat weak, this draws them most. For nothing does so much as emulation. "And your zeal has stirred up very many." What sayest thou? A little before thou saidst, they did it "of their own accord, beseeching us with much entreaty," how then now, "your zeal?" 'Yes,' he saith, 'we did not advise we did not exhort, but we only praised you, we only boasted of you, and this was enough to incite them.' Seest thou how he rouses them each by the other, these by those, and those by these, and, along with the emulation, has intermingled also a very high encomium. Then, that he may not elate them, he follows it up in a tempered tone, saying, "Your zeal hath stirred up very many."
