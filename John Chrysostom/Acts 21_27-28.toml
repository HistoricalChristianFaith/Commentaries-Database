"And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia" - for his arrival most keeps times with theirs - "when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teacheth all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place." Mark their habitual conduct, how turbulent we everywhere find it, how men who with or without reason make a clamor in the midst.

"Jews from Asia having seen him," for it was natural that they were spending some days there, "in the Temple." Mark the economy of Providence that appeared in this. After the believing Jews had been persuaded concerning him, then it is that those Jews of Asia set upon him in order that those believing Jews may not also set upon him. "Help," say they, "ye men of Israel!" as though it were some monster difficult to be caught, and hard to be overcome, that has fallen into their hands. "All men," they say, "everywhere, he ceaseth not to teach;" not here only. And then the accusation is more aggravated by the present circumstances. "And yet more," say they, "he has polluted the temple, having brought into it men who are Greeks." And yet in Christ's time there "came up Greeks to worship": true, but here it speaks of Greeks who had no mind to worship.
