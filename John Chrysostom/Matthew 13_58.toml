Luke says, “And he did not do many miracles there.” And yet it was to be expected he should have done them. For if the feeling of wonder toward him was growing (for indeed even there he was marveled at), why did Jesus not do them? Because he wasn’t concerned with the spectacle [of miracles] but with their usefulness. Therefore when this did not succeed, he overlooked what was of concern to himself to avoid aggravating their punishment.Why then did he still do a few miracles? That they might not say, “Physician, heal yourself.” Or to prevent them saying, “He is a foe and an enemy to us and overlooks his own.” Or that they might not say, “If he had performed miracles, we also would have believed.” Therefore he both performedd them and ceased doing so: the one, that he might fulfill his own part; the other, that he might not condemn them the more.
And consider the power of Jesus’ words. Possessed as the Jews were by envy, they still admired him. And as with regard to his works, they do not find fault with what is done but invent causes that have no basis, saying, “By Beelzebub he casts out devils.” Even so here too they find no fault with his teaching but take refuge only in the lowly stature of his ancestors.
