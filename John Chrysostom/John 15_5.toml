Do you see that the Son contributes not less than the Father towards the care of the disciples? The Father purges, but He keeps them in Himself. The abiding in the root is that which makes the branches to be fruit-bearing. For that which is not purged, if it remain on the root, bears fruit, though perhaps not so much as it ought; but that which remains not, bears none at all. But still the purging also has been shown to belong to the Son, and the abiding in the root, to the Father, who also begot the Root. Do you see how all is common,  both the purging, and the enjoying the virtue which is from the root?
