What then says the centurion? I am not worthy that you should come under my roof. Matthew 8:8 Let us hearken, as many as are to receive Christ: for it is possible to receive Him even now. Let us hearken, and emulate, and receive Him with as great zeal; for indeed, when you receive a poor man who is hungry and naked, you have received and cherished Him.

2. But say in a word only, and my servant shall be healed.

See this man also, how, like the leper, he has the right opinion touching Him. For neither did this one say, entreat, nor did he say, pray, and beseech, but command only.

It is curious that when Martha, who was very dear to Jesus, said, “I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give it to you,” far from being praised, she was rebuked and corrected by the Lord as not having spoken quite fittingly.… For Jesus was teaching her that he himself is the fountain of all good things, the resurrection and the life, as if to say, “I do not wait to receive active power but have it already in myself.”
