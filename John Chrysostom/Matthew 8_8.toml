It is curious that when Martha, who was very dear to Jesus, said, “I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give it to you,” far from being praised, she was rebuked and corrected by the Lord as not having spoken quite fittingly.… For Jesus was teaching her that he himself is the fountain of all good things, the resurrection and the life, as if to say, “I do not wait to receive active power but have it already in myself.”
