And yet the very things he spoke were enough to bring them to true religion: but being poor senseless creatures, this is the part they act. For if this (Paul being) man is strong enough to turn away all, and the worship of the gods is in jeopardy, one ought to reflect, how great must this man's God be, and that he will much more give you those things, for which you are afraid. Already (at the outset) he has secured a hold upon their minds by saying, This Paul has turned away much people, saying, that they be no gods, which are made with men's hands. See what it is that the heathen are so indignant at; because he said that they which be made of men are no gods. Throughout, he drives his speech at their craft. Then that which most grieved them he brings in afterwards. But, with the other gods, he would say, we have no concern, but that the temple also of the great goddess Diana is in danger to be destroyed. Then, lest he should seem to say this for the sake of lucre, see what he adds: Whom the whole world worships. Observe how he showed Paul's power to be the greater, proving all (their gods) to be wretched and miserable creatures, since a mere man, who was driven about, a mere tentmaker, had so much power. Observe the testimonies borne to the Apostles by their enemies, that they overthrew their worship. There (at Lystra) they brought garlands and oxen. Acts 14:13 Here he says, This our craft is in danger to be set at naught.— You have filled (all) everywhere with your doctrine. Acts 5:28 So said the Jews also with regard to Christ: You see how the world is going after Him John 12:19; and, The Romans shall come and take away our city. John 11:48. And again on another occasion, These that have turned the world upside down have come hither also. Acts 17:6.— And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath. Upon what was that wrath called forth? On hearing about Diana, and about their source of gain. And cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. And the whole city was filled with confusion: and rushed with one accord into the theatre.

For each city had its proper gods. (d) They thought to make their voice a barrier against the Divine Spirit. Children indeed, these Greeks! (h) And their feeling was as if by their voice they could reinstate the worship of her, and undo what had taken place! And the whole city, etc.
