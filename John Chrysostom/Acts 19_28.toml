Observe the testimonies borne to the Apostles by their enemies, that they overthrew their worship. There at Lystra they brought "garlands and oxen." Here he says, "This our craft is in danger to be set at naught. - Ye have filled all everywhere with your doctrine." So said the Jews also with regard to Christ: "Ye see how the world is going after Him"; and, "The Romans shall come and take away our city." And again on another occasion, "These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also." - "And when they heard these sayings, they were full of wrath." Upon what was that wrath called forth? On hearing about Diana, and about their source of gain.

"And when they heard, they were filled with wrath, and shouted, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!" For each city had its proper gods. They thought to make their voice a barrier against the Divine Spirit. Children indeed, these Greeks! And their feeling was as if by their voice they could reinstate the worship of her, and undo what had taken place!
