The leper came unto Him when He had come down from the mountain, but this centurion, when He was entered into Capernaum. Wherefore then did neither the one nor the other go up into the mountain? Not out of remissness, for indeed the faith of them both was fervent, but in order not to interrupt His teaching.

Some argue that the centurion, by his description, implied the reason why he had not brought his servant to Jesus, saying, “Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress,” as though he was at his last gasp, or even, as Luke said, he was “at the point of death.” In my opinion, however, the reason he had not brought him in was itself a sign of his great faith, even much greater than those who let the patient down through the roof. Because the centurion knew for certain that even a mere command was enough for raising the servant up, he thought it unnecessary to bring him.
