"For when one says, I am Paul, and I of Apollos, are you not carnal?"

And he points out that this, so far from helping them at all or causing them to acquire anything, had even become an obstacle to their profiting in the greater things. For this it was which brought forth jealousy, and jealousy had made them "carnal;" and the having become "carnal" left them not at liberty to hear truths of the sublimer sort.
