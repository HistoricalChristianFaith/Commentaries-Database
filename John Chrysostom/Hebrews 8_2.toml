A minister of the sanctuary, not simply a minister, but a minister of the sanctuary. And of the true Tabernacle, which the Lord pitched and not man. You see the condescension. Did he not a little before make a separation, saying: Are they not all ministering spirits? Hebrews 1:14 and therefore (he says) it is not said to them, Sit on my right hand, Hebrews 1:13 for He that sits is not a minister. How is it then that it is here said, a minister, and a minister of the Sanctuary? For he means here the Tabernacle.

See how he raised up the minds of the believing Jews. For as they would be apt to imagine that we have no such tabernacle [as they had], see here (he says) is the Priest, Great, yea, much greater than the other, and who has offered a more wonderful sacrifice. But is not all this mere talk? Is it not a boast, and merely said to win over our minds? On this account he established it first from the oath, and afterwards also from the tabernacle. For this difference too was manifest: but the Apostle thinks of another also, which (he says) the Lord pitched [or made firm] and not man. Where are they who say that the heaven whirls around? where are they who declare that it is spherical? For both of these notions are overthrown here.

Now (he says) of the things which we have spoken this is the sum. By the sum is always meant what is most important. Again he brings down his discourse; having said what is lofty, henceforward he speaks fearlessly.
