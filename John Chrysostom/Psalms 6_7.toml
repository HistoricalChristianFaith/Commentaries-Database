Our life is a struggle, and our existence beset with countless foes who prove to be stronger when we fall into sin. Hence we should do everything to escape their clutches and never come to terms with them; this, after all, is the surest path to insecurity. Paul touches on the horde of those enemies in saying, “Our wrestling is not with flesh and blood but with the powers and the authorities and the cosmic rulers of darkness of this age.” Since, then, the horde of enemies is of this kind, we must constantly be on the alert and avoid the assault of sin.
