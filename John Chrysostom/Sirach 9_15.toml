That you may therefore with confidence draw near to God, do not receive wrath when it comes in on you and desires to be with you. Drive it away, instead, like a mad dog. For this is also what Paul commanded. His phrase was, “lifting up holy hands without wrath and disputing.” Instead, adorn it with gentleness, with humility, make it worthy of the God who is entreated, fill it with blessing, with much almsgiving. For it is possible even with words to give alms. “For a word is a better thing than a gift,” and “Answer the poor peaceably with meekness.” And all the rest of your time, too, adorn it with the rehearsing of the laws of God. “Yes, let all your communication be in the law of the Most High.” Having thus adorned ourselves, let us come to our King and fall at his knees, not with the body only but also with the mind. Let us consider whom we are approaching and on whose behalf, and what we want to accomplish.
