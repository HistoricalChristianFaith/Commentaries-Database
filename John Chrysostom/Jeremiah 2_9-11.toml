For since you are not persuaded by the Scriptures, I am compelled to shame you by those who are outside your company. God also did this to the Jews when he said, “Go to the Isles of Kittim and send to Kedar and find out if the nations will change their gods which are no gods.”

God actually permitted erroneous and unworthy opinions of himself to prevail—opinions such as that he was formerly a body and that he was visible.… For he nowhere considers his own dignity but always what will be profitable to us.… Even in reproving he stoops down, as when he speaks by the prophet, “Has a nation changed their gods?” And in every part of Scripture there are instances of his humility both in words and actions.
