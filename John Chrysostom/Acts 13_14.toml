“They sat down in the synagogue,” he says, “and on the sabbath day,” to prepare the way beforehand for the Word. And they did not speak first but when invited, seeing that they summoned them as strangers. Had they not waited, there would have been no discourse. Here for the first time we have Paul preaching. And notice his wisdom: where the word was already sown, he passes on; but where there was none, he makes a stay. It is as he himself writes, “Yes, so have I strived to preach the gospel, not where Christ was named.” Great courage was also embodied in this. Truly from the very outset a wonderful man! Crucified, drawn up in the line of battle, he knew how great was the grace he obtained, and he brought in an equal zeal.
