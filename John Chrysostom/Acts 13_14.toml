"But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down." And here again they entered the synagogues, in the character of Jews, that they might not be treated as enemies, and be driven away: and in this way they carried the whole matter successfully.

"They sat down in the synagogue," he says, and, "on the sabbath day": that they might prepare the way beforehand for the Word. And they do not speak first, but when invited: since as strangers, they called upon them to do so. Had they not waited, there would have been no discourse. Here for the first time we have Paul preaching. And observe his prudence: where the word was already sown, he passes on: but where there was none (to preach), he makes a stay: as he himself writes: "Yea, so have I strived to preach the Gospel, not where Christ was named." Great courage this also. Truly, from the very outset, a wonderful man! crucified, ready for all encounters, he knew how great grace he had obtained, and he brought to it zeal equivalent.

But it is well done, that "they entered the synagogue on the sabbath day" when all were collected together.
