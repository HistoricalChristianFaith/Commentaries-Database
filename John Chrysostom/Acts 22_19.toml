Not to gainsay Christ, but because he wished to learn this which was so contrary to all reasonable expectation. Christ, however, did not teach him (this), but only bade him depart, and he obeys: so obedient is he. And they lifted up their voices, it says, and said, Away with him: it is not fit that this fellow should live.
