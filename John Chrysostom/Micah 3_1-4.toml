Indeed, the prophets repeatedly charged the people, saying, “Hear, you rulers of Sodom,” and “Your princes are faithless.” And again Micah: “Is it not for you to know justice?” In fact, everywhere they vehemently upbraided them. What, then? Will someone on that account find fault with God? Perish the thought! The fault, in truth, is with them. Moreover, what better proof could one offer that you do not know the law, than that of your failure to obey it?
