By what “word is she washed”? “In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” He did not simply bathe her; he adorned her, making her glorious, having no spot or wrinkle or anything lacking. Let us too seek that sort of beauty, and grace will make us able to refract it. The husband does not seek from the wife something she does not have to give. For you see the pattern: the church has received everything from Christ.
