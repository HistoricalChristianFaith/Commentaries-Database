I suppose that they were not at all unfavorably disposed towards Timothy: wherefore he also put him forward. For Hebrews 13:23 know ye, he says, that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you. Set at liberty, he says; from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not this, that he was sent away from Athens. For this also is mentioned in the Acts.
