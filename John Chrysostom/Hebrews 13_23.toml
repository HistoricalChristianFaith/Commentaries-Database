I suppose that they were not at all unfavorably disposed towards Timothy: wherefore he also put him forward. For "know ye," he says, "that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you." "Set at liberty," he says; from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not this, that he was sent away from Athens. For this also is mentioned in the Acts.

"Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty, with whom if he come shortly I will see you." This is enough to persuade them to submit themselves, if he is ready to come with his disciple.
