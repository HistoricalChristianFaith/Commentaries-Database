They did not perform all their miracles with the same ease. But this was profitable for them: for truly God took thought not only for the salvation of others, but for their own. He that healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that he now has to do so much first? There are cases also in which the faith of the applicants co√∂perated. This is the first dead person that he raises. Observe how he, as it were, awakes her out of sleep: first she opened her eyes: then upon seeing (Peter) she sat up: then from his hand she received strength. And it was known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.

Why does he put them all out? That he may not be confused nor disturbed by their weeping. And having knelt down, he prayed. Observe the intentness of his prayer And he gave her his hand.
