They did not perform all their miracles with the same ease. This helped them. For truly God took thought not only for the salvation of others but also of their own. He who healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that now he has to do so much first? There are cases in which the faith of the applicants also assisted. This is the first dead person he has raised. Notice how he awakens her as if out of sleep. First, she opened her eyes; then, at the sight of Peter, she sat up; then, from his hand she received strength again. Look at the gain, look at the harvest, but note that it was not for display. That is why he sent them all outside, imitating his teacher also in this.
