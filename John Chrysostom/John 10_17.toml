What could be fuller of humanity than when our Lord says that he is loved because he is dying for us? Wasn’t he loved before this? Is it only now that the Father begins to love him and are we the causes of that love? See how he condescends to our level. But what is he trying to prove here? They had said he was a stranger to the Father and a deceiver who had come only to ruin and destroy. And so he tells them: Even if there was nothing else that made me love you, the fact that you are loved by my Father in such a way that I win his love by dying for you—that alone is reason enough to love you. He also shows that he did not do this under compulsion. For if he did it under compulsion, how could love be the motive? And that willingness on his part was something especially known by his Father.
