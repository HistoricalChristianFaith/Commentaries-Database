For neither did they approach him as before, dragging him into their houses and seeking a touch from his hand and directions from him in words. But now in a far higher pattern, and with greater self-denial and with a more abundant faith, they tried to win themselves a cure. By now the woman who had the issue of blood had taught them all to be constrained in seeking wisdom. And the Evangelist, also implying that at long intervals Jesus visited the various neighborhoods, said, “When the men of that place recognized him, they sent round to all that region and brought to him all that were sick.” Far from abolishing their faith, this interval of miracles had made it even greater and preserved it vigorously.
