Then he called for lights, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas; and brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Do you mark how the wonder overpowered him? And having called for lights, it says, he sprang in, and fell down at the feet of the prisoner; he, the prison keeper, saying, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Why, what had they said? Observe, he does not, on finding himself safe, think all is well; he is overcome with awe at the miraculous power.

Do you mark what happened in the former case, and what here? There a girl was released from a spirit, and they cast them into prison, because they had liberated her from the spirit. Here, they did but show the doors standing open, and it opened the doors of his heart, it loosed two sorts of chains; that prisoner kindled the true light; for the light in his heart was shining. And he sprang in, and fell before them; and he does not ask, How is this? What is this? but straightway he says, What must I do to be saved?
