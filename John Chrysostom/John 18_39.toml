Consider how prudently Pilate acted. He did not say, “Since he has sinned and is deserving of death, forgive him on account of the feast.” Rather, having first acquitted him of all guilt, Pilate goes the extra mile and asks them if they are willing to allow him the benefit of the season, even though they are unwilling to let him go as innocent.
