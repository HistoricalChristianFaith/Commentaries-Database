Ver. 20. "Yea, brother."

What is, "Yea, brother"? Receive him, he says. For this we must understand though unexpressed. For dismissing all pleasantry, he again pursues his former considerations, that is, serious ones. And yet even these are serious. For the things that proceed from Saints are of themselves serious, even when they are pleasantry.

"Yea, brother, let me have joy of you in the Lord, refresh my heart in Christ."

That is, you grant the favor to the Lord, not to me. "My heart," that is, toward yourself.
