Now then, let us too follow him. For we also have many diseases of our soul, and these especially he would gladly heal. With this intent he corrects that other sort, that he may banish these out of our soul.Let us therefore come to him, and let us ask nothing pertaining to this life but rather remission of sins. For indeed he gives it even now, if we come in earnest. Since as then “his fame went out into Syria,” so now into the whole world. And they indeed ran together when they heard that he healed demon-possessed people. And you, after having much more and greater experience of his power, do you not rouse yourself and run?
But whereas they left both country and friends and family, do you not endure so much as to leave your house for the sake of drawing near and obtaining far greater things? Or rather we do not require of you so much as this, but only leave your evil habits, and you can easily be made whole, even while remaining at home with your friends.
