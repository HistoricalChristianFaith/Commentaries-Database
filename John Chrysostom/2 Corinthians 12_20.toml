Paul did not say that he was afraid of finding them in sin but rather that they might not be all he would wish. Furthermore, he balances this by saying that their expectations of him might be disappointed as well.

He is going to say something great and offensive. And therefore he also inserts this excuse [for it], both by saying, All things are for your edifying, and by adding, I fear, softening the harshness of what was presently going to be said. For it was not here out of arrogance nor the authority of a teacher, but out of a father's tender concern, when he is more fearful and trembling than the sinners themselves at that which is likely to reform them. And not even so does he run them down or make an absolute assertion; but says doubtingly, lest by any means when I come, I should not find you such as I would. He did not say, 'not virtuous,' but not such as I would, everywhere employing the terms of affection. And the words, I should find, are of one who would express what is out of natural expectation, as are also those, I shall be found by you. For the thing is not of deliberate choice, but of a necessity originating with you. Wherefore he says, I should be found such as you would not. He said not here, such as I would not, but, with more severity, such as you wish not. For it would in that case become his own will, not indeed what he would first have willed, but his will nevertheless. For he might indeed have said again, 'such as I would not,' and so have showed his love: but he wishes not to relax his hearer. Yea rather, his words would in that case have been even harsher; but now he has at once dealt them a smarter blow and showed himself more gentle. For this is the characteristic of his wisdom; cutting more deeply, to strike more gently. Then, because he had spoken obscurely, he unveils his meaning, saying,

Lest there be strife, jealousy, wraths, backbitings, whisperings, swellings.
And what he might well put first, that he puts last: for they were very proud against him. Therefore, that he may not seem principally to be seeking his own, he first mentions what was common. For all these things were gendered of envy, their slanderings, accusations, dissensions. For just like some evil root, envy produced wrath, accusation, pride, and all those other evils, and by them was increased further,
