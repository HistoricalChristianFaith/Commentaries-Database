Entreat God—for this cause entreat him. It is in our behalf indeed that it is done, but it is wholly for your sakes. For we [spiritual leaders] are appointed for your advantage, and for your interests we are concerned.…For our enemy is violent. For each of you indeed anxiously thinks of his own interests, but we [think of] the concerns of all together. We stand in the part of the battle that is pressed on. The devil is more violently armed against us. For in wars too, the one who is on the opposite side endeavors before all others to overthrow the general. For this reason all his fellow combatants hasten there. For this reason there is much tumult, every one endeavoring to rescue him; they surround him with their shields, wishing to preserve his person. Hear what all the people say to David (I do not say this, as comparing myself to David, as I am not so mad, but because I wish to show the affection of the people for their ruler), “You shall go out no more; do not quench the lamp of Israel.” See how anxious they were to spare the old man. I am greatly in need of your prayers. Let no one, as I have said, from an excessive humility deprive me of this alliance and succor. If our part is well approved, your own also will be more honorable. If our teaching flows abundantly, the riches will redound to you.
