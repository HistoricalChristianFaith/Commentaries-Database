Either he speaks here about his present intervention, as if to say, “I do not speak so in order to condemn you but to show that you are righteous”; or he wants to speak about his trial by calling intervention his approval. This means, “Do not think that I managed things in this manner for any other reason.” He did not say, “In order that you might be righteous” but “that you might appear to be righteous,” as you actually were, so that you might teach others. Finally, he may want to speak about his present intervention, as if to say, “If I said it, it is in order that you might appear to be righteous after the words that I had expressed, not in order to condemn you.” Then he places again before him his power and his hatred for the wicked, because I am not only powerful, he says, but I act and use my power against the wicked.
