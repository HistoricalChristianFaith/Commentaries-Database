The word of the prophet went forth and suddenly the air was changed, the sky became bronze, not because its nature was altered but because of the electric effect which was produced. Suddenly the elements were transformed, as the prophetâ€™s word fell like a fiery bolt on the hollow parts of the earth, and immediately everything dried up, became a desert and disappeared.
