Now this is the same publican whois named by all the Evangelists; Matthew by Matthew; simply Levi by Luke; and Levi, the son of Alphaeus, by Mark; for he was the son of Alphaeus. And you may find persons with two names in other parts of Scripture; as Mosesâ€™ father inlaw is sometimes called Jethro, sometimes Raguel.
