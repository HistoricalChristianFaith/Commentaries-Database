Do you see what a great thing zeal is? It does not ask for more time or delay or procrastinate. It is sufficient simply to offer one’s self, and all is fulfilled.… Why then do I say this? Because if we are awake we shall not need the help of others. If we sleep, the help of others accomplishes nothing for us, but even with their aid we perish.… You say that your prayers accomplish little? They accomplish much when we combine them with our acts.… But if you remain idle, you will receive no benefit.
