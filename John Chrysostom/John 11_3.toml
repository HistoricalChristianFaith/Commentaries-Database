They desired to draw on Christ to pity, for they still gave heed to Him as to a man. This is plain from what they say, If you had been here, he  had not died, and from their saying, not, Behold, Lazarus is sick, but Behold, he whom you love is sick. What then said Christ?

Many are offended when they see any of those who are pleasing to God suffering anything terrible. There are those, for instance, who have fallen ill or have become impoverished or have endured some other tragedy. Those who are offended by this do not know that those who are especially dear to God have it as their lot to endure such things, as we see in the case of Lazarus, who was also one of the friends of Christ but was also sick.
