And wherefore came He the second time? In order to reprove them, for that they were so drowned in despondency, as not to have any sense even of His presence. He did not however reprove them, but stood apart from them a little, showing their unspeakable weakness, that not even when they had been rebuked, were they able to endure. But He does not awake and rebuke them again, lest He should smite them that were already smitten, but He went away and prayed, and when He has come back again, He says, Sleep on now, and take your rest. And yet then there was need to be wakeful, but to show that they will not bear so much as the sight of the dangers, but will be put to flight and desert Him from their terror, and that He has no need of their succor, and that He must by all means be delivered up, Sleep on now, He says, and take your rest; behold the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. Matthew 26:45

He shows again that what is done belongs to a divine dispensation.

But He does not this only, but also, by saying, into the hands of sinners, He cheers up their minds, showing it was the effect of their wickedness, not of His being liable to any charge.
