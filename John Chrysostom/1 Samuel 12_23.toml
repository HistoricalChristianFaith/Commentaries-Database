For he who loves Christ also loves his flock.… David in this way came to be king, having been seen first to be affectionately-minded toward them. So much indeed, though yet young, did he grieve for the people, as to risk his life for them, when he killed that barbarian. … And Samuel too was very affectionate; when it was that he said, “But God forbid that I should sin in ceasing to pray to the Lord for you.” In like way Paul also, or rather not in like way but even in a far greater degree, burned toward all his subjects.

What did Samuel profit Saul? Did he not mourn for him even to his last day, and not merely pray for him only? What did he profit the Israelites? Did he not say, “God forbid that I should sin in ceasing to pray for you”? Did they not all perish? Do prayers then, you say, profit nothing? They profit even greatly: but it is when we also do something. For prayers indeed cooperate and assist, but a man cooperates with one that is operating and assists one that is himself also working. But if you remain idle, you will receive no great benefit.
