God indeed says that he called Paul on account of his excellent capacity, as he said to Ananias, “for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings.” That is to say, he was capable of service and the accomplishment of great deeds. God gives this as the reason for his call. But Paul himself everywhere ascribes it to grace and to God’s inexpressible mercy. He says this in the words, “I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience for an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.”

Paul pointed out to all the deeds he had dared to commit before. He thought that it was better for his former life to be publicized to all in order to make evident the greatness of the gift of God than to cover up his ineffable and indescribable mercy by shrinking from proclaiming his own sins to all. He therefore recounted in detail his persecutions, his plots, his fights against the church. He says, “I am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God”; and again, “that Jesus came to save sinners of whom I am the chief.” And once more, “You have heard of my former way of life in Judaism; how beyond all measure I persecuted the church of God and ravaged it.” Indeed, to give, as it were, some kind of return to Christ for his long-suffering toward him, by telling plainly what sort he was and what an enemy and foe he had saved, he very frankly revealed the battle which in the beginning he had waged with consuming zeal against Christ. And because of this he held out good hope even to those who had despaired of themselves.
