What is “that which has been entrusted to me”? The faith, the preaching of the gospel. God, who committed this to us, will preserve it unimpaired. I suffer everything, that I may not be despoiled of this treasure. I am not ashamed of these things, so long as the faith is preserved uninjured. Or by “that which is entrusted to me” he may be referring to the faithful people who God has committed to him.
