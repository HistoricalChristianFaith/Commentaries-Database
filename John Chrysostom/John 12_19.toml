Now this seems to me to be said by those who felt rightly, but had not courage to speak boldly, and who then would restrain the others by pointing to the result, as though they were attempting impossibilities. Here again they call the multitude the world. For Scripture is wont to call by the name world both the creation, and those who live in wickedness; the one, when It says, Who brings out His world  by number Isaiah 40:26; the other when It says, The  world hates not  you, but Me it hates. John 7:7 And these things it is necessary to know exactly, that we may not through the signification of words afford a handle to the heretics.
