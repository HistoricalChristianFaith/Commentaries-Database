Ver. 24. "And the servant of the Lord must not strive."

Not even in questions ought he to strive, for the servant of the Lord must keep far from strife, since God is the God of peace, and what should the servant of the God of peace have to do with strife?

"But be gentle unto all men."

How is it then he says, "Rebuke with all authority" [Titus 2:15]; and again, "Let no man despise your youth" [1 Timothy 4:12]: and again, "Rebuke them sharply"?
