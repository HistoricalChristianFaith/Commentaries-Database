Again, he takes hold on them beforehand with their own testimony, saying, "As therefore ye received." We introduce no strange addition, he says, neither do ye. "Walk ye in Him," for He is the Way that leads to the Father: not in the Angels; this way leads not there. "Rooted," that is, fixed; not one while going this way, another that, but "rooted": now that which is rooted, never can remove. Observe how appropriate are the expressions he employs. "And built up," that is, in thought attaining unto Him. "And established" in Him, that is, holding Him, built as on a foundation. He shows that they had fallen down, for the word "built"  has this force. For the faith is in truth a building; and needs both a strong foundation, and secure construction. For both if any one build not upon a secure foundation it will shake; and even though he do, if it be not firm, it will not stand. "As you were taught." Again, the word "As." "Abounding," he says, "in thanksgiving"; for this is the part of well-disposed persons, I say not simply to give thanks, but with great abundance, more than ye learned, if possible, with much ambition.
