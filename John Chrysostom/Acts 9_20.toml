"And he was with the disciples which were at Damascus certain days. And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus, that He is the Son of God." See, straightway he was a teacher in the synagogues. He was not ashamed of the change, was not afraid while the very things in which he was glorious afore-time, the same he destroyed. Even from his first appearance on the stage here was a man, death-dealing, ready for deeds of blood: seest thou what a manifest sign was here?

"And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus"-for he was accurate in the faith-"that this is the Son of God." He did not merely say, "that He is risen"-not this: no, nor "that He liveth": but what? immediately he strictly expounded the doctrine-"that this is the Son of God."
