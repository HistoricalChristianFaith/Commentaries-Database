The disciples experienced some human weakness; therefore the Evangelist also shows this, adding “in that hour,” when he honored Peter more than all others. For though Peter was a firstborn son along with James and John, he did nothing similar for them. Then being ashamed to admit what they felt, they did not openly say, “Why have you honored Peter above us?” or “Surely he is not greater than us?” When they became ashamed, they asked less definitely, “Who then is greater?” When they had seen the three honored above the rest, they had felt nothing of the kind. But when one took the highest honor, then they were hurt. Apparently it was not for this alone but piling up many feelings they became incensed. For Jesus had said to Peter, “I will give you the keys,” and “You are blessed, Simon Bar-Jonah,” and to Peter here he instructed, “Give it to them for me and for yourself.” And seeing the great freedom allowed him elsewhere they were upset.
