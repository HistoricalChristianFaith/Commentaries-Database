Paul says this in order to show that the Corinthians have no reason to think that some of them are superior to others. He did not allow those who worked hard to regard themselves as superior to those who did less, nor did he permit the latter to be jealous of the former. But in order to avoid the temptation to idleness which naturally results when everybody is treated equally, whether they have worked hard or not, Paul adds that the rewards will be distributed to each one according to the work accomplished.
