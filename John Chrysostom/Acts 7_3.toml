It shows how far these men are from being children of Abraham, how obedient he was. And from your kindred. Uncomfortable (φορτικὰ) reflections, both, that he endured the labors, while you reap the fruits, and that all your ancestors were in evil case. Then came he out of the land of the Chaldæans, and dwelt in Charran: and from thence, when his father was dead, He removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell. And He gave him none inheritance in it, no, not so much as to set his foot on. (v. 4, 5.) See how he raises their thoughts away from (their possession of) the land. For if He said (that, He will give: clearly [all came from him], and nothing from themselves. For he came, having left both kindred and country. Wherefore then did He not give it to him? Truly it was a figure of another land. And He promised to give it to him. Do you perceive, that he does not merely resume the thread of his discourse? He gave him not, says he; and He promised; and to his seed after him, when as yet he had no child. Again, what God can do: that out of impossibilities, He does all. For here is a man in Persia, so far away, and this man God says He will make lord of Palestine. But let us look back to what was said before.

Whence, I pray you, did that grace bloom upon the countenance of Stephen?
