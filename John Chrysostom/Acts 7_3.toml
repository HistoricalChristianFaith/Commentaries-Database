"And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into a land which I shall show thee." "And from thy kindred." How then saith the Scripture, that Abraham's father was willing to go out? Hence we learn, that it was in consequence of Abraham's vision, that his father was moved to join in the migration. "Get thee out of thy kindred." Here he shows how far these men are from being children of Abraham, how obedient he was. "And from thy kindred." Uncomfortable reflections, both, that he endured the labors, while ye reap the fruits, and that all your ancestors were in evil case.
