There is need not of pomp of words but of strong minds, of skill in the Scriptures and of powerful thoughts. Do you not see that Paul put to flight the whole world, that he was more powerful than Plato and all the rest?.

“For the bishop,” he says, “must hold to the faithful word which is according to the teaching, that he may be able to convict even the gainsayers.” How, then, if he is inexperienced at speaking, as they say, will he be able to convict the objectors and to stop their mouths? If it is permissible to welcome such inexperience in the episcopacy, then why should any church leader bother to read books and study the Scriptures? This is all just a pretense and excuse and a pretext for carelessness and indolence.

You see what intensity of virtue he required. Not given to filthy lucre, that is, showing great contempt for money. A lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just, holy; he means, giving away all his substance to them that need. Temperate; he speaks not here of one who fasts, but of one who commands his passions, his tongue, his hands, his eyes. For this is temperance, to be drawn aside by no passion.

Holding fast the faithful word as he has been taught. By faithful is here meant true, or that which was delivered through faith, not requiring reasonings, or questionings.

Holding fast, that is, having care of it, making it his business. What then, if he be ignorant of the learning that is without? For this cause, he says, the faithful word, according to teaching.
That he may be able both to exhort, and to convince the gainsayers.

So that there is need not of pomp of words, but of strong minds, of skill in the Scriptures and of powerful thoughts. Do you not see that Paul put to flight the whole world, that he was more powerful than Plato and all the rest? But it was by miracles, you say. Not by miracles only, for if you peruse the Acts of the Apostles, you will find him often prevailing by his teaching previously to his miracles.

That he may be able by sound doctrine to exhort, that is, to retain his own people, and to overthrow the adversaries. And to convince the gainsayers. For if this is not done, all is lost. He who knows not how to combat the adversaries, and to bring every thought into captivity to the obedience of Christ, and to beat down reasonings, he who knows not what he ought to teach with regard to right doctrine, far from him be the Teacher's throne. For the other qualities may be found in those under his rule, such as to be blameless, to have his children in subjection, to be hospitable, just, holy. But that which characterizes the Teacher is this, to be able to instruct in the word, to which no regard is now paid.
