What? That for this cause I came not, to spare you. When wrote he? In the former Epistle when he said, I do not wish to see you now by the way? 1 Corinthians 16:7 I think not; but in this Epistle when he said, Lest when I come again, my God should humble me before you. 2 Corinthians 12:21 I have written then towards the end this same, says he, lest when I come, my God will humble me, and I should mourn for many of them that have sinned heretofore.

But why did you write? Lest when I came I should have sorrow from them of whom I ought to rejoice, having confidence in you all, that my joy is the joy of you all? For whereas he said he was made glad by their sorrow, and this was too arrogant and harsh, again he gave it a different turn and softened it by what he subjoined. For, he says, I therefore wrote unto you before, that I might not with anguish find you unreformed; and I said this, lest I should have sorrow, out of regard not to my own interest but yours. For I know that if you see me rejoicing you rejoice, and if you behold me sad you are sad. Observe therefore again the connection of what he said; for so his words will be more easy to understand. I came not, he says, lest I should cause you sorrow when finding you unreformed. And this I did, not studying my own advantage, but yours. For as to myself, when you are made sorry I receive no little pleasure, seeing that you care so much about me as to be sorry and distressed at my being displeased. For who is he that makes me glad, but he that is made sorry by me. However, though it be so with myself, yet because I study your advantage, I wrote this same thing to you that I might not be made sorry, herein also again studying not my advantage, but yours; for I know, that were ye to see me sad, you also would be sorry; as also you are glad when you see me rejoicing. Observe now his prudence. He said, I came not, that I might not make you sorry; although, says he, this makes me glad. Then, lest he should seem to take pleasure in their pain, he says, In this respect I am glad inasmuch as I make you feel, for in another respect I am sorry in that I am compelled to make those sorry who love me so much, not only by this rebuke, but also by being myself in sorrow and by this means causing you fresh sorrow.

But observe how he puts this so as to mingle praise; saying, from them of whom I ought to rejoice, for these are the words of one testifying kindred and much tender affection; as if one were speaking of sons on whom he had bestowed many benefits and for whom he had toiled. If then for this I write and come not; it is with weighty meaning I come not, and not because I feel hate or aversion, but rather exceeding love.

3. Next, whereas he said, he that makes me sorry makes me glad; lest they should say 'this then is what you study, that you might be made glad and might exhibit to all the extent of your power;'

Paul had already said that he was gladdened by their sorrow. This may have seemed arrogant and harsh, so to soften the impact he adds this: He knew that if he were happy they would be happy and that if he were sad, they would be sad too.â€¦ It is with weighty meaning that I do not come to you, because I feel not hate or aversion but rather exceeding love.
