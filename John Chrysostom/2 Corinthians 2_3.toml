Paul had already said that he was gladdened by their sorrow. This may have seemed arrogant and harsh, so to soften the impact he adds this: He knew that if he were happy they would be happy and that if he were sad, they would be sad too.… It is with weighty meaning that I do not come to you, because I feel not hate or aversion but rather exceeding love.
