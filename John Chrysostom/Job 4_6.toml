“Is not your fear based on folly, as is your hope, and your mischievous ways?” That is to say, was there not a foolish intention behind your actions? Eliphaz means, “Either you have not done these things, or your life is full of evil. Or you do not fear God with a righteous intention and all that you say is mere words. Your hope is based on folly.” Eliphaz states that Job’s hope was filled with foolishness. Why? Is it necessary to say that? Is it not possible that after often helping his neighbor, he has now fallen into misfortune? “No,” says Eliphaz. - "Commentary on Job 4.6"
