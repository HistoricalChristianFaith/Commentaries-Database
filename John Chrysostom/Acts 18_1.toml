What can be the reason that, having persuaded some so far as to say that they would hear him again, and there being no dangers, Paul is so in haste to leave Athens? Probably he knew that he should do them no great good; moreover he was led by the Spirit to Corinth. For the Athenians, although fond of hearing strange things, nevertheless did not attend to him; for this was not their study, but only to be always having something to say; which was the cause that made them hold off from him. It seemed to Paul sufficient to have cast the seeds of the doctrines. To Corinth then, as I said, he was led by the Spirit, in which city he was to abide.
