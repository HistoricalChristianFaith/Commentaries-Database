Therefore, let us take in our hands that stone, I mean the cornerstone, the spiritual rock. If Paul could think in these terms of the rock in the desert, no one will in any way feel resentment against me if I understand David’s stone in the same sense. In the case of the Jews in the desert, it was not the nature of the visible stone but the power of the spiritual stone which sent forth those streams of water. So, too, in David’s case, it was not the visible stone but the spiritual stone which sank into the barbarian’s head. This is why, at that time, I promised that I would say nothing based on rational arguments. “Our weapons are not merely carnal but spiritual, demolishing sophistries and reasoning and every proud height that raises itself against the knowledge of God.” - "Against the Anomoeans 11.6"
