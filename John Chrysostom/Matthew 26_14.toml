Then. When? It was when it had been made clear that he was being prepared for burial, that the Gospels would be preached everywhere and that he had been shown honor. Then Judas did the devil’s deed.But what can be the reason they mention his surname? Because there was also another Judas.
And why do they specifically say that “he was one of the twelve”? They have opted entirely to hide none of those things which seem to be matters of reproach. And yet they might have merely said that he was one of the disciples, for there were others besides. But now they add, “of the twelve,” as though they had said, of the first company of those selected as the best, of those alongside Peter and John.
