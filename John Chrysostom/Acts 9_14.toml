How was that known? It is likely that they, being in fear, made minute enquiries. He does not say this, as thinking that Christ does not know the fact, but, such being the case, how, says he, can these things be? As in fact those (in the Gospel) say, Who can be saved?â€” Mark 10:26 This is done, in order that Paul may believe him that shall come to him: he has seen in a vision: it has showed him beforehand: he prays, says (the Lord): fear not. And observe, He speaks not to him of the success achieved: teaching us not to speak of our achievements. And, though He saw him afraid, for all this He said it not. You shall not be disbelieved: he has seen, says He, in a vision a man (named) Ananias: for this is why it was in a vision, namely, because he was blind. And not even the exceeding wonderfulness of the thing took possession of the disciple's mind, so greatly was he afraid. But observe: Paul being blind, in this way He restored to sight. But the Lord said unto him, Go your way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake.
