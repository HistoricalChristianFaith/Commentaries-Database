We must diligently learn to avoid sexual immorality. But we “possess” our vessel, when it is pure; when it is impure, sin possesses it.… For it does not do the things which we wish, but what sin commands. “Not in the passion of lust,” Paul says. Here he shows also the manner of moderation. By moderation we should channel the passions of lust. For luxury, wealth, idleness, sloth, ease and all similar things lead to irregularity of lust within us.
