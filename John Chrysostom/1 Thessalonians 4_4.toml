We must diligently learn to avoid sexual immorality. But we “possess” our vessel, when it is pure; when it is impure, sin possesses it…. For it does not do the things which we wish, but what sin commands. “Not in the passion of lust,” Paul says. Here he shows also the manner of moderation. By moderation we should channel the passions of lust. For luxury, wealth, idleness, sloth, ease and all similar things lead to irregularity of lust within us.

He says, That each one of you know how to possess himself of his own vessel. It is, then, a matter to be learned, and that diligently, not to be wanton. But we possess our vessel, when it is pure; when it is impure, sin possesses it. And reasonably. For it does not do the things which we wish, but what sin commands. Not in the passion of lust, he says. Here he shows also the manner, according to which one ought to be temperate; that we should cut off the passions of lust. For luxury, and wealth, and idleness, and sloth, and ease, and all such things, lead us on to irregular lust. Even as the Gentiles, he says, which know not God. For such are they who do not expect that they shall suffer punishment.
