Wherefore also Christ in the first place leads them off from these thoughts, commanding them to await slaughter and dangers, and the utmost terrors. For, Are ye able, says He, to drink of the cup that I drink of? Matthew 20:22

But let no man be troubled at the apostles being in such an imperfect state. For not yet was the cross accomplished, not yet the grace of the Spirit given. But if you would learn their virtue, notice them after these things, and you will see them superior to every passion. For with this object He reveals their deficiencies, that after these things you might know what manner of men they became by grace.

That then they were asking, in fact, for nothing spiritual, neither had a thought of the kingdom above, is manifest from hence. But let us see also, how they come unto Him, and what they say. We would, it is said, that whatsoever we shall desire of You, You should do it for us. Mark 10:35

And Christ says to them, What would ye? Mark 10:36 not being ignorant, but that He may compel them to answer, and lay open the wound, and so apply the medicine. But they out of shame and confusion of face, because under the influence of a human passion they had come to do this, took Him privately apart from the disciples, and asked Him. For they went before, it is said, so that it might not be observable to them, and so said what they wished. For it was their desire, as I suppose, because they heard, You shall sit on twelve thrones, to have the first place of these seats. And that they had an advantage over the others, they knew, but they were afraid of Peter, and say, Command, that one sit on Your right hand, one on Your left; and they urge Him, saying, Command.

What then says He? Showing, that they asked nothing spiritual, neither, if they had known again what they were asking, would they have ventured to ask for so much, He says, You know not what ye ask, how great, how marvellous, how surpassing even the powers above. After that He adds, Are ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? Do you see, how He straightway drew them off from their suspicion, by framing His discourse from the contrary topics? For you, He says, talk to me of honor and crowns, but I to you of conflicts and labors. For this is not the season for rewards, neither shall that glory of mine appear now, but the present time is one of slaughter, and wars, and dangers.

And see how by the form of His question, He both urges and attracts them. For He said not, Are ye able to be slain? Are ye able to pour forth your blood? but how? Are ye able to drink of the cup? Then to attract them to it, He says, Which I shall drink of, that by their fellowship with Him in it they might be made more ready.

And a baptism again calls He it; showing that great was the cleansing the world was to have from the things that were being done.

They say unto Him, We are able. Matthew 20:22 Out of their forwardness they straightway undertook it, not knowing even this which they were saying, but looking to hear what they had asked.
