4. "All the brethren salute you. Salute one another with an holy kiss." This addition of the "holy kiss" he makes only  here. What may the reason be? They had been widely at variance with one another on account of their saying, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ;" on account of "one being hungry, and another drunken;" on account of their having contentions and jealousies and suits. And from the gifts there was much envying and great pride. Having then knit them together by his exhortation, he naturally bids them use the holy kiss  also as a means of union: for this unites, and produces one body. This is holy, when free from deceit and hypocrisy.

Having bound them together by his exhortation, Paul goes on to bid them to set the seal on their union by means of the holy kiss, which unites and produces one body. The kiss is holy when it is free of deceit and hypocrisy.
