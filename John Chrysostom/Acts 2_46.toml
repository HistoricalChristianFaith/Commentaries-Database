Also, they continued, daily, to be of one accord in the temple:
they enjoyed the benefit of teaching. Consider how these Jews did nothing else great or small, than busily attend at the temple. For, as having become more earnest, they had increased devotion also to the place. For the Apostles did not for the present pluck them away from this object, for fear of injuring them, and daily they went up as to a sacred place, as frequently we find Peter and John doing this: for at present they disturbed none of the Jewish observances.

with exultation and simplicity of heart:
For no gladness can exist where there is no simplicity.
