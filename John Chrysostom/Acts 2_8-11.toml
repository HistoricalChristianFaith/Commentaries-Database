Even Plato, who talked a great deal, is now silent. His voice was heard everywhere, not only among his own people but also among the Parthians, the Medes, the Elamites, in India, in short, in every part of the earth and to the ends of the world. But where is the arrogance of Greece now? Where the name of Athens? Where the ravings of the philosophers? He of Galilee, he of Bethsaida, he, the uncouth rustic, has overcome them all. Are you not ashamed (confess it!) at the very name of your vanquisherâ€™s country? And if you hear his own name as well, that he was called Cephas, you will hide your faces even more. For this has utterly defeated you, because you believe it is a disgrace; you believe that glibness of tongue is praiseworthy and lack of glibness a disgrace. You did not travel the road that ought to have been followed. Instead, you left the road to the kingdom, so easy and smooth, and walked the road that was rough, steep and laborious. Therefore, you did not arrive at the kingdom of heaven.
