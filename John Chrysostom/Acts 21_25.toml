Here with a kind of remonstrance (ἐ ντρεπτικὥς), As we, say they, commanded them, although we are preachers to the Jews, so do thou, although a preacher to the Gentiles, cooperate with us. Observe Paul: he does not say, Well, but I can bring forward Timothy, whom I circumcised: well, but I can satisfy them by what I have to say (of myself): but he complied, and did all: for in fact thus was it expedient (to do). For it was one thing to take (effectual) measures for clearing himself, and another to have done these things without the knowledge of any (of the parties). It was a step open to no suspicion, the fact of his even bearing the expenses. Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, signifying the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
