And that they may not say, that it was in flattery he so called Him, and that this was a human judgment, see what He says, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord? See how submissively He introduces the sentence and judgment concerning Himself. First, He had said, What do you think? Whose Son is He? so by a question to bring them to an answer. Then since they said, the Son of David, He said not, And yet David says these things, but again in this order of a question, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord? in order that the sayings might not give offense to them. Wherefore neither did He say, What think ye of me, but of Christ. For this reason the apostles also reasoned submissively, saying, Let us speak freely of the Patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried. Acts 2:29

And He Himself too in like manner for this cause introduces the doctrine in the way of question and inference, saying, How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit on my right hand, until I make Your foes Your footstool; Matthew 22:44 and again, If David then call Him Lord, how is He then his Son, Matthew 22:45 not taking away the fact that He is his Son, away with the thought; for He would not then have reproved Peter for this, but to correct their secret thoughts. So that when He says, How is He his Son? He means this, not so as you say. For they said, that He is Son only, and not also Lord. And this after the testimony, and then submissively, If David then call Him Lord, how is He his Son?
