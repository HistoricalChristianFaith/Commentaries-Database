(Hom. lxxxi.) Or, by the first day, he means the day before the days of unleavened bread. For the Jews always reckoned their day from the evening; and this day of which he speaks was that on the evening of which they were to kill the Passover, namely, the fifth day of the weekb.

Hence it is evident that He had neither house nor lodging. Nor, I conclude, had the disciples any, for they would surely have invited Him thither.

Or, we may say that this, to such a man, shows that He sent them to some person unknown to them, teaching them thereby that He was able to avoid His Passion. For He who prevailed with this man to entertain Him, how could He not have prevailed with those who crucified Him, had He chosen not to suffer? Indeed, I marvel not only that he entertained Him, being a stranger, but that he did it in contempt of the hatred of the multitude.

My time is at hand, this He said, both by so manifold announcements of His Passion, fortifying His disciples against the event, and at the same time showing that He undertook it voluntarily. I will keep the Passover at thy house, wherein we see, that to the very last day He was not disobedient to the Law. With my disciples, He adds, that there might be sufficient preparation made, and that he to whom He sent might not think that He desired to be concealed.

By “the first day of the feast of unleavened bread,” he means the day before that feast. For it is customary always to reckon the day from the evening. He mentions this with regard to the evening of the Passover. It was on the fifth day of the week they came to him. Hence on the day before the feast of unleavened bread they came to him. As to the time, Mark says, “On the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb.”

The disciples came to him then on the first day, that is, the evening, when the Passover was drawing very near, and said, “Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover?” Even from this it is clear that he had no house, no place in which to live, and I suppose neither had they. For surely they would have asked him to come there. But none of them had anything, having given away all their worldly possessions. Why did he keep the Passover? To indicate in every way and until the last day that he was not opposed to the law. And for what possible reason does he send them to an unknown person? To also show by this that he might have avoided suffering. For he had the power to change the minds of those who crucified him. So it is once again clear: He is willing to suffer.
