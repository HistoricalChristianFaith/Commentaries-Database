"For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead."

But if by a man, doubtless by one having a body. And observe his thoughtfulness, how on another ground also he makes his argument inevitable. As thus: "he that is defeated," saith he, "must in his own person also renew the conflict, the nature which was cast down must itself also gain the victory. For so the reproach was wiped away."

But let us see what kind of death he is speaking of.
