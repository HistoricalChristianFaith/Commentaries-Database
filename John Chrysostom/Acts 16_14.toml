"And a certain woman": a woman and she of low condition, from her trade too: but mark in her a woman of elevated mind. In the first place, the fact of God's calling her bears testimony to her.

"And a certain woman, named Lydia, a seller of purple": observe how the writer of the history is not ashamed of the occupations of the converts: moreover neither was this city of the Philippians a great one. Having learnt these things, let us also be ashamed of no man. Peter abides with a tanner; Paul with a woman who was a seller of purple, and a foreigner. Where is pride? "Whose heart the Lord opened." Therefore we need God, to open the heart: but God opens the hearts that are willing: for there are hardened hearts to be seen. "So that she attended to the things which were spoken of Paul." The opening, then, was God's work, the attending was hers: so that it was both God's doing and man's.
