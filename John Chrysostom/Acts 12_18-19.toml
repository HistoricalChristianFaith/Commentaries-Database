Some persons, it is likely, are at a loss how to explain it, that God should quietly look on while His champions are put to death, and now again the soldiers on account of Peter: and yet it was possible for Him after delivering Peter to rescue them also. But it was not yet the time of judgment, so as to render to each according to his deserts. And besides, it was not Peter that put them into his hands. For the thing that most annoyed him was the being mocked; just as in the case of his grandfather when he was deceived by the wise men, that was what made him feel cut to the heart - the being eluded and made ridiculous. "And having put them to the question," it says, "he ordered them to be led away to execution." And yet he had heard from them - for he had put them to the question - both that the chains had been left, and that he had taken his sandals, and that until that night he was with them.

For if the Angel had brought out the soldiers also, along with Peter, it would have been thought a case of flight. Then why, you may ask, was it not otherwise managed? Why, where is the harm? Now, if we see that they who have suffered unjustly, take no harm, we shall not raise these questions. For why do you not say the same of James? Why did not God rescue him? "There was no small stir among the soldiers." So clearly had they perceived nothing of what had happened. Lo, I take up the plea in their defence. The chains were there, and the keepers within, and the prison shut, nowhere a wall broken through, all told the same tale: the man had been carried off: why dost thou condemn them? Had they wished to let him off, they would have done it before, or would have gone out with him. "But he gave them money?" And how should he, who had not to give even to a poor man, have the means to give to these? And then neither had the chains been broken, nor were they loosed. He ought to have seen, that the thing was of God, and no work of man.
