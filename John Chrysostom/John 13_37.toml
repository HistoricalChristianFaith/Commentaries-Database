[Jesus says to Peter], You shall know from this temptation that your love is nothing without the presence of the impulse from above. From this it is clear that in caring for him, Jesus allowed Peter to fall. Jesus wanted to teach him by what he had said earlier, but in the face of Peter’s vehemence, Jesus did not throw or force him into his denial but rather left him alone in order that he might learn his own weakness.… Since Peter is in the habit of contradicting Jesus, Jesus next teaches him not to oppose him.… In every way, Jesus teaches Peter humility and proves that human nature by itself is nothing.
