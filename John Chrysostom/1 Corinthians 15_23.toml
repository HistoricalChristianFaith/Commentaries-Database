"But every man in his own order."

For do not, because you hear of a resurrection, imagine that all enjoy the same benefits. Since if in the punishment all will not suffer alike but the difference is great; much more where there are sinners and righteous men shall the separation be yet wider.

"Christ the first-fruits, then they that are Christ's;" i.e., the faithful and the approved.
