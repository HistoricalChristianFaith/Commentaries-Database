Just because everyone will be raised from the dead, do not imagine that all will enjoy the same benefits. Even just thinking of punishment, there is a great difference in the degrees of suffering which will be inflicted. How much more then will there be a difference between the fate of sinners, on the one hand, and the righteous on the other.
