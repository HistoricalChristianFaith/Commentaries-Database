I say this, for Isaiah said, “The Lord has given me a learned tongue that I should know when I ought to speak a word.” Furthermore, what of Jeremiah? When he was sent, he then was inspired by God. And what of Ezekiel? For, when he had eaten the chapter of the book, he then spoke prophetically. - "Homilies on the Gospel of John 69"
