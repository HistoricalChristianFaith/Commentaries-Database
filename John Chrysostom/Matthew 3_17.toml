Jesus freely identified himself with the people. For if he were not one of the people, he would not have come with the people for John’s baptism. Yet this caused some to imagine that John was greater than Jesus. In order that this opinion not be entertained, when Jesus was baptized the Spirit came down, and a voice with the Spirit proclaimed the identity of the Only Begotten. The voice said, “This is my beloved Son.” The voice was not identifying John but Jesus. The voice did not say this one who is baptized, but simply “this.” The Spirit came in the form of a dove, drawing the voice toward Jesus and making it evident to all that “this” was not spoken of John who baptized, but of Jesus who was baptized.
