He then shows the way in which the Father draws. “It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ ” You see the excellence of faith: that it cannot be learned from people or by the teaching of people but only from God himself.… If then all shall be taught by God, how is it that some shall not believe?

For the Teacher sits ready to impart what he has to everyone and dispenses his truth to all.
