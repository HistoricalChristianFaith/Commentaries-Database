Do you see the dignity of faith, and that not of men nor by man, but by God Himself they shall  learn this? And to make this assertion credible, He referred them to their prophets. If then 'all shall be taught of God,' how is it that some shall not believe? Because the words are spoken of the greater number. Besides, the prophecy means not absolutely all, but all that have the will. For the teacher sits ready to impart what he has to all, and pouring forth his instruction unto all.

He then shows the way in which the Father draws. “It is written in the prophets, ‘And they shall all be taught of God.’ ” You see the excellence of faith: that it cannot be learned from people or by the teaching of people but only from God himself.… If then all shall be taught by God, how is it that some shall not believe? Because all here only means in general. Besides, the prophecy does not mean absolutely everyone but all who have the desire. For the Teacher sits ready to impart what he has to everyone and dispenses his truth to all.
