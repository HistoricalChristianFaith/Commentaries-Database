The Scripture indicates that this man was extremely weak in faith, as is evident at four points: from Christ’s saying that “All things are possible to him that believes;” from the saying of the man himself as he approached, “Help me in my unbelief;” from Christ’s commanding the devil to “enter no more into him;” and from the man’s saying again to Christ, “If you can.”
