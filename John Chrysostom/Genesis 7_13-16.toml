The text goes on, “The Lord God shut the ark from the outside.” Notice in this place too the considerateness in the expression “God shut the ark from the outside,” to teach us that he had ensured the good man’s complete safety. The reason for adding “from the outside” to “he shut” was that the good man might not be in the position of seeing the disaster occur and suffering even greater distress. I mean, if he brooded over that terrible flood and set indelibly in his mind the destruction of the human race, the complete annihilation of all brute beasts and the disappearance, as it were, of people, animals and the earth itself, he would have been disturbed and anguished.
