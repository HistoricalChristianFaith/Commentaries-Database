This man is not a Jew, nor of those under the law, but he had already anticipated our manner of life. Observe, thus far, two persons, both of high rank, receiving the faith, the eunuch at Gaza and this man; and the pains taken on behalf of these men. But do not imagine that this was because of their high rank: God forbid! It was because of their piety. The Scripture mentions their dignified stations to show the greatness of their piety, since it is more wonderful when a person in a position of wealth and power is such as these were.
