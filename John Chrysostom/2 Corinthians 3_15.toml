"But even unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies upon their heart."

For since he said that in the reading of the Old Testament the veil remains, lest any should think that this that is said is from the obscurity of the Law, he both by other things showed even before what his meaning was, (for by saying, "their minds were hardened," he shows that the fault was their own,) and, in this place too, again. For he said not, 'The veil remains on the writing,' but "in the reading;" (now the reading is the act of those that read;) and again, "When Moses is read." He showed this however with greater clearness in the expression which follows next, saying unreservedly, "The veil lies upon their heart." For even upon the face of Moses it lay, not because of Moses, but because of the grossness and carnal mind of these.

Having then suitably  accused them, he points out also the manner of their correction. And what is this?
