Let us compare, beloved, with that night these nights of ours, with their revellings, their drunkenness, and wanton excesses, with their sleep which might as well be death, their watchings which are worse than sleep. For while some sleep without sense or feeling, others lie awake to pitiable and wretched purpose, plotting deceits, anxiously thinking about money, studying how they may be revenged upon those who do them wrong, meditating enmity, reckoning up the abusive words spoken during the day: thus do they rake up the smouldering embers of wrath, doing things intolerable. Mark how Peter slept. Acts 12:6 Both there, it was wisely ordered (that he should be asleep); for the Angel came to him, and it behooved that none should see what happened; and on the other hand it was well ordered here (that Paul should be awake), in order that the keeper of the prison might be prevented from killing himself. And suddenly there was a great earthquake.

Who is equal to these souls? After being whipped they received numerous blows and underwent insults and extreme dangers. While fastened in stocks in the innermost cell, they stayed awake not wanting to fall asleep. Do you see how great the affliction of the righteous is? We sleep in soft beds without any fear throughout the night. Maybe they stayed awake because they were in this state. The tyrant sleep did not catch them, pain did not bend them, fear did not make them dispirited, but these things spurred them on even more.

Let us set against that night these nights of revelry, drunkenness and wanton excesses, when sleep is no different from death and sleeplessness worse than sleep. For while some people sleep without sense or feeling, others lie awake to pitiful and wretched purpose, weaving treacherous plots, scheming for money, struggling to ward off those who wrong them, nursing hatred, counting up words of abuse spoken during the day. Thus they stoke the fire of their wrath, working up unbearable things. Look how Peter slept. It was part of the divine plan. For the angel came to him and it was necessary that no one should see what happened. Likewise here, it was well that Paul was awake: he prevented the jailer from killing himself.
