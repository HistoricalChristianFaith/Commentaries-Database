Wherefore does He ask them? Lest any one should think that when they wish to receive one thing, He gives them another thing. For indeed it is usual with Him on every occasion, first to make manifest and discover to all the virtue of those He is healing, and then to apply the cure, for one reason, that He might lead on the others likewise to emulation; and for another, that He might show that they were enjoying the gift worthily. This, for instance, He did with respect to the Canaanitish woman also, this too in the case of the centurion, this again as to her that had the issue of blood, or rather that marvellous woman even anticipated the Lord's inquiry; but not so did He pass her by, but even after the cure makes her manifest. Such earnest care had He on every occasion to proclaim the good deeds of them that come to Him, and to show them to be much greater than they are, which He does here also.

Lest anyone might think that the blind men ask for one thing but Jesus gave them something else, we must examine why he asks them, “What do you want me to do?” It indeed was usual with him on many occasions that he first sought to discover all the highest moral excellences of one he was healing and only then to apply the cure. He did this in order that he might lead others to emulate their good qualities and that he might show that they were receiving the gift of healing in a worthy manner. He did this, for instance, in the case of the Canaanite woman, and also in the case of the centurion19 and with the woman suffering from bleeding. We especially remember that this marvelous woman even anticipated the Lord’s inquiry. But recall that he did not pass her by. Even after her healing he kept looking around to see who had done it. Such earnest care he had on every occasion. He wished to make known the good qualities of those who came to him and to show them to be much greater than they are. This he also does here.Then, when they cried out what they desired, he had compassion on them and touched them. For this alone is the cause of their cure. It is the end for which he came into the world. Even though it is filled with mercy and grace, it seeks worthy recipients.
