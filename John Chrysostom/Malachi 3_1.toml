And what sort of connection may this have with what was said before? Much, assuredly, and in full accord with it. By this topic also he proceeds to urge and press them into faith. At the same time he is speaking in agreement with what had been before said by John. “For if all things are fulfilled even down to John, I am ‘he that should come.’ ”“For all the prophets,” says he, “and the law prophesied until John.” For the prophets would not have ceased unless I were come. Expect, therefore, nothing further, and do not wait for anyone else. For that I am he who is manifest both from the prophets ceasing and from those that every day “take by force” the faith that is in me. For so manifest is it and certain that many even take it by force. Why, who has so taken it? Tell me. All who approach it with earnestness of mind.
Then he states also another infallible sign, saying, “If you will receive it, he is Elijah, who was to come.” For “I will send you,” it is said, “Elijah the Tishbite, who shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children.” This man then is Elijah, if you attend exactly, says he. For “ ‘I will send,’ says he, ‘my messenger before your face.’ ” And well has he said, “If you will receive it,” to show the absence of force. For I do not constrain, says he. And this he said, as requiring a candid mind and showing that John is Elijah, and Elijah John. For both of them received one ministry, and both of them became forerunners. He did not simply say, “This is Elijah,” but “If you are willing to receive it, this is he,” that is, if with a candid mind you give heed to what is going on. And he did not stop even at this, but to the words “this is Elijah, who was to come” he added, to show that understanding is needed, “he that has ears to hear, let him hear.”
