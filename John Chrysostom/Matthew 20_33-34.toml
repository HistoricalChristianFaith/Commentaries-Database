Note that they did not hasten away after their cure, as happened on numerous occasions, with those who were less than grateful after receiving benefits. Not so with these two blind men, whose worthiness to receive is seen both in what they cried out and that they followed. They were persevering before the gift and grateful after the gift. For it says that they followed him.
