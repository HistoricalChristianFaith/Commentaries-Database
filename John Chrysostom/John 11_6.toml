Wherefore tarried He? That Lazarus might breathe his last, and be buried; that none might be able to assert that He restored him when not yet dead, saying that it was a lethargy, a fainting, a fit,  but not death. On this account He tarried so long, that corruption began, and they said, He now stinks.
