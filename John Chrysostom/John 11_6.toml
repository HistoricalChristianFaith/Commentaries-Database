Wherefore tarried He? That Lazarus might breathe his last, and be buried; that none might be able to assert that He restored him when not yet dead, saying that it was a lethargy, a fainting, a fit,  but not death. On this account He tarried so long, that corruption began, and they said, He now stinks.

To give time for his death and burial, that they might say, he stinks, and none doubt that it was death, and not atrance, from which he was raised.
He had not as yet told His disciples where He was going; but now He tells them, in order to prepare them beforehand, for they are in great alarm, when they hear of it: His disciples say to Him, Master, the Jews sought to stone you, and you go there again? They feared both for Him, and for themselves; for they were not yet confirmed in faith.
As if to say, the upright need fear no evil: the wicked only have cause to fear. We have done nothing worthy of death, and therefore are in no danger. Or, If any one sees this worldâ€™s light, he is safe; much more he who is with Me.
