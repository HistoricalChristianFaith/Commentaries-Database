“And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God.” That shout arose from joy and great emotion. Such indeed are the prayers that do their work, prayers filled with true philosophy, prayers offered up for such reasons by such persons, on such occasions, in such a manner. All others are abominable and profane. Notice how we hear of nothing that is superfluous, no old wives’ talk or fables. No, it is of his power that they speak.
