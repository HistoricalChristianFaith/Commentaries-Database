By “throne” here he means not simply throne but kingship. He calls it eternal here, but elsewhere elevated: “I saw the Lord seated on an elevated throne,” Scripture says. And again: “Because your throne is elevated.” Another author … contemplates him seated on a throne of glory, whereas David presents also a throne of lovingkindness: “Mercy and judgment the foundation of his throne.” Now, all of these references are to his kingship, that it is everlasting (this is the meaning of “for ages of ages”), that it is in high esteem, that it is elevated, that it is powerful and mighty. Also that it has no beginning, when he says, “Your kingdom a kingdom of all ages.”
