Consider the degree of evil of those inhabitants such as even to begrudge the good man water. Not even the king, despite his having so much wealth, could withstand the impulse of envy but said, “Depart from us, because you have become far too powerful for us.” What terrible malice; why, in fact, are you driving the good man off? Surely Isaac caused your subjects no harm? Surely he did no wrong? But that is what envy is like: It does nothing out of calm reason. I mean, on seeing the good man enjoying such favor from the God of all, Abimelech should rather have respected him, should rather have shown him honor so as himself to win favor from on high because of the honor shown him. But instead of doing that, he even tried to drive him off, saying, “Depart from us, because you have become far too powerful for us.”That is what envy is like, after all: It cannot simply accept others’ success but instead regards the neighbor’s prosperity as a disaster for itself and is devastated by the neighbor’s good fortune. That is precisely what happened here: having authority over the whole city and holding everyone in his thrall, the king said to this nomad, this vagrant, wandering hither and yon, “Depart from us, because you have become far too powerful for us.” Isaac really was more powerful, with help from above in every circumstance and protected by God’s right hand.
