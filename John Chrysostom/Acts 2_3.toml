"And there appeared unto them," it says, "cloven tongues like as of fire." Observe how it is always, "like as;" and rightly: that you may have no gross sensible notions of the Spirit. Also, "as it were of a blast:" therefore it was not a wind. "Like as of fire." For when the Spirit was to be made known to John, then it came upon the head of Christ as in the form of a dove: but now, when a whole multitude was to be converted, it is "like as of fire. And it sat upon each of them." This means, that it remained and rested upon them. For the sitting is significant of settledness and continuance.

The roll of a book is given him, and Ezekiel ate what he was about to utter. "And it became in his mouth," it is said, "as honey for sweetness." And again the hand of God touches the tongue of another Prophet; but here it is the Holy Ghost Himself: so equal is He in honor with the Father and the Son. And again, on the other hand, Ezekiel calls it "Lamentations, and mourning, and woe." To them it might well be in the form of a book; for they still needed similitudes. Those had to deal with only one nation, and with their own people; but these with the whole world, and with men whom they never knew. Also Elisha receives the grace through the medium of a mantle; another by oil, as David; and Moses by fire, as we read of him at the bush. But in the present case it is not so; for the fire itself sat upon them. But the story shows, that it is the same here as there. For you are not to stop at this, that "there appeared unto them cloven tongues" but note that they were "of fire." Such a fire as this is able to kindle infinite fuel. Also, it is well said, Cloven, for they were from one root; that you may learn, that it was an operation sent from the Comforter.
