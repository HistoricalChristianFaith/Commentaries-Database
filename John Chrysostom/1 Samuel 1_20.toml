Let the men among us emulate her, let the women among us imitate her: the woman is teacher of both sexes. Those who are sterile, let them not despair; those who are mothers, let them bring up in this fashion the children they have borne; and let everyone emulate this woman’s faith in giving birth and zeal following the birth. I mean, what could reveal sounder values than the way she meekly and nobly put up in such a manner with an intolerable calamity and did not desist until she had escaped the disaster and discovered a remarkable and baffling outcome of the problem, finding no helper or ally here below. In fact, she experienced the Lord’s lovingkindness—hence she made her approach on her own and achieved what she wanted. That is to say, the remedy for that depression depended not on human help but on divine grace.
