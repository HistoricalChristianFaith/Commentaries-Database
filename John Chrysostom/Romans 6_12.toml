It is absurd for those who are being led toward the kingdom of God to have sin ruling over them or for those who are called to reign with Christ to choose to be captives to sin, as if one should throw down the crown from off his head and choose to be the slave of a hysterical woman who comes begging and covered in rags.… How is it that sin can reign in you? It is not from any power of its own but only from your laziness. HOMILIES ON ROMANS 11.JEROME:Because men are not my masters, because sin is not my lord—for sin does not reign in my mortal body—I am your servant.
