Excellent truly the good deeds at their feasts! They are eager for murder, and wish to seize Him, even during the feast.  At least, in another place they speak thus, Think ye that He will not come to the feast? John 11:56; and here they said, Where is He? Through their excessive hatred and enmity they would not even call Him by name. Great was their reverence towards the feast, great their caution. By occasion of  the very feast they wished  to entrap Him!
