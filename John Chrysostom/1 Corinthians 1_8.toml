7. "Who shall also confirm you unto the end, that you may be unreprovable." Here he seems to court them, but the saying is free from all flattery; for he knows also how to press them home; as when he says, [1 Corinthians 4:18-21] "Now some are puffed up as though I would not come to you:" and again, "What will you? Shall I come unto you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?" And, [2 Corinthians 13:3] "Since you seek a proof of Christ speaking in me." But he is also covertly accusing them: for, to say, "He shall confirm," and the word "unreprovable" marks them out as still wavering, and liable to reproof.

But do thou consider how he always fastens them as with nails to the Name of Christ. And not any man nor teacher, but continually the Desired One Himself is remembered by him: setting himself, as it were to arouse those who were heavy-headed after some debauch. For no where in any other Epistle does the Name of Christ occur so continually. But here it is, many times in a few verses; and by means of it he weaves together, one may say, the whole of the proem. Look at it from the beginning. "Paul called [to be] an Apostle of Jesus Christ, to them that have been sanctified in Jesus Christ, who call upon the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, grace [be] unto you and peace from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God for the grace which has been given you by Jesus Christ, even as the testimony of Christ has been confirmed in you, waiting for the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ, who shall confirm you unreprovable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is faithful, by whom you have been called into the fellowship of His Son Jesus Christ our Lord. And I beseech you by the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ." Do you see the constant repetition of the Name of Christ? From whence it is plain even to the most unobservant, that not by chance nor unwittingly he does this, but in order that by incessant application  of that glorious Name he may foment  their inflammation, and purge out the corruption of the disease.

This is not praise but backhanded reproof, since the Corinthians were far from “guiltless,” as the rest of the epistle makes clear.
