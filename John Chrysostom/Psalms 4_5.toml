Seek after righteousness, make an offering of righteousness: this is the greatest gift to God, this an acceptable sacrifice, this an offering of great appeal, not sacrificing sheep and calves but doing righteous things.… This sacrifice requires no money, no sword, no altar, no fire; it does not dissolve into smoke and ashes and smells; rather, the intention of the offerer suffices. Poverty is no impediment to it nor indigence a problem, nor the place nor anything else like that; instead, wherever you are, you are fit to offer sacrifice, you are priest, and altar, and sword and victim. This, you see, is what things of the mind and spirit are like. They enjoy greater facility; they have no need of outside prompting.… Whom is there left to fear if you have God as your ally? No one. Now, this is no little virtue, having confidence in him, putting trust in him. But along with righteousness he also asks this virtue of us, to put our trust in him to hope in him, to place no confidence in things of this life but rather detach ourselves from everything and fix our minds on him. After all, the things of the present life are like dreams and shadows and have even less substance than they do, appearing and departing at the same time; when present they cause their possessors awful worry. Hope in God, [by contrast], is immortal, unchangeable, immovable; it is subject to no alteration, stands firm and steady and renders unassailable the one who professes it in all diligence and with a proper disposition.
