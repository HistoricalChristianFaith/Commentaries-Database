"Do you not know that we shall judge angels? How much more, things which pertain to this life?"

Some say that here the priests are hinted at, but away with this. His speech is about demons. For had he been speaking about corrupt priests, he would have meant them above when he said, "the world is judged in you:" (for the Scripture is wont to call evil men also "The world:") and he would not have said the same thing twice, nor would he, as if he was saying something of greater consequence, have put it down afterwards. But he speaks concerning those angels about whom Christ says, "Depart ye into the fire which is prepared for the devil and his angels." [Matthew 25:41] And Paul, "his angels fashion themselves as ministers of righteousness." [2 Corinthians 11:15] For when the very incorporeal powers shall be found inferior to us who are clothed with flesh, they shall suffer heavier punishment.

But if some should still contend that he speaks of priests, "What sort of priests?" let us ask. Those whose walk in life has been worldly, of course. In what sense then does he say, "We shall judge angels, much more things that relate to this life?" He mentions the angels, in contradistinction to "things relating to this life": likely enough; for they are removed from the need of these things, because of the superior excellence of their nature.

Some people say that Paul was thinking of corrupt priests when he said this, but that cannot be right. He is really talking about the demons.
