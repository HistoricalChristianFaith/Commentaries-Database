By examples he teaches them prudence; and, by way of encouragement, mentions last the man who seduced the greatest number. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: "for," saith the Scripture, "in the mouth of two witnesses": and yet he had it in his power to mention even three. "Refrain from these men." See how mild his manner is, and his speech not long, but concise, and his mention even of those impostors how free from passion: "And all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered." And for all this he does not blaspheme Christ.
