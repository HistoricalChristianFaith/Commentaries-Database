He shows his love not only by telling them his news but also by asking for theirs. This is the mark of a soul that is constantly permeated with solicitude and consideration.… Why did he say not “so that you may know my affairs” but “so that I may know yours”? The reason is that Epaphroditus was going to bring news of him before Timothy.
