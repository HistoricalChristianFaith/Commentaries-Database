Then he adduces these Gentiles themselves as witnesses: "ye know," says he, "the matter which came to pass throughout all Judea, beginning at Galilee - then he confirms it from this also - after the baptism which John preached" - "even Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Ghost and with power." He does not mean, Ye know Jesus, for they did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him.

Then he proves how He was Lord of all, from the things which He achieved "throughout all Judea. For ye know," saith he, "the matter which came to pass throughout all Judea:" and, what is the wonderful part of it, "beginning at Galilee: after the baptism which John preached." First he speaks of His success, and then again he says concerning Him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Why, what a stumbling-block, this birthplace!
