But what means it, "How God first did visit?" It means from the beginning. Moreover he well says, "Symeon expounded," implying that he too spake the mind of others. "And to this agree," etc. Observe how he shows that this is a doctrine of old time. "To take out of the Gentiles," he says, "a people for His Name." Not simply, Chose, but, "for His Name," that is for His glory. His Name is not shamed by the taking the Gentiles first, but it is even a greater glory. Here some even great thing is hinted at: that these are chosen before all.
