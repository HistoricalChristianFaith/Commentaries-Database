It is possible to be a widow and not be enrolled in the rank of widows, as when a woman has not as yet accepted this way of life.… Paul allows the uncommitted woman to remarry if she so desires. But he strongly admonishes the one who has professed perpetual widowhood to God but then has later gotten married, because she has treated superficially her commitment to God.
