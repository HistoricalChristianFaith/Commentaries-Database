Here it is as though Jesus had said: They shall be safe and secure, that is, they shall remain within and no one shall throw them out. This is in reference to the apostles who went in and out boldly as though they had become masters of all the world. None could turn them out of their kingdom. But by “pasture,” Jesus means his own nurturing and feeding of the sheep as well as his power and lordship.
