As though He had said, shall be in safety and security, (but by pasture, He here means His nurturing and feeding the sheep, and His power  and Lordship,) that is, shall remain within, and none shall thrust him out. Which took place in the case of the Apostles, who came in and went out securely, as having become lords of all the world, and none was able to cast them out.
