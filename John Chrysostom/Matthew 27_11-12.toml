What does Christ answer to Pilate’s question? “You have said so.” He confessed that he was [indeed] a king, but a heavenly king. This would be made clearer elsewhere when he replied more specifically to Pilate, “My kingship is not of this world.” He gives a reason that cannot be doubted: “If my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over.” There was, of course, no excuse for even making such accusations, either from the governor or priests. For in order to refute this suspicion he paid a tax and taught others to pay it. And when others wanted to make him a king, he fled.

So why then did he not defend himself reasonably by recalling these acts when he was under accusation of being a usurper of power? Because his acts themselves proved his meekness and gentleness and spiritual power. They were beyond number. The judicial process was corrupt, and his accusers were willfully blind and dealt unfairly. So he chose to reply to nothing. He held his peace. He answered briefly to the authorities so as not to appear arrogant from continuing silence. But he did not say anything in reply to these false accusations. He knew he was not likely to persuade them.
