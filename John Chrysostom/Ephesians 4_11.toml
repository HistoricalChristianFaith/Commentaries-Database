“First apostles,” because these had all the gifts. “Then prophets,” for there were some who were not apostles but were prophets, like Agabus. “Third, evangelists,” those who did not travel everywhere but merely preached the gospel, like Priscilla and Aquila. “Shepherds and teachers” means all those in positions of trust. Are these shepherds and teachers of less account? Certainly it seems that those who are stationary and reside in a single place, like Timothy and Titus, [are of less account] than those who go about the world preaching the gospel. But on another reading we cannot from this passage deduce subordination and precedence but from a different letter. .

What he said elsewhere, Wherefore also God has highly exalted Him Philippians 2:9, that says he also here. He that descended, is the same also that ascended. It did Him no injury that He came down into the lower parts of the earth, nor was it any hindrance to His becoming far higher than the Heavens. So that the more a man is humbled, so much the more is he exalted. For as in the case of water, the more a man presses it downwards, the more he forces it up; and the further a man retires to hurl a javelin, the surer his aim; so is it also with humility. However, when we speak of ascents with reference to God, we must needs conceive a descent first; but when with reference to man, not at all so. Then he goes on to show further His providential care, and His wisdom, for He who has wrought such things as these, who had such might, and who refused not to go down even to those lower parts for our sakes, never would He have made these distributions of spiritual gifts without a purpose. Now elsewhere he tells us that this was the work of the Spirit, in the words, In the which the Holy Ghost has made you bishops to feed the Church of God. And here he says that it is the Son; and elsewhere that it is God. And He gave to the Church some apostles, and some prophets. But in the Epistle to the Corinthians, he says, I planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase. And again, Now he that plants and he that waters are one: but each shall receive his own reward according to his own labor. 1 Corinthians 3:6-8 So is it also here; for what if you bring in but little? You have received so much. First, he says, apostles; for these had all gifts; secondarily, prophets, for there were some who were not indeed apostles, but prophets, as Agabus; thirdly, evangelists, who did not go about everywhere, but only preached the Gospel, as Priscilla and Aquila; pastors and teachers, those who were entrusted with the charge of a whole nation. What then? Are the pastors and the teachers inferior? Yes, surely; those who were settled and employed about one spot, as Timothy and Titus, were inferior to those who went about the world and preached the Gospel. However, it is not possible from this passage to frame the subordination and precedence, but from another Epistle. He gave, says he; you must not say a word to gainsay it. Or perhaps by evangelists he means those who wrote the Gospel.
