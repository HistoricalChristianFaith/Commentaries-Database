“First apostles,” because these had all the gifts. “Then prophets,” for there were some who were not apostles but were prophets, like Agabus. “Third, evangelists,” those who did not travel everywhere but merely preached the gospel, like Priscilla and Aquila. “Shepherds and teachers” means all those in positions of trust. Are these shepherds and teachers of less account? Certainly it seems that those who are stationary and reside in a single place, like Timothy and Titus, [are of less account] than those who go about the world preaching the gospel. But on another reading we cannot from this passage deduce subordination and precedence but from a different letter.
