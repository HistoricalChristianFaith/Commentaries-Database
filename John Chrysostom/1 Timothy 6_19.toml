Laying up in store for themselves a good foundation against the time to come.

There nothing is uncertain, for the foundation being firm, there is no instability, all is firm, fixed, immovable, fast, and enduring.

That they may lay hold, he says, on eternal life.

For the doing of good works can secure the enjoyment of eternal life.
