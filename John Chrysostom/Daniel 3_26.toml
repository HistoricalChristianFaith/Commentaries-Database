“You servants of the most high God, come forth and come here!” How are they to come forth, O king? Did you not cast them into the fire bound? But because they sang praises to God, they were saved. The fire reverenced their readiness to suffer, and afterwards it reverenced that wonderful song and their hymns of praise. By what title do you then call them? As I noted earlier, “You servants of the most high God.” Yes, to the servants of God all things are possible; for if some, who are the servants of people, have, just so, power and authority … much more have the servants of God. He called them by the name most delightful to them; he knew that by this means he flattered them most; for indeed, if it was in order to continue to be servants of God that they entered into the fire, there could be no sound more delightful to them than this. Had he called them kings, had he called them lords of the world, yet he would not have brought them joy as when he called them “servants of the most high God.”
