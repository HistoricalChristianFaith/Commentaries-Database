What Jesus says is like this: I, being God, did not need the witness of John, which is a human witness. And yet, because you listened to him and believe that he is more trustworthy than anyone else, and because you ran to him as to a prophet (for “all the city came out to the Jordan”) and, finally, because you have not believed on me even when I performed miracles, therefore I remind you of that witness of his.
