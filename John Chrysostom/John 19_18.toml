Who cares if the Jews did these things with a different intent? They crucified him too with thieves, in this also unintentionally fulfilling prophecy. For what they did for insult contributed to the truth, that you may learn how great its power is, since the prophet of old had foretold, “He was numbered with the transgressors.” The devil therefore wished to cast a veil over what was done but was unable. For the three were crucified, but Jesus alone was glorious, that you may learn that his power affected all. Yet the miracles took place when the three had been nailed to the cross. But no one attributed anything of what was done to either of those others but to Jesus only. This is how the plot of the devil was rendered so entirely impotent and how everything rained back on his own head. For even of these two, one was saved. He therefore did not insult the glory of the cross but contributed to it not a little. For it was not a lesser matter than shaking the rocks to change a thief on the cross and to bring him into paradise.
