"And while they looked stedfastly," it is said, "toward heaven, as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven" - they used the expression "This" demonstratively, saying, "this Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall thus" - demonstratively, "in this way" - "come in like manner as ye have seen Him going into heaven." Again, the outward appearance is cheering - "in white apparel." They were Angels, in the form of men. And they say, "Ye men of Galilee:" they showed themselves to be trusted by the disciples, by saying, "Ye men of Galilee." For this was the meaning: else, what needed they to be told of their country, who knew it well enough? By their appearance also they attracted their regard, and showed that they were from heaven.

"Behold, two men stood by them." That they may vent no sorrowful exclamations, and that it might not be with them as it was with Elisha, who, when his master was taken up, rent his mantle (2 Kings ii. 12). And what say they? "This Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall thus come." And, "Behold, two men stood by them." With good reason: for "in the mouth of two witnesses shall every word be established" (Deut. xvii. 6): and these utter the same things. And it is said, that they were "in white apparel." In the same manner as they had already seen an Angel at the sepulchre, who had even told them their own thoughts; so here also an Angel is the preacher of His Ascension; although indeed the Prophets had frequently foretold it, as well as the Resurrection.
