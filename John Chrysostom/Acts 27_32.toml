Here the text shows that the sailors would have fled, as they did not believe [Paul’s] words; but the centurion believed together with the soldiers. Therefore Paul said, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” Not that their escape would have doomed the rest. He said this to stop them, so that the prophecy would not be broken. See how they, as if they were in a church, are taught the love of wisdom by Paul, who pulls them away from dangers. They did not believe Paul through providence, so that they might believe him after the experience of the facts, as happened.
