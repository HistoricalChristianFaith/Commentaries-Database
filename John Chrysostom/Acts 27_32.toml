The sailors however, were about to escape, having no faith in what was said: but the centurion does believe Paul, For he says, If these flee, ye cannot be saved: so saying, not on this account, but that he might restrain them, and the prophecy might not fall to the ground. See how as in a church they are instructed by the calmness of Paul's behavior, how he saved them out of the very midst of the dangers. And it is of providential ordering that Paul is disbelieved, that after proof of the facts, he might be believed: which accordingly was the case. And he exhorts them again to take some meat, and they do as he bids them, and he takes some first, to persuade them not by word, but also by act, that the storm did them no harm, but rather was a benefit to their souls. And while the day was coming on, Paul besought them all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that you have tarried and continued fasting having taken nothing.

Here the text shows that the sailors would have fled, as they did not believe [Paul’s] words; but the centurion believed together with the soldiers. Therefore Paul said, “Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved.” Not that their escape would have doomed the rest. He said this to stop them, so that the prophecy would not be broken. See how they, as if they were in a church, are taught the love of wisdom by Paul, who pulls them away from dangers. They did not believe Paul through providence, so that they might believe him after the experience of the facts, as happened.
