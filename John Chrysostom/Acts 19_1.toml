"And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper coasts" - meaning what we have read as to Caesarea and the other places - "came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples." But whence had those, being in Ephesus, the baptism of John? Probably they had been on a visit at Jerusalem at the time of John's preaching, and did not even know Jesus.
