Not only should the brethren receive no hurt from us, but neither should those who are outside the church. If we are light and leaven and luminaries and salt, we ought to enlighten, not to darken, to bind, not to loose, to draw unbelievers to us and not drive them away. The Gentiles are hurt when they see us doing such things, because they do not understand that we have been set free from them. Likewise, Jews and the weaker brethren will also suffer, for the same reason.
