See him given constantly to prayer: though freed from troubles and made secure, he does not cease from praying again in the words “have pity on me” and implores God for future benefits. You see, we always stand in need of God’s providence, but especially at a time of freedom from troubles. I mean, another battle follows that is more difficult than the former, that against indifference and obtuseness; then it is that the devil comes panting more aggressively. And so it is especially after being freed from troubles that we have need of that grace so as to cope with good times more easily.
