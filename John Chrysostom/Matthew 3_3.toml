Both the prophet and the Baptist state the same idea even though with different words. The prophet said that one would come: “prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” And when John came he himself said, “Bear fruit worthy of repentance,” a statement that corresponds to “prepare the way of the Lord.” Both by the words of the prophets and by John’s own preaching, this one thing is clear: he had arrived, making a way and preparing it beforehand. John was not bestowing the gift, which was the remission of sins, but preparing beforehand the souls of those who would receive the God of all.
