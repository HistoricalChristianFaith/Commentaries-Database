Paul suffered everything for Christ’s sake not in order to obtain the kingdom, nor for any honor, but because of his great love for the Master. But we are not drawn away from the things of this life either by Christ or by the things of Christ. Like snakes or like swine we keep dragging the things of this world along with us in the mire.… Yet God even gave up his Son for your sake!
