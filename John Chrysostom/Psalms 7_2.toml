For proof that the devil is called a lion in Scripture, listen to it saying, “Your enemy the devil prowls around like a lion roaring and looking for someone to devour.” And this inspired author himself says elsewhere, “You will tread on the lion and the serpent.” This beast is wily, you see; but if we are on the alert, this lion and serpent will be less than dirt in importance, neither will it mount an assault against us directly, but if it does mount an assault, it will be trodden on. “Walk on snakes and scorpions,” Scripture says, remember. He goes around in an awful rage, in fact, like a lion; but if he attacks those who have Christ, and his cross on their forehead, and the fire of the Spirit and the lamp that is never spent, he will not succeed even in looking them in the eye but will turn tail, not daring even to face about. And for you to learn that the words are not froth and bubble, consider, pray, the example of Paul. I mean, he too was human, but this lion had a such a healthy respect for him as to shun his garments and his shadow. Rightly so: he could not bear the fragrance of Christ emanating and ascending from him and had not the strength to raise his eyes to the lamp of his virtue.

To be sure, he had assembled an army and had a large number with him; so why does he say, “with no one to ransom or save me”? Because he considers not even the whole world as help should he not enjoy influence from on high, nor does he think of it as solitude if he is alone, as long as he shares in help from God.
