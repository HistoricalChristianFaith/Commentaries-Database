What harm, after all, could come to you from the mockery of human beings, even the whole world, when the Lord of the angels praises and extols you? Just as, consequently, should he not bless you, no matter if all the inhabitants of earth and sea sang your praises, it would do you no good. So make it the complete object of your attention that he extol you, that he bestow the crown. If this were the case, we should be the most exalted people of all, even if we were in poverty, if failing health, at death’s door.

This victory wreath is woven of mercy, as David says elsewhere, “Who crowns you with mercy and compassion.” It is also woven of righteousness, as Paul says, “Hereafter there is set aside for me the wreath of righteousness.” It is also a wreath of grace, as another author says, “She will defend you with a wreath of graces.” Yet it is also a wreath of honor, as Isaiah says, “there will be the wreath of hope, woven of honor.” The wreath, you see, has all these attributes—lovingkindness, righteousness, grace, honor, comeliness. The gift, after all, comes from God, offering a grace of many hues. It is also a wreath proof against corruption, as Paul says, “Whereas their purpose is to gain a corruptible wreath, ours is incorruptible.”
