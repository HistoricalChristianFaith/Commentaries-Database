Do you see how the glory of the Father and of the Son is all one glory? But if the glory is one, it is quite evident that the substance also is one. For if in one substance there be a difference of glory (“for there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory”; although the substance is one), how may the substance of those differ in which the glory is one? For he did not say, “In glory such as the Father’s,” whereby someone might suppose again some variation between the glory of the Father and the Son. Rather, he implies the entire perfection of the one God: “In that same glory, he will come,” for it to be deemed one and the same.“Why are you afraid, Peter,” so he speaks, “as you hear of death? Then you will see me in the glory of the Father. If I am in glory, so are you all. Your interests are no way limited to the present life. Another sort of condition will take you up, a better one.” Nevertheless, when he had spoken of the good things to come, he did not neglect to speak also of the fearful things to come. He spoke of the judgment seat, and the inexorable account, and the inflexible sentence and the judgment that cannot be deceived.
Thus Christ’s discourse was not intended only to make people feel dismal, but it was tempered with good hope.… He reminded not only the sinners of punishment but also them that have done well of rewards and crowns.

Having alarmed them therefore hereby, He comforts them also by His good things.

Do you see how the glory of the Father and of the Son is all one? But if the glory be one, it is quite evident that the substance also is one. For if in one substance there be a difference of glory (for there is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from another star in glory; 1 Corinthians 15:41 although the substance be one), how may the substance of those differ, whereof the glory is one? For He said not at all, In glory such as the Father's, whereby you might suppose again some variation; but implying entire perfection, In that same glory, says He, will He come; for it to be deemed one and the same.

Now, why fear, O Peter (so He speaks), on being told of death? Why, then shall you see me in the glory of the Father. And if I am in glory, so are you; your interests are no wise limited to the present life, but another sort of portion will take you up, a better one. Nevertheless, when He had spoken of the good things, He stayed not at this, but mingled the fearful things also, bringing forward that judgment-seat, and the inexorable account, and the inflexible sentence, and the judgment that cannot be deceived.

He suffered not however His discourse to appear only dismal, but tempered it also with good hopes. For neither did He say, then shall He punish them that sinned, but, He shall reward every man according to his doings. And this He said, reminding not only the sinners of punishment, but also them that have done well of prizes and crowns.

And He indeed spoke it, in part to refresh the good, but I ever shudder at hearing it, for I am not of them that are crowned, and I suppose that others also share with us in our fear and anxiety. For whom is this saying not enough to startle, when he has entered into his own conscience; and to make him shudder, and convince him that we have need of sackcloth, and of prolonged fasting, more than the people of the Ninevites? For not for an overthrow of a city, and the common end, are we concerned, but for eternal punishment, and the fire that is never quenched.

Wherefore also I praise and admire the monks that have occupied the desert places, as for the rest, so for this saying. For they after having made their dinners, or rather after supper (for dinner they know not at any time, because they know that the present time is one of mourning and fasting); after supper then, in saying certain hymns of thanksgiving unto God, they make mention of this expression also. And if you would hear the very hymns themselves, that you too may say them continually, I will rehearse to you the whole of that sacred song. The words of it then stand as follows: Blessed God, who feedest me from my youth up, who givest food to all flesh; fill our hearts with joy and gladness, that always having all sufficiency we may abound unto every good work in Christ Jesus our Lord; with whom be unto You glory, honor and might, with the Holy Spirit, forever. Amen. Glory to You, O Lord, glory to You, O Holy One, glory to You, O King, that You have given us meat to make us glad. Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be found well-pleasing before You, not being ashamed, when You render to every man according to his works.

Now this hymn is in all parts worthy of admiration, but especially the above ending of it. That is, because meals and food are wont to dissipate and weigh down, they put this saying as a kind of bridle upon the soul, at the time of indulgence reminding it of the time of judgment. For they have learned what befell Israel through a costly table. For my beloved, says He, ate, and waxed fat, and kicked. Wherefore also Moses said, When you shall have eaten and drunk and art full, remember the Lord your God. Deuteronomy 6:11-12

For after that feast, then they ventured on those acts of lawless daring.

Do thou therefore also look to it, lest something like it befall you. For though thou sacrifice not to stone nor to gold, either sheep or bullocks, see lest to wrath thou sacrifice your own soul, lest to whoredom or other like passions, thou sacrifice your own salvation. Yea— on this account, you see, they being afraid of these downfalls, when they have enjoyed their meal, or rather fasting (for their meal is in fact fasting), remind themselves of the terrible judgment-seat, and of that day. And if they who correct themselves both with fasting, and with nights spent on the ground, with watchings, and with sackcloth, and with ten thousand means, do yet require also this reminding, when will it be possible for us to live virtuously; who set forth tables loaded with innumerable wrecks, and do not so much as pray at all, neither in the beginning nor the end?

Wherefore to put an end to these shipwrecks, let us bring before us that hymn and unfold it all, that seeing the profit thereof, we too may chant it constantly over our table, and quell the rude motions of the belly, introducing both the manners and laws of those angels into our houses. For you ought indeed to go there and reap these fruits; but since you are not willing, at least through our words, hear this spiritual melody, and let every one after his meal say these words, beginning thus.

Blessed God. For the apostolic law they straightway fulfill, that commands, Whatsoever we do in word or in deed, that we do it in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, giving thanks to God and the Father by Him. Colossians 3:17

Next, the thanksgiving takes place not for that one day only, but for all their life. For, Who feedest me, it is said, from my youth up. And a lesson of self-command is drawn thence, that when God feeds, we must not take thought. For if upon a king's promising you to furnish your daily food out of his own stores, you would be of good hope for the future; much more, when God gives, and all things pour upon you as out of fountains, should you be freed from all anxiety. Yea, and to this very intent they so speak, that they may persuade both themselves, and those that are made disciples by them, to put off all worldly care.

Then, not to have you suppose that for themselves only they offer up this thanksgiving, they further say, Who givest food to all flesh, giving thanks in behalf of all the world; and as fathers of the whole earth, so do they offer up their praises for all, and train themselves to a sincere brotherly love. For it is not even possible they should hate them, in behalf of whom they thank God, that they are fed.

Do you see both charity introduced by their thanksgiving, and worldly care cast out, both by the preceding words, and by these? For if He feed all flesh, much more them that are devoted to him; if them that are entangled in worldly cares, much more them that are freed from the same.

To establish this, Christ Himself said, How many sparrows do ye exceed in value? And He said it, teaching them not to put their confidence in wealth and land and seeds; for it is not these that feed us, but the word of God.

Hereby they stop the mouths, both of the Manichæans, and of them of Valentinus, and of all that are diseased in their way. For sure this Being is not evil, who sets his own stores before all, even before them that blaspheme Him.

Then comes the petition: Fill our hearts with joy and gladness. With what manner of joy then, does it mean? The joy of this world? God forbid: for had they meant this, they would not have occupied summits of mountains, and deserts, nor wrapt themselves in sackcloth; but that joy they mean, which has nothing in common with this present life, the joy of angels, the joy above.

And they do not simply ask for it, but in great excess; for they say not, give, but, fill, and they say not us, but our hearts. For this is especially a heart's joy; For the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace. Galatians 5:22

Thus, because sin brought in sorrow, they request that through joy righteousness may be implanted in them, for no otherwise might joy be engendered.

That, always having all sufficiency, we may abound unto every good work. 2 Corinthians 9:8 See how they fulfill that word of the gospel which says, Give us this day our daily bread, and how they seek even this for spiritual ends. For their phrase is, That we may abound unto every good work. They said not, That we may do our duty only, but even more than what is enjoined, for, that we may abound, means this. And while of God they seek sufficiency in things needful, themselves are willing to obey not in sufficiency only, but with much abundance, and in all things. This is the part of well-disposed servants, this of men strict in goodness, to abound always, and in all things.

Then again reminding themselves of their own weakness, and that without the influence from above nothing noble can be done; having said, that we may abound unto every good work, they add, in Christ Jesus our Lord, with whom unto You be glory, honor, and might forever. Amen; framing this end like their commencement by a thread of thanksgiving.

After this again, they seem to begin afresh, but they are keeping to the same argument. As Paul also in the beginning of an epistle, having closed with a doxology, where he says, According to the will of our God and Father, to whom be glory forever. Amen; Galatians 1:4-5 begins the subject again on which he was writing. And again in another place when he had said, They worshipped and served the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed forever: Amen; Romans 1:25 he completed not his discourse, but begins again.

Therefore neither let us blame these our angels, as acting disorderly, for that having closed with a doxology they begin again the sacred hymns. For they follow laws, beginning from a doxology, and ending therein, and after that end making a commencement again.

Wherefore they say, Glory be to You, O Lord; glory be to You, O Holy One; glory be to You, O King; that You have given us food to make us glad.

Since not for the greater things only, but also for the lesser, we ought to give thanks. And they do give thanks for these also, putting to shame the heresy of the Manichæans, and of as many as affirm our present life to be evil. For lest for their high self-command, and contempt of the belly, you should suspect them as abhorring the meat, like the heretics aforesaid, who choke themselves to death; they by their prayer teach you, that not from abhorrence of God's creatures they abstain from most of them, but as exercising self-restraint.

And see how after thanksgiving for His past gifts, they are importunate also for the greater things, and dwell not upon the mat ters of this life, but mount above the heavens, and say, Fill us with the Holy Ghost. For it is not even possible to approve one's self as one ought, not being filled with that grace; as there is no doing anything noble or great, without the benefit of Christ's influences.

As therefore when they had said, That we may abound unto every good work, they added, In Christ Jesus; so here also they say, Fill us with the Holy Ghost, that we may be found to have been well-pleasing before You.

Do you see how for the things of this life they pray not, but give thanks only; but for the things of the Spirit, they both give thanks and pray. For, seek ye, says He, the kingdom of heaven, and all these things shall be added unto you.

And mark too another kind of severe goodness in them; their saying, namely, That we may be found to have been well-pleasing in Your sight, not being ashamed. For we care not, say they, for the shame that proceeds from the many, but whatever men may say of us, laughing, upbraiding, we do not so much as regard it; but our whole endeavor is not to be put to shame then. But in these expressions, they bring in also the river of fire, and the prizes, and the rewards.

They said not, that we be not punished, but, that we be not ashamed. For this is to us far more fearful than hell, to seem to have offended our Lord.

But since the more part and the grosser sort are not in fear of this, they add, When You render to every man according to his works. Do you see how greatly these strangers and pilgrims have benefitted us, these citizens of the wilderness, or rather citizens of the Heavens? For whereas we are strangers to the Heavens, but citizens of the earth, these are just the contrary.

And after this hymn, being filled with much compunction, and with many and fervent tears, so they proceed to sleep, snatching just so much of it as a little to refresh themselves. And again, the nights they make days, spending them in thanksgivings and in the singing of psalms.

But not men only, but women also practise this self-denial, overcoming the weakness of their nature by the abundance of their zeal.

Let us be abashed then at their earnestness, we who are men, let us cease to be fastened to the things present, to shadow, to dreams, to smoke. For the more part of our life is passed in insensibility.

For both the first period of our life is full of much folly, and that again which travels on to old age, makes all the feeling that is in us wither away, and small is the space between, that is able feelingly to enjoy pleasure; or rather, not even that has a pure participation thereof, by reason of innumerable cares and toils, that harrass it.

Wherefore, I pray, let us seek the unmovable and eternal goods, and the life that never has old age.

For even one dwelling in a city may imitate the self-denial of the monks; yea, one who has a wife, and is busied in a household, may pray, and fast, and learn compunction. Since they also, who at the first were instructed by the apostles, though they dwelt in cities, yet showed forth the piety of the occupiers of the deserts: and others again who had to rule over workshops, as Priscilla and Aquila.

And the prophets too, all had both wives and households, as Isaiah, as Ezekiel, as the great Moses, and received no hurt therefrom in regard of virtue.

These then let us also imitate, and continually offer thanksgiving to God, continually sing hymns to Him; let us give heed to temperance, and to all other virtues, and the self-denial that is practised in the deserts, let us bring into our cities; that we may appear both well-pleasing before God, and approved before men, and attain unto the good things to come, by the grace and love towards man of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom and with whom be unto the Father, glory, honor, and might, together with the holy and life-giving Spirit, now and always and world without end. Amen.
