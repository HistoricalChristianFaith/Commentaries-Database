He signifies that his death is a transition, for the light of the sun is not destroyed, but having withdrawn for a while appears again. Then he says, “While you have the light,” but he does not say of what time he is talking about here. Is he speaking of the whole present life or of the time before the cross? I think both, for because of his ineffable love of humankind many even after the cross believed. He speaks these things to press them on to the faith.
