Note with admiration the self-restraint of the disciples. Observe how carefully they relate these things. This clearly shows their disposition to love the truth. They relate with all truthfulness the things that seem to be opprobrious. They disguise nothing. They are not ashamed of anything. Rather, they account it as a very great glory, as indeed it was, that the Lord of the universe should endure to suffer such things for us. This shows both his unutterable tenderness and the inexcusable wickedness of those men who had the heart to do such things to him that was so mild and meek. His words were such as to change a lion into a lamb.… All of these things the prophet Isaiah had foretold. He had proclaimed it beforehand: “Like as many were astonished at you, so shall your form be held inglorious of men, and your glory of the sons of men.”
