But it is not these that foretell to Paul, though they were prophetesses; it is Agabus. And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus. And when he had come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus says the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owns this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
