“I saw the Lord seated.” To be seated on a throne is always a symbol of judgment, as David says: “You are seated on a throne, you who administer justice.” And Daniel, “Three thrones were set up, and the tribunal sat down.” By contrast, the prophet says that simply being seated is a symbol of something else. Of what? Stability, durability, proceeding onward, immutability, eternity, infinite life. Thus it is said, “You who are seated forever, and we who perish forever.” You, it is said, who endure: who are, who live and are always thus. The comparison makes it clear that he was not speaking of a seat but “you who are seated forever, and we who perish.” To sit on a throne is to judge. - "Commentary on Isaiah 6.2"
