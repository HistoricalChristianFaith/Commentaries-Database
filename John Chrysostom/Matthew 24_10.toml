This is the greater evil, when the war is intestine too, for there were many false brethren. Do you see the war to be threefold? From the deceivers, from the enemies, from the false brethren. See Paul too lamenting over the same things, and saying, Without were fightings, within were fears; 2 Corinthians 7:5 and, perils among false brethren, 2 Corinthians 11:26 and again, For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:13
