(in Joan. Hom. xiv. [xiii.] 1) Or thus; the Evangelist after showing the great superiority of Christ's gifts, compared with those dispensed by Moses, wishes in the next place to supply an adequate reason for the difference. The one being a servant was made a minister of a lesser dispensation: but the other Who was Lord, and Son of the King, brought us far higher things, being ever coexistent with the Father, and beholding Him. Then follows, No man hath seen God at any time, &c.

(Hom. xv. [xiv.]) If the old fathers had seen That very Nature, they would not have contemplated It so variously, for It is in Itself simple and without shape; It sits not, It walks not; these are the qualities of bodies. Whence he saith through the Prophet, I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the Prophets: (Hosea 12:10) i. e. I have condescended to them, I appeared that which I was not. For inasmuch as the Son of God was about to manifest Himself to us in actual flesh, men were at first raised to the sight of God, in such ways as allowed of their seeing Him.

(Hom. xv. [xiv.] 1) That very existence which is God, neither Prophets, nor even Angels, nor yet Archangels, have seen. For enquire of the Angels; they say nothing concerning His Substance; but sing, Glory to God in the highest, and Peace on earth to men of good will. (Luke 2:1) Nay, ask even Cherubim and Seraphim; thou wilt hear only in reply the mystic melody of devotion, and that heaven and earth are full of His glory. (Is. 6:3)

(Hom. xv. [xiv.] 1.) In this complete sense only the Son and the Holy Ghost see the Father. For how can created nature see that which is uncreated? So then no man knoweth the Father as the Son knoweth Him: and hence what follows, The Only-Begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared Him. That we might not be led by the identity of the name, to confound Him with the sons made so by grace, the article is annexed in the first place; and then, to put an end to all doubt, the name Only-Begotten is introduced.

(Hom. xv. [xiv.] 2.) He adds, Which is in the bosom of the Father. To dwell in the bosom is much more than simply to see. For he who sees simply, hath not the knowledge thoroughly of that which he sees; but he who dwells in the bosom, knoweth every thing. When you hear then that no one knoweth the Father save the Son, do not by any means suppose that he only knows the Father more than any other, and does not know Him fully. For the Evangelist sets forth His residing in the bosom of the Father on this very account: viz. to show us the intimate converse of the Only-Begotten, and His coeternity with the Father.

(Hom. xv. [xiv.] 3) But what hath He declared? That God is one. But this the rest of the Prophets and Moses proclaim: what else have we learnt from the Son Who was in the bosom of the Father? In the first place, that those very truths, which the others declared, were declared through the operation of the Only Begotten: in the next place, we have received a far greater doctrine from the Only Begotten; viz. that God is a Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth; and that God is the Father of the Only Begotten.

(Hom. xvi. [xv.] 1.) The text then, No man hath seen God at any time, applies not to the Father only, but also to the Son: for He, as Paul saith, is the Image of the invisible God; but He who is the Image of the Invisible, must Himself also be invisible.

Observe, therefore, with what fullness the Evangelist speaks. Having said that “no man has seen God at any time,” he does not go on to say “that the Son who has seen has declared him,” but adds something beyond “seeing” by the words “who is in the bosom of the Father.” “To dwell in the bosom” is far more than “to see.” For he who merely “sees” does not have an exact knowledge of the object in every way. He who “dwells in the bosom,” however, can be ignorant of nothing.… The Evangelist mentions “the bosom” in order to show to us by that one word that the affinity and nearness of the essence is great, that the knowledge is in no way different and that the power is equal. The Father would not have in his bosom one of another essence, nor would he have dared, had he been one among many servants, to live in the bosom of his Lord. For this belongs only to a true Son, to one who has much confidence toward his Father and who is in nothing inferior to him.

What has he declared? That “no one has seen God at any time”? That “God is one”? But this all the other prophets testify, and Moses continually exclaims, “The Lord your God is one Lord”; and Isaiah, “Before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.” What more then have we learned from “the Son who is in the bosom of the Father”? What more from “the Only Begotten”? In the first place, these very words were uttered by his working. In the next place, we have received a teaching that is far clearer, and we learned that “God is a spirit, and they who worship him must worship him in spirit and in truth.” And again, that it is impossible to see God; “that no one knows” him “except the Son”; that he is the Father of the true and Only Begotten; and all other things that are told us of him. But the word “has declared” shows the plainer and clearer teaching that he gave and established not to the Jews only but to all the world. Not even all the Jews listened to the prophets, but to the only begotten Son of God all the world yielded and obeyed. So the “declaration” in this place shows the greater clearness of his teaching, and therefore he is called “Word” and “Angel of great Counsel.”
