Everywhere we find these two Apostles in great harmony together. "To him Simon Peter beckoned." These two also "came together to the sepulchre." And concerning John, Peter said unto Christ, "And what shall this man do?" Now as for the other miracles, the writer of this book omits them; but he mentions the miracle by which they were all put in commotion. Observe again that they do not come to them purposely; so clear were they of ambition, so closely did they imitate their Master. Why now did they go up to the temple? Did they still live as Jews? No, but for expediency.

You observe how they continued in prayer. "The ninth hour:" there they prayed together.
