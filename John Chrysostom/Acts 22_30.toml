"On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty whereof he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him from his bands, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them." This he should have done at the outset. He brought him in, loosed. This above all the Jews would not know what to make of. He discourses not now to the multitude, nor to the people.
