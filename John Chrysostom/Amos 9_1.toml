Tell me, John, what do you mean when you say, “No one has ever seen God”? What shall we think about he prophets who say that they saw God? Isaiah said, “I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne.” And, again, Daniel said, “I saw until the thrones were set, and the ancient of days sat.” And Micah said, “I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne.” And again, another prophet said, “I saw the Lord standing on the altar, and he said unto me, ‘Strike the mercy seat.’ ” And I can gather many similar passages to show you as witnesses of what I say.How is it, then, that John says, “No one has ever seen God”? He says this so that you may know that he is speaking of a clear knowledge and a perfect comprehension of God. All the cases cited were instances of God’s condescension and accommodation. That no one of those prophets saw God’s essence in its pure state is clear from the fact that each one saw him in a different way. God is a simple being; he is not composed of parts; he is without form or figure. But all these prophets saw different forms and figures. God proved this very thing through the mouth of another prophet. And he persuaded those other prophets that they did not see his essence in its exact nature when he said, “I have multiplied visions, and by the ministries of the prophets I was presented.” What God was saying was, “I did not show my very essence, but I came down in condescension and accommodated myself to the weakness of their eyes.”
