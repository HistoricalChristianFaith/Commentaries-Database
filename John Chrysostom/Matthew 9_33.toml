The affliction of the dumb demoniac was not natural. It was the work of the evil spirit. So it was that the demoniac was “brought to him.” For he had no tongue to speak for himself, no way to ask on his own behalf, being speechless. He could not petition another, since the evil spirit had bound his tongue. And as his tongue was fettered, so was his soul.This is why Jesus did not require a confession of faith from him. He straightway healed the disease. “And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, ‘Never was anything like this seen in Israel.’ ”
