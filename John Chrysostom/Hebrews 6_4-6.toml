What then is the medicine of repentance, and of what does it consist? First, of the condemnation of our own sins.… Second, of great humbleness of mind, for it is like a golden chain; if one grasps firmly the beginning, all will follow. Because if you confess your sin as one ought to confess, the soul is humbled, for conscience, turning it on itself, causes it to be subdued.Other things too must be added to humbleness of mind if it is to be such as the blessed David knew when he said, “A broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise.” For that which is broken does not rise up, does not strike, but is ready to be ill-treated and does not strike back. Such is contrition of heart. Though it is insulted, though it be evilly treated, it is quiet and is not eager for vengeance.
And after humbleness of mind, there is need of intense prayers, of many tears, tears by day and tears by night, for, he says, “I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears; I drench my couch with my weeping.” And again, “For I eat ashes like bread and mingle tears with my drink.” And after prayer this intense, there is need of much almsgiving, for thus it is which especially gives strength to the medicine of repentance.… For hear what the divine Scripture says, “Give alms, and all things shall be clean.” And again, “By almsgiving and acts of faithfulness sins are purged away.” And “Water extinguishes a blazing fire; so almsgiving atones for sin.”
Next, do not be angry with any one, not bearing malice, forgiving all their trespasses. For it is said, “Does a man harbor anger against another and yet seek healing from the Lord?” “Forgive that you may be forgiven.”18
Also, converting our brethren from their wandering. For it is said, “Go, and convert your brethren, that your sins may be forgiven.” Remain in close relation with the elders, so if one has “committed sins, he will be forgiven.” Stand forward in defense of those who are wronged. Do not retain anger. Bear all things meekly.

But let us all humble our own souls by almsgiving and forgiving our neighbors their trespasses, by not remembering injuries or avenging ourselves. If we continually reflect on our sins, no external circumstances can make us elated, neither riches, nor power, nor authority, nor honor. Even if we should sit in the imperial chariot itself, we shall sigh bitterly. For even the blessed David was a king, and yet he said, “Every night I flood my bed” … and he was not at all hurt by the purple robe and the diadem. He was not puffed up, for he knew himself to be a man, and inasmuch as his heart had been made contrite, he continued mourning.

“They crucify,” he says, “the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt.” What he means is this. Baptism is a cross, and “our old self was crucified with him,” for we were “united with him in a death like his” and again, “we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death.” Therefore, it is not possible that Christ should be crucified a second time, for that is to “hold him up to contempt.” For if “death no longer has dominion over him,” if he rose again, by his resurrection becoming superior to death, if by death he wrestled with and overcame death, and then is crucified again, all those things become a fable and a mockery. He then that baptizes a second time crucifies him again.…For as Christ died on the cross, so do we in baptism, not as to the flesh but as to sin. Behold two deaths. He died as to the flesh. In our case, the old self was buried and the new self arose, made conformable to the likeness of his death. If, therefore, it is necessary to be baptized again, it is necessary that this same Christ should die again. For baptism is nothing else than the putting to death of the baptized and his rising again. And he well said, “crucify on their own account,” for he that does this, having forgotten the former grace and ordering his own life carelessly, acts in all respects as if there were another baptism. It behooves us therefore to take heed and to make ourselves safe.
