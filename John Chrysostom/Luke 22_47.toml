For just as incurable wounds yield neither to severe nor soothing remedies, so the soul when once it is taken captive, and has sold itself to any particular sin, will reap no benefit from admonition. And so it was with Judas, who desisted not from His betrayal, though deterred by Christ by every manner of warning. Hence it follows, And drew near to Jesus to kiss him.
Now we must not depart from admonishing our brethren, albeit nothing comes ofour words. For even the streams though no one drink therefrom still flow on, and him whom you have not persuaded today, peradventure you may tomorrow. For the fisherman after drawing empty nets the whole day, when it was now late takes a fish. And thus our Lord, though He knew that Judas was not to be converted, yet ceased not to do such things as had reference to him. It follows, But Jesus said to him, Judas, betray you the Son of man with akiss? .
And He gives him his proper name, which was rather like one lamenting and recalling him, than one provoked to anger.
But He said not, &#8220;Betray you your Master, your Lord, your Benefactor,&#8221; but the Son of man, that is, the humble and meek, who though He were not your Master and Lord, forasmuch as He has borne himself so gently toward you, should have never been betrayed by you.
For they had come at night fearing an outbreak of the multitude, therefore He says, &#8220;What need was there of these arms against one who was always with you? As it follows, When I was daily with you.
