“For he, the Almighty, observes all those who commit impieties. But plead before him, if you can praise him conveniently.” If he had established a court and had published its decisions, you would have not praised him, you would have not glorified him, as he deserves, with regard to what happened to you, because you think you have been unjustly punished. Not to be able to praise God as he deserves, that is not too serious; but not to be able to praise him as he deserves when we plead before him, that is really serious.
