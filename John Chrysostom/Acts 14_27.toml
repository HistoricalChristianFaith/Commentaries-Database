They did not say what they themselves had done but “what God had done with them.” It seems to me that they mean through their trials. It was not for nothing that they went there, nor to rest. They were providentially guided by the Spirit, so that the preaching to the Gentiles might be firmly established.… And note Paul’s ardor. He does not ask if there is need to speak to Gentiles; he speaks at once. This is why he says, “I did not refer myself to flesh and blood.”
