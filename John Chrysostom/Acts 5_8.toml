But observe how Peter, instead of sending for her, waited till she entered; and how none of the others dared carry out the intelligence. Such the teacher's awfulness, such the disciples' reverence, such the obedience! An interval of three hours,â€” and yet the woman did not hear of it, and none of those present reported it, although there was time enough for it to be noised abroad; but they were afraid. This circumstance the Evangelist relates with wonder even, when he says, Not knowing what was done, came in.
