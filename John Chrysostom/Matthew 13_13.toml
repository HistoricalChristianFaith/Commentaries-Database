It were meet then, one may say, to have opened their eyes, if they see not. Nay, if the blindness were natural, it were meet to open them; but because it was a voluntary and self-chosen blindness, therefore He said not simply, They see not, but, seeing, they see not; so that the blindness is of their own wickedness. For they saw even devils cast out, and said, By Beelzebub, prince of the devils, He casts out the devils. Matthew 12:14 They heard Him guiding them unto God, and evincing His great unanimity with Him, and they say, This man is not of God. John 9:16 Since then the judgment they pronounced was contrary both to their sight and hearing, therefore, says He, the very hearing do I take away from them. For they derive thence no advantage, but rather greater condemnation. For they not only disbelieved, but found fault also, and accused, and laid snares. However, He says not this, for it is not His will to give disgust in accusing them. Therefore neither at the beginning did He so discourse to them, but with much plainness; but because they perverted themselves, thenceforth He speaks in parables.
