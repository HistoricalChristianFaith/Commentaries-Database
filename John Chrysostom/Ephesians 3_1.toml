He has mentioned Christ's great and affectionate care; he now passes on to his own, insignificant indeed as it is, and a very nothing in comparison with that, and yet this is enough to engage them to himself. For this cause, says he, am I also bound.  For if my Lord was crucified for your sakes, much more am I bound. He not only was bound Himself, but allows His servants to be bound also —"for you Gentiles." It is full of emphasis; not only do we no longer loathe you, but we are even bound, says he, for your sakes and of this exceeding grace am I partaker.

This is a very emphatic statement: Not only do we not hate you. We are even imprisoned on your account!
