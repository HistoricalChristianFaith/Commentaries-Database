He has mentioned Christ's great and affectionate care; he now passes on to his own, insignificant indeed as it is, and a very nothing in comparison with that, and yet this is enough to engage them to himself. For this cause, saith he, am I also bound. For if my Lord was crucified for your sakes, much more am I bound. He not only was bound Himself, but allows His servants to be bound also,-"for you Gentiles." It is full of emphasis; not only do we no longer loathe you, but we are even bound, saith he, for your sakes and of this exceeding grace am I partaker.

For what could be better than those bonds which always in his Epistles he prefers to all things else, saying, "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ:" and again, "On this account I am bound with this chain, but the word of God is not bound;" and, "Even unto bonds, as an evil-doer." The punishment was twofold. For if indeed he had been so bound, as with a view to his good, the thing would have carried with it some consolation: but now he is bound both "as an evil-doer," and as with a view to very ill consequences; yet for none of these things cared he.
