Already these have borne witness as martyrs. Arrayed in battle against all, they said, “we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard.” If what we say is false, arrest us; but if it is true, why do you stand in the way? Such is philosophy! Those in perplexity, these in gladness; those full of great shame, these with boldness in all actions; those in fear, these in confidence. For who, I ask you, were the frightened? Was it those who said, “in order that it may spread no further among the people,” or these who said, “we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard?” These had a delight, a freedom of speech, a joy surpassing all; those a despondency, a shame, a fear, for they feared the people. While these spoke what they wished to say, those did not do what they wished to do. Which were in chains and dangers? Certainly not these.

For better than all others he knows the nature of things. He knows that fierceness is not quenched by fierceness but by meekness. If you wish to see this in action, read the book of the Acts of the apostles and you will see how often, when the people of the Jews was rebelling and sharpening their teeth, these men, imitating the dove and answering with suitable meekness, released their wrath, quenched their madness and dissolved their impetuosity. For when they said, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in this name,” the disciples, although they were able to work countless miracles, neither said nor did anything harsh but answered with all gentleness, saying, “Whether it is right to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge.”
