Since then their minds are elevated, He also speaks to them in a higher strain. For He no longer tells them, "Of that day not even the Son of Man knoweth" (Mark xiii. 32); but He says, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father hath put in His own power. Ye ask things greater than your capacity, He would say. And yet even now they learned things that were much greater than this. And that you may see that this is strictly the case, look how many things I shall enumerate. What, I pray you, was greater than their having learned what they did learn? Thus, they learned that there is a Son of God, and that God has a Son equal with Himself in dignity; they learned that there will be a resurrection; that when He ascended He sat on the right hand of God; and what is still more stupendous, that Flesh is seated in heaven, and adored by Angels, and that He will come again; they learned what is to take place in the judgment; learned that they shall then sit and judge the twelve tribes of Israel; learned that the Jews would be cast out, and in their stead the Gentiles should come in. For, tell me, which is greater? to learn that a person will reign, or to learn the time when? If the greater be with power, much more the other.

"Which the Father hath put in His own power." And yet He declared the Father's power and His to be one: as in the saying, "For as the Father raiseth up the dead and quickeneth them, even so the Son quickeneth whom He will." (John v. 21.) If where need is to work, Thou actest with the same power as the Father; where it behooves to know, dost Thou not know with the same power? Yet certainly to raise up the dead is much greater than to learn the day. If the greater be with power, much more the other.
