We may suppose that He proceeded slowly, and spake longer to the woman whom Hehad healed, that He might suffer the maid to die, and thus an evident miracle of restoring to life might be wrought. In the case of Lazarus also He waited till the third day. "And when he saw the minstrels and the people making a noise;” this was a proof of her death.
But Christ put forth all the pipers, but took in the parents, that it might notbe said that He had healed her by any other means; and before the restoring to life He excites their expectations by His words, “And he said, Give place: forthe maid is not dead, but sleepeth.”.
He restored her to life not by bringing in another soul, but by recalling that which had departed, and as it were raising it from sleep, and through this sight preparing the way for belief of the resurrection. And He not only restores her to life, but commands food to be given her, as the other Evangelists relate, that which was done might be seen to be no delusion. “And the fame of him went abroad into all that country.”
