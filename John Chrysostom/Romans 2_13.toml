Well does he add "before God;" for haply before men they may be able to appear dignified and to vaunt great things, but before God it is quite otherwise â€” the doers of the Law alone are justified. You see with what advantage he combats, by turning what they said to an opposite bearing. For if it is by the Law you claim to be saved, in this respect, says he, the Gentile will stand before you, when seen to be a doer of what is written in the Law. And how is it possible (one may say) for one who has not heard to be a doer? Not this only, he says, is possible, but what is much more even than this. For not only is it possible without hearing to be a doer, but even with hearing not to be so. Which last thing he makes plainer, and that with a greater advantage over them, when he says, "You that teaches another, do you not teach yourself?" [Romans 2:21] But here he is still making the former point good.
