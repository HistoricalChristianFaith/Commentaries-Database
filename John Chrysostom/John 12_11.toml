No other miracle of Christ exasperated the Jewish leaders as much as this one.… It was so public, and so wonderful, to see a man walking and talking after he had been dead four days. And the fact was so undeniable.… In the case of some other miracles, they had charged him with breaking the sabbath and so diverted people’s minds; but here there was nothing to find fault with, and therefore they vent their anger upon Lazarus.… They would have done the same to the blind man, had they not had the charge to make of breaking the sabbath. Then again the latter was a poor man, and they cast him out of the temple, but Lazarus was a man of rank, as is plain from the number who came to comfort his sisters.… It exasperated them to see all leaving the feast, which was now beginning, and going to Bethany.
