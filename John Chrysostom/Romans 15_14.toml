"And I myself also am persuaded of you, my brethren, that you also are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish one another." (So most: S. Chrys. "others.")

He had said, "Inasmuch as I am the Apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office." [Romans 11:13] He had said, "Take heed lest He also spare not you." [Romans 11:21] He had said, "Be not wise in your own conceits" [Romans 12:16]; and again, "Why do you judge your brother?" [Romans 14:10] And, "Who are you that judgest another man's servant?" [Romans 14:4] And several other like things besides. Since then he had often made his language somewhat harsh, he now speaks kindly (θεραπεύει ) . And what he said in the beginning, that he does in the end also. At the beginning he said, "I thank my God for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world." [Romans 1:8] But here he says, "I am persuaded that you also are full of goodness, being able also to admonish others;" and this is more than the former. And he does not say, I have heard, but, "I am persuaded," and have no need to hear, from others. And, "I myself," that is, I that rebuke, that accuse you. That "you are full of goodness," this applies to the exhortation lately given. As if he said, It was not as if you were cruel, or haters of your brethren, that I gave you that exhortation, to receive, and not to neglect, and not to destroy "the work of God." For I am aware that "you are full of goodness." But he seems to me here to be calling their virtue perfect. And he does not say you have, but "you are full of." And the sequel is with the same intensitives: "filled with all knowledge." For suppose they had been affectionate, but yet did not know how to treat those they loved properly. This was why he added, "all knowledge. Able to admonish others," not to learn only, but also to teach.

This applies to the exhortation just given [in the preceding verses]. It is as if Paul was saying: “It was not that you were cruel or haters of your brethren that I gave you that exhortation to receive and not to neglect or destroy the work of God. For I am aware that you are full of goodness.”
