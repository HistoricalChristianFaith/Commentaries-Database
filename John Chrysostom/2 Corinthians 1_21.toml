If the root and the fount are properly established, how can it be that we shall not enjoy the fruits which will spring from them? One thing leads inevitably to the other.

title="HOMILIES ON THE EPISTLES OF PAUL TO THE CORINTHIANS 3.4"

[[commentary]]

After these words, after the renunciation of the devil and the covenant with Christ, inasmuch as you have henceforth become his very own and have nothing in common with that evil one, he straightway bids you to be marked and places on your forehead the sign of the cross. That savage beast is shameless, and when he hears those words, he grows more wild—as we might expect—and desires to assault you on sight. Hence God anoints your countenance and stamps thereon the sign of the cross. In this way God holds in check all the frenzy of the Evil One, for the devil will not dare to look on such a sight. Just as if he had beheld the rays of the sun and had leaped away, so will his eyes be blinded by the sight of your face and he will depart. For through the chrism the cross is stamped on you.… And that you may again know that it is not a man but God himself who anoints you by the hand of the priest, listen to St. Paul when he says: “It is God who makes both us and you stand firm in Christ, who has anointed us.”
