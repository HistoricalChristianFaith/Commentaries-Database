Speaking of the ancient times, [John] had said that “the world knew him not.” Afterwards, he comes down in his narrative to the times of the proclamation [of the gospel] and says, “He came to his own, and his own did not receive him,” now calling the Jews “his own,” as his particular people, or perhaps even all humankind, as created by him. And as above, when perplexed at the folly of the many and ashamed of our common [fallen human] nature, [John] said that “the world was made by him,” and having been made, did not recognize its Maker. So here again, being troubled beyond what he could bear … he makes his accusation in an even more striking manner, saying, “His own did not receive him,” even when “he came to them.”
