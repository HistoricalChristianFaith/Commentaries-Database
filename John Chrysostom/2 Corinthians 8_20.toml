What can this be which is said? A thing worthy of the virtue of Paul; and showing the greatness of his tender care and his condescension. 'For,' he says, 'that none should suspect us, nor have the slightest cavil against us, as though we purloined anything of the money placed in our hands; therefore we send such persons, and not one only, but even two or three.' Do you see how he clears them of all suspicions? Not on account of the Gospel, nor of their having been chosen merely; but also, from their being persons of proved character, (and for this very reason) having been chosen, that they might not be suspected. And he said not 'that you should not blame,' but 'that no other person should.' And yet it was on their account that he did this; and he implied as much in saying, to the glory of the same Lord, and your readiness: however, he does not wish to wound them; and so expresses himself differently,

Avoiding this. And he is not satisfied with this either, but by what he adds, soothes again, saying,

In the matter of this bounty which is ministered by us, and mingling his severity with praise. For that they might not feel hurt, and say, 'Is he obliged then to eye us stealthily, and are we so miserable as ever to have been suspected of these things?' Providing a correction against this too, he says, 'the money sent by you is of large amount, and this abundance, that is, the large amount of the money, is enough to afford suspicion to the evil-minded had we not offered that security.
