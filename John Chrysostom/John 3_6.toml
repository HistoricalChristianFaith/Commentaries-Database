Do you see the dignity of the Spirit? It appears performing the work of God. For above he said that some “were begotten of God.” Here he says that the Spirit begets them. “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” He means, “The one that is born of the Spirit is spiritual.” For the birth of which he speaks here is not that according to essence but according to honor and grace.
