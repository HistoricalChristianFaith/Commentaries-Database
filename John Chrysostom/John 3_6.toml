1. Great mysteries are they, of which the Only-begotten Son of God has counted us worthy; great, and such as we were not worthy of, but such as it was meet for Him to give. For if one reckon our desert, we were not only unworthy of the gift, but also liable to punishment and vengeance; but He, because He looked not to this, not only delivered us from punishment, but freely gave us a life much more bright  than the first, introduced us into another world, made us another creature; If any man be in Christ, says Paul, he is a new creature. 2 Corinthians 5:17 What kind of new creature? Hear Christ Himself declare; Unless a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the Kingdom of God. Paradise was entrusted to us, and we were shown unworthy to dwell even there, yet He has exalted us to heaven. In the first things we were found unfaithful, and He has committed to us greater; we could not refrain from a single tree, and He has provided for us the delights  above; we kept not our place in Paradise, and He has opened to us the doors of heaven. Well said Paul, O the depth of the riches, both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! Romans 11:33 There is no longer a mother, or pangs, or sleep, or coming together, and embracings of bodies; henceforth all the fabric  of our nature is framed above, of the Holy Ghost and water. The water is employed, being made the Birth to him who is born; what the womb is to the embryo, the water is to the believer; for in the water he is fashioned and formed. At first it was said, Let the waters bring forth the creeping things that have life Genesis 1:20, Septuagint; but from the time that the Lord entered the streams of Jordan, the water no longer gives forth the creeping thing that has life, but reasonable and Spirit-bearing souls; and what has been said of the sun, that he is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber Psalm 18:6, we may now rather say of the faithful, for they send forth rays far brighter than he. That which is fashioned in the womb requires time, not so that in water, but all is done in a single moment. Here our life is perishable, and takes its origin from the decay of other bodies; that which is to be born comes slowly, (for such is the nature of bodies, they acquire perfection by time,) but it is not so with spiritual things. And why? Because the things made are formed perfect from the beginning.

When Nicodemus still hearing these things was troubled, see how Christ partly opens to him the secret of this mystery, and makes that clear which was for a while obscure to him. That which is born, says He, of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. He leads him away from all the things of sense, and suffers him not vainly to pry into the mysteries revealed with his fleshly eyes; We speak not, says He, of flesh, but of Spirit, O Nicodemus, (by this word He directs him heavenward for a while,) seek then nothing relating to things of sense; never can the Spirit appear to those eyes, think not that the Spirit brings forth the flesh. How then, perhaps one may ask, was the Flesh of the Lord brought forth? Not of the Spirit only, but of flesh; as Paul de  clares, when he says, Made of a woman, made under the Law Galatians 4:4; for the Spirit fashioned Him not indeed out of nothing, (for what need was there then of a womb?) but from the flesh of a Virgin. How, I cannot explain unto you; yet it was done, that no one might suppose that what was born is alien to our nature. For if even when this has taken place there are some who disbelieve in such a birth, into what impiety would they not have fallen had He not partaken of the Virgin's flesh.

That which is born  of the Spirit is spirit. Do you see the dignity of the Spirit? It appears performing the work of God; for above he said of some, that, they were begotten of God, John 1:13, here He says, that the Spirit begets them.

That which is born of the Spirit is spirit. His meaning is of this kind; He that is born  of the Spirit is spiritual. For the Birth which He speaks of here is not that according to essence,  but according to honor and grace. Now if the Son is so born also, in what shall He be superior to men so born? And how is He, Only-begotten? For I too am born of God, though not of His Essence, and if He also is not of His Essence, how in this respect does He differ from us? Nay, He will then be found to be inferior to the Spirit; for birth of this kind is by the grace of the Spirit. Needs He then the help of the Spirit that He may continue a Son? And in what do these differ from Jewish doctrines?

Christ then having said, He that is born of the Spirit is spirit, when He saw him again confused, leads His discourse to an example from sense, saying,

For above he said that some “were begotten of God.” Here he says that the Spirit begets them. “That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” He means, “The one that is born50 of the Spirit is spiritual.” For the birth of which he speaks here is not that according to essence but according to honor and grace.
