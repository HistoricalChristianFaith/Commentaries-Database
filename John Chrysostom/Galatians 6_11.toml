Observe what great grief occupies that blessed soul [Paul].… Having said a little about morals, he now returns to the things that were causing the greatest disturbance to his soul, saying “See in what large letters I have written to you.” Here he hints at nothing except that he himself wrote the whole letter, which is a sign of the greatest authenticity. For in the other epistles he may have composed, but another wrote.… By “so large” he seems to me to be indicating not the size but the poor form of the characters, all but saying, “Although I do not write well, I have nonetheless been compelled to write for myself, so as to silence those who slander me.”
