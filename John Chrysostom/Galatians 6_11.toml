Observe what great grief occupies that blessed soul [Paul]…. Having said a little about morals, he now returns to the things that were causing the greatest disturbance to his soul, saying “See in what large letters I have written to you.” Here he hints at nothing except that he himself wrote the whole letter, which is a sign of the greatest authenticity. For in the other epistles he may have composed, but another wrote…. By “so large” he seems to me to be indicating not the size but the poor form of the characters, all but saying, “Although I do not write well, I have nonetheless been compelled to write for myself, so as to silence those who slander me.”

Observe what grief possesses his blessed soul. As those who are oppressed with some sorrow, who have lost one of their own kindred, and suffered an unexpected calamity, rest neither by night nor day, because their grief besieges their soul, so the blessed Paul, after a short moral discourse, returns again to that former subject which chiefly disturbed his mind, saying as follows: see with how large letters I have written unto you with my own hand. By this he signifies that he had written the whole letter himself, which was a proof of great sincerity. In his other Epistles he himself only dictated, another wrote, as is plain from the Epistle to the Romans, for at its close it is said, I Tertius, who write the Epistle, salute you; Romans 16:22 but in this instance he wrote the whole himself. And this he did by necessity, not from affection merely, but in order to remove an injurious suspicion. Being charged with acts wherein he had no part, and being reported to preach Circumcision yet to pretend to preach it not, he was compelled to write the Epistle with his own hand, thus laying up beforehand a written testimony. By the expression what sized, he appears to me to signify, not the magnitude, but, the misshapen appearance of the letters, as if he had said, Although not well skilled in writing, I have been compelled to write with my own hand to stop the mouth of these traducers.
