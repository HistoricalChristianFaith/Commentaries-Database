But of what laborers does He speak here? Of the twelve disciples. What then? Whereas He had said, But the laborers are few, did He add to their number? By no means, but He sent them out alone. Wherefore then did He say, Pray ye the Lord of the harvest, that He would send forth laborers into His harvest; and made no addition to their number? Because though they were but twelve, He made them many from that time forward, not by adding to their number, but by giving them power.
