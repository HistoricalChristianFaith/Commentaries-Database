See how through the insight granted him by the Spirit Jacob anticipates the legislation of Moses against allowing father and son to have relations with the same woman. Ahead of time he forbids this in censuring his son thus, “You stained the couch” by entering your father’s bed. You committed an unlawful act, he says. Hence “you ran riot like water, but you shall not break out again.”
