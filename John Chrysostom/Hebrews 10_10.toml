And why do you wonder that it is not the will of God now, when it was not His will even from the beginning? For who, says He, has required this at your hands? Isaiah 1:12

How then did He Himself enjoin it? In condescension. For as Paul says, I would that all men were even as I myself 1 Corinthians 7:7, in respect of continence, and again says, I will that the younger women marry, bear children 1 Timothy 5:14; and lays down two wills, yet the two are not his own, although he commands; but the one indeed is his own, and therefore he lays it down without reasons; while the other is not his own, though he wishes it, and therefore it is added with a reason. For having previously accused them, because they had waxed wanton against Christ 1 Timothy 5:11, he then says, I will that the younger women marry, bear children. 1 Timothy 5:14 So in this place also it was not His leading will that the sacrifices should be offered. For, as He says, I wish not the death of the sinner, as that he should turn unto [Me] and live Ezekiel 33:11: and in another place He says that He not only wished, but even desired this: and yet these are contrary to each other: for intense wishing is desire. How then dost Thou not wish? How dost Thou in another place desire, which is a sign of vehement wishing? So is it in this case also.
