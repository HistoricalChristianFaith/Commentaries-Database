Then, since they kept on in a state of incurable madness and were not to be sobered even by the rest being carried away, he first exhorts them to remain there. But when they kept not up to this but deserted to Egypt, this indeed God allowed them but requires of them not to desert to pagan religion as well as to Egypt. But when they did not comply in this either, he sends the prophet along with them, so that they might not after all suffer total disaster. For since they did not follow him when he called, he next follows them to discipline them and prevent their being hurried further into vice, as a father full of affection does to a child who takes all treatment in the same peevish way, conducting him about everywhere with himself and following him about. This was the reason why God sent not Jeremiah only into Egypt but also Ezekiel into Babylon, and they did not refuse to go. - "Homilies on Romans 14"
