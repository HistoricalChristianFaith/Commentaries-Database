There were probably in the time of our ancestors also some who … “did the works of the false prophets”; … a thing, by the way, done (I think) by some even today. When, for example, we say that he who calls his brother a fool will go into hell fire, others will say, what? Impossible, they say. And again, when we say that the “covetous person is an idolater,” in this too again they make excuses and say the expression is hyperbolical. And in this way they underrate and explain away all the commandments.
