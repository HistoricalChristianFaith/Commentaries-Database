As, He says, I both by My words and by the truth declare the Father, so also do ye by your actions (declare yours). For I have not only the same Substance, but also the same Truth with the Father.

He does not say, “You do not take in my words” but “My word has no place in you,” thus declaring the depths of his doctrines. And yet, this is not a reason to kill him. In fact, they should have honored him and waited on him in order to learn. But they might say, Why should we pay attention to you if you are speaking about yourself? And so he adds, “I speak what I have seen with my Father.… As both by my words and by the truth I declare the Father, so also do you by your actions [declare your father].” For I have not only the same substance but also the same truth with the Father.
