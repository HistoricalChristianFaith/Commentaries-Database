The expression, "If so be that you heard Him," is not that of one doubting, but of one even strongly affirming: as he also speaks elsewhere, "If so be that it is a righteous thing with God to recompense affliction to them that afflict you." [2 Thessalonians 1:6] That is to say, It was not for these purposes that "ye learned Christ."
