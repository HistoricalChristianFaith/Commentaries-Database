Paul's reasoning "concerning righteousness" was directed against the well-known injustice of a prince of whom Tacitus says that he acted as if there were no penalty for villainy. His reasoning "concerning self-control" was in opposition to his sensuality. He had unlawfully married Drusilla who was the wife of Azizus, the king of Emesa. His references to the judgment to come might well have been directed against the governor's murder of Jonathan, the high priest.
