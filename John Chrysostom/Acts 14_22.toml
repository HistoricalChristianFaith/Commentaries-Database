This [the apostles] said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only by the apostles but by the disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the power of the preaching and that they must themselves also suffer such things, that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles but much more ready for the trials. Therefore also the apostle himself said, “Having the same conflict which you saw in me and heard.” … And they were taught this by Christ when he said, “Rejoice not that the devils obey you.” For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer anything for Christ’s sake.
