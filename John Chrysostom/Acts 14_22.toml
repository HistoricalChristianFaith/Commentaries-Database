This they said, this they showed. But it is purposely so done, not only by the Apostles, but by the disciples also, that they may learn from the very outset both the might of the preaching, and that they must themselves also suffer such things, that they may stand nobly, not idly gaping for the miracles, but much more (ready) for the trials. Therefore also the Apostle himself said, Having the same conflict which you saw in me and heard. Philippians 1:30 Persecutions succeeded to persecutions: wars, fightings, stonings. (g) These things, not less than the miracles, both made them more illustrious, and prepared for them a greater rejoicing. The Scripture nowhere says that they returned rejoicing because they had done miracles, but (it does say that they rejoiced), that they were counted worthy for that Name to suffer shame. Acts 5:41 And this they were taught of Christ, saying, Rejoice not that the devils obey you. Luke 10:20 For the joy indeed and without alloy is this, to suffer anything for Christ's sake. (i) And that through much tribulation: what sort of cheering (προτροπή) is this? How did they persuade them, by telling them at the outset of tribulations? Then also another consolation. And when they had appointed for them elders in every Church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
