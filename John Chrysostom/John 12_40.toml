Just as the sun blinds the eyes of the weak … this is also what happens to those who do not listen to the words of God. As so, in the case of Pharaoh, he is said to have hardened his heart, and so it is with those who are at all contentious against the words of God. This is a peculiar mode of speech of Scripture, as in, “He gave them over to a reprobate mind,” … that is, he allowed or permitted them to go. For the writer does not here introduce God as himself doing these things but shows that they took place through the wickedness of others. For when we are abandoned by God, we are given up to the devil.… It is to terrify the hearer that the writer says “he hardens” and “he gave over.” For to show that he does not give us over or even leave us unless we want him to, listen to what he says, “Isn’t it your iniquities that separate me and you.” … Isaiah also says, “I came, and there was no one; I called, and there was none who listened.” He says these things, showing that we begin the desertion and become the causes of our destruction. For God not only desires not to leave or to punish us, but even when he punishes, he does it unwillingly. “I desire not,” he says, “the death of the sinner but that he should turn and live.” … Knowing this, let us do everything we can so as not to remove ourselves from God. Let us instead be concerned about the care of our souls and about our love toward one another.
