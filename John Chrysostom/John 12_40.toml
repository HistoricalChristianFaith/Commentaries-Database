Here again is another question, but it is not so if we rightly consider it. For as the sun dazzles the eyes of the weak, not by reason of  its proper nature, so it is with those who give not heed to the words of God. Thus, in the case of Pharaoh, He is said to have hardened his heart, and so it is with those who are at all contentious against the words of God. This is a peculiar mode of speech in Scripture, as also the, He gave them over unto a reprobate mind Romans 1:28, and the, He divided them to the nations,  that is, allowed, permitted them to go. For the writer does not here introduce God as Himself working these things, but shows that they took place through the wickedness of others. For, when we are abandoned by God, we are given up to the devil, and when so given up, we suffer ten thousand dreadful things. To terrify the hearer, therefore, the writer says, He hardened, and gave over. For to show that He does not only not give us over, but does not even leave us, except we will it, hear what He says, Do not your iniquities separate between Me and you? Isaiah 59:2, Septuagint. And again, They that go far away from You shall perish. Psalm 73:27, Septuagint And Hosea says, You have forgotten the law of your God, and I will also forget you Hosea 4:6, Septuagint; and He says Himself also in the Gospels, How often would I have gathered your children&mdash; and you would not. Luke 13:34 Esaias also again, I came, and there was no man; I called, and there was none to hearken. Isaiah 50:2, Septuagint These things He says, showing that we begin the desertion, and become the causes of our perdition; for God not only desires not to leave or to punish us, but even when He punishes, does it unwillingly; I will not, He says, the death of a sinner, so much as that he should turn and live. Ezekiel 18:32, Septuagint Christ also mourns over the destruction of Jerusalem,  as we also do over our friends.

3. Knowing this, let us do all so as not to remove from God, but let us hold fast to the care of our souls, and to the love towards each other; let us not tear our own members, (for this  is the act of men insane and beside themselves,) but the more we see any ill disposed, the more let us be kind to them. Since we often see many persons suffering  in their bodies from difficult or incurable maladies, and cease not to apply remedies. What is worse than gout in foot or hand? Are we therefore to cut off the limbs? Not at all, but we use every means that the sufferer may enjoy some comfort, since we cannot get rid of the disease. This also let us do in the case of our brethren, and, even though they be diseased incurably, let us continue to tend them, and let us bear one another's burdens. So shall we fulfill the law of Christ, and obtain the promised good things, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

Just as the sun blinds the eyes of the weak … this is also what happens to those who do not listen to the words of God. As so, in the case of Pharaoh, he is said to have hardened his heart, and so it is with those who are at all contentious against the words of God. This is a peculiar mode of speech of Scripture, as in, “He gave them over to a reprobate mind,” … that is, he allowed or permitted them to go. For the writer does not here introduce God as himself doing these things but shows that they took place through the wickedness of others. For when we are abandoned by God, we are given up to the devil.… It is to terrify the hearer that the writer says “he hardens” and “he gave over.” For to show that he does not give us over or even leave us unless we want him to, listen to what he says, “Isn’t it your iniquities that separate me and you.” … Isaiah also says, “I came, and there was no one; I called, and there was none who listened.” He says these things, showing that we begin the desertion and become the causes of our destruction. For God not only desires not to leave or to punish us, but even when he punishes, he does it unwillingly. “I desire not,” he says, “the death of the sinner but that he should turn and live.” … Knowing this, let us do everything we can so as not to remove ourselves from God. Let us instead be concerned about the care of our souls and about our love toward one another.
