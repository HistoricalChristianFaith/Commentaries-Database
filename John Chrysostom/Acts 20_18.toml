Look, although [Paul] was in a hurry to sail past, he did not overlook them but planned everything. He sent for the leaders and broadcast his words through them. It is worthy of admiration how finding himself under compulsion to say something great about himself, he tries to make the least of it. For just as Samuel, about to hand over the rule to Saul, said in their presence, “Have I taken anything from you? You are witnesses and God also.” … Likewise Paul himself says to the Corinthians, “I have been a fool! You forced me.” Even God does this: he speaks of himself not for no reason but when he is disbelieved, and then he offers his benefits. Observe, then, what Paul does here. First he brings up their testimony, so that you should not think he is boasting, and calls the listeners themselves to be witnesses of his words, since he was not likely to lie in their presence.
