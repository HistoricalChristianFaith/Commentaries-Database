Do not be astonished, he says, if Christ confers benefits on those who decline his kingdom, since it was just the same in the case of Moses. And not only did he deliver them from Egypt, but also he saved them in the wilderness.… He shows that the prophecy must by all means be fulfilled and that Moses is not opposed to him. This is the man, he says, “who was in the assembly in the wilderness” and “who spoke to the children of Israel.” Do you see that this is where the root4 comes from and that “salvation is from the Jews”? “With the angel,” it says, “who had spoken to him.” Look, again he affirms that it was he [Christ] who gave the law, since Moses was with him “in the assembly in the wilderness.”
