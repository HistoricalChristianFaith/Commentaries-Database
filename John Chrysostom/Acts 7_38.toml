Do you mark that thence comes the root, and that salvation is from the Jews? John 4:22 With the Angel, it says, which spoke unto him. Romans 11:16 Lo, again he affirms that it was He (Christ) that gave the Law, seeing Moses was with Him in the Church in the wilderness. And here he puts them in mind of a great marvel, of the things done in the Mount: Who received living oracles to give unto us. On all occasions Moses is wonderful, and (so) when need was to legislate. What means the expression, Living oracles (λόγια)? Those, whereof the end was shown by words (διὰ λόγων): in other words, he means the prophecies. Then follows the charge, in the first instance, against the patriarchs [after], the signs and wonders, after the receiving of the lively oracles: To whom, he says, our fathers would not obey. Acts 7:39 But concerning those, Ezekiel says that they are not living; as when he says, And I gave you statutes that are not good. Ezekiel 20:25 It is with reference to those that he says, Living. But thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt— the place where they groaned, where they cried, whence they called upon God.

Again no mention of temple, none of sacrifice. With the Angel, it says, he received the lively oracles to give unto the fathers. It shows, that he not only wrought miracles, but also gave a law, as Christ did. Just as Christ first works miracles, and then legislates: so did Moses. But they did not hear him, keeping their disobedience, even after the miracles: To whom, he says, our fathers would not obey: Acts 7:39 after the wonders done in those forty years. And not only so, but just the contrary: but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt. Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us; for as for this Moses, which brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what has become of him. And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands. Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the Prophets, O you house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices by the space of forty years in the wilderness? Yea, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, figures which you made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon. (v. 40, 43.) The expression, gave them up, means, He suffered.

Do not be astonished, he says, if Christ confers benefits on those who decline his kingdom, since it was just the same in the case of Moses. And not only did he deliver them from Egypt, but also he saved them in the wilderness.… He shows that the prophecy must by all means be fulfilled and that Moses is not opposed to him. This is the man, he says, “who was in the assembly in the wilderness” and “who spoke to the children of Israel.” Do you see that this is where the root4 comes from and that “salvation is from the Jews”? “With the angel,” it says, “who had spoken to him.” Look, again he affirms that it was he [Christ] who gave the law, since Moses was with him “in the assembly in the wilderness.”
