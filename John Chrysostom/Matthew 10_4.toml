Then after having mentioned Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus, and Simon Zelotes, whom he calls also the Canaanite, he comes to the traitor. And not as a sort of enemy or foe, but as one writing a history, so has he described him. He says not, the unholy, the all unholy one, but has named him from his city, Judas Iscariot. Because there was also another Judas, Lebbæus, whose surname was Thaddæus, who, Luke says, was the brother of James, saying, Judas the brother of James. Luke 6:16 Therefore to distinguish him from this man, it says, Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him. Matthew 10:4 And he is not ashamed to say, who also betrayed Him. So far were they from ever disguising anything even of those things that seem to be matters of reproach.

And first of all, and leader of the choir, is the unlearned, the ignorant man. Acts 4:13

He makes them confident not only by calling their ministry a sending forth to the  harvest, but by giving them strength for the ministry; whence it follows, "He gave them power over all unclean spirits to cast them out, and to heal every sickness and every disease.”.
This is no small honour (done to Peter), He places Peter from his merit, Andrew from the nobility he had in being the brother of Peter. Mark names Andrew next after the two heads, namely, Peter and John; but this one not so; for Mark has arranged them in order of dignity.
