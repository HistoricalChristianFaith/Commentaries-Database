There is knowledge which goes beyond speech. Many have knowledge which they cannot express â€”for example, those who are uneducated and unable to express themselves clearly. But the Corinthians were not like them. They were able both to understand and to speak.

In all utterance, and all knowledge. Word [or utterance,] not such as the heathen, but that of God. For there is knowledge without word, and there is knowledge with word. For so there are many who possess knowledge, but have not the power of speech; as those who are uneducated and unable to exhibit clearly what they have in their mind. You, says he, are not such as these, but competent both to understand and to speak.
