Do not, he says, hastily cut them off, but carefully inquire into all the circumstances. When you have thoroughly informed yourself, then proceed against the offender with rigor, that others may take warning. For as it is wrong to condemn hastily and rashly, so not to punish manifest offenses is to open the way to others, and embolden them to offend.… Let us therefore love God with fear … as I have ever said, the threatenings of hell show the care of God for us no less than the promises of heaven.
