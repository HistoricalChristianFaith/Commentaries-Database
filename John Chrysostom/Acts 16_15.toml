Notice again the absence of pride. She was a woman, and she was lowly and a manual laborer. Note, however, that the woman was a lover of wisdom. The first evidence of this is her testimony that God called her. See how the writer of the story was not ashamed to report the habits of life.… And as for us, let us not be ashamed of these students or of any student of these things. Peter stays with the tanner, and Paul with the dealer in purple and a foreign one for that matter. Where is their pride? Therefore let us pray to God that he may open our heart. In fact God opens those hearts that want to be opened, as he can see those that are hardened. The opening is God's part, being attentive hers: this is something that is, in fact, both human and divine.

"And when she was baptized," it says, "she and her household" - mark how he persuaded all of them - "she besought us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and abide there. And she constrained us": then look at her wisdom, how she importunes the Apostles, how full of humility her words are, how full of wisdom. "If ye have judged me faithful," she says. Nothing could be more persuasive. Who would not have been softened by these words? She did not request, did not entreat simply: but she left them to decide, and yet exceedingly forced them: "And she constrained us," it says, by those words. And again in a different way: for see how she straightway bears fruit, and accounts it a great gain. "If ye have judged me," that is, That ye did judge me is manifest, by your delivering to me such holy mysteries: and she did not dare to invite them before this.

And she was baptized, and receives the Apostles with such earnestness of entreaty; with more than that used by Abraham. And she speaks of no other token than that whereby she was saved: she says not, "If ye have judged me" a great, a devout woman; but what? "faithful to the Lord": if to the Lord, much more to you. "If ye have judged me": if ye do not doubt it. And she says not, Abide with me, but, "Come into my house and abide": with great earnestness she says it. Indeed a faithful woman!
