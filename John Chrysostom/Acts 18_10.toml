“Do not be afraid,” he says. This was enough to rouse him, either because he was reproved as being afraid or because he was not reproved but encouraged that he would not suffer this. (For he did not always allow them to suffer terribly, so that they might not become too weak.) For nothing pained Paul so much as those who disbelieved and gave opposition. This was more difficult for him to bear than dangers. “And do not be silent,” he says, “for I have many people in this city.” It was probably for this reason that Christ appeared to him.
