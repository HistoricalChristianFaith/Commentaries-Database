"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come." See how free from flattery his speech is, and how he ascribes the whole to God. Then his boldness-but neither do I now desist: and the sure grounds-for it is from the prophets that I urge the question.

"Testifying," he says, "both to great and small," that is, both to distinguished and undistinguished. This is also for the soldiers. Observe: having left the post of defendant, he took up that of teacher-and therefore also it is that Festus says to him, "Thou art beside thyself"-but then, that he may not seem to be himself the teacher, he brings in the prophets, and Moses.
