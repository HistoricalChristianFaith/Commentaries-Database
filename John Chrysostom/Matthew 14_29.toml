This is more wonderful than the former. Therefore this is done after that. For when He had shown that He rules the sea, then He carries on the sign to what is yet more marvellous. Then He rebuked the winds only; but now He both walks Himself, and permits another to do so; which thing if He had required to be done at the beginning, Peter would not have so well received it, because he had not yet acquired so great faith.

Wherefore then did Christ permit him? Why, if He had said, you can not, Peter being ardent would have contradicted Him again. Wherefore by the facts He convinces him, that for the future he may be sobered.

But not even so does he endure. Therefore having come down, he becomes dizzy; for he was afraid. And this the surf caused, but his fear was wrought by the wind.

But John says, that they willingly received Him into the ship; and immediately the ship was at the land whither they went, relating this same circumstance. So that when they were on the point of arriving at the land, He entered the ship.

Why then did Christ permit Peter to come? Suppose he had said, “No, you cannot come.” With his boldness Peter might have protested again. But when Peter saw the sea and wind, he became dizzy and was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.”In relating this same situation, John remarks that “then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.” This implies that when they were on the point of arriving at the land, he entered the ship. Peter then having come down from the ship went to Jesus, not rejoicing so much in walking on the water as in coming to him.
