Why then did Christ permit Peter to come? Suppose he had said, “No, you cannot come.” With his boldness Peter might have protested again. But when Peter saw the sea and wind, he became dizzy and was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, “Lord, save me.”In relating this same situation, John remarks that “then they were willing to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat reached the shore where they were heading.” This implies that when they were on the point of arriving at the land, he entered the ship. Peter then having come down from the ship went to Jesus, not rejoicing so much in walking on the water as in coming to him.
