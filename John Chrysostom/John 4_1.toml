[Christ acted] not from fear but to take away their malice and soften their envy. He was indeed able to restrain them when they came against him, but he did not want to be found doing this all the time. Otherwise people might not believe his incarnation in the flesh was real. For if he was always being seized, only to then escape, this would have raised a lot of suspicion. Therefore, for the most part, he did things in a human way instead.
