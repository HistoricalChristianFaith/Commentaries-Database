Observe how not only by the washing but also in another way he exhibits humility. For it was not before reclining, but after they had all sat down, then he arose. In the next place, he does not merely wash them, but he does so taking off his garments. And he did not even stop here, but he girded himself with a towel. Nor was he satisfied with this, but himself filled [the basin] and did not ask another to fill it. He did all these things himself, showing by all of them that we must do such things when we are engaged in well doing, not merely for the sake of appearance but with every effort.
