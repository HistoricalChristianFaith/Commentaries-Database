And he does not spend a long time on these [ingratitudes of the ancestors], taking it for granted that the word is of course believed. But he expands on the punishment and goes after that which they love, showing that the law is being cast out, and he dwells on what is for their good, [telling them] that great shall be the blessings for those who obey and great the evils for those who do not.â€¦ Paul loved them exceedingly. And notice how he does not dwell on the ingratitude of the fathers but puts before them what they must fear. For Stephen indeed does this with good reason, seeing that he was about to be put to death, and was not teaching them but showing them that the law is even now on the point of being abolished. But not so Paul; he only threatens and puts fear in them.
