Ver. 14. "Who gave Himself for us, that He might redeem us from all iniquity, and purify unto Himself a peculiar people."

"Peculiar": that is, selected from the rest, and having nothing in common with them.

"Zealous of good works."

Do you see that our part is necessary, not merely works, but "zealous"; we should with all alacrity, with a becoming earnestness, go forward in virtue. For when we were weighed down with evils, and incurably diseased, it was of His lovingkindness that we were delivered. But what follows after this is our part as well as His.

“That he might purify unto himself a people of his own.” Considering the desperate condition of human nature and the ineffably tender solicitude of Christ, in what he delivered us from and what he freely gave us, and kindled by the yearning of affection towards him, this is a remarkably tender expression. Thus the prophets often appropriate to themselves him who is God of all, as in the words, “O God, you are my God, early will I seek you.” Moreover, this language teaches that each individual justly owes a great debt of gratitude to Christ, as if he had come for that person’s sake alone. For he would not have grudged this his condescension even if it were only for one person. The measure of his love to each is as great as to the whole world.
