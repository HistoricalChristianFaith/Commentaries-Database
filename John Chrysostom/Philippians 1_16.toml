"The one proclaim Christ of faction not sincerely."

That is, not with pure motives, nor from regard to the matter itself; but why? "thinking to add affliction to my bonds." As they think that I shall thus fall into greater peril, they add affliction to affliction. O cruelty! O devilish instigation! They saw him in bonds, and cast into prison, and still they envied him. They would increase his calamities, and render him subject to greater anger: well said he, "thinking," for it did not so turn out. They thought indeed to grieve me by this; but I rejoiced that the Gospel was furthered.
