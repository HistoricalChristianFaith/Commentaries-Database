Lest any should say, If what you say is life, wherefore has Christ left you here? "It is," he says, "the fruit of my work;" so that it is possible to use to good purpose the present life, while not living it. Lest you should think that reproach is cast upon life. For if we gain no advantage here, wherefore do we not make away with ourselves, nor slay ourselves? By no means, he answers. It is open to us to profit even here, if we live not this, but another life. But perchance one will say, does this bear you fruit? Yes! He answers. Where are now the heretics? Behold now; "to live in the flesh," this is "the fruit of his work." "That which I now live in the flesh, I live in faith;" therefore it is "the fruit of my work."

"And what I shall choose I know not." Marvelous! How great was his philosophy! How has he both cast out the desire of the present life, and yet thrown no reproach upon it! For in that he says, "to die is gain," by this he has cast out the desire, but in that he says, "to live in the flesh is the fruit of my work," here he shows that the present life also is needful, if we use it as need is, if we bear fruit; since if it be unfruitful, it is no longer life. For we despise those trees which bear no fruit, as though they were dry, and give them up to the fire. Life itself belongs to that middle class of indifferent things, while to live well or ill is in ourselves. We do not then hate life, for we may live well too. So even if we use it ill, we do not even then cast the blame on it. And wherefore? Because not itself, but the free choice of those who use it ill is to blame. For God has made you live, that you may live to Him. But you, by living through corruption unto sin, makest yourself accountable for all blame. What do you say, tell me. You know not what to choose? Here has he revealed a great mystery, in that his departure was in his own power; for where choice is, there have we power. "What I shall choose," says he, "I know not." Is it in your own power? Yes, he answers, if I would ask this grace of God.

One must not suppose that he is demeaning this life. He is not saying that since there is nothing good for us here, we might as well do away with ourselves. Not at all. There can be profit even here, if we live not toward this life finally but toward that other.

Here he divulges a great mystery: he thought that the time of his departure was in his own power. Where there is choice, there we have power. “Yet,” he says, “which one I shall choose I do not yet know.” If he would ask this grace of God, either would appear to be within his power.… Behold the affection of this blessed man! By this he comforts them when they see that even his departure is within his own power. This happens only by the dispensation of God.
