I exhort you that you not carelessly slumber so as to leave everything to God. Nor, when diligent in your endeavors, imagine that by your own exertions the whole work is achieved. God does not will that we should be indolent. For God does not do the whole work by himself by fiat. Nor is it his will that we should be entirely selfsufficient. For God does not commit the whole work to us alone. The Gospel of St. Matthew, Homily

Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc., see Chrys, Hom. in Matt., 40: He placed him in the midst, that they might be frightened at the sight, and on seeing Him compassionate him, and lay aside their malice.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: For they knew that He would certainly cure him. It goes on: “And looking round about upon them with anger. "His looking round upon them in anger, and being saddened at the blindness of their hearts, is fitting for His humanity, which He deigned to take upon Himself for us. He connects the working of the miracle with a word, which proves that the man is cured by His voice alone. It follow therefore, “And he stretched itout, and his hand was restored.” Answering by all these things for His disciples, and at the same time shewing that His life is above the law.
