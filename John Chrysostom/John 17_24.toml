This again is a sign of his being of one mind with the Father and of a higher character than those who lived in former times. For he says “before the foundation of the world.” And yet, there is also a certain humility evident when Jesus says, “You have given me.” Now if this is not the case, I would gladly ask those who do not think so a question: The one that gives is considered superior to the one who receives the gift. Did the Father, then, having first begotten the Son, afterward give him glory, having allowed him to be without glory until then? How can this be reasonable? See that the “he gave” really means “he begot”? But why didn’t he say, “That they may share my glory” instead of “that they may behold my glory”? Here he implies that what they are doing is looking on the Son of God. This certainly is what causes them to be glorified, as Paul says, “with open face mirroring the glory of the Lord.” For as they who look on the sunbeams and enjoy a very clear atmosphere draw their enjoyment from their sight, so then also our sight will cause us greater pleasure. At the same time also he shows that what they should behold was not the body then seen but something awesome.
