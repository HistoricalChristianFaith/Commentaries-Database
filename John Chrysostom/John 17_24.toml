Then dost Thou gain by prayer, and dost Thou not yet possess that concerning which they enquired continually, saying, 'Where are You going?' What sayest Thou? How then did You say to them, 'You shall sit upon twelve thrones'? Matthew 19:28 How did You promise other things more and greater? Do you see that He says all  in the way of condescension? Since how would He have said, You shall follow afterwards? John 13:36 But He speaks thus with a view to a fuller conviction and demonstration of His love.

That they may behold My glory which You have given Me.

This again is a sign of His being of one mind with the Father, of a higher character than those former, for He says, Before  the foundation of the world, yet has it also a certain condescension; for, You have given Me, He says. Now if this be not the case, I would gladly ask the gainsayers a question. He that gives, gives to one subsisting;  did the Father then, having first begotten the Son, afterwards give Him glory, having before allowed Him to be without glory? And how could this be reasonable? Seest that the He gave, is, He begot?

3. But why said He not, That they may share My glory, instead of, That they may be  hold My glory? Here He implies, that all that rest is, the looking on the Son of God. This certainly it is which causes them to be glorified; as Paul says, With open face mirroring the glory of the Lord. 2 Corinthians 3:18 For as they who look on the sunbeams, and enjoy a very clear atmosphere, draw their enjoyment from their sight, so then also, and in much greater degree, this will cause us pleasure.  At the same time also He shows, that what they should behold was not the body then seen, but some awful Substance.

After He has said that many should believe on Him through them, and that they should obtain great glory, He then speaks of the crowns in store for them; Father, 1 will that they also whom you have given Me, be with Me; where I am.
he says not, that they may partake of My glory, but, that they may behold, intimating that therest there is to see the Son of God. The Father gave Him glory, when He begat Him.
He says this asif He were troubled at the thought, that they should be unwilling to know One so just and good. And whereas the Jews had said, that they knew God, and He knew Him not: He on the contrary says, But I have known you, and these have known that you have sent Me, and I have declared to them your name, and will declare it, by giving them perfect knowledge through the Holy Spirit. When they have learned what you are, they will know that I am not separate from You, but You own Son greatly beloved, and joined to You. This I have e told them, thatI might receive them, and that they who believe this aright, shall preserve their faith and love toward Me entire; and I will abide in them: That the love wherewith you have loved Me maybe in them, and I in them.
