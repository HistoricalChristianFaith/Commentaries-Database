Ver. 15. "Let us, therefore, as many as be perfect, be thus minded," says he. "And if in anything you are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you." What sort of thing? That we should "forget the things which are behind." Wherefore it belongs to him who is perfect not to consider himself perfect. How therefore do you say, "as many as are perfect"? For tell me, are we minded as you are? For if you have not attained nor art perfected, how do you command those that are perfect to be so minded as you are, who art not yet perfect? Yea, for this, says he, is perfection. And "if you are in anything otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you." That is, if any one considers that he has attained all excellence. He puts them on their guard, not by speaking directly, but what says he? "If in anything you are otherwise minded, even this shall God reveal unto you." See how humbly he says this! God shall teach you, i.e. God shall persuade you,  not teach you; for Paul was teaching, but God shall lead them on. And he said not, shall lead you on, but "shall reveal," that this may rather seem to spring from ignorance. These words were spoken not concerning doctrines, but concerning perfection of life, and our not considering ourselves to be perfect, for he who considers that he has apprehended all, has nothing.
