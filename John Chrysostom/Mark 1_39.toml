Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: Not that He required prayer; for it was He who Himself received the prayers of men; but He did this by way of an economy, and became to us the model of good work.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: Luke however says that crowds came to Christ, and spoke what Mark here relates that the Apostles said, adding, “And when they came to Him, they said to Him, All seek thee.” But they do not contradict each other; for Christ received after the Apostles the multitude, breathlessly anxious to embrace His feet. He received them willingly, but chose to dismiss them, that the rest also might be partakers of His doctrine, as He was not to remain long in the world. And therefore there follows: “And He said, Let us go into the neighbouring villages and towns, that there also I may preach.”.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: In which word, He manifests the mystery of His “emptying himself,” that is, of His incarnation, and the sovereignty of His divine nature, in that He here asserts, that He came willingly into theworld.There follows: “And He continued preaching in their synagogues, in all Galilee.”
