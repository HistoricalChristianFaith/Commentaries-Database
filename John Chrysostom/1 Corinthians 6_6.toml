When brothers go to law against each other, there is no need for a mediator to show understanding and discernment. Brotherly feeling and relationship contribute greatly toward the settlement of such quarrels. To take such a quarrel before unbelievers merely makes everything that much worse and prevents a happy resolution of the problem.
