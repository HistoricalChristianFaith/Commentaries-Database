"But brother goes to law with brother, and that before unbelievers."

The charge is twofold; both that he "goes to law," and "before the unbelievers." For if even the thing by itself, To go to law with a brother, be a fault, to do it also before aliens, what pardon does it admit of?

When brothers go to law against each other, there is no need for a mediator to show understanding and discernment. Brotherly feeling and relationship contribute greatly toward the settlement of such quarrels. To take such a quarrel before unbelievers merely makes everything that much worse and prevents a happy resolution of the problem.
