Let us become as clean as is possible. Let us wash away our sins. And the prophet teaches us how to wash them away, saying, “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean, put away from my eyes the evil of your souls.” … See that we must first cleanse ourselves, and then God cleanses us. He first said, “Wash yourselves, make yourselves clean,” and then said, “I will make you white.” … The power of repentance is then tremendous as it makes us white as snow and wool, even though sin had stained our souls.

I say this, for in the prophet’s words he does not mean bathing by water—the Jewish method of purification—but the purifying of the conscience. Let us also, then, be clean.

Let us accept the medicine that obliterates our failures. Repentance is not what is spoken in words but what is confirmed by deeds, the repentance that obliterates the filth of impiety from the heart.… Why “before my eyes”? Because the eyes of people see differently, and the eye of God sees differently.… “Do not adulterate repentance with pretense,” he says, “but, before my eyes, which examine what is secret, reveal the fruits of repentance.”
