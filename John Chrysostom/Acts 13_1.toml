He still mentions Barnabas first: for Paul was not yet famous, he had not yet wrought any sign. As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Ghost said, Separate Me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them. And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.
