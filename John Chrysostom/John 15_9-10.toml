Again, Jesus’ discourse proceeds in a human way. For certainly the lawgiver himself would not be subject to commandments. Here again, as I keep on saying, this is spoken because of the infirmity of his hearers. He is primarily speaking to their suspicions, and by every means he tries to show them that they are safe and that their enemies are being lost. He is showing them that everything, whatever they have, they have from the Son and that, if they demonstrate a pure life, no one can prevail against them. And observe how authoritative he is with them. He did not say, “Abide in the love of my Father,” but “in my love.” Then, in case they should say, “When you have put us at war with everyone, that is when you leave us and depart,” he shows that he does not leave them but is as joined to them as the branch is to the vine. Then, in case they get so confident that they become lazy, he tells them the blessing can be removed if they are not vigilant. And, so that he does not refer the action to himself and make them even more apt to fall, he says, “Herein is my Father glorified.” For everywhere he demonstrates his own and his Father’s love toward them.
