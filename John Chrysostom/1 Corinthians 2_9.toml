Where are these words written? Why, it is said to have been written, then also, when it is set down, not in words, but in actual events, as in the historical books ; or when the same meaning is expressed, but not in the very same words, as in this place: for the words, They to whom it was not told about Him shall see, and they who have not heard shall understand, Isaiah 52:15; Septuagint. Comp. Romans 15:21; Isaiah 64:4 are the same with the things which eye has not seen, nor ear heard. Either then this is his meaning, or probably it was actually written in some books, and the copies have perished. For indeed many books were destroyed, and few were preserved entire even in the first captivity. And this is plain, in those which remain to us. For the Apostle says Acts 3:24 From Samuel and the Prophets which follow after they have all spoken concerning Him: and these their words are not entirely extant. Paul, however, as being learned in the law and speaking by the Spirit, would of course know all with accuracy. And why speak I of the captivity? Even before the captivity many books had disappeared; the Jews having rushed headlong to the last degree of impiety: and this is plain from the end of the fourth book of Kings, 2 Kings 22:8; 2 Chronicles 34:14 for the book of Deuteronomy could hardly be found, having been buried somewhere in a dunghill.
And besides, there are in many places double prophecies, easy to be apprehended by the wiser sort; from which we may find out many of the things which are obscure.

7. What then, has eye not seen what God prepared? No. For who among men saw the things which were about to be dispensed? Neither then has the ear heard, nor has it entered into the heart of man. How is this? For if the Prophets spoke of it, how says he, Ear has not heard, neither has it entered into the heart of man? It did not enter; for not of himself alone is he speaking, but of the whole human race. What then? The Prophets, did not they hear? Yes, they heard; but the prophetic ear was not the ear of man: for not as men heard they, but as Prophets. Wherefore he said, Isaiah 50:4. Septuagint He has added unto me an ear to hear, meaning by addition that which was from the Spirit. From whence it was plain that before hearing it had not entered into the heart of man. For after the gift of the Spirit the heart of the Prophets was not the heart of man, but a spiritual heart; as also he says himself, We have the mind of Christ 1 Corinthians 2:16 as if he would say, Before we had the blessing of the Spirit and learned the things which no man can speak, no one of us nor yet of the Prophets conceived them in his mind. How should we? Since not even angels know them. For what need is there to speak, says he, concerning 'the rulers of this world,' seeing that no man knew them, nor yet the powers above?

What kind of things then are these? That by what is esteemed to be the foolishness of preaching He shall overcome the world, and the nations shall be brought in, and there shall be reconciliation of God with men, and so great blessings shall come upon us! How then have we known? Unto us, he says, God has revealed them by His Spirit; not by the wisdom which is without; for this like some dishonored handmaid has not been permitted to enter in, and stoop down and look into see John 20:5 the mysteries pertaining to the Lord. Do you see how great is the difference between this wisdom and that? The things which angels knew not, these are what she has taught us: but she that is without, has done the contrary. Not only has she failed to instruct, but she hindered and obstructed, and after the event sought to obscure His doings, making the Cross of none effect. Not then simply by our receiving the knowledge, does he describe the honor vouchsafed to us, nor by our receiving it with angels, but, what is more, by His Spirit conveying it to us.

7. Then to show its greatness, he says, If the Spirit which knows the secret things of God had not revealed them, we should not have learned them. Such an object of care was this whole subject to God, as to be among His secrets. Wherefore we needed also that Teacher who knows these things perfectly; for the Spirit, 1 Corinthians 2:10-12 says he, searches all things, even the deep things of God. For the word to search is here indicative not of ignorance, but of accurate knowledge: it is the very same mode of speaking which he used even of God, saying, He that searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit. Romans 8:27 Then having spoken with exactness concerning the knowledge of the Spirit, and having pointed out that it is as fully equal to God's knowledge, as the knowledge of a man itself to itself; and also, that we have learned all things from it and necessarily from it; he added, which things also we speak, not in words which man's wisdom teaches, but which the Holy Ghost teaches; comparing spiritual things with spiritual. Do you see to what point he exalted us because of the Teacher's dignity? For so much are we wiser than they as there is difference between Plato and the Holy Spirit; they having for masters the heathen rhetoricians but we, the Holy Spirit.

8. But what is this, comparing spiritual things with spiritual? When a thing is spiritual and of dubious meaning, we adduce testimonies from the things which are spiritual. For instance, I say, Christ rose again— was born of a Virgin; I adduce testimonies and types and demonstrations; the abode of Jonah in the whale and his deliverance afterwards; the child-bearing of the barren, Sarah, Rebecca, and the rest; the springing up of the trees which took place in paradise Genesis 2:5 when there had been no seeds sown, no rains sent down, no furrow drawn along. For the things to come were fashioned out and figured forth, as in shadow, by the former things, that these which are now might be believed when they came in. And again we show, how of the earth was man, and how of man alone the woman; and this without any intercourse whatever; how the earth itself of nothing, the power of the Great Artificer being every where sufficient for all things. Thus with spiritual things do I compare spiritual, and in no instance have I need of the Wisdom which is without— neither its reasonings nor its embellishments. For such persons do but agitate the weak understanding and confuse it; and are not able to demonstrate clearly any one of the things which they affirm, but even have the contrary effect. They rather disturb the mind and fill it with darkness and much perplexity. Wherefore he says, with spiritual things comparing spiritual. Do you see how superfluous he shows it to be? And not only superfluous, but even hostile and injurious: for this is meant by the expressions, lest the Cross of Christ be made of none effect, and, that our ('your faith,' rec. text) faith should not stand in the wisdom of men. And he points out here, that it is impossible for those who confidently entrust every thing to it, to learn any useful thing.

Where are these words written? Either they are a paraphrase of some passage [such as Isaiah 52:15], or they were written in some book which has now disappeared. In fact, many books were destroyed, and very few survived the first captivity intact, as we know from the documents which have survived. Not all the words of the prophets are extant, but Paul, who was learned in the law and was also speaking by the Spirit, would have known them all accurately.
