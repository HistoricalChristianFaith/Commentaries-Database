Then he directs his speech at the city, yet with the intention of correcting his hearers. He says, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!” Why the repetition? This is the speech of one who at the same time pities, bemoans and greatly loves this city. The emotive quality is like a woman who is much beloved and forever loved, yet who had despised the one who loved her. Now on the point of her punishment, just as the punishment is about to be inflicted, he pleads for her. The prophets also had similar words when they said, “Turn to me, and she did not return.”Then having called her, he tells also her bloodstained deeds, she who has been “killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you would not!” In this way Jesus is also pleading his own case. But even with all this you have turned me aside. Yet I have not withdrawn my great affection toward you. It was my desire often to draw you to myself, but you would not.
Jerusalem is defeating itself by its sins. Yet what affection remains. With what warmth is his affection expressed, as a mother for her brood. Everywhere in the prophets is this same image of the wings, both in the song of Moses and in the Psalms, indicating his great protection and care.
“But you would not,” he says, so “behold, your house is forsaken and desolate,” stripped of the protection which comes from me.
It surely was this same one who had been protecting the city, and holding it together and preserving it, who had found it necessary to chasten his beloved. So now a punishment is appointed, one that brings exceeding dread and implies the entire overthrow of the city.
