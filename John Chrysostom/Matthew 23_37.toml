Then He directs His speech unto the city, in this way too being minded to correct His hearers, and says, O Jerusalem, Jerusalem! Matthew 23:37 What means the repetition? This is the manner of one pitying her, and bemoaning her, and greatly loving her. For, like as unto a woman beloved, herself indeed ever loved, but who had despised Him that loved her, and therefore on the point of being punished, He pleads, being now about to inflict the punishment. Which He does in the prophets also, using these words, I said, Turn thou unto me, and she returned not. Jeremiah 3:7

Then having called her, He tells also her blood-stained deeds, Thou that killest the prophets, and stone them that are sent unto you, how often would I have gathered your children together, and you would not, in this way also pleading for His own dealings; not even with these things have you turned me aside, nor withdrawn me from my great affection toward you, but it was my desire even so, not once or twice, but often to draw you unto me. For how often would I have gathered your children together, even as a hen gathers her chickens, and you would not. And this He says, to show that they were ever scattering themselves by their sins. And His affection He indicates by the similitude; for indeed the creature is warm in its love towards its brood. And everywhere in the prophets is this same image of the wings, and in the song of Moses and in the Psalms, indicating His great protection and care.

Then he directs his speech at the city, yet with the intention of correcting his hearers. He says, “O Jerusalem, Jerusalem!” Why the repetition? This is the speech of one who at the same time pities, bemoans and greatly loves this city. The emotive quality is like a woman who is much beloved and forever loved, yet who had despised the one who loved her. Now on the point of her punishment, just as the punishment is about to be inflicted, he pleads for her. The prophets also had similar words when they said, “Turn to me, and she did not return.”Then having called her, he tells also her bloodstained deeds, she who has been “killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, but you would not!” In this way Jesus is also pleading his own case. But even with all this you have turned me aside. Yet I have not withdrawn my great affection toward you. It was my desire often to draw you to myself, but you would not.
Jerusalem is defeating itself by its sins. Yet what affection remains. With what warmth is his affection expressed, as a mother for her brood. Everywhere in the prophets is this same image of the wings, both in the song of Moses and in the Psalms, indicating his great protection and care.
“But you would not,” he says, so “behold, your house is forsaken and desolate,” stripped of the protection which comes from me.
It surely was this same one who had been protecting the city, and holding it together and preserving it, who had found it necessary to chasten his beloved. So now a punishment is appointed, one that brings exceeding dread and implies the entire overthrow of the city.
