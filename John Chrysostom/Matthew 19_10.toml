What then was Christ saying? He did not say, “Yes, marriage would be easier; that is what you must do.” He did not want the disciples to consider this as a commandment. So he added, “Not all receive this word but only those to whom it is given.” He raises up the matter of marriage and shows that it is important, both drawing them toward chastity and encouraging them.

But what took place there, this happened here also. For as there, when the Jews had been put to silence the disciples were troubled, and came unto Him with Peter and said, Declare unto us this parable; Matthew 15:15 even so now also they were troubled and said, If the case of the man be so, it is good not to marry.

For now they understood the saying more than before. Therefore then indeed they held their peace, but now when there has been gainsaying, and answering, and question, and learning by reply, and the law appeared more clear, they ask Him. And openly to contradict they do not dare, but they bring forward what seemed to be a grievous and galling result of it, saying, If the case of the man be so with his wife, it is not good to marry. For indeed it seemed to be a very hard thing to have a wife full of every bad quality, and to endure a wild beast perpetually shut up with one in the house. And that you may learn that this greatly troubled them, Mark said, Mark 10:10 to show it, that they spoke to Him privately.
