This was fit and proper for Paul to say, but we dare not say it, conscious as we are of numberless faults. Wherefore for him the ever vigilant, ever at hand, the man enduring all things for the sake of the salvation of his disciples, it was fit and proper to say this: but we must say that of Moses, The Lord was angry with me for your sakes Deuteronomy 3:26, because ye lead us also into many sins. For when we are dispirited at seeing you make no progress, is not the greater part of our strength struck down? For what, I ask you has been done? Lo! By the grace of God we also have now passed the space of three years, not indeed night and day exhorting you, but doing this, often every third day, or every seventh. What more has come of it? We accuse, we rebuke, we weep, we are in anguish, although not openly, yet in heart. But those (inward) tears are far more bitter than these (outward ones): for these indeed bring a kind of relief to the feelings of the sorrowful, whereas those aggravate it, and bind it fast. Since when there is any cause of grief, and one cannot give vent to the sorrow, lest he should seem to be vainglorious, think what he suffers! Were it not that people would tax me with excessive love of display, you would see me each day shedding fountains of tears: but to those my chamber is witness, and my hours of solitude. For believe me I have (at times) despaired of my own salvation, but from my mourning on your account, I have not even leisure to bemoan my own evils: so entirely are you all in all to me. And whether I perceive you to be advancing, then, for very delight, I am not sensible of my own evils: or whether I see you not advancing, such is my grief, I again dismiss my own cares from my thoughts: brightening up on account of your good things, though I myself have evils without number, and saddened on account of your painful things, though my own successes are without number. For what hope is there for the teacher, when his flock is destroyed? What kind of life, what kind of expectation is there for him? With what sort of confidence will he stand up before God? What will he say? For grant that he has nothing laid to his charge, has no punishment to suffer, but is pure from the blood of all men: yet even so will he suffer a grief incurable: since fathers also though they be not liable to be called to account for their children's sins, nevertheless have grief and vexation. And this profits them nothing, nor shields them (προίσταται). For it is they that watch for our souls, as those that must give account. Hebrews 13:17 This seems to be a fearful thing: to me this gives no concern after your destruction. For whether I give account, or not, it is no profit to me. Might it be, that you were saved, and I to give account because of you: ye saved, and I charged with not having fulfiled my part! For my anxiety is not that you should be saved through me as the means, but only that you should be saved, no matter by what person as the instrument. You know not the pangs of spiritual childbirth, how overpowering they are; how he who is in travail with this birth, would rather be cut into ten thousand pieces, than see one of those to whom he has given birth perishing and undone. Whence shall we persuade you? By no other argument indeed, but by what has been done, in all that regards you we shall clear ourselves. We too shall be able to say, that in nothing have we shrunk from declaring to you the whole truth: nevertheless we grieve: and that we do grieve, is manifest from the numberless plans we lay and contrivances we devise. And yet we might say to ourselves, What matters it to me? I have done my part, I am pure from (their) blood: but this is not enough for comfort. If we could tear open our heart, and show it to you, you would see with what largeness it holds (you) within it, both women and children and men; for such is the power of love, that it makes the soul more spacious than the heaven. Receive us, says (Paul): we have wronged no man, you are not straitened in us. 2 Corinthians 7:2; 6:12 He had all Corinth in his heart, and says, You are not straitened: be ye also enlarged 2 Corinthians 6:13; but I myself could not say this, for I well know, that you both love me and receive me. But what is the profit either from my love or from yours, when the things pertaining to God thrive not in us? It is a ground for greater sorrow, an occasion of worse mischief (λύμης, al. λύπης). I have nothing to lay to your charge: for I bear you record, that, if it had been possible, you would have plucked out your own eyes, and have given them to me. Galatians 4:15 We yearn not only to give you the Gospel, but also our own souls. 1 Thessalonians 2:8 We are loved and we love (you): but this is not the question. But let us love Christ, for the first commandment is, You shall love the Lord your God: and the second is like it, And your neighbor as yourself. Matthew 22:37-39 We have the second, we need the first: need the first, exceedingly, both I and you. We have it, but not as we ought. Let us love Him: ye know how great a reward is laid up for them that love Christ: let us love Him with fervor of soul, that, enjoying his goodwill, we may escape the stormy waves of this present life, and be found worthy to obtain the good things promised to them that love Him, through the grace and mercy of His only-begotten Son, with whom to the Father, together with the Holy Ghost, be glory, might, honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

Do you mark how he terrifies them, and troubled and afflicted as their souls are, how hard he rubs them (ἐ πιτρίβει)? But it was necessary. For I have not shunned, he says, to declare unto you all the counsel of God.

[Paul] is about to say something more burdensome, that is, “I am innocent of the blood of all of you.” With this he prepares them and shows that nothing is lacking. Since he was about to place upon them the entire burden with all its weight, he first appeases their feelings by saying, “And now, behold, I know that you will see my face no more.” He then adds, “I am innocent of the blood of all of you.” The pain is twofold: one, to see his face no more; two, that this applies to all of them. For he says, “All you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.” Therefore it is natural that “I testify to you,” since I will no longer be here, “that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.” Do you see how he frightens them and crushes their souls, troubled and afflicted as they are? But this was necessary. “For I did not shrink,” he says, “from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.” So it is he who does not speak who is responsible for the blood, that is, for the murder. Nothing could be more terrifying than this. He shows that they too, if they do not act, are responsible for the blood. So although he seems to be justifying his own actions, he is, in fact, putting fear into them.
