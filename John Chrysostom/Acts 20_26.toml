[Paul] is about to say something more burdensome, that is, “I am innocent of the blood of all of you.” With this he prepares them and shows that nothing is lacking. Since he was about to place upon them the entire burden with all its weight, he first appeases their feelings by saying, “And now, behold, I know that you will see my face no more.” He then adds, “I am innocent of the blood of all of you.” The pain is twofold: one, to see his face no more; two, that this applies to all of them. For he says, “All you among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom will see my face no more.” Therefore it is natural that “I testify to you,” since I will no longer be here, “that I am innocent of the blood of all of you, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.” Do you see how he frightens them and crushes their souls, troubled and afflicted as they are? But this was necessary. “For I did not shrink,” he says, “from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.” So it is he who does not speak who is responsible for the blood, that is, for the murder. Nothing could be more terrifying than this. He shows that they too, if they do not act, are responsible for the blood. So although he seems to be justifying his own actions, he is, in fact, putting fear into them.
