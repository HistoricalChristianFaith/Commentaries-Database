Then too he gives him to understand why, turning from him, he addressed his speech to the king: "For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from him: for this thing was not done in a corner." He shows, that the king knows all perfectly; at the same time, all but saying to the Jews, And ye indeed ought to have known these things-for this is the meaning of that which he adds, "For this thing was not done in a corner."
