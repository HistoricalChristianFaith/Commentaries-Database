"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the Spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John." If this man knew only the baptism of John, how is it that he was "fervent in the Spirit," for the Spirit was not given in that way? It seems to me that this was one of the hundred and twenty who were baptized with the Apostles: or, if not so, then the same that took place in the case of Cornelius, took place also in the case of this man. Though not knowing all, by his zeal he attracted the Holy Spirit, in the same manner as Cornelius and his company.
