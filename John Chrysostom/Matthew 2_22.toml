Do you perceive the alternation between relief and danger? Joseph left foreign territory and returned to his ancestral land, discovering the slaughter of the children in the process. Having left his household in Bethlehem, he again discovers remnants of his first dangers. He finds that the son of the tyrant is alive and ruling as king. And how was it possible that Archelaus should be king of Judea, when Pontius Pilate was in charge? Herod’s death had recently occurred, and the kingdom had not yet been divided. But no sooner had Herod died than his son took power in his father’s place.… But if Joseph had feared to make his way to Judea, they say, on account of Archelaus, he ought to have been equally wary of Galilee on account of Herod Antipas. But let us leave unexamined for now the rest of the question as to whether he changed his place of residence, for his every impulse led away from Bethlehem and its confines.

After the slaughter of the children occurred, the young Archelaus was under the impression that everything else had been taken care of. Both the children in Bethlehem had been eliminated and the one they were seeking to kill. But once he saw how his father had lost his life, Archelaus became most conscious of the precedent and much more diligent in contending with lawlessness. Therefore Joseph left Judea for Nazareth, both in flight from the danger and at the same time out of love for his home country. And that he might be more confident, he received a divine pronouncement from the messenger about it.
