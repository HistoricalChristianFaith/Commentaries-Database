4. "But Christ having come an High Priest of good things that have come  by a greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands." Here he means the flesh. And well did he say, "greater and more perfect," since God The Word and all the power of The Spirit dwells therein; "For God gives not the Spirit by measure [unto Him]." [John 3:34] And "more perfect," as being both unblamable, and setting right greater things.

"That is, not of this creation." See how [it was] "greater." For it would not have been "of the Spirit" [Matthew 1:20], if man had constructed it. Nor yet is it "of this creation"; that is, not of these created things, but spiritual, of  the Holy Ghost.

Do you see how he calls the body tabernacle and veil and heaven.  "By a greater and more perfect tabernacle. Through the veil, that is, His flesh." [Hebrews 10:20] And again, "into that within the veil." [Hebrews 6:19] And again, "entering into  the Holy of Holies, to appear before the face of God." [Hebrews 9:24] Why then does he this? According as one thing or a different one is signified. I mean for instance, the Heaven is a veil, for as a veil it walls off the Holy of Holies; the flesh [is a veil] hiding the Godhead;  and the tabernacle likewise holding the Godhead. Again, Heaven [is] a tabernacle: for the Priest is there within.

"But Christ" (he says) "having come an High Priest": he did not say, "become," but "having come," that is, having come for this very purpose, not having been successor to another. He did not come first and then become [High Priest], but came and became at the same time.  And he did not say "having come an High Priest" of things which are sacrificed, but "of good things that have come," as if his discourse had not power to put the whole before us.

Well did he say, “greater and more perfect tent,” since God the Word and all the power of the Spirit dwells therein, “for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit.” “More perfect,” as being both without blame and setting right greater things. “That is, not of this creation”—see how it was greater, for it would not have been “of the Spirit,” if humankind had constructed it. Nor yet is it “of this creation,” that is, not of these created things, but spiritual, of the Holy Spirit.See how he calls the body tent and curtain and heaven: “Through the greater and more perfect tent.” “Through the curtain, that is, through his flesh.” And again, “into the inner shrine behind the curtain.” And again, “entering into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God.” Why then does he say this? In accordance with whether one thing or another is signified. I mean, for instance, the heaven is a curtain, for as a curtain it walls off the Holy of Holies; the flesh is a curtain hiding the Godhead; and the tent likewise holds the Godhead. Again, heaven is a tent, for the priest is there within.
