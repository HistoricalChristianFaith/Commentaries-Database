Our admonitions are best accompanied by praises. Only in this way are they welcomed. So we call those we are exhorting to that level of zeal of which they are capable of exhibiting. For they become welcome when we call those whom we are exhorting to compete with themselves. This is what Paul does here, and note how wisely. “So, my beloved,” he says. He does not say simply “you obey.” Rather he first praises them and says “just as you have always obeyed,” as if to say, “I am urging you to imitate not others but yourselves.”

“At that time you seemed to be doing everything for the sake of honoring and respecting me, but now no longer. If then it proves that you now continue, it is proved then also that you did it not for my sake but for God’s.”

What do you want? Tell us. Not “that you should hear me” but that “with fear and trembling you should work out your own salvation.” For without fear no one can accomplish anything noble or remarkable.… If the goods of life cannot be attained without fear, how much more true is this of spiritual ones? For tell me, whoever learned letters without fear? Who became skilled in a craft without fear? But if the devil does not best us there but only lethargy oppresses us, we needed all that fear merely to overcome our natural lethargy. Here, where the war is so great and impediments so many, how can we be saved without fear?
