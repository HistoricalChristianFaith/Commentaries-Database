You see, since he had reached extreme old age, the text says, he wished to preserve Isaac from association with the Canaanites, lest he take a wife from among them. So he summoned the more prudent of his servants, the text says, and gave him the following instructions: “Place your hand under my thigh.” In Greek the verse is written this way: “under my thigh”; whereas in Hebrew it says “under my loins.” Why did he speak in this fashion? It was an idiom of people in the past. But on other grounds it was also because the birth of Isaac takes its origin from there.For you to learn that the action was done according to a certain custom, notice that when he was ordering him to put his hand there, he immediately added, “and I will make you swear by the Lord, the God of heaven and the God of earth.” See how he teaches the servant to recognize the Creator of all things. By saying, “the God of heaven and the God of earth,” he encompassed all creation.
