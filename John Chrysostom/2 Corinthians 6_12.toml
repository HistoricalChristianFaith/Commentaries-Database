"Ye are not straitened in us, but ye are straitened in your own affections." And this reproof, see it administered with forbearance, as is the wont of such as love exceedingly. He did not say, 'ye do not love us,' but, 'not in the same measure,' for he does not wish to touch them too sensibly. 'You receive one,' he says, 'but I a whole city, and so great a population.' And he said not, 'ye do not receive us,' but, 'ye are straitened;' implying indeed the same thing but with forbearance and without touching them too deeply.
