Indeed it behoved them then to watch, but He said this to show that the prospect of coming evils was more than they would bear, that He had no need of their aid, and that it must needs be that He should be delivered up.

The words, the hour is at hand, point out that all that has been done was by Divine interference; and that, into the hands of sinners, show that this was the work of their wickedness, not that He was guilty of any crime.

Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.” All this belongs to the divine economy. “Into the hands of sinners” is said to make it clear that he was not liable to any charge but that this course of events was due to human wickedness. Finally he says, “Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand.” By all these means he was teaching them that this course of events was not something that happens of necessity, without human willing or out of human weakness. It is all unfolding, without denying freedom, as God’s own secret dispensation. Even though he foreknew that Judas would come, so far was he from fleeing, he even went to meet him.
