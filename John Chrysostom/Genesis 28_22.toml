See the good man’s gratitude: In making his request Jacob did not bring himself to ask for anything lavish—just bread and clothing. On the other hand, he promised to the Lord what lay within his power, realizing God’s generosity in giving and the fact that he surpasses our expectations in rewarding us. And so he said, “I will consider the monument God’s house, and of all the things provided me by you I will set aside a tenth.” Do you see his godly attitude? He still had not received anything, and yet he promised to devote to God a tenth of what was due to be given him. Let us not pass idly by these words, dearly beloved. Instead, may we all imitate this good man, we in the age of grace imitating this man who lived before the law, and let us ask the Lord for nothing of this world. After all, he does not wait for a reminder from us. Even if we don’t ask, he grants us what we need. “He makes the sun rise on evil people and good, and rains on just and unjust.” Let us believe him as he advises us in these words, “Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things will come to you in addition.” Do you see that he personally has made the former things ready for us and promises to give the latter as a bonus? Accordingly, don’t request as an initial favor what you are likely to receive as a bonus, thus reversing the due order. Instead, let us seek the former things, as he directed, so that we may come to enjoy the former and the latter.
