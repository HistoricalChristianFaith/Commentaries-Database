"Which" (he says) "was established  as a figure for the time then present."  What does he mean by "the time present"? That before the coming of Christ: For after the coming of Christ, it is no longer a time present: For how [could it be], having arrived, and being ended?

There is too something else which he indicates, when he says this, "which [was] a figure for the time then present," that is, became the Type. "In which  were offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience." You see now what is [the meaning of] "The Law made nothing perfect," [Hebrews 7:19,] and "If that first [covenant] had been faultless." [Hebrews 8:7] How? "As pertaining to the conscience." For the sacrifices did not put away  the defilement from the soul, but still were concerned with the body: "after the law of a carnal commandment." [Hebrews 7:16] For certainly they could not put away  adultery, nor murder, nor sacrilege. Do you see? You have eaten this, You have not eaten that, which are matters of indifference. ["Which stood] only in meats and drinks, and various washings." "You have drunk this," he says: and yet nothing has been ordained concerning drink, but he said this, treating them as trifles.
