God allowed us to dispose of great things and reserved smaller things for himself. Bodily nourishment belongs exclusively to him, because only he can control the rain and the seasons. But spiritual nourishment he has entrusted to us, since by our own will we can decide whether our fruit will be abundant or not.

Not that you may consume it upon things not fitting, but upon such as bring much thanksgiving to God. For God made us to have the disposal of great things, and reserving to Himself that which is less yielded to us that which is greater. For corporeal nourishment is at His sole disposal, but mental He permitted to us; for we have it at our own disposal whether the crops we have to show be luxuriant. For no need is here of rains and of variety of seasons, but of the will only, and they run up to heaven itself. And largeness in giving is what he here calls liberality. Which works through us thanksgiving to God. For neither is that which is done almsgiving merely, but also the ground of much thanksgiving: yea rather, not of thanksgiving only, but of many other things besides. And these as he goes on he mentions, that by showing it to be the cause of many good works, he may make them thereby the forwarder.

2. What then are these many good works?
