You are intentionally to seek out honorable persons. You are not then to move from house to house, looking constantly for better fare, which would vex those who would be receiving you and give you the reputation of gluttony and self-indulgence. This seems evident in his saying, “And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it, and stay with him until you depart.”
