Laughing at him for his shamelessness. As long as he belonged to the band of disciples he dared not spring upon him, but attacked  him from without; but when Christ made him manifest and separated him, then he sprang upon him without fear. It was not fitting to keep within one of such a character, and who so long had remained incorrigible. Wherefore He henceforth cast him out, and then that other seized him when cut off, and he leaving them went forth by night. 

Jesus says unto him, Friend,  that you do, do quickly.
