Laughing at him for his shamelessness. As long as he belonged to the band of disciples he dared not spring upon him, but attacked  him from without; but when Christ made him manifest and separated him, then he sprang upon him without fear. It was not fitting to keep within one of such a character, and who so long had remained incorrigible. Wherefore He henceforth cast him out, and then that other seized him when cut off, and he leaving them went forth by night. 

Jesus says unto him, Friend,  that you do, do quickly.

Let no one … be a deceiver, no one full of evil, no one holding venom in his mind, lest his partaking lead to condemnation. After Judas took what was offered, the devil hastened into him, not because the devil despised the Lord’s body but because he despised Judas for his shamelessness. Thus you may learn concerning those who partake unworthily of the divine mysteries, that these especially are the ones the devil invades and enters at once, just like he did to Judas of old. Honors, indeed, are of benefit to those who are worthy, but those who enjoy them without deserving them are propelled into greater retribution. I say these things not to frighten but to protect you.
