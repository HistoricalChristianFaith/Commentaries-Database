In my opinion, he has placed at this stage a cloud over this righteous man in order to raise his thoughts and to persuade him that “that voice” came “from above,” as [in the case] of the “mercy seat placed upon the ark of alliance.” Since the cloud is a symbol of heaven, it is as if God wanted to place heaven itself over Job, as if he had moved his throne near him. This is what also happened, it seems to me, “on the mountain,” when “the cloud” settled on it, so that we might learn that “the voice came from above.” Let us listen carefully, because it is the common Master of the universe who speaks. Let us see how he exhorts Job. Does he do it with the same vehemence of humankind? Not at all. Now we find a very clear solution to all the previous, disquieting questions, dear friends, which Job asked and to which we have tried to find a solution.
