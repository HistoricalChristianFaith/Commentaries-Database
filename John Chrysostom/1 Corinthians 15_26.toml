"The last enemy that shall be abolished is death."

How the last? After all, after the devil, after all the other things. For so in the beginning also death came in last; the counsel of the devil having come first, and our disobedience, and then death. Virtually then indeed it is even now abolished: but actually, at that time.

In the beginning death entered last, after the counsel of the devil and our disobedience. Similarly, death will be the last thing to be destroyed.
