Paul having discoursed much concerning widows, and having settled the age at which they were to be admitted, saying, Let not a widow be taken into the number under threescore years old, and having described the qualifications of a widow, If she have brought up children, if she have lodged strangers, if she have washed the Saints' feet, proceeds now to say, But the younger widows refuse. But concerning virgins, though the case of their falling is a much more gross one, he has said nothing of this kind, and rightly. For they had enrolled themselves on higher views, and the work with them proceeded from a greater elevation of mind. Therefore the receiving of strangers, and the washing of the Saints' feet, he has represented by attending upon the Lord without distraction 1 Corinthians 7:34-35, and by saying, The unmarried cares for the things that belong to the Lord. 1 Corinthians 7:34-35 And if he has not limited a particular age for them, it is most likely because that point is settled by what he has said in this case. But indeed, as I said, the choice of virginity proceeded from a higher purpose. Besides, in this case there had been falls, and thus they had given occasion for his rule, but nothing of that kind had occurred among the virgins. For that some had already fallen away is plain, in that he says, When they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; and again, For some have already turned aside after Satan.

The younger widows refuse, for when they have begun to wax wanton against Christ, they will marry; that is, when they have become scornful and luxurious. For as in the case of a just man, we might say, Let her depart, for she has become another's. He shows therefore that though they chose widowhood, it was not the choice of their judgment. So then a widow, by the state of widowhood, is espoused to Christ. For He has said, I am the defender of the widows and the father of the orphans. Psalm 68:5 He shows that they do not choose widowhood as they ought, but wax wanton: however he bears with them. Elsewhere indeed he says, I have espoused you to one husband, that I may present you as a chaste virgin to Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:2 After having given their names to Him, they will marry, he says, having condemnation, because they have cast off their first faith. By faith he means, fidelity to their covenant. As if he had said, They have been false to Christ, they have dishonored Him, and transgressed His covenant. And withal they learn to be idle.

Why then, you ask, did Paul forbid young women to remain as widows even if they were willing? â€¦ Do you not see that it is not those who wish to keep their widowhood but rather those who prefer to marry after being widowed whom he forbids to remain as widows and to be appointed to that holy company? And he does so very wisely. For if you should intend to engage in second marriages, he says, do not profess widowhood. For breaking a promise is much worse than not promising at all.

Paul himself has condemned women who chose widowhood but then do not desire to abide by their decision.
