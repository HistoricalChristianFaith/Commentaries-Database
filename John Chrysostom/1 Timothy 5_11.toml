Paul himself has condemned women who chose widowhood but then do not desire to abide by their decision.

Why then, you ask, did Paul forbid young women to remain as widows even if they were willing?â€¦ Do you not see that it is not those who wish to keep their widowhood but rather those who prefer to marry after being widowed whom he forbids to remain as widows and to be appointed to that holy company? And he does so very wisely. For if you should intend to engage in second marriages, he says, do not profess widowhood. For breaking a promise is much worse than not promising at all.
