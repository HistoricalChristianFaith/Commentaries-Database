Then that they might not say, You are subjecting us to men, He added, And unto God the things that are God's. For it is possible both to fulfill to men their claims and to give unto God the things that are due to God from us. Wherefore Paul also says, Render unto all their dues; tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom, fear to whom fear. Romans 13:7

But you, when you hear, Render unto Cæsar the things which are Cæsar's, know that He is speaking only of those things, which are no detriment to godliness; since if it be any such thing as this, such a thing is no longer Cæsar's tribute, but the devil's.
