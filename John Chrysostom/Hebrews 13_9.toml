"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines." Not "with strange doctrines" only, but neither with "divers ones."

"For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein." Here he gently hints at those who introduce the observance of "meats." For by Faith all things are pure. There is need then of Faith, not of "meats."

"Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines." "Strange," that is, different from those ye heard from us; "Divers" that is, of all sorts: for they have no stability, but are different one from another. For especially manifold is the doctrine of meats.

"For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not with meats." These are the "divers," these the "strange" doctrines: especially as Christ has said, "not that which entereth into the mouth defileth the man, but that which cometh out." (Matt. xv. 11.) And observe that he does not make bold to say this openly, but as it were by a hint. "For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats."

Faith is all. If that establishes it, the heart stands in security. It follows that Faith establishes: consequently reasonings shake. For Faith is contrary to reasoning.

"Which" (he says) "have not profited them that have been occupied therein." For what is the gain from the observance of them, tell me. Does it not rather destroy? Does it not make such an one to be under sin? If it be necessary to observe them, we must guard ourselves.

"Which" (he says) "have not profited them that have been occupied therein." That is, who have always diligently kept them.

There is one observance, abstaining from sin. For what profit is it, when some are so polluted, as not to be able to partake of the sacrifices? So that it did not save them at all; although they were zealous about the observances. But because they had not faith, even thus they profited nothing.
