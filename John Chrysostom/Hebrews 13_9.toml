For it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace, not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein. Here he gently hints at those who introduce the observance of meats. For by Faith all things are pure. There is need then of Faith, not of meats.

Not “with strange teachings” only, but neither with “diverse ones.” “For it is well that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited their adherents.” Here he gently hints at those who introduce the observance of “foods.” For by faith all things are pure. There is need then of faith, not of “foods.”

Who … can preserve grace by prideful conduct? How then will grace, that is, good pleasure or the energy of the spirit, be with you, unless you embrace it by good deeds? Indeed, the very cause of all good things is our constant abiding in the grace of the Spirit, for he guides us to everything.
