See how this blessed man pleads with the Philippians concerning the things that are to their own advantage. For when he is counseling them about concord, the cause of all good things, what does he say? See how elegantly, how energetically he speaks, with what fellow feeling! “If there is any encouragement in Christ.” It is as though he were saying: “If you take comfort in Christ and if you take any account of me, if you have any thought for me personally, if you have received any good from me, listen to this carefully.” We use this way of speaking when we are making a request about a matter that we take to have the highest priority.
