He is here alluding to the blessings of the Jews ; for that was blessing also, but it was not spiritual blessing. For how did it run? "The Lord bless you, He will bless the fruit of your body;" [Deuteronomy 7:13] and "He will bless your going out and your coming in." [Deuteronomy 28:4] But here it is not thus, but how? "With every spiritual blessing." And what do you lack yet? You are made immortal, you are made free, you are made a son, you are made righteous, you are made a brother, you are made a fellow-heir, you reign with Christ, you are glorified with Christ; all things are freely given you. "How," says he, "shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" [Romans 8:32] Your First-fruits is adored by Angels, by the Cherubim, by the Seraphim! What do you lack yet? "With every spiritual blessing." There is nothing carnal here. Accordingly He excluded all those former blessings, when He said, "In the world you have tribulation," [John 16:33] to lead us on to these. For as they who possessed carnal things were unable to hear of spiritual things, so they who aim at spiritual things cannot attain to them unless they first stand aloof from carnal things.

What again is "spiritual blessing in the heavenly places?" It is not upon earth, he means, as was the case with the Jews. "You shall eat the good of the land." [Isaiah 1:19] "Unto a land flowing with milk and honey." [Exodus 3:8] "The Lord shall bless your land." [Deuteronomy 7:13] Here we have nothing of this sort, but what have we? "If a man love Me, he will keep My word, and I and My Father will come unto him, and make our abode with him." [John 14:23] "Every one therefore which hears these words of Mine, and does them, shall be likened unto a wise man which built his house upon the rock, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house, and it fell not, for it was founded upon the rock."  [Matthew 7:24-25] And what is that rock but those heavenly things which are above the reach of every change? "Every one therefore who," says Christ, "shall confess Me before men, him will I also confess before My Father which is in Heaven: But whosoever shall deny Me, him will I also deny." [Matthew 10:32-33] Again, "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God." [Matthew 5:8] And again, "Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of Heaven." [Matthew 5:3] And again, "Blessed are you which are persecuted for righteousness sake, for great is your reward in Heaven." [Matthew 5:11-12] Observe, how every where He speaks of Heaven, no where of earth, or of the things on the earth.  And again, "Our citizenship is in Heaven, from whence also we wait for a Saviour the Lord Jesus Christ." [Philippians 3:20] And again, "Not setting your mind on the things that are on the earth, but on the things which are above." [Colossians 3:3]

"In Christ."

That is to say, this blessing was not by the hand of Moses, but by Christ Jesus: so that we surpass them not only in the quality of the blessings, but in the Mediator also. As moreover he says in the Epistle to the Hebrews; "And Moses indeed was faithful in all his house as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were afterward to be spoken; but Christ as a Son over His house, whose house are we." [Hebrews 3:5-6]

* Blessed be the God, he says, and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Observe; The God of Him that was Incarnate. And though you will not, The Father of God the Word.

* Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ.
