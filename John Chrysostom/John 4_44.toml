We read below that his country was, I suppose, Capernaum. Now, to demonstrate how he received no honor there, listen to what he says: “And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell.” He calls Capernaum his own country because he lived there most of the time and taught there. But someone might ask, “Don’t we usually see many admired among their own people?” This may be so, but we should not make such judgments on the basis of a few instances, because it is also true that while some have been honored in their own country, many more have been honored outside it, since familiarity generally breeds contempt.
