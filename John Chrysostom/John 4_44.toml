Wherefore is this added? Because He departed not unto Capernaum, but into Galilee, and thence to Cana. For that you may not enquire why He tarried not with His own people, but tarried with the Samaritans, the Evangelist puts the cause,  saying that they gave no heed unto Him; on this account He went not there, that their condemnation might not be the greater. For I suppose that in this place He speaks of Capernaum as His country. Now, to show that there He received no honor, hear Him say, And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shall be brought down to hell. Matthew 11:23 He calls it His own country, because there He set forth the Word of the Dispensation, and more especially dwelt upon it. What then, says some one, do we not see many admired among their kindred? In the first place such judgments must not be formed from rare instances; and again, if some have been honored in their own, they would have been much more honored in a strange country, for familiarity is wont to make men easily despised.

We read below that his country was, I suppose, Capernaum. Now, to demonstrate how he received no honor there, listen to what he says: “And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell.” He calls Capernaum his own country because he lived there most of the time and taught there. But someone might ask, “Don’t we usually see many admired among their own people?” This may be so, but we should not make such judgments on the basis of a few instances, because it is also true that while some have been honored in their own country, many more have been honored outside it, since familiarity generally breeds contempt.
