The speakers are those who, in some cases, distort the providence of God; in other cases they are people given over to pleasure, indulgence and luxury, notoriety and naked power. In their lives of such things as these they ask, Where are the good things from God? I am in poverty, and illness and hardship, at death’s door, the victim of contumely and abuse, while my neighbor enjoys the good life, luxury, influence, reputation and money. Some people look only for these things, bypassing things really worthwhile, as I say, virtue and a love of wisdom, whereas others, as I mentioned above, on those grounds distort the providence of God in asking, Where is God’s providence? Our lives are in such a mess, most of us are in need and poverty and at the end of our tether. What evidence is there of loving care? Those saying this, you see, behave exactly like someone struggling to see the sun in the unwavering brightness of midday and calling the light in question.
