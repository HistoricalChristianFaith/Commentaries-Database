No small thing is at stake here. The question is, if the apostles at this point consented to circumcision, why did Paul apply the term “false brothers” to those who also imposed circumcision in accordance with the sentiment of the apostles? First of all, it is one thing actively to impose an act and another passively to consent to it once done. For the one who zealously imposes it makes it necessary and paramount. But the one who, without imposing it, does not prevent the one who wants it, does not consent to it as a necessity but rather through passive consent seeks to accomplish other purposes. … Second, the apostles did this only in Judea, but the false apostles had gone about everywhere. They had all the Galatians in their grip.
