The Father of glory.

He has no name by which he may represent these things, and on all occasions calls them glory, which is in fact, with us, the name and appellation of every kind of magnificence. Mark, he says, the Father of glory; cf.Acts 7:2 but of Christ the God. What then? Is the Son inferior to the glory? No, there is no one, not even a maniac, would say so.

May give unto you,

That is, may raise and wing your understanding, for it is not possible otherwise to understand these things. For the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him. 1 Corinthians 2:14 So then, there is need of spiritual wisdom, that we may perceive things spiritual, that we may see things hidden. That Spirit reveals all things. He is going to set forth the mysteries of God. Now the knowledge of the mysteries of God, the Spirit alone comprehends, who also searches the deep things of Him. It is not said, that Angel, or Archangel, or any other created power, may give, that is, confer upon you a spiritual gift. And if this be of revelation, then is the discovery of arguments consequently vain. For he that has learned God, and knows God, shall no longer dispute concerning any thing. He will not say, This is impossible, and That is possible, and How did the other thing come to pass? If we learn God, as we ought to know Him; if we learn God from Him from whom we ought to learn Him, that is from the Spirit Himself; then shall we no longer dispute concerning any thing.

Two things he requires them to understand, as it is their duty to understand them; to what blessings they are called, and how they have been released from their former state. He says, however, himself, that these points are three. How then are they three? In order that we may understand touching the things to come; for from the good things laid up for us, we shall know His ineffable and surpassing riches, and from understanding who we were, and how we believed, we shall know His power and sovereignty, in turning again to Himself those who had been so long time estranged from Him, For the weakness of God is stronger than men. 1 Corinthians 1:25 Inasmuch as it is by the self-same power by which He raised Christ from the dead, that He has also drawn us to Himself. Nor is that power limited to the resurrection, but far exceeds it.

Glory is the name among us which denotes that which is most magnificent. The “Father of glory” means “the one who has given you these most extraordinary gifts.” Through his subordinate effects his glory is revealed. Everywhere in Scripture this name is applied to God: glory. .
