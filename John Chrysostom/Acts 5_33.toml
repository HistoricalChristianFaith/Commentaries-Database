“And they wanted to kill them.” Behold again these in perplexity and in pain, and those relaxed, in high spirits and joyous. Not only did they suffer pain, but also they were enraged. This then illustrates the proverb, “Do evil, suffer evil.” These men were in chains, they had come to be judged in court; but the men who sat in judgment were in danger, in perplexity, in great helplessness. For the person who strikes a blow on steel receives the force of the blow himself. And they saw that not only was [the apostles’] boldness of speech not stopped, but their preaching even increased, and they spoke without a thought of fear and yielded them no advantages.
