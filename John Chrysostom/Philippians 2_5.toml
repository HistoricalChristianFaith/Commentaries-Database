[[commentary]]
quote='''
Our Lord Jesus Christ, when urging his disciples to undertake great works, makes himself an example. … This too the blessed Paul does, bringing Christ before their eyes when he urges them to practice humility.… For nothing so sustains the great and philosophic soul in the performance of good works as learning that through this one is becoming like God.
