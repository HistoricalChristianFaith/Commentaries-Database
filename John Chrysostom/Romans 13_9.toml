He does not say merely it is fulfilled, but "it is briefly comprehended,"  that is, the whole work of the commandments is concisely and in a few words completed. For the beginning and the end of virtue is love. This it has for its root, this for its groundwork, this for its summit. If then it be both beginning and fulfilment, what is there equal to it? But he does not seek love merely, but intense love. For he does not say merely "love your neighbor," but, "as yourself." Hence also Christ said  that "the Law and the Prophets hang upon" it. And in making two kinds of love, see how He has raised this! For after saying that the first commandment is, "You shall love the Lord your God," He added a second;  and He did not stay, but added, "like it; You shall love your neighbor as yourself." What can be equal to this love to man, or this gentleness? That when we were at infinite distance from Him, He brings the love to us into comparison with that toward Himself, and says that "is like this." Hence then, to put the measures of either as nearly the same, of the one He says, "with all your heart, and with all your soul," but of this towards one's neighbor, He says, "as yourself." But Paul said, that when this did not exist even the other was of no great profit to us. As then we, when we are fond of any one, say, if you love him, then you love me; so He also to show this says, "is like it;" and to Peter, "If you love Me, feed My sheep." [John 21:16]

The beginning and the end of virtue is love.… But Paul is not looking merely for love; he wants it to be an intense love. For he does not say merely: “Love your neighbor,” but adds: “as yourself.” Christ himself said that the law and the prophets hang upon this.

Note that love has two excellent qualities: it abstains from evil and does good deeds.
