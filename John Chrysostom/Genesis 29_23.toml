Don’t idly pass by this sentence, either. Much can be understood from it. [First], there is Jacob’s simplicity in being deceived through his own ignorance of any wickedness; second, the fact that everything was conducted with such extreme decorum, no unnecessary display of lamps and dancers and torches, that Laban’s deception took effect. It is possible, however, to learn from this incident Laban’s affection for Jacob. You see, his purpose in devising this scheme was to keep the good man with him longer. I mean, he realized that Jacob was madly in love with one daughter and that, had he attained the object of his desire, he would then not have chosen to undergo servitude for the sake of Leah or reside with Laban. Hence, seeing Jacob’s virtue and realizing that he would not otherwise get the better of him or persuade him, he had recourse to this deception and gave him Leah with her maidservant Zilpah.

Do you see with how much solemnity they conducted weddings in ancient times? Take heed, you who are swept up in the excitement of satanic rituals and besmirch the solemnity of marriage at its very beginnings. Surely there’s no place for flutes? Surely there’s no place for cymbals? Surely there’s no place for satanic dances? Why is it, tell me, that you introduce such a nuisance into the house and call in people from the stage and the theater so as to undermine the girl’s chastity with this regrettable expenditure and make the young person shameless?
