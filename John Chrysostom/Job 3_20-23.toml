“Why is light given,” Job asks, “to those whose soul dwells in bitterness, and life to those souls who are in pain?” Again this is not the language—God forbid!—of someone who makes rebukes, but of someone who searches and suffers. In fact, when words are spoken with a different spirit, they must not be interpreted in the same manner. Therefore, when a philosopher asserts, “Why does a senseless person have riches at his disposal?” he only shows that he is unworthy of riches. From this we learn that not only life but also death is useful, when it is more desired than evil. In this way Job speaks of “those who long for death,” but, he says, “it does not come.” That is why the Preacher in Ecclesiastes says, “For everything there is a season” and, in another passage, “O death, how your memory is sweet.” When you hear Job’s wife suggesting to him, “Curse God, and die,” you should not suppose that he did not answer because of his love of life but because of his piety. Indeed he who considered death to be very desirable and saw it as a real goodness when he was allowed to obtain it did not dare speak against God. “Death is rest for man.” This is what Job declares. Now if death brings rest, why don’t the majority of people rush to it? Because God has made life desirable in order to prevent us from running to death. “Its way is hidden.” In my opinion Job is speaking about death, but by pretending that his words are about the way of humankind. This indicates that Job’s words concerning death are what has been said before, especially in the expression, “they dig for it more than for hidden treasures,” things that are evidently hidden. Our future is unknown, Job says. We do not uncover it. Please do not speak to me about those who hang themselves, because Job speaks about what conforms to nature and the commandments of God. “God has surrounded it,” he says, “with a wall.” As the gospel states, “The day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night.” To avoid the response, “Why do you not choose death?” Job answers, “The Lord has surrounded it with a wall.” Its doors are closed.
