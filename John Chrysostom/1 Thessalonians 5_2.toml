Do not place your confidence in your youth, nor think that you have a very fixed term of life, “For the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night.” On this account he has made our end invisible, so that we might demonstrate clearly our diligence and forethought. Do you not see men taken away prematurely day after day? On this account a certain one admonishes, “don’t delay in turning to the Lord, and don’t put things off from day to day,” lest at any time, while you delay, you are destroyed. Let the old man keep this admonition; let the young man heed this advice. Indeed, are you in insecurity, and are you rich, and do you abound in wealth, and does no affliction happen to you? Still hear what Paul says: “when they say peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them.” Affairs change often. We are not masters of our end. Let us be masters of virtue. Our Master Christ is loving.
