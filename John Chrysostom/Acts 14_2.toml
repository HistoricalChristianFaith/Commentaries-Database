"But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds evil affected against the brethren." Together with themselves now they took to stirring up the Gentiles too, as not being themselves sufficient. Then why did the Apostles not go forth thence? Why, they were not driven away, only attacked.

"Made their minds evil-affected," it says, "against the brethren": i.e. slandered the Apostles, raised numberless accusations against them: these people, being simple, they "made evil-affected," disposed them to act a malignant part.
