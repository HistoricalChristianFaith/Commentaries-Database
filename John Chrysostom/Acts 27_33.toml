Look, just as in a church, they are instructed by Paul’s true knowledge. He saved them from the midst of danger. It is part of the divine plan that Paul is disbelieved; he is to be believed only after he is tried in action. So this is what happened: he urges them to partake of nourishment again and persuades them. He himself is the first to partake, thus persuading them not only by word but also by action that the storm in no way harmed them but rather benefited their souls.

With the ship in danger and shipwreck awaiting, the prisoners were saved through Paul. Imagine what it would be like to have a holy man in a house. For many are the storms that assail us, even more fierce than those storms of nature. But God is able to forgive us, if only we obey the holy men as those in the ship did, if we do what they command. For they are not only saved but also carry the faith with them. Even if the holy man is a prisoner, he does greater things than those who are free. The centurion who was free needed his prisoner who was in chains, the skillful pilot needed him who was not a pilot, or rather, who was the true pilot. For it is not a vessel such as this that he steers but the church of the whole world (for he had learned from him who was also the master of the sea), and [Paul] does this not by the art of humankind but by the wisdom of the Spirit. In this vessel are many shipwrecks, many waves and spirits of wickedness, “conflicts on the outside, fears within.” That is why [Paul] is the true pilot.
