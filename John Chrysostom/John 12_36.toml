He tells them to become sons of light, that is, become my children. Yet in the beginning the Evangelist says these “were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, but of God,” that is, of the Father, while here Christ himself is said to beget them so that you may understand that the operation of the Father and the Son is One.

Why does he now “hide himself”? They did not take up stones against him, nor did they blaspheme him in any way as before. Why then did he hide himself? Walking in people’s hearts, he knew that their wrath was fierce, although they said nothing. He knew their wrath was boiling and murderous and did not wait until it broke into action, but rather he hid himself to mitigate their ill will.
