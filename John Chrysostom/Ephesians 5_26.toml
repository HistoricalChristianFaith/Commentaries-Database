So then she was unclean! So then she had blemishes, so then she was unsightly, so then she was worthless! Whatsoever kind of wife you shall take, yet shall you never take such a bride as the Church, when Christ took her, nor one so far removed from you as the Church was from Christ. And yet for all that, He did not abhor her, nor loathe her for her surpassing deformity. Would you hear her deformity described? Hear what Paul says, "For you were once darkness." [Ephesians 5:8] Did you see the blackness of her hue? What blacker than darkness? But look again at her boldness, "living," says he, "in malice and envy." [Titus 3:3] Look again at her impurity; "disobedient, foolish." But what am I saying? She was both foolish, and of an evil tongue; and yet notwithstanding, though so many were her blemishes, yet did He give Himself up for her in her deformity, as for one in the bloom of youth, as for one dearly beloved, as for one of wonderful beauty. And it was in admiration of this that Paul said, For scarcely for a righteous man will one die [Romans 5:7]; and again, "in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." [Romans 5:8] And though such as this, He took her, He arrayed her in beauty, and washed her, and refused not even this, to give Himself for her.
