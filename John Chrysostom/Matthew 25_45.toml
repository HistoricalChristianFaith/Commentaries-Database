Hom. lxxix: To this most sweet section of Scripture which we cease not continually to ponder, let us now listen with all attention and compunction of spirit, for Christ does indeed clothe this discourse with more terrors and vividness. He does not accordingly say of this as of the others, “The kingdom of heaven is like,” but shows of Himself by direct revelation, saying, “When the Son of man shall come in his majesty.”
“For all his Angels shall be with him” to bear witness to the things wherein they have administered to men’s salvation at His bidding.
Or, He calls the one sheep and the other goats, to denote the unprofitableness of the one, and the fruitfulness of the other, for sheep are greatly productive in fleece, milk, and lambs.
Then He separates them in place.
Observe that He says not ‘Receive,’ but “possess,” or “inherit,” as due to you from of old.
For what the Saints obtain the boon of this heavenly kingdom He shows when He adds, “I was an hungred, and ye gave me to eat.”
But if they are His brethren, why does He call them “the least?” Because they are lowly, poor, and outcast. By these He means not only the monks who have retired to the mountains, but every believer though he should be secular, though an hungred, or the like, yet He would have him obtain merciful succours, for baptism and communication of the Divine mysteries makes him a brother.
Observe how they had failed in mercifulness, not in one or two respects only, but in all; not only did they not feed Him when He was hungry, but they did not even visit Him when He was sick, which was easier. And look how light things He enjoins; He said not, “I was in prison,” and ye did not set me free, but, and “ye visited me not.” Also His hunger required no costly dainties, but necessary food.
Thus convicted by the words of the Judge, they make answer submissively, “Lord, when saw we thee”.
