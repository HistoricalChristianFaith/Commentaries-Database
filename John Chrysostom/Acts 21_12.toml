"And," what is the grievous part of the business, "deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem." Many even besought him not to depart, and still he would not comply. They said, "Adventure not thyself into the theatre, and he did not adventure": often they bore him off from dangers, and he complied: again he escaped by a window: and now, though numberless persons, so to say, beseech him, both those at Tyre and those at Caesarea, weeping also and predicting numberless dangers, he refuses to comply. And yet it is not merely, they predicted the dangers, but "said by the Spirit." If then the Spirit bade, why did he gainsay?
