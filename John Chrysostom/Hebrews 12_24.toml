"And to Jesus the mediator of the New Covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel." Did then the blood "of Abel" speak? "Yea," he saith, "and by it he being dead yet speaketh." And again God says, "The voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me." Either this meaning or that; because it is still even now celebrated: but not in such way as that of Christ. For this has cleansed all men, and sends forth a voice more clear and more distinct, in proportion as it has greater testimony, namely that by facts.

"And to Jesus the Mediator of the New Covenant: and to the blood of sprinkling," that is, of purification, "which speaketh better things than that of Abel." And if the blood speaks, much more does He who, having been slain, lives. But what does it speak? "The Spirit also" (he says) "speaketh with groanings which cannot be uttered." How does He speak? Whenever He falls into a sincere mind, He raises it up and makes it speak.
