(Hom. lxii. 1) His disciples say unto Him, Master, the Jews sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again? They feared both for Him, and for themselves; for they were not yet confirmed in faith.

"The Jews of late sought to stone Thee, and goest Thou thither again?" They therefore had feared for Him also, but for the more part rather for themselves; for they were not yet perfect. So Thomas, shaking with fear, said, "Let us go, that we also may die with Him," because Thomas was weaker and more unbelieving than the rest. But see how Jesus encourageth them by what He saith.
