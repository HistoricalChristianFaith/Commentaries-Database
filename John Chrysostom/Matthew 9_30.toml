Then after their cure He commands them to tell no man; neither does He merely command them, but with much strictness.

This command to silence is itself no light charge against the religious leadership. The eyes of these two men had been ruined. They then received faith by hearing alone. They themselves could now see this miracle. Ironically, however, having now sight to witness to what was happening, they were commanded to say nothing. You can hear their earnestness in their loud cries, in their pleading simply for mercy and in their supplications. So they called him Son of David, because that name was above all thought to be honorable, the name that the prophets called those whom they wished most to commend and declare great.
