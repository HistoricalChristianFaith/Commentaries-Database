Because he spoke as one greater than human beings, they said he had a devil.… They had said this many times. “Others said, ‘These are not the words of one who has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind?’ ” Since they could not silence their opponents by words, they now brought proof from his works. “Certainly neither are the words those of one that has a devil, and yet if you are not persuaded by the words, be persuaded by the works.” … Our Lord, having already given proof of who he was by his works, holds his peace because they were unworthy of an answer.… Indeed, as they disagreed among themselves, an answer was unnecessary. Their opposition only brought out, for our imitation, our Lord’s gentleness and long suffering.
