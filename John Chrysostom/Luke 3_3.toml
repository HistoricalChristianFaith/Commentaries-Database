Do you perceive how the prophet anticipated all by his words—the concourse of the people? Thus, when he says, “Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the rough ways shall be made smooth,” he is signifying the exaltation of the lowly, the humiliation of the selfwilled, the hardness of the law changed into easiness of faith. For it is no longer toils and labors, says he, but grace and forgiveness of sins, affording the way to salvation. Next he states the cause of these things, saying, “All flesh shall see the salvation of God.” No longer Jews and proselytes only, but also all earth and sea and the whole race of people may be saved. By “the crooked things” he signified our whole corrupt life, publicans, harlots, robbers and magicians, as many as having been perverted before, afterward walk in the right way. As Jesus himself likewise said, “Tax collectors and harlots go into the kingdom of God before you,” because they believed.

Thus the prophet wrote that he shall come saying, “Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.” And John himself said when he came, “Bring forth fruits consistent with repentance,” which corresponds with “prepare the way of the Lord.” See that both by the words of the prophet and by his own preaching, this one thing is manifested alone. John was to come, making a way and preparing beforehand, not bestowing the gift, which was the remission, but ordering in good time the souls of such as should receive the God of all.
