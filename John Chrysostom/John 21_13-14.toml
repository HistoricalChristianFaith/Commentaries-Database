Perhaps when you heard these things, you glowed and called those happy who were then with him along with those who shall be with him at the day of the general resurrection. Let us then make every effort so that we may see that admirable face. For if when now we hear, we are so enflamed, and desire to have been in those days that he spent upon earth, and to have heard his voice and seen his face and to have approached and touched and ministered unto him—consider how great a thing it will be to see him no longer in a mortal body or doing human actions but with a bodyguard of angels, being ourselves also in a form of unmixed purity, and beholding him and enjoying the rest of that bliss which surpasses all language. Therefore I beseech you, let us use every means so as not to miss such glory. For nothing is difficult if we are willing, nothing burdensome if we apply ourselves. “If we endure, we shall also reign with him.”
