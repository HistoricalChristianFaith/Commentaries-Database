What then does the Master say? “You ought to have invested my money with the banker.” You ought to have spoken to someone and received his advice and been admonished. Are the bankers bad people? That is not for you to say.What could be more gentle than this? Those who give money at interest keep close accounts on its repayment. But you have not done anything with it. You ought to have given it to someone else to work with and required them to report to you. I require it back with increase, that is, with some good works to boot. You ought to have done the easy part and left with someone else the part that is more difficult.
