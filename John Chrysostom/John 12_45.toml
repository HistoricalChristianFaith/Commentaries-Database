What then! Is God a body? By no means. The “seeing” of which he here speaks is that of the mind. This demonstrates the consubstantiality. And what does it mean when he says “he that believes on me”? It is as though one should say, “He that takes water from the river does not take it from the river but from the spring that supplies the river.”
