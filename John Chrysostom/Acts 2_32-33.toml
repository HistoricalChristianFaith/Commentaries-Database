"This Jesus" - observe how he does not call Him otherwise - "hath God raised up; whereof all we are witnesses. Being therefore by the right hand of God exalted": again he takes refuge with the Father, and yet it had been enough to say what precedes: but he knows what a great point this is. Here he has hinted at the Ascension also, and that Christ is in heaven: but neither does he say this openly. "And having received," says he, "the promise of the Holy Ghost." Observe how, in the beginning of his discourse, he does not say that Jesus Himself had sent It, but the Father: now, however, that he has mentioned His signs and the things done to Him by the Jews, and has spoken of His resurrection, he boldly introduces what he has to say about these matters, again adducing themselves as witnesses by both senses: "He hath shed forth this, which ye do see and hear." And of the resurrection he has made continual mention, but of their outrageous deed he has spoken once for all.

"And having received the promise of the Holy Ghost." This again is great. "The promise," he says; because promised before His Passion. Observe how he now makes it all His "He hath poured forth this", covertly making a great point. For if it was He that poured it forth, it is of Him that the Prophet has spoken above, "In the last days I will pour forth of My Spirit on My Servants, and on Mine handmaids, and I will do wonders in the heaven above." Observe what he secretly puts into it! But then, because it was a great thing, he again veils it with the expression of "His having received of the Father." He has spoken of the good things fulfilled, of the signs; has said, that He is king, the point that touched them; has said, that it is He that gives the Spirit.

"He hath poured it out," he says; not requiring worthiness: and not simply gave, but with abundance.
