This the Prophet puts in the beginning, that you might learn that that which is here said was according to the counsel of the Father. For he that is beloved does according to his will who loveth him. And again, he that is chosen, does not as an enemy break the lair, nor as one being an adversary of the legislator, but as one in agreement with Him. Because therefore He is beloved, "I will put my Spirit upon him.”.
Further, to show His lowliness, He says, “He shall not strive;” and so He was offered up as the Father had willed, and gave Himself willingly into the hands of His persecutors. “Neither shall he cry;” so He was dumb as a lamb before his shearer. “Nor shall any hear his voice in the streets.”.
The Lord sought to heal the Jews by this mildness. But though they rejected Him, yet He did not resist them by destroying them; whence the Prophet, displaying His power and their weakness, says, “A bruised reed he shall not break, and a smoking flax he shall not quench.”.
Or this, “He shall not break a bruised reed,” shows that it was as easy for Himto break them all, as to break a reed, and that a bruised reed. And, “He shallnot quench a smoking flax,” shows that their rage was fired, and that the power of Christ was strong to quench such rage with all readiness; hence in this isshewn the great mercy of Christ.
But one might say, What then shall these things be always thus? Will He endure for ever those who thus lay snares, and are mad against Him? Far from it; when His own work shall be all complete, then shall He work these things also. And this He signifies, saying, “Until he shall send forth judgment to victory;” as much as to say, When He shall have accomplished all things which are of Himself, then shall He bring in perfect vengeance; then shall they receive punishment when He has made his victory illustrious, that there be not left to the m any irreverent opportunity of contradiction.
But the things of this dispensation will not rest in this only, that they who have not believed should be punished, but He will also draw the world to Him; whence it follows, “And in his name shall the Gentiles hope.”

What then? Shall these things always be? And will He endure them perpetually, forming such frantic plots against Him? Far from it; but when He has performed His part, then shall He execute the other purposes also. For this He declared by saying Till He send forth judgment unto victory: and in His name shall the Gentiles trust. As Paul likewise says, Having in a readiness to revenge all disobedience, when your obedience is fulfilled.

But what is, when He sends forth judgment unto victory? When He has fulfilled all His own part, then, we are told, He will bring down upon them His vengeance also, and that a perfect vengeance. Then shall they suffer His terrors, when His trophy is gloriously set up, and the ordinances that proceed from Him have prevailed, and He has left them no plea of contradiction, however shameless. For He is wont to call righteousness, judgment.

But not to this will His dispensation be confined, to the punishment of unbelievers only, but He will also win to Himself the whole world. Wherefore He added, And in His name shall the Gentiles trust.

Then, to inform you that this too is according to the purpose of the Father, in the beginning the prophet had assured us of this likewise, together with what had gone before; saying, My well-beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. For of the well-beloved it is quite evident that He did these things also according to the mind of the beloved.
