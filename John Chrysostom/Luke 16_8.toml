Mark also that He said not, &#8220;that they may receive you into their own habitations.&#8221; For it isnot they who receive you. Therefore when He said, Make to yourselves friends, he added, of the mammon of unrighteousness, to show, that their friendship will not alone protect usunless good works accompany us, unless we righteously cast away all riches unrighteouslyamassed. The most skillful then of all arts is that of almsgiving. For it builds not for us houses of mud, but lays up in store an everlasting life. Now in each of the arts one needs the support of another; but when we ought to show mercy, we need nothing else but the will alone.
