See how far Aristarchus also accompanies Paul. To good and useful purpose is Aristarchus present, as he would take back the report of all to Macedonia. And Julius courteously entreated Paul, and gave him liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself. Julius gave Paul liberty, it says, acting courteously, that he might refresh himself; as it was but natural that he should be much the worse from his bonds and the fear, and the being dragged hither and there. See how the writer does not hide this either, that Paul wished to refresh himself. And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.

Aristarchus accompanies Paul for a while. He is fittingly and usefully present with the intention of reporting everything concerning him in Macedonia.
