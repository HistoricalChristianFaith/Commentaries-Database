And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go. It is likely the magistrates had learnt what had happened, and did not dare of themselves to dismiss them. And the keeper of the prison told these words to Paul, saying, the magistrates have sent to let you go: now therefore depart, and go in peace - that is, in safety, fearing no man.
