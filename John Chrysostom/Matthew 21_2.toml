Note carefully how many miracles occurred so quickly. Observe how many prophecies are fulfilled. For example, when he said, “You will find an ass” he foretold that no man should hinder them but that all, when they heard, should hold their peace.… He had already persuaded many who had never known him before to give up their own property and follow him. The Jews of Jerusalem were hardly persuaded, however, even though some of them were present with him when he worked his miracles.
