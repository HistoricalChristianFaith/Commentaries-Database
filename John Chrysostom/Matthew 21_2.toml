But do thou observe, I pray you, how many miracles are done, and how many prophecies are fulfilled. He said, You shall find an ass; He foretold that no man should hinder them, but that all, when they heard, should hold their peace.

But this is no small condemnation of the Jews, if them that were never known to Him, neither had appeared before Him, He persuades to give up their own property, and to say nothing against it, and that by His disciples, while these, being present with Him at the working of His miracles, were not persuaded.

Note carefully how many miracles occurred so quickly. Observe how many prophecies are fulfilled. For example, when he said, “You will find an ass” he foretold that no man should hinder them but that all, when they heard, should hold their peace.… He had already persuaded many who had never known him before to give up their own property and follow him. The Jews of Jerusalem were hardly persuaded, however, even though some of them were present with him when he worked his miracles.
