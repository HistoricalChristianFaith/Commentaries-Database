Ver. 15, 16. "Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? For I bear you witness, that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me. So then am I become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?"

Here he shows perplexity and amazement, and desires to learn of themselves the reason of their change. Who, says he, has deceived you, and caused a difference in your disposition towards me? Are you not the same who attended and ministered to me, counting me more precious than your own eyes? What then has happened? Whence this dislike? Whence this suspicion? Is it because I have told you the truth? You ought on this very account to pay me increased honor and attention; instead of which "I have become your enemy, because I tell you the truth,"â€” for I can find no other reason but this. Observe too what humbleness of mind appears in his defense of himself; he proves not by his conduct to them, but by theirs to him that his language could not possibly have proceeded from unkind feeling. For he says not; How is it supposable that one, who has been scourged and driven about, and ill-treated a thousand things for your sakes, should now have schemes against you? But he argues from what they had reason to boast of, saying, How can one who has been honored by you, and received as an Angel, repay you by conduct the very opposite?
