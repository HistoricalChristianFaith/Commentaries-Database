When Scripture wishes to show that God needs no one, it says that he has no counselor. When it wishes to show the equal honor of the Only Begotten, it calls the Son of God his counselor.

The Son of God is said to be the angel of great counsel because of his many other teachings, but especially because he revealed his Father to humankind.

Come now, and let me show you that the Son is called God. “Behold, the virgin shall be with child and shall give birth to a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which means, ‘God is with us.’ ” Did you see how both the name Lord is given to the Father and the name God is given to the Son? In the psalm, the sacred writer said, “Let them know that Lord is your name.” Here Isaiah says, “They shall call his name Immanuel.” And again, he says, “A child is born to us, and a son is given to us; and his name shall be called Angel of Great Counsel, God the Strong, the Mighty One.”
