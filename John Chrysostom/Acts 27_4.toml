Again trials, again contrary winds. See how the life of the saints is thus interwoven throughout: escaped from the court of justice, they fall in with shipwreck and storm. And when we had sailed over the sea of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia. And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing into Italy; and he put us therein.

See how God does not alter or change the order of nature but allows him to sail into unfavorable winds. But even so the miracle happens. To ensure that they sail safely, he did not allow them to go out to the open sea; they always sailed along the coast.
