As it was a mean looking house, they asked below, they inquired of the neighbors. And while Peter thought, the Spirit said unto him, Arise, get you down, and go, nothing doubting, for I have sent them. (v. 19, 20.) And he does not say, For to this end did the vision appear unto you; but, I have sent them. Then Peter went down

the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as (the Lord) suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity. His perplexity neither lasts long (when it did occur), nor (did it occur) before this, but just at the moment when they asked whether he were lodging there. While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek you. Arise therefore, and get you down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them. (supra, p. 142, and 145, note 7; v. 19, 20.) And this again is a plea for Peter in answer to the disciples, that he did doubt, and was instructed to doubt nothing. For I, says He, have sent them. Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God does, this the Spirit is said to do. Not so the Angel, but having first said, Your prayers and your alms have ascended, for a memorial before God, to show that he is sent from thence, then he adds, And now send men, etc.: the Spirit not so, but, For I have sent them. Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom you seek: what is the cause wherefore you have come? And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that fears God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for you into his house, and to hear words of you.
