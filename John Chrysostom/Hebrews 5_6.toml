"As He saith also in another place, Thou art a Priest forever after the order of Melchisedech." Unto whom now was this spoken?

Who is "after the order of Melchisedech"? No other than He. For they all were under the Law, they all kept sabbaths, they all were circumcised; one could not point out any other than Him.
