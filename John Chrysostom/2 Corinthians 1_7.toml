See how far they had advanced since Paul wrote his first epistle. Now his hope for them was unshaken by their behavior. Paul also tells them that if he has been comforted, they will be comforted as well. If the Corinthians regarded Paulâ€™s sufferings as their own, then his comfort would also be theirs. By saying this, Paul hoped that he would be able to encourage them and get them to accept his absence from them more easily.

"And our hope for you is steadfast." That is, though ye should suffer ills innumerable, we are confident that you will not turn round , either upon your own trials or upon our persecutions. For so far are we from suspecting you of being confounded on account of our sufferings that even when yourselves are in peril, we are then confident concerning you.

Do you see how great had been their advance since the former Epistle? For he has here witnessed of them far greater things than of the Macedonians, whom throughout that Epistle he extols and commends. For on their [the Macedonians'] account he feared and says, "We sent," unto you, "Timothy...to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith, that no man be moved by these afflictions, for yourselves know that hereunto we are appointed." [1 Thessalonians 3:2-3] And again: "For this cause when I could no longer forbear, I sent to know your faith, lest by any means the tempter has tempted you: and our labor should be in vain." [2 Corinthians 1:5] But of these [the Corinthians] he says nothing of this kind, but quite the contrary, "Our hope for you is steadfast."
