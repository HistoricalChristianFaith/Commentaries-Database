Abstaining then from curious questionings is glorifying God, as indulging in them is transgressing. But if by entering into curious questions, and searching out things below, we fail to glorify Him, much more if we be over curious in the matter of the Lord's generation, shall we suffer to the utmost for our insolence. For if the type of the resurrection is not to be searched into, much less those unutterable and awestriking subjects.  And he does not use the word "believed" merely, but, "being fully persuaded." For such a thing is faith, it is clearer than the demonstration by reasons, and persuades more fully. For it is not possible for another reasoning succeeding to it to shake  it afterwards. He indeed that is persuaded with words may have his persuasion altered too by them. But he that stays himself upon faith, has henceforward fortified his hearing against words that may do hurt to it. Having said then, that he was justified by faith, he shows that he glorified God by that faith; which is a thing specially belonging to a good life. For, "Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father Which is in heaven." [Matthew 5:16] But lo! This is shown also to belong to faith! Again, as works need power, so does faith. For in their case the body often shares the toil, but in the faith the well-doing belongs to the soul alone. And so the labor is greater, since it has no one to share the struggles with it. Do you observe how he shows that all that belonged to works attached to faith in a far greater degree, as having whereof to glory before God — requiring power and labor — and again, glorifying God? And after saying, that "what He had promised, He is able also to perform," he seems to me to speak beforehand of things to come. For it is not things present merely that He promises, but also things to come. For the present are a type of the other. It is then a sign of a weak, little, and pitiful mind not to believe. And so when any make faith a charge against us, let us make want of faith a charge against them in return, as pitiful, and little-minded, and foolish, and weak, and no better in disposition than asses. For as believing belongs to a lofty and high-born soul, so disbelieving does to a most unreasonable and worthless one, and such as is sunken drowsily (κατενηνεγμένης) into the senselessness of brutes. Therefore having left these, let us imitate the Patriarch, and glorify God as he gave Him glory. And what does it mean, gave Him glory? He held in mind His majesty, His boundless power. And having formed a just conception of Him, he was also "fully persuaded" about His promises.

Let us then also glorify Him by faith as well as by works, that we may also attain to the reward of being glorified by Him. "For them that glorify Me, I will glorify" [1 Samuel 2:30], He says: and indeed, if there were no reward, the very privilege of glorifying God were itself a glory. For if men take a pride in the mere fact of speaking eulogies of kings, even if there be no other fruit of it; consider how glorious it must be, that our Lord is glorified by us: as again, how great a punishment to cause Him to be by our means blasphemed. And yet this very being glorified, He wishes to be brought about for our sakes, since He does not need it Himself. For what distance do you suppose to be between God and man? As great as that between men and worms? Or as great as between Angels and worms? But when I have mentioned a distance even thus great, I have not at all expressed it: since to express its greatness is impossible. Would you, now, wish to have a great and marked reputation among worms? Surely not. If then thou that lovest glory, would not wish for this, how should He Who is far removed from this passion, and so much farther above us, stand in need of glory from you? Nevertheless, free from the want of it as He is, still He says that He desires it for your sake. For if He endured for your sake to become a slave, why wonder that He upon the same ground lays claim to the other particulars also? For He counts nothing unworthy of Himself which may be conducive to our salvation. Since then we aware of this, let us shun sin altogether, because by reason of it He is blasphemed. For it says, "flee from sin, as from the face of a serpent: if you come too near unto it, it will bite you" [Sirach 21:2]: for it is not it that comes to us, but we that desert to it. God has so ordered things that the Devil should not prevail over us by compulsion (Gr. tyranny): since else none would have stood against his might. And on this account He set him a distant abode, as a kind of robber and tyrant.  And unless he find a person unarmed and solitary for his assaults, he does not venture to attack him. Except he see us travelling by the desert,  he has not the courage to come near us. But the desert and place of the Devil is nothing else than sin. We then have need of the shield of faith, the helmet of salvation, the sword of the Spirit, not only that we may not get evil intreated, but that ever should he be minded to leap  upon us, we may cut off his head. Need we have of continual prayer that he may be bruised under our feet, for he is shameless and full of hardihood, and this though he fights from beneath. But yet even so he gets the victory: and the reason is, that we are not earnestly set upon being above his blows. For he has not even the power to lift himself very high, but he trails along upon the ground. And of this the serpent is a type. But if God set him in that rank from the beginning, much more will He now. But if you dost not know what fighting from beneath may be, I also will try to explain to you the manner of this war. What then may this fighting "from beneath" [John 8:23] be? It is standing upon the lower things of the world to buffet us, such as pleasure and riches and all the goods of this life. And for this reason, whoever he sees flying toward heaven, first, he will not even be able to leap so far. Secondly, even if he should attempt he will speedily fall. For he has no feet; be not afraid: he has no wings; fear not. He trails upon the earth, and the things of the earth. Do thou then have naught in common with the earth, and you will not need labor even. For he has not any knowledge of open fight: but as a serpent he hides him in the thorns, nestling evermore in the "deceitfulness of riches." [Matthew 13:22] And if you were to cut away the thorns, he will easily be put to flight, being detected:  and if you know how to charm him with the inspired charms he will straightway be struck. For we have, we surely have, spiritual charms, even the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the might of the Cross. This charm will not only bring the serpent out of his lurking places, and cast him into the fire [Acts 28:5], but even wounds it heals. But if some that have said this Name have not been healed, it came of their own little faith, and was not owing to any weakness in what they said. For some did throng Jesus and press Him [Luke 8:44-45], and got no good therefrom. But the woman with an issue, without even touching His Body, but merely the hem of His garment, stanched a flux of blood of so long standing. (So St. Aug. Serm. LXII. iii. 4, p. 124 O.T.) This Name is fearful alike to devils, and to passions, and to diseases. In this then let us find a pleasure, herewith let us fortify ourselves. It was thus Paul waxed great, and yet he was of the like nature with ourselves, so the whole choir of the Disciples. But faith had made him a perfectly different person, and so much did it abound in them, that even their garments had great force. [Acts 19:12] What excuse then shall we deserve, if even the shadows and the garments of those men drove off death [Acts 5:15], but our very prayers do not so much as bring the passions down? What is the reason  of it? Our temper is widely different. For what nature gives, is as much ours as theirs. For he was born and brought up just as we are, and dwelt upon the earth and breathed the air, as we do. But in other points he was far greater and better than we are, in zeal, in faith, and love. Let us then imitate him. Let us allow Christ to speak through us. He desires it more than we do: and by reason of this, He prepared this instrument, and would not have it remain useless and idle, but wishes to keep it ever in hand. Why then do you not make it serviceable for the Maker's hand, but let it become unstrung, and makest it relaxed through luxury, and unfittest the whole harp for His use, when you ought to keep the members  of it in full stretch, and well strung, and braced with spiritual salt.  For if Christ see our soul thus attuned, He will send forth His sounds even by it. And when this takes place, then shall you see Angels leaping for joy, (σκιρτὥντας) and Archangels too, and the Cherubim.

Let us then become worthy of His spotless hands. Let us invite Him to strike even upon our heart. For He rather needs not any inviting. Only make it worthy of that touch, and He will be foremost in running unto you. For if in consideration of their attainments not yet reached, He runs to them (for when Paul was not yet so advanced He yet framed that praise for him) when He sees one fully furnished, what is there that He will not do? But if Christ shall sound forth and the Spirit shall indeed light upon us, and we shall be better than the heaven, having not the sun and the moon fixed in our body, but the Lord of both sun and moon and angels dwelling in us and walking in us. And this I say, not that we may raise the dead, or cleanse the lepers, but that we may show forth what is a greater miracle than all these — charity. For wheresoever this glorious thing shall be there the Son takes up His abode along with the Father, and the grace of the Spirit frequents. For "where two or three are gathered together in My Name," it says, "there am I in the midst of them." [Matthew 18:20] Now this is for great affection, and for those that are very intimate friends, to have those whom they love on either side of them. Who then, he means, is so wretched as not to wish to have Christ in the midst? We that are at variance with one another! And haply some one may ridicule me and ask, What is it that you mean? Do you not see that we are all within the same walls, and under the same enclosure of the Church, standing under the same fold with unanimity; that no one fights, that we be under the same shepherd, crying aloud in common, listening in common to what is being said, sending up our prayers in common — and yet mention fighting and variance? Fighting I do mention, and I am not mad nor out of my sober mind. For I see what I see, and know that we are under the same fold, and the same shepherd. Yet for this cause I make the greater lamentation, because, though there are so many circumstances to draw us together, we are at variance. And what sedition, it will be said, see you here? Here truly I see none. But when we have broken up, such an one accuses such another, another is openly insulting, another grudges, another is fraudulent, and rapacious, and violent, another indulges in unlawful love, another frames countless schemes of deceit. And if it were possible to open your souls, then ye would see all things distinctly, and know that I am not mad. Do you not see in a camp, that when it is peace, men lay down their arms and cross over unarmed and undefended into the camp of the enemy, but when they are protected with arms, and with guards and outposts, the nights are spent in watching, and the fires are kept continually burning, this state of things is no longer peace but war? Now this is what may be seen among us. For we are on our guard against one another, and fear one another and talk each of us into his neighbor's ear. And if we see any one else present, we hold our peace, and draw in all we were going to say. And this is not like men that feel confidence, but like those that are strictly on their guard. "But these things we do (some one may say,) not to do wrong, but to escape having it done us." Yea, for this I grieve, that living as we do among brethren, we need be on our guard against having wrong done us; and we light up so many fires, and set guards and out-posts! The reason is the prevalence of falsehood, the prevalence of craft, the prevailing secession of charity, and war without truce. By this means one may find men that feel more confidence in Gentiles (Greeks) than in Christians. And yet, how ashamed we ought to be of this; how we ought to weep and bewail at it! "What then, some may say, is to become of me? Such and such an one is of ungainly temper, and vexatious." Where then is your religion (Gr. philosophy)? Where are the laws of the Apostles, which bid us bear one another's burdens? [Galatians 6:2] For if you have no notion of dealing well by your brother, when are you to be able to do so by a stranger? If you have not learned how to treat a member of your own self, when are you likely to draw to you any from without, and to knit him to yourself? But how am I to feel? I am vexed exceedingly almost to tears, for I could have sent forth large fountains from my eyes [Jeremiah 9:1], as that Prophet says, seeing as I do countless enemies upon the plain more galling than those he saw. For he said, upon seeing the aliens coming against them, "My bowels! I am pained at my bowels." [Jeremiah 4:19] But when I see men arrayed under one leader, yet standing against one another, and biting and tearing their own members, some for money's sake, and some for glory's, and others quite at random ridiculing and mocking and wounding one another in countless ways, and corpses too worse treated than those in war, and that it is but the bare name of the brethren that is now left, myself feel my inability to devise any lament fitting such a catastrophe as this! Reverence now, oh reverence, this Table whereof we all are partakers! [1 Corinthians 10:16-18] Christ, Who was slain for us, the Victim that is placed thereon! [Hebrews 13:10] Robbers when they once partake of salt, cease to be robbers in regard to those with whom they have partaken thereof; that table changes their dispositions, and men fiercer than wild beasts it makes gentler than lambs. But we though partakers of such a Table, and sharers of such food as that, arm ourselves against one another, when we ought to arm against him who is carrying on a war against all of us, the devil. Yet this is why we grow weaker and he stronger every day. For we do not join to form in defense against him, but along with him we stand against each other, and use him as a commander for such hostile arrays, when it is he alone that we ought to be fighting with. But now letting him pass, we bend the bow against our brethren only. What bows, you will say? Those of the tongue and the mouth. For it is not javelins and darts only, but words too, keener far than darts, that inflict wounds. And how shall we be able to bring this war to an issue? One will ask. If you perceive that when you speak ill of your brother, you are casting up mire out of your mouth, if you perceive that it is a member of Christ that you are slandering, that you are eating up your own flesh [Psalm 27:2], that you are making the judgment set for you more bitter (fearful and uncorrupt as it is), that the shaft is killing not him that is smitten, but yourself that shot it forth.

But he did you some wrong, maybe, and injured you? Groan at it, and do not rail. Weep, not for the wrong done you, but for his perdition, as your Master also wept at Judas, not because Himself was to be crucified, but because he was a traitor. Has he insulted you and abused you? Beseech God for him, that He may speedily become appeased toward him. He is your brother, he is a member of you, the fruit of the same pangs as yourself, he has been invited to the same Table. But he only makes fresh assaults upon me, it may be said. Then is your reward all the greater for this. On this ground then there is the best reason for abating one's anger, since it is a mortal wound that he has received, since the devil has wounded him. Do not thou then give a further blow, nor cast yourself down together with him. For so long as you stand you have the means of saving him also. But if you dash yourself down by insulting deeds in return, who is then to lift you both up? Will he that is wounded? Nay, for he cannot, now that he is down. But will you that are fallen along with him? And how shall you, that could not support your own self, be able to lend a hand to another? Stand therefore now nobly, and setting your shield before you, and draw him, now he is dead, away from the battle by your long-suffering. Rage has wounded him, do not thou also wound him, but cast out even that first shaft. For if we associate with each other on such terms, we shall soon all of us become healthful. But if we arm ourselves against one another, there will be no farther need even of the devil to our ruin. For all war is an evil, and civil war especially. But this is a sorer evil than even a civil one, as our mutual rights are greater than those of citizenship, yea, than of kindred itself. Of old, Abel's brother slew him and shed the blood of his kinsman. But this murder is more lawless than that, in that the rights of kinsmanship are greater, and the death a sorer evil. For he wounded the body, but you have whetted your sword against the soul. "But you first suffered ill." Yes, but it is not suffering ill, but doing it, that is really suffering ill. Now consider; Cain was the slayer, Abel was the slain. Who then was the dead? He that after death cries, (for He says, "The voice of your brother's blood cries to Me,") [Genesis 4:10], or he who while he lived was yet trembling and in fear? He was, assuredly he was, more an object of pity than any dead man. Do you see how to be wronged is better, though a man come even to be murdered? Learn that to wrong is worse, though a man should be strong enough even to kill. He smote and cast down his brother, yet the latter was crowned, the former was punished. Abel was made away with and slain wrongfully, but he even when dead accused [comp. John 5:45], and convicted and overcame: the other, though alive, was speechless, and was ashamed, and was convicted, and effected the opposite of what he intended. For he made away with him because he saw him beloved, expecting to cast him out of the love also. Yet he did but make the love more intense, and God sought him more when dead, saying, "Where is your brother Abel?" [Genesis 4:9] For you have not extinguished the desire towards him by your envy, but hast kindled it up the more. You have not lessened his honor by slaying him, but hast made it the more ample. Yet before this God had even made him subject to you, whereas since you have slain him, even when dead, he will take vengeance upon you. So great was my love towards him. Who then was the condemned person, the punisher or the punished? He that enjoyed so great honor from God, or he that was given up to a certain novel and unexpected punishment? You did not fear him (he would say) while alive, you shall fear him therefore when dead. You did not tremble when on the point of thrusting with the sword. You shall be seized, now the blood is shed, with a continual trembling. While alive he was your servant, and you showed no forbearance to him. For this reason, now he is dead, he has become a master you shall be afraid of. Thinking then upon these things, beloved, let us flee from envy, let us extinguish malice, let us recompense one another with charity, that we may reap the blessings rising from it, both in the present life and the life which is to come, by the grace and love toward man, etc. Amen.
