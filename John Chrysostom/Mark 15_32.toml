In the case of the robbers, one Evangelist says that the two blasphemed, another that one of them reproved him who was reviling the Lord. Yet in this again there is no contradiction. Both things took place, and at the beginning both the men behaved badly. Afterwards when signs occurred, when the earth shook and the rocks were torn apart, and the sun was darkened, one of them was penitent, became more chastened, recognized the crucified One and acknowledged his kingdom.
