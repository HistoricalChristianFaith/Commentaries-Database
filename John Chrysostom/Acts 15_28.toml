“For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.” Why did they add “and to us,” when “to the Holy Spirit” was enough? The latter prevents them from thinking it came of people, while the former teaches them that they too welcome [the Gentiles], even though they [as Jewish Christians] are circumcised. They have to speak to people who are still weak and afraid of them. This is the reason why this is added as well.
