not making themselves equal (to Him )— they are not so mad. But why does it put this (so)? Why did they add, And to us, and yet it had sufficed to say, To the Holy Ghost? The one, To the Holy Ghost, that they may not deem it to be of man; the other, To us, that they may be taught that they also themselves admit (the Gentiles), although themselves being in circumcision. They have to speak to men who are still weak and afraid of them: this is the reason why this also is added. And it shows that it is not by way of condescension that they speak, neither because they spared them, nor as considering them weak, but the contrary; for great was the reverence of the teachers also. To lay upon you no greater burden— they are ever calling it a burden— and again, save these necessary things: for that was a superfluous burden. See here a brief Epistle, with nothing more in it (than was needed), neither arts of persuasion (κατασκευὰς) nor reasonings, but simply a command: for it was the Spirit's legislating. So when they were dismissed they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered to them the epistle.

“For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us.” Why did they add “and to us,” when “to the Holy Spirit” was enough? The latter prevents them from thinking it came of people, while the former teaches them that they too welcome [the Gentiles], even though they [as Jewish Christians] are circumcised. They have to speak to people who are still weak and afraid of them. This is the reason why this is added as well.
