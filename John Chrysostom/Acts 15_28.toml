"For it seemed good to the Holy Ghost and to us" - it is not man's doing, it says - "to lay upon you no greater burden" - again it calls the Law a burden: then apologizing even for these injunctions - "save these necessary things." For that was a superfluous burden. See here a brief Epistle, with nothing more in it than was needed, neither arts of persuasion nor reasonings, but simply a command: for it was the Spirit's legislating. "For it seemed good," say they, "to the Holy Ghost and to us": not making themselves equal to Him - they are not so mad. But why does it put this so? Why did they add, "And to us," and yet it had sufficed to say, "To the Holy Ghost?" The one, "To the Holy Ghost," that they may not deem it to be of man; the other, "To us," that they may be taught that they also themselves admit the Gentiles, although themselves being in circumcision. They have to speak to men who are still weak and afraid of them: this is the reason why this also is added. And it shows that it is not by way of condescension that they speak, neither because they spared them, nor as considering them weak, but the contrary; for great was the reverence of the teachers also.
