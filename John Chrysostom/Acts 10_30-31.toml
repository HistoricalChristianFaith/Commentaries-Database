What then does Cornelius? He does not say, Why, did not the soldiers tell thee? but observe again, how humbly he speaks. For he says, "From the fourth day I was fasting until this hour; and at the ninth hour I prayed in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing, and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are come up for a memorial before God." It seems to me, that this man had also fixed for himself set times of a life under stricter rule, and on certain days. For this is why he says, "From the fourth day." See how great a thing prayer is! When he advanced in piety, then the Angel appears to him.

He does not say, an Angel, so unassuming is he: "and said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God."
