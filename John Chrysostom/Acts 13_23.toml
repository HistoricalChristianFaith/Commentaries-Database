This was no small thing that Christ should be from David. Then John bears witness to this: When John had first preached before His coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom do you think that I am? I am not He. But, behold, there comes one after me, whose shoes of His feet I am not worthy to loose.

(c) the name of David was dear to them; well then, is it not (a thing to be desired) that a son of his, he says, should be their king?— (b) then he adduces John: then again the prophets, where he says, By condemning they fulfilled, and again, All that was written: then the Apostles as witnesses of the Resurrection: then David bearing witness. For neither the Old Testament proofs seemed so cogent when taken by themselves as they are in this way, nor yet the latter testimonies apart from the former: wherefore he makes them mutually confirm each other. Men and brethren, etc.

Notice how [Paul] weaves his discourse from things present and from the prophets. Thus he says, “from [this man’s] seed according to the promise,” and then adduces John again, saying, “By condemning they fulfilled all that was written.” Both the apostles as witnesses of the resurrection, and David bearing witness. For neither do the Old Testament proofs seem so cogent when taken by themselves, nor the later testimonies apart from the former. Therefore it is through both that he makes his discourse trustworthy.
