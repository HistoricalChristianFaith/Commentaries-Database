Notice how [Paul] weaves his discourse from things present and from the prophets. Thus he says, “from [this man’s] seed according to the promise,” and then adduces John again, saying, “By condemning they fulfilled all that was written.” Both the apostles as witnesses of the resurrection, and David bearing witness. For neither do the Old Testament proofs seem so cogent when taken by themselves, nor the later testimonies apart from the former. Therefore it is through both that he makes his discourse trustworthy.
