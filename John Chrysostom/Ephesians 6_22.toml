This language he employs, not without a purpose, but in consequence of what he had been saying previously; "having girded your loins, having on the breastplate," etc., which are a token of a constant and unceasing advance; for hear what the Prophet says, "Let it be unto him as the raiment wherewith he covers himself, and for the girdle wherewith he is girded continually" [Psalm 109:19]; and the Prophet Isaiah again says, that God has "put on righteousness as a breastplate" [Isaiah 59:17]; by these expressions instructing us that these are things which we must have, not for a short time only, but continually, inasmuch as there is continual need of warfare. "For it is said the righteous are bold as a lion." [Proverbs 28:1] For he that is armed with such a breastplate, it cannot be that he should fear the array that is against him, but he will leap into the midst of the enemy. And again Isaiah says, "How beautiful are the feet of him that brings good tidings." [Isaiah 52:7] Who would not run, who would not serve in such a cause; to publish the good tidings of peace, peace between God and man, peace, where men have toiled not, but where God has wrought all?

But what is the "preparation of the Gospel"?  Let us hearken to what John says, "Make ready the way of the Lord, make His paths straight." [Matthew 3:3] But again there is need also of another "preparation" after baptism, so that we may do nothing unworthy of "peace." And then, since the feet are usually a token of the way of life, hence he is constantly exhorting in this language, "Look, therefore, carefully how ye walk." [Ephesians 5:15] On this account, he would say, let us exhibit a practice and example worthy of the Gospel; that is, make our life and conduct pure. The good tidings of peace have been proclaimed to you, give to these good tidings a ready way; since if you again become enemies, there is no more "preparation of peace." Be ready, be not backward to embrace this peace. As you were ready and disposed for peace and faith, so also continue. The shield is that which first receives the assaults of the adversary, and preserves the armor uninjured. So long then as faith be right and the life be right, the armor remains uninjured.

He discourses, however, much concerning faith, but most especially in writing to the Hebrews, as he does also concerning hope. Believe, says he, in the good things to come, and none of this armor shall be injured. In dangers, in toils, by holding out your hope and your faith to protect you, you will preserve your armor uninjured. "He that comes to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of them that seek after Him." [Hebrews 11:6] Faith is a shield; but wherever there are quibbles, and reasonings, and scrutinizings, then is it no longer a shield, but it impedes us. Let this our faith be such as shall cover and screen the whole frame. Let it not then be scanty, so as to leave the feet or any other part exposed, but let the shield be commensurate with the whole body.

"Fiery  darts." For many doubtful reasonings there are, which set the soul, as it were, on fire, many difficulties, many perplexities, but all of them faith sets entirely at rest; many things does the devil dart in, to inflame our soul and bring us into uncertainty; as, for example, when some persons say, "Is there then a resurrection?" "Is there a judgment?" "Is there a retribution?" "But is there faith?" the apostle would say, "you shall with it quench the darts of the devil. Has any base lust assaulted you? Hold before you your faith in the good things to come, and it will not even show itself, yea, it will perish." "All the darts"; not some quenched, and others not. Hearken to what Paul says, "For I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed to us-ward." [Romans 8:18] Do you see how many darts the righteous quenched in those days? Seems it not to you to be "fiery darts," when the patriarch burned with inward fire, as he was offering up his son? Yea, and other righteous men also have quenched "all his darts." Whether then they be reasonings that assault us, let us hold out this; or whether they be base desires, let us use this; or whether again labors and distresses, upon this let us repose. Of all the other armor, this is the safeguard; if we have not this, they will be quickly pierced through. "Withal," says he, "taking up the shield of faith." What is the meaning of "withal"? It means both "in truth," and "in righteousness," and "in the preparation of the gospel"; that is to say, all these have need of the aid of faith.

And therefore he adds further, "and take the helmet of salvation"; that is to say, finally by this shall you be able to be in security. To receive the helmet of salvation is to escape the peril. For as the helmet covers the head perfectly in every part, and suffers it not to sustain any injury, but preserves it, so also does faith supply alike the place of a shield, and of a helmet  to preserve us. For if we quench his darts, quickly shall we receive also those saving thoughts that suffer not our governing principle  to sustain any harm; for if these, the thoughts that are adverse to our salvation, are quenched, those which are not so, but which contribute to our salvation, and inspire us with good hopes, will be generated within us, and will rest upon our governing principle, as a helmet does upon the head.

And not only this, but we shall take also "the sword of the Spirit," and thus not only ward off his missiles, but smite the devil himself. For a soul that does not despair of herself, and is proof against those fiery darts, will stand with all intrepidity to face the enemy, and will cleave open his breastplate with this very sword with which Paul also burst through it, and "brought into captivity his devices" [2 Corinthians 10:5]; he will cut off and behead the serpent.

"Which is the word of God."

By the "word of God" in this place, he means on the one hand the ordinance of God, or the word of command; or on the other that it is in the Name of Christ. For if we keep his commandments, by these we shall kill and slay the dragon himself, "the crooked serpent." [Isaiah 27:1] And as he said, "You shall be able to quench the fiery darts of the evil one"; that he might not puff them up, he shows them, that above all things they stand in need of God; for what does he say?

"With all prayer and supplication," he says, these things shall be done, and you shall accomplish all by praying. But when you draw near, never ask for yourself only: thus shall you have God favorable to you.

"With all prayer and supplication, praying at all seasons in the Spirit, and watching thereunto in all perseverance for all the saints." Limit it not, I say, to certain times of the day, for hear what he is saying; approach at all times; "pray," says he, "without ceasing." [1 Thessalonians 5:17] Have you never heard of that widow, how by her importunity she prevailed? [Luke 18:1-7] Have you never heard of that friend, who at midnight shamed his friend into yielding by his perseverance? [Luke 11:5-8] Have you not heard of the Syrophœnician woman [Mark 7:25-30], how by the constancy of her entreaty she called forth the Lord's compassion? These all of them gained their object by their importunity.

"Praying at all seasons," says he, "in the Spirit."

That is to say, let us seek for the things which are according to God, nothing of this world, nothing pertaining to this life.

Therefore, is there need not only that we "pray without ceasing," but also, that we should do so "watching — and watching," says he, "thereunto." Whether he is here speaking of vigils;  or of the wakefulness of the soul, I admit both meanings. Do you see how that Canaanitish woman watched unto prayer? And though the Lord gave her no answer, nay, even shook her off, and called her a dog, she said, "Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table" [Matthew 15:27], and desisted not until she obtained her request. How, too, did that widow cry, and persist so long, until she was able to shame into yielding that ruler, that neither feared God, nor regarded man [Luke 18:1-7]? And how, again, did the friend persist, remaining before the door in the dead of night, till he shamed the other into yielding by his importunity, and made him arise. [Luke 11:5-8] This is to be watchful.

Would you understand what watchfulness in prayer is? Go to Hannah, hearken to her very words, "Adonai Eloi Sabaoth." [1 Samuel 1:11] Nay, rather, hear what preceded those words; "they all rose up," says the history, "from the table" [1 Samuel 1:9], and she, immediately, did not betake herself to sleep, nor to repose. Whence she appears to me even when she was sitting at the table to have partaken lightly, and not to have been made heavy with viands. Otherwise never could she have shed so many tears; for if we, when we are fasting and foodless, hardly pray thus, or rather never pray thus, much more would not she ever have prayed thus after a meal, unless even at the meal she had been as they that eat not. Let us be ashamed, us that are men, at the example of this woman; let us be ashamed, that are suing and gasping for a kingdom, at her, praying and weeping for a little child. "And she stood," it says, "before the Lord" [1 Samuel 1:10]; and what are her words? "Adonai, Lord, Eloi Sabaoth!" and this is, being interpreted, "O Lord, the God of Hosts." Her tears went before her tongue; by these she hoped to prevail with God to bend to her request. Where tears are, there is always affliction also: where affliction is, there is great wisdom and heedfulness. "If you will indeed," she continues, "look on the affliction of your handmaid, and will give to your handmaid a man child, then will I give him unto the Lord all the days of his life." [1 Samuel 1:11] She said not, "for one year," or, "for two," as we do — nor said she, "if you will give me a child, I will give you money"; but, "I give back to You the very gift itself entire, my first-born, the son of my prayer." Truly here was a daughter of Abraham. He gave when it was demanded of him. She offers even before it is demanded.

But observe even after this her deep reverence. "Only her lips moved, but her voice," it says, "was not heard." [1 Samuel 1:13] And thus does he who would gain his request draw near unto God; not consulting his ease, nor gaping, nor lounging, nor scratching his head, nor with utter listlessness. What, was not God able to grant, even without any prayer at all? What, did He not know the woman's desire even before she asked? And yet had He granted it before she asked, then the woman's earnestness would not have been shown, her virtue would not have been made manifest, she would not have gained so great a reward. So that the delay is not the result of envy or of witchcraft, but of providential kindness. When therefore ye hear the Scripture saying, that "the Lord had shut up her womb" (ver. 5, 6.), and that, "her rival provoked her sore"; consider that it is His intention to prove the woman's seriousness.  For, mark, she had a husband devoted to her, for he said [1 Samuel 1:8], "Am I not better to you than ten sons?" "And her rival," it says, "provoked her sore," that is, reproached her, insulted over her. And yet did she never once retaliate, nor utter imprecation against her, nor say, "Avenge me, for my rival reviles me." The other had children, but this woman had her husband's love to make amends. With this at least he even consoled her, saying, "Am not I better to you than ten sons?"

But let us look, again, at the deep wisdom of this woman. "And Eli," it says, "thought she had been drunken." [1 Samuel 1:13] Yet observe what she says to him also, "Nay, count not your handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto." [1 Samuel 1:16] Here is truly the proof of a contrite heart, when we are not angry with those that revile us, when we are not indignant against them, when we reply but in self-defense. Nothing renders the heart so wise as affliction; nothing is there so sweet as "godly mourning." [2 Corinthians 7:10] "Out of the abundance," says she, "of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken hitherto." Her let us imitate, one and all. Hearken, you that are barren, hearken, you that desire children, hearken, both husbands and wives; yes, for husbands, too, used oftentimes to contribute their part; for hear what the Scripture says, "And Isaac intreated the Lord for Rebekah his wife, because she was barren." [Genesis 25:21] For prayer is able to accomplish great things.

"With all prayer and supplication," says he, "for all the saints, and for me," placing himself last. What doest thou, O blessed Paul, in thus placing yourself last? Yea, says he, "that utterance may be given unto me, in opening my mouth, to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in chains." And where are you an ambassador? "To mankind," says he. Oh! amazing lovingkindness of God! He sent from Heaven in His own Name ambassadors for peace, and lo, men took them, and bound them, and reverenced not so much as the law of nations, that an ambassador never suffers any hurt. "But, however, I am an ambassador in bonds. The chain lies like a bridle upon me, restraining my boldness, but your prayer shall open my mouth" in order that I may speak all things I was sent to speak.

"But that you also may know my affairs, how I do, Tychicus, the beloved brother, and faithful minister in the Lord, shall make known to you all things." If "faithful," he will tell no falsehood, he will in everything speak the truth:— "whom I have sent unto you for this very purpose, that you might know our state, and that he may comfort your hearts." Amazing, transcendent affection! "that it may not be in the power," he means, "of them that would, to affright you." For it is probable that they were in tribulation; for the expression, "may comfort your hearts," intimates as much; that is, "may not suffer you to sink under it."
