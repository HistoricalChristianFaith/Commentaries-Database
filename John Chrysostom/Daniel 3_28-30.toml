“Blessed be God who has sent his angel.” … For how can it be otherwise than astonishing for the emperor of the world, with so many arms around him, and legions, and generals, and viceroys, and consuls and land and sea subject to his sway, to be despised by captive children; for the bound to overcome the binder and conquer all that army? Neither was there any power in the king and his company to do what they would, no, not even with the furnaces for an ally. But they who were naked, and slaves, and strangers and few (for what number could be more contemptible than three?), being in chains, vanquished an innumerable army. For already now was death despised, since Christ was henceforth about to sojourn in the world. And as when the sun is on the point of rising, even before his rays appear the light of the day grows bright; so also when the Sun of righteousness was about to come, death henceforth began to withdraw himself. What could be more splendid than that theater? What more conspicuous than that victory?

Contemplate with me how he [the king] at first proclaims the Arbiter of the contest: “Blessed be God.” … This he proclaims as regards the power of God. He speaks also of the virtue of the combatants: “Because they trusted in him.” … Could anything equal the virtue of this? Before this, when they said, “We will not serve your gods,” he was inflamed more fiercely than the very furnace; but now, when by their deeds they had taught him this, he was so far from being indignant that he praised and admired them for not having obeyed him! So good a thing is virtue that it has even its enemies themselves to applaud and admire it! These young men had fought and conquered, but the vanquished party gave thanks that the sight of the fire had not terrified them but that the hope in their Lord had comforted them.… For this reason he both applauds those who had despised him, and passing by so many governors, kings and princes, those who had obeyed him, he stands in admiration of the three captives and slaves who derided his tyranny! For they did these things not for the sake of contention but for the love of wisdom; not of defiance but of devotion; not being puffed up with pride but on fire with zeal. For great indeed is the blessing of a hope in God.
