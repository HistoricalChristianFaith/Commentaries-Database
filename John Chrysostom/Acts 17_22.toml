(f) for the cities were full of gods (δαιμόνων, al. εἰδώλων): (h) this is why he says δεισιδαιμονεστέρους . For as I passed by and viewed the objects of your worship — he does not say simply τοὺς δαίμονας (the demons, or deities), but paves the way for his discourse: I beheld an altar, etc.

he puts it by way of encomium: (the word) does not seem to mean anything offensive— δεισιδαιμονεστέρους, that is, εὐλαβεστέρους, more religiously disposed. For as I passed by, and beheld your devotions, I found an altar with his inscription, To an Unknown God. What therefore ye ignorantly worship, this declare I unto you.
