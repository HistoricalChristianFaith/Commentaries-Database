Ver. 9. "A little leaven leavens the whole lump."

And thus this slight error, he says, if not corrected,  will have power (as the leaven has with the lump) to lead you into complete Judaism.

Some may say, “Why do you blow up the matter so portentously by your words? We have kept a single command of the law, and are you clamoring because of that?” But Paul is concerned not only for their present but for their future…. “For,” he says, “this little evil, if uncorrected, has the strength to lead you into complete Judaizing, just as leaven acts on the lump.”
