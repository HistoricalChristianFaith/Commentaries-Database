Isaiah made it clear that Christ will raise up all people when he said, “The dead shall be raised up again; even those in the tombs shall be raised up. For the dew from you is healing for them.” That was not all. After his cross, after his slaughter, his glory will shine forth more brightly; after his resurrection, he will advance the message of his gospel still more.
