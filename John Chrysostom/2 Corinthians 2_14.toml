Paul was in constant affliction everywhere he went, but this did not draw him into despair. On the contrary, he rejoiced and gave thanks, because although persecution might seem like a disgrace, in fact it was a very great honor.

"But thanks be to God, which always causes us to triumph in Christ, and makes manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every place."

For that he may not seem as though in sorrow to be lamenting these things, he sends up thanks to God. Now what he says is this: 'Every where is trouble, every where straitness. I came into Asia, I was burdened beyond strength. I came to Troas, I found not the brother. I came not to you; this too bred in me no slight, yea rather, exceeding great dejection, both because many among you had sinned, and because on this account I see you not. For, "To spare you," he says, "I came not as yet unto Corinth." That then he may not seem to be complaining in so speaking, he adds, 'We not only do not grieve in these afflictions, but we even rejoice; and, what is still greater, not for the sake of the rewards to come only, but those too even which are present. For even here we are by these things made glorious and conspicuous. So far then are we from lamenting, that we even call the thing a triumph ; and glory in what happens.' For which cause also he said, "Now thanks be unto God, Which always causes us to triumph," that is, 'Who makes us renowned unto all. For what seems to be matter of disgrace, being persecuted from every quarter, this appears to us to be matter of very great honor.' Wherefore he said not, "Which makes us seen of all," but, "Which causes us to triumph:" showing that these persecutions set up a series  of trophies against the devil in every part of the world. Then having mentioned along with the author, the subject also of the triumph, he thereby also raises up the hearer. 'For not only are we made to triumph by God, but also "in Christ;"' that is, on account of Christ and the Gospel. 'For seeing it behooves to triumph, all need is that we also who carry the trophy are seen of all, because we bear Him. For this reason we become observed and conspicuous.'

"And which makes manifest through us the savor of His knowledge in every place."

He said above, "Which always causes us to triumph." Here he says "in every place," showing that every place and every time is full of the Apostles' labors. And he uses yet another metaphor, that of the sweet savor. For 'like as those who bear ointment, so are we,' says he, 'manifest to all'; calling the knowledge a very precious ointment. Moreover, he said not, 'the knowledge;' but "the savor of the knowledge;" for such is the nature of the present knowledge, not very clear nor uncovered. Whence also he said in the former Epistle, "For now we see in a mirror darkly." [1 Corinthians 13:12] And here he calls that which is such a "savor." Now he that perceives the savor knows that there is ointment lying somewhere; but of what nature it is he knows not yet, unless he happens before to have seen it. 'So also we. That God is, we know, but what in substance we know not yet. We are then, as it were, a Royal censer, breathing wherever we go of the heavenly ointment and the spiritual sweet savor.' Now he said this, at once both to set forth the power of the Preaching, in that by the very designs formed against them, they shine more than those who prosecute them and who cause the whole world to know both their trophies and their sweet savor: and to exhort them in regard to their afflictions and trials to bear all nobly, seeing that even before the Recompense they reap this glory inexpressible.
