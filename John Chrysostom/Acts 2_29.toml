Noble brothers, permit me to speak freely to you about the Patriarch David:
Remarkable lowliness, in a case where he was giving no hurt, nor was there any reason why the hearers should be angry. For he did not say, This is not said concerning David, but concerning the Christ. But in another point of view: by his reverential expression towards the blessed David, he awed them; speaking of an acknowledged fact as if it were a bold thing to say, and therefore begging them to pardon him for saying it. And thereupon his expression is not simply concerning David, but concerning the patriarch David, 

for he passed away and was buried:
he does not also say, and is not risen again, but in another way (though this too would have been no great thing to say)
