Ver. 22. "Servants," he says, "obey in all things your masters according to the flesh."

And see how always he sets down the names, "wives, children, servants," being at once a just claim upon their obedience. But that none might be pained, he added, "to your masters according to the flesh." Your better part, the soul, is free, he says; your service is for a season. It therefore do thou subject, that your service be no more of constraint. "Not with eye-service, as men-pleasers." Make, he says, your service which is by the law, to be from the fear of Christ. For if when your master sees you not, you do your duty and what is for his honor, it is manifest that you do it because of the sleepless Eye. "Not with eye-service," he says, "as men-pleasers"; thus implying, "it is you who will have to sustain the damage." For hear the prophet saying, "God has scattered the bones of the men-pleasers." [Psalm 53:6, Septuagint] See then how he spares them, and brings them to order. "But in singleness of heart," he says, "fearing God."  For that is not singleness, but hypocrisy, to hold one thing, and act another; to appear one when the master is present, another when he is absent. Therefore he said not simply, "in singleness of heart," but, "fearing God." For this is to fear God, when, though none be seeing, we do not anything that is evil; but if we do, we fear not God, but men. Do you see how he brings them to order?

There is also a certain kind of love that does not proceed from nature, as in Paul’s earlier examples, but from habit, and from the nature of authority itself…. In these relationships love’s sphere is narrowed while that of obedience is widened.
