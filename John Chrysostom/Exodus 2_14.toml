Wherefore also very foolishly did that Hebrew say to him, “Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?” What do you say? You see the actions and doubt of the title? Just as if one seeing a physician using the knife excellently well and succoring that limb in the body which was diseased, should say, “Who made you a physician and ordered you to use a knife?” “It is my art, my good sir, and your own ailment.” So too did his knowledge make him (i.e., Moses) what he claimed to be. For ruling is an art, not merely a dignity, and an art above all arts.

“By faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the wrath of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.” What do you say? That he did not fear? And yet the Scripture says that when he heard, he “was afraid,” and for this cause provided for safety by flight, and stole away and secretly withdrew himself. And afterwards he was exceedingly afraid. Observe the expressions with care: he said, “not fearing the wrath of the king” with reference to his presenting himself again. For it would have been [the part] of one who was afraid not to undertake again to defend his championship or to have any hand in the matter. That he did however again undertake it was [the part] of one who committed all to God. For he did not say, “He is seeking me and is busy [in the search], and I cannot bear again to engage in this matter.”So even his flight was [an act of] faith. Why then did he not remain? [you say]. That he might not cast himself into a foreseen danger. For this finally would have been tempting [God]: to leap into the midst of dangers and say, “Let us see whether God will save me.” And this the devil said to Christ, “Cast yourself down.” Do you see that it is a diabolical thing to throw ourselves into danger without cause and for no purpose and to make trial of God, whether he will save us?
