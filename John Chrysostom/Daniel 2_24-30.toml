Let us not then be looking open-mouthed toward others. For it is true, the prayers of the saints have the greatest power, on condition, however, of our repentance and change. Since even Moses, who had rescued his own brother and six hundred thousand men from the wrath that was then coming on them from God, had no power to deliver his sister. … And Samuel was not able to save Saul from the wrath from above, yet he oftentimes preserved the Israelites.… And Daniel saved the barbarians from slaughter, but he did not deliver the Jews from their captivity.… So on the one hand, if we are careless, we shall not be able to obtain salvation, no, not even by the help of others; if, on the other hand, we are watchful, we shall be able to do this by ourselves, and by ourselves rather than by others. Yes, for God is more willing to give his grace to us than to others for us, that we, by our zeal to avoid his wrath, may both enjoy a deep trust in him and become better people.

For nothing is so advantageous and so likely to pacify the hearers as to say nothing about one’s self of an honorable nature, but on the contrary, to forestall all suspicion of wishing to do so. And, in truth, much more did they [the apostles] increase their glory by despising glory and showing that what had just taken place was not a human act but a divine work; and that it was their part to join with the beholders in admiration rather than to receive it from them.… In the same manner also did the ancient fathers, for instance, Daniel, say, “Not because of any wisdom I have more than all the living has this mystery been revealed to me.” … And again Joseph, “Do not interpretations belong to God?”
