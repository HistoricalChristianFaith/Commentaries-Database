But this parable He speaks, as anointing His disciples, and to teach them, that even though the lost be more than such as receive the word yet they are not to despond. For this was the ease even with their Lord, and He who fully foreknew that these things should be, did not desist from sowing.

We have good cause to admire the disciples. Longing as they do to learn, they know when they ought to ask. They do not ask in the presence of the crowd. Matthew shows this by saying, “And they came.” But to show that this is not a conjecture, Mark has expressed it more distinctly by saying that “they came to him privately.” This is what his brothers and his mother should have done. It would have been better if his family had not called him out and made a scene.But mark the disciples’ gentle affection, how they have much regard for the others and how they seek the other’s good first and then their own. “For why,” they ask, “do you speak to them in parables?” They did not say, “Why do you speak to us in parables?” On other occasions as well we can see their kindness in their human relationships, as when they said, “Send the multitude away” and “Do you know that they were offended?”
