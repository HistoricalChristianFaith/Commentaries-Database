Do you see, how many ways He leads them on to the faith? First, Matthew 11:7-11 by His praises of John. For by pointing to him as a great and marvellous one, He proved likewise all his sayings credible, whereby he used to draw them on to the knowledge of Him. Secondly, Matthew 11:12 by saying, The kingdom of Heaven suffers violence, and the violent take it by force; for this is the language of one who is pressing and urging them. Thirdly, Matthew 6:13 by signifying that the number of the prophets was finished; for this too manifested Himself to be the person that was announced beforehand by them. Fourthly, Matthew 6:14-19 by pointing out that whatsoever things should be done by him, were all accomplished; at which time also He made mention of the parable of the children. Fifthly, by His upbraiding them that had not believed, and by His alarming and threatening them greatly. Matthew 11:20-24 Sixthly, by His giving thanks for them that believed. For the expression, I make acknowledgment to You, here is, I thank You. I thank You, He says, because You have hid these things from the wise and prudent.

What then? Does He rejoice in destruction, and in the others not having received this knowledge? By no means; but this is a most excellent way of His to save men, His not forcing them that utterly reject, and are not willing to receive His sayings; that, since they were not bettered by His call, but fell back, and despised it, His casting them out might cause them to fall into a longing for these things. And so likewise the attentive would grow more earnest.

And while His being revealed to these was fit matter of joy, His concealment from those was no more of joy but of tears. Thus at any rate He acts, where He weeps for the city. Not therefore because of this does He rejoice, but because what wise men knew not, was known to these. As when Paul says, I thank God, that you were servants of sin, but you obeyed from the heart the form of doctrine which was delivered unto you. You see, neither does Paul therefore rejoice, because they were servants of sin, but because being such, they had been so highly favored.

Now by the wise, here, He means the Scribes, and the Pharisees. And these things He says, to make the disciples more earnest, and to show what had been vouchsafed to the fishermen, when all those others had missed of it. And in calling them wise, He means not the true and commendable wisdom, but this which they seemed to have through natural shrewdness. Wherefore neither did He say, you have revealed it to fools, but to babes; to unsophisticated, that is, to simple-minded men; and He implies that so far from their missing these privileges contrary to their desert, it was just what might be expected. And He instructs us throughout, to be free from pride, and to follow after simplicity. For this cause Paul also expressed it with more exceeding earnestness, writing on this wise: If any man among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise. 1 Corinthians 3:18 For thus is God's grace manifested.

But wherefore does He give thanks to the Father, although of course it was Himself who wrought this? As He prays and intercedes with God, showing His great love towards us, in the same way does He this too: for this also is of much love. And He signifies, that not from Him only had they fallen away, but also from the Father. Thus, what He said, speaking to His disciples, Cast not the holy things unto dogs, Matthew 7:6 this He Himself anticipated them in performing.

Moreover He signifies hereby both His own principal will, and that of the Father; His own, I say, by His giving thanks and rejoicing at what had taken place; His Father's, by intimating that neither had He done this upon entreaty, but of Himself upon His own will; For so, says He, it seemed good in Your sight: that is, so it pleased You.

And wherefore was it hidden from them? Hear Paul, saying, that Seeking to establish their own righteousness, they have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God. Romans 10:3

Consider now how it was likely the disciples should be affected, hearing this; that what wise men knew not, these knew, and knew it continuing babes, and knew it by God's revelation. But Luke says, that at the very hour, when the seventy came telling Him about the devils, then He rejoiced and spoke these things, Luke 10:21 which, besides increasing their diligence, would also dispose them to be modest. That is, since it was natural for them to pride themselves on their driving away devils, on this among other grounds He refrains them; that it was a revelation, whatever had been done, no diligence on their part. Wherefore also the scribes, and the wise men, thinking to be intelligent for themselves, fell away through their own vanity. Well then, if for this cause it was hidden from them, do you also, says He, fear, and continue babes. For this caused you to have the benefit of the revelation, as indeed on the other hand the contrary made them be deprived of it. For by no means, when He says, You have hid, does He mean that it is all God's doing: but as when Paul says, He gave them over to a reprobate mind, Romans 1:28 and, He has blinded their minds, it is not meant to bring Him in as the doer of it, but those who gave the occasion: so here also He uses the expression, You have hid.

For since He had said, I thank You, because You have hid them, and hast revealed them unto babes; to hinder your supposing that as being Himself deprived of this power, and unable to effect it, so He offers thanks, He says,
