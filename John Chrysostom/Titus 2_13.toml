And Paul said: “from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed forever, Amen.” And again: “No fornicator or covetous one has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.” And still again: “through the appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” And John calls him by the same name of God when he says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.”

"That we should live godly in this present world."

And what is this hope? what the reward of our labors?

"Looking for the blessed hope and the appearing."

For nothing is more blessed and more desirable than that appearing. Words are not able to represent it, the blessings thereof surpass our understanding.

"Looking for the blessed hope and glorious appearing of our great God and Saviour."

Where are those who say that the Son is inferior to the Father?

"Our great God and Saviour." He who saved us when we were enemies. What will He not do then when He has us approved?

"The great God." When he says great with respect to God, he says it not comparatively but absolutely, after Whom no one is great, since it is relative. For if it is relative, He is great by comparison, not great by nature. But now He is incomparably great.
