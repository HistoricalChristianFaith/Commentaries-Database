And Paul said: “from whom is the Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things, God blessed forever, Amen.” And again: “No fornicator or covetous one has an inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.” And still again: “through the appearance of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ.” And John calls him by the same name of God when he says: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God; and the Word was God.”
