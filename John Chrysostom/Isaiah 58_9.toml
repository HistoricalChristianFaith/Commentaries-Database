Were he distant from us in place, you might well doubt, but if [God] is present everywhere, to him that strives and is in earnest he is near.… What father would ever be thus obedient to his offspring? What mother is there, so ready and continually standing, in case her children call her? There is not one, no father, no mother, but God stands continually waiting … and never, when we have called as we ought, has he refused to hear.
