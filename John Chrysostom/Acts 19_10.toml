See how much separating oneself accomplishes: both the Jews and Hellenes came to listen. He teaches those who believe in the Son of God to separate themselves from those who blaspheme him.

"And this was done for the space of two years, so that all that were in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks." Do you mark how much was effected by his persisting? "Both Jews and Greeks heard: all that dwelt in Asia": it was for this also that the Lord suffered him not to go into Asia on a former occasion; waiting, as it seems to me, for this same conjuncture. And so he disputed in the school of one Tyrannus for two years: where were believers, and believers exceedingly advanced in the faith. Moreover Paul writes to them as to great men.
