He does not say, it is God that forgave our sins, but what is much greater, "It is God that justifies." For when the Judge's sentence declares us just, and a Judge such as that too, what signifies the accuser? Hence neither is it right to fear temptations, for God is for us, and has shown it by what He has done; nor again Jewish triflings, for He has both elected and justified us, and the wondrous thing is that it was also by the death of His Son that He did so. Who then is to condemn us, since God crowns us, and Christ was put to death for us, and not only was put to death, but also after this intercedes for us?

For, "It is Christ," he says, "that died, yea rather, that is risen from the dead, Who is at the right hand of God, Who also makes intercession for us."

For though seen now in His own dignity, He has not left caring for us, but even "makes intercession for us," and still keeps up the same love. For He was not contented with being put to death alone. And this is a sign for the most part of very great love, to be doing not only what falls to His lot, but also to address Another on this behalf. For this is all he meant to signify by the interceding, using a way of speaking better suited to man, and more condescending, that he might point out love. Since unless we take the words, "He spared not," also with the same understanding, many inconsistencies will come of it. And that you may see that such is the point he is aiming at, after first saying, that He "is at the Right Hand," he next proceeds to say, that He "makes intercession for us," when he had shown an equality of honor and rank, so that hence it may appear that the Intercession is not a sign of inferiority,  but of love only. For being Life itself (αὐτοζωή]) [Psalm 36:9], and a Well of good things of every kind, and with the same power as the Father, both to raise up the dead and to quicken them, and do all besides that He does, how could He need to be a suppliant in order to help us? [John 5:19-36] He that of His own power set free those who were given over and condemned, even from that condemnation; and made them righteous, and sons, and led them to the very highest honors, and brought to pass things which had never been hoped for: how should He, after having achieved all this, and having shown our nature on the King's throne, require to be a suppliant to do the easier things? [Acts 7:55; Hebrews 10:12; Revelation 7:17] You see how it is shown by every argument, that there is no other reason for his having mentioned intercession, save to show the warmth and vigorousness of His love for us; for the Father also is represented to us as beseeching men to be reconciled to Him. "For we are ambassadors of Christ, as though God did beseech you by us." [2 Corinthians 5:20] Still, though God beseeches, and men are "ambassadors in Christ's stead" to men, we do not understand on that account anything done unworthy of that dignity; but one thing only do we gather from all that is told us, namely, the intenseness of the love. This then let us do here also. If then the Spirit even "makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered," and Christ died and intercedes for us, and the Father "spared not His own Son" for you, and elected you, and justified you, why be afraid any more? Or why tremble when enjoying such great love, and having such great interest taken in you? In this way then, after showing His great providence over us from the first, he afterwards brings out what comes next in a bold style, and does not say, you ought also to love Him, but, as if grown enthusiastic at this unspeakable Providence over us, he says,
