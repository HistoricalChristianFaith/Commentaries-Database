Why ought we to give more earnest heed to the things which we have heard? Were not those former things of God, as well as these? Either then he means more earnest than [to] the Law, or very earnest; not making comparison, God forbid. For since, on account of the long space of time, they had a great opinion of the Old Covenant, but these things had been despised as yet new, he proves (more than his argument required) that we ought rather to give heed to these. How? By saying in effect, Both these and those are of God, but not in a like manner. And this he shows us afterwards: but for the present he treats it somewhat superficially, but afterwards more clearly, saying For if that first covenant had been faultless Hebrews 8:7, and many other such things: for that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away. Hebrews 8:13 But as yet he ventures not to say any such thing in the beginning of his discourse, nor until he shall have first occupied and possessed his hearer by his fuller [arguments].

Why then ought we to give more earnest heed? Lest at any time, says he, we should let them slip— that is, lest at any time we should perish, lest we should fall away. And here he shows the grievousness of this falling away, in that it is a difficult thing for that which has fallen away to return again, inasmuch as it has happened through wilful negligence. And he took this form of speech from the Proverbs. For, says he, my son [take heed] lest you fall away Proverbs 3:21, Septuagint, showing both the easiness of the fall, and the grievousness of the ruin. That is, our disobedience is not without danger. And while by his mode of reasoning he shows that the chastisement is greater, yet again he leaves it in the form of a question, and not in the conclusion. For indeed this is to make one's discourse inoffensive, when one does not in every case of one's self infer the judgment, but leaves it in the power of the hearer himself to give sentence: and this would render them more open to conviction. And both the prophet Nathan does the same in the Old [Testament], and in Matthew Christ, saying, What will He do to the husbandmen Matthew 21:40 of that vineyard? So compelling them to give sentence themselves: for this is the greatest victory.

Next, when he had said, For if the word which was spoken by Angels was steadfast— he did not add, much more that by Christ: but letting this pass, he said what is less, How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation? And see how he makes the comparison. For if the word which was spoken by Angels, says he. There, by Angels, here, by the Lord— and there a word, but here, salvation.

Then lest any man should say, Your sayings, O Paul, are they Christ's? He proves their trustworthiness both from his having heard these things of Him, and from their being now spoken by God; since not merely a voice is wafted, as in the case of Moses, but signs are done, and facts bear witness.

6. But what is this, For if the word spoken by Angels was steadfast? For in the Epistle to the Galatians also he says to this effect, Being ordained by angels in the hand of a Mediator. Galatians 3:19 And again, You received a law by the disposition of Angels, and have not kept it. Acts 7:53 And everywhere he says it was given by angels. Some indeed say that Moses is signified; but without reason. For here he says Angels in the plural: and the Angels too which he here speaks of, are those in Heaven. What then is it? Either he means the Decalogue only (for there Moses spoke, and God answered him Exodus 19:19)—or that angels were present, God disposing them in order—or that he speaks thus in regard of all things said and done in the old Covenant, as if Angels had part in them. But how is it said in another place, The Law was given by Moses John 1:17, and here by Angels? For it is said, And God came down in thick darkness. Exodus 19:16-20

For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast. What is was steadfast? True, as one may say; and faithful in its proper season; and all the things which had been spoken came to pass. Either this is his meaning, or that they prevailed, and the threatenings were coming to be accomplished. Or by the word he means injunctions. For apart from the Law, Angels sent from God enjoined many things: for instance at Bochim, in the Judges, in [the history of] Samson. Judges 2:1; 13:3 For this is the cause why he said not the Law but the word. And he seems to me haply rather to mean this, viz., those things which are committed to the management of angels. What shall we say then? The angels who were entrusted with the charge of the nation were then present, and they themselves made the trumpets, and the other things, the fire, the thick darkness. Exodus 19:16

And every transgression and disobedience, says he. Not this one and that one, but every one. Nothing, he says, remained unavenged, but received a just recompense of reward, instead of [saying] punishment. Why now spoke he thus? Such is the manner of Paul, not to make much account of his phrases, but indifferently to put down words of evil sound, even in matters of good meaning. As also in another place he says, Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ. 2 Corinthians 10:5 And again he has put the recompense for punishment, as here he calls punishment reward. If it be a righteous thing, he says, with God to recompense tribulation to them that trouble you, and to you who are troubled rest. 2 Thessalonians 1:6-7 That is, justice was not violated, but God went forth against them, and caused the penalty to come round on the sinners, though not all their sins are made manifest, but only where the express ordinances were transgressed
