Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: The blasphemy of the Scribes having been detailed, our Lords hews that what they said was impossible, confirming His proof by an example. Wherefore it says, “And having called them together unto Him, He said unto them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan?” As if He had said, A kingdom divided against itself by civil war must be desolated, which is exemplified both in a house and in a city. Wherefore also if Satan’s kingdom by divided against itself, so that Satan expels Satan from men, the desolation of the kingdom of the devils is at hand.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: He says indeed, that blasphemy concerning Himself was pardonable, because He then seemed to be a man despised and of the most lowly birth, but, that contumely against God has no remission. Now blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is against God, for the operation of the Holy Spirit is the kingdom of God; and for this reason, He says, that blasphemy against the Holy Spirit cannot be remitted. Instead, however, of what is here added, “But will be in danger of eternal damnation,” another Evangelist says, “Neither in this world, nor in the world to come.” By which isunderstood, the judgment which is according to the law, and that which is tocome.For the law orders one who blasphemes Godto be slain, and in the judgment of the second law he has no remission. However, he who is baptized is taken out of this world; but the Jews were ignorant of the remission which takes place in baptism. He therefore who refers to the devil miracles, and the casting out of devils which belong to the Holy Spirit alone, has no room left him for remission of his blasphemy. Neither does it appear that such a blasphemy as this is remitted, since it is against the Holy Spirit. Wherefore he adds, explaining it, “Because they said, He hath an unclean spirit.”
