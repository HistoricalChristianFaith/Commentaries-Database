Great was the grace of Timothy. When Barnabas departed (ἀ πέστη), he finds another, equivalent to him. Of him he says, Remembering your tears and your unfeigned faith, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice. 2 Timothy 1:5 His father continued to be a Gentile, and therefore it was that (Timothy) was not circumcised. (a) Observe the Law already broken. Or if not so, I suppose he was born after the preaching of the Gospel but this is perhaps not so. (c) He was about to make him a bishop, and it was not meet that he should be uncircumcised. (e) And this was not a small matter, seeing it offended after so long a time: (b) for from a child, he says, you have known the Holy Scriptures. 2 Timothy 3:15 (d) And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep.
