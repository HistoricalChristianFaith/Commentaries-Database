"And, behold a certain disciple was there, named Timotheus, the son of a certain woman, which was a Jewess, and believed; but his father was a Greek: which was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium." Great was the grace of Timothy. When Barnabas departed, he finds another, equivalent to him. Of him he saith, "Remembering thy tears and thy unfeigned faith, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and in thy mother Eunice." His father continued to be a Gentile, and therefore it was that (Timothy) was not circumcised. Observe the Law already broken.
