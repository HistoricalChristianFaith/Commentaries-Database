3. "Now I beseech you, brethren;â€” ye know the house of Stephanas, that it is the first-fruits of Achaia, and that they have set themselves to minister unto the saints."

In the beginning too he mentions this man, saying, "I baptized also the home of Stephanas:" and now he speaks of him as "the first-fruits" not of Corinth only, but also of all Greece. And this too is no small encomium that he was the first to come to Christ. Wherefore also in the Epistle to the Romans, praising certain persons on this account, he said, "Who also were in Christ before me." [Romans 16:7] And he said not, that they were the first who believed, but were the "first-fruits;" implying that together with their faith they showed forth also a most excellent life, in every way proving themselves worthy, as in the case of fruits. For so the first-fruits ought to be better than the rest of those things whereof they are the first-fruits: a kind of praise which Paul has attributed to these also by this expression: namely, that they not only had a genuine faith, as I was saying, but also they exhibited great piety, and the climax of virtue, and liberality in almsgiving.

And not from hence only, but from another topic likewise he indicates their piety, i.e., from their having filled their whole house also with godliness.

And that they flourished in good works also, he declares by what follows, saying, "They have set themselves to minister unto the saints." Hear ye, how vast are the praises of their hospitality? For he did not say, "they minister," but, "have set themselves:" this kind of life they have chosen altogether, this is their business in which they are always busy.

That ye also be in subjection unto such, that is, "that you take a share with them both in expenditure of money, and in personal service: that you be partakers with them." For both to them the labor will be light when they have comrades, and the results of their active benevolence will extend to more.

And he said not merely, "be fellow-helpers," but added, "whatsoever directions they give, obey;" implying the strictest obedience. And that he might not appear to be favoring them, he adds, "and to every one that helps in the work and labors." "Let this," says he, "be a general rule: for I do not speak about them individually, but if there be any one like them, let him also have the same advantages." And therefore when he begins to commend, he calls upon themselves as witnesses, saying, "I beseech you, you know the house of Stephanas." "For you also yourselves are aware," says he, "how they labor, and have no need to learn from us."
