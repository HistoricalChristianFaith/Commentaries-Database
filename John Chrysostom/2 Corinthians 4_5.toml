"For we preach not ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake."

And what is the nature of the connection there? What has this in common with what has been said? He either hints at them  as exalting themselves, and persuading the disciples to name themselves after them: as he said in the former Epistle, "I am of Paul and I of Apollos;" or else another thing of the gravest character. What then is this? Seeing that they waged fierce war against them, and plotted against them on every side; 'Is it,' he says, 'with us ye fight and war? [Nay but] with Him that is preached by us, "for we preach not ourselves." I am a servant, I am [but] a minister even of those who receive the Gospel, transacting every thing for Another, and for His glory doing whatsover I do. So that in warring against me you throw down what is His. For so far am I from turning to my own personal advantage any part of the Gospel, that I will not refuse to be even your servant for Christ's sake; seeing it seemed good to Him so to honor you, seeing He so loved you and did all things for you.' Wherefore also he says, "and ourselves your servants for Christ's sake." Do you see a soul pure from glory? 'For in truth,' says he, 'we not only do not take to ourselves  anything of our Master's, but even to you we submit ourselves for His sake.'
