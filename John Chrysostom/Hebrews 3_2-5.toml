Being about to place him before Moses in comparison, Paul led his discourse to the law of the high priesthood; for they all had a high esteem for Moses.… Therefore he begins from the flesh and goes up to the Godhead, where there was no longer any comparison. He began from the flesh, from his human nature, by assuming for a time the equality, and says, “as Moses also was faithful in all God’s house.” Nor does he at first show his superiority, lest the hearers should start away and straightway stop their ears. For although they were believers, yet nevertheless they still had strong feeling of conscience as to Moses.
