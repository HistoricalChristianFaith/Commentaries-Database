"For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf." It is high praise when the teacher boasted, for he saith, "I was not put to shame." I therefore rejoiced, because ye showed yourselves to be amended and proved my words by your deeds. So that the honor accruing to me was twofold; first, in that ye had made progress; next, in that I was not found to fall short of the truth. "But as we spake always to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth." Here he alludes to something further. As we spake all things among you in truth, (for it is probable that he had also spoken to them much in praise of this man,) so also, what we said of you to Titus has been proved true.
