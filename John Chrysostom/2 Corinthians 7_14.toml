It is high praise when a teacher boasts that his pupils have not put him to shame. Paul even adds that after he had boasted about the Corinthians to Titus they had not let him down.

"For if in anything I have gloried to him on your behalf."

It is high praise when the teacher boasted, for he says, "I was not put to shame." I therefore rejoiced, because ye showed yourselves to be amended and proved my words by your deeds. So that the honor accruing to me was twofold; first, in that you had made progress; next, in that I was not found to fall short of the truth.

2 Corinthians 7:14. "But as we spoke always to you in truth, so our glorying also which I made before Titus was found to be truth."

Here he alludes to something further. As we spoke all things among you in truth, (for it is probable that he had also spoken to them much in praise of this man ,) so also, what we said of you to Titus has been proved true.
