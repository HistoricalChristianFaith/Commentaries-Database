Observe the customary encomiums again. "And Lucius, and Jason, and Sosipater my kinsmen."

This Jason Luke also mentions, and sets before us his manliness also, when he says, that "they drew" him "to the rulers of the city, crying," etc. [Acts 17:5] And it is likely that the others too were men of note. For he does not mention relations barely, unless they were also like him in religiousness.
