"And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul: so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them." Not touched the wearer only and so were healed, but also receiving them, they laid them upon the sick and so healed them. "He that believeth on Me," saith Christ, "doeth greater works than those which I do." This, and the miracle of the shadows is what He meant in those words. And look, no sooner is the trial from those without over, than this from the demons begins. Mark the infatuated Jewish hardness. Having seen his garments working miracles, they paid no heed to it. What could be greater than this? But, on the contrary, it resulted in just the opposite effect. If any of the heathens believe not, having seen the very dust working these effects, let him believe.
