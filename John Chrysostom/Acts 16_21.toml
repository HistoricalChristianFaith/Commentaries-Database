Observe, how they do not attend even to the demon, but look only to one thing, their covetousness. But observe them (Paul and Silas), how they do not answer, nor plead for themselves; (b) For when, says he, I am weak, then am I strong. My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness 2 Corinthians 12:9: so that by reason of their gentleness also they should be admired. (a) And the magistrates, etc., charging the jailer to keep them safely

What do you say? Do you believe the demon? Does not he say here, “servants of the most high God”? You say, “They are disturbing our city.” He says that they proclaim to you a way of salvation. You say, “They are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to adopt”; see how they do not even listen to the demon but are influenced by greed.
