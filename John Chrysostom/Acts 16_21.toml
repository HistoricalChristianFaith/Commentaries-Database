What do you say? Do you believe the demon? Does not he say here, “servants of the most high God”? You say, “They are disturbing our city.” He says that they proclaim to you a way of salvation. You say, “They are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to adopt”; see how they do not even listen to the demon but are influenced by greed.
