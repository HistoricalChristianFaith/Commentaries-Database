What do you say? Do you believe the demon? Does not he say here, "servants of the most high God"? You say, "They are disturbing our city." He says that they proclaim to you a way of salvation. You say, "They are advocating customs that are not lawful for us to adopt"; see how they do not even listen to the demon but are influenced by greed.

"And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans." They made a charge of treason of it. Why did they not say, Because they cast out the demon, they were guilty of impiety against God? For this was a defeat to them: but instead of that, they have recourse to a charge of treason: like the Jews when they said, "We have no king but Caesar: whoso maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar."
