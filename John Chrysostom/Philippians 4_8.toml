"Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things."

Whatever is pure is the contrary of “thinking earthly thoughts.” “Whatever is honorable” is the contrary of those “whose god is their belly.”
