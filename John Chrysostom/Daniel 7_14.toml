What, I ask, is more obvious than these words? “And all the peoples, tribes and tongues will serve him.” See how he embraced every nation of the world. See how he took the judge’s seat and power. Lest you should think that this is temporary, he says, “These things will not pass away, and his kingdom will not perish” but will stay and remain. But if you doubt, you can be persuaded by considering the matter. Do you see the equality of honor he has with the Father? Since the Son appeared after the Father, he says that the Son came with the clouds. But it is clear from the very clouds that he had existed before then, if indeed he came on them. “And honor was conferred on him,” namely, the power that he had. “And the peoples, tribes and tongues will serve him.” Indeed, he had dominion previously, but then he will take that dominion that he had obtained. For just as you understand the hair of the Father and the other aspects of the vision, so you must understand this part of the vision. When you hear “it was given” and other similar things, you will not think in human terms about the Son or think lowly of him. For though you saw an old man, you did not think that he was an old man, so also you must think about the other things. Do not seek crystal clarity among the prophets, where you will find instead shadows and riddles, just as you do not seek constant light in a thunderbolt. Instead, it suffices if light appears for just a bit.
