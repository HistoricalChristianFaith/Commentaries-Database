After that he returns and says to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour?” They all were sleeping. He admonishes Peter. He is hinting at him in what he said, especially in the words “with me.” They are not employed without reason. It is as though he had said, “So you are the one who is ready to lay down your life for me, and you could not watch with me for one hour!” What follows also suggests the same admonition: “Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.” He is again instructing them not to be self-confident but contrite in mind, to be humble and to refer everything to God.

And at one time we find him addressing them all together and at another time Peter. He says, “Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat, but I have prayed for you.” Then he says to all in common, “Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.” He is in every way encouraging them to be resolute and strong in these convictions. Then, that he might not seem to make his language altogether condemnatory, he says, “The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” For no matter how much you might wish to despise death, you will not be able to do so until God extends his hand. For the carnal mind draws you downAnd again he prayed in the same way, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.”
