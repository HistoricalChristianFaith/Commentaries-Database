"Thy money perish, because thou hast imagined that the gift of God is to be purchased with money." Why had not these received the Holy Ghost, when baptized? How was it then that they did not strike him dead, as they did Ananias and Sapphira? Because even in the old times, he that gathered sticks on the sabbath-day was put to death as a warning to others and in no other instance did any suffer the same fate. So too on the present occasion, "Peter said to him, Thy money perish, because thou hast imagined that the gift of God is to be purchased with money."

"Thy money with thee to perdition": since thou hast not used it as it ought to be used. These are not words of imprecation, but of chastisement. "To thee," he says, be it to thee: being such. As if one should say, Let it perish along with thy purpose. Hast thou so mean conceptions of the gift of God, that thou hast imagined it to be altogether a thing of man? It is not this. Wherefore also Peter well calls the affair a gift: "Thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money."

"For thine heart is not right in the sight of God." Dost thou see how he does all of malice? To be simple, however, was the thing needed. Dost thou observe how on all occasions they are clean from money?
