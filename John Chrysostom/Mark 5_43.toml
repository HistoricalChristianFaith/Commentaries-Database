Or else, to take away all display, He suffered not all to be with Him; that, however, He might leave behind Him witnesses of His divine power, He chose His three chief disciples and the father and mother of the damsel, as being necessary above all. And He restores life to the damsel both by His hand, and by word of mouth. Wherefore it says, “And He took the damsel by the hand, and said unto her, Talitha cumi; which is, being interpreted, Damsel, I say unto thee, Arise. "For the hand of Jesus, having a quickening power, quickens the dead body, and His voice raises her as she is lying. Wherefore it follows, “And straightway the damsel arose and walked.”.
Hom. in Matt., 81: To show that Hehad raised her really, and not only to the eye of fancy.
