If this man, because he heard himself called “the voice of a god, and not of man!” suffered such a fate, even though he said nothing, much more would Christ have suffered, were he not God. For he was always saying such things as “these words of mine are not mine,” “angels minister to me,” etc. That man, then, ended his life in shame and misery, and no more was seen of him.
