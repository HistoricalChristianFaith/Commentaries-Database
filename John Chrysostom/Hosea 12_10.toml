How is it, then, that John says, “No one has ever seen God”? He says this so that you may know that he is speaking of a clear knowledge and a perfect comprehension of God. All the cases cited were instances of God’s condescension and accommodation. That no one of those prophets saw God’s essence in its pure state is clear from the fact that each one saw him in a different way. God is a simple being; he is not composed of parts; he is without form or figure. But all these prophets saw different forms and figures. God proved this very thing through the mouth of another prophet. And he persuaded those other prophets that they did not see his essence in its exact nature when he said, “I have multiplied visions, and by the ministries of the prophets I was represented.” What God was saying was, “I did not show my very essence, but I came down in condescension and accommodated myself to the weakness of their eyes.” However, John does not say only of humanity that “no one has ever seen God.” This was proved by what I have said—I mean by the prophetic utterance that states, “I have multiplied visions, and by the ministries of the prophets I was represented.” Against the Anomoeans, Homily

How is it, then, that John said, “No one has at any time seen God”? He was affirming that all those instances were manifestations of his humbling of himself, not the vision of pure Being itself. If they had actually seen the very nature of God, they would not have beheld it under different appearances. For that which is itself simple, and without shape, and not made up of parts, and not restricted by limits, does not sit or stand or walk about, since all these are functions of material bodies. However, he alone knows how he exists. Now, to show this, God the Father declared by one of the prophets, “I have multiplied visions, and by the hands of the prophets I have used similitudes,” that is, “I reached out for the lowly. I did not appear as I was in myself.” His Son was soon to appear to us in the guise of real flesh. But in the prophets he gave them experience of this beforehand by allowing them to see something of the substance of God in the way in which it was possible for them to see him.
