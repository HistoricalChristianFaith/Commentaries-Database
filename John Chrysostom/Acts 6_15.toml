"And all that sat in the council, looking steadfastly on him, saw his face as it had been the face of an angel." So possible is it even for one in a lower degree to shine. For what, I ask, had this man less than the Apostles? He lacked not miracles, and great was the boldness he exhibited. "They saw His face," it is said, "as it had been the face of an angel." For this was his grace, this was the glory of Moses. God made him thus gracious of visage, now that he was about to say somewhat, thus at once by his very look to awe them. For there are, yes, there are faces full-fraught with spiritual grace, lovely to them that love, awful to haters and enemies. It mentions also the reason, why they suffered his oration.

But to show that it was not in the nature of such a man to speak such things, and harshly, "Then all," it says, "which were in the council, looking steadfastly upon him, saw his face, as it had been the face of an angel": so mild was he even in countenance. For, in cases where persons were not falsely accused, Scripture mentions nothing of this kind: but as in this case it was all false accusation, with reason does God rectify it by the very look of the man. For the Apostles indeed were not falsely accused, but were forbidden: but this man is falsely accused: and therefore before all else his countenance pleads for him. This abashed even the priest.

"They saw his face as it had been the face of an angel." "Full of faith and of power": which is also the character given of Barnabas "he was a good man, full of faith and of the Holy Ghost." Whence we learn that the sincere and innocent are, above all others, the men to be saved, and that these same are also more gracious.
