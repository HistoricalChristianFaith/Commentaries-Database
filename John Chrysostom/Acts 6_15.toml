“And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.” Thus it is possible even for one who is on a lower level to shine. For what did this man have, I ask, that was less than the apostles? He did not lack for miracles, and great was the boldness he showed. “They saw,” it says, “that his face was like the face of an angel.” This was his grace. This was the glory of Moses. Gracious did God make him, now that he was about to speak, so that immediately by his very look he might strike them with amazement. For indeed there are faces full of spiritual grace, lovely to behold for those who desire them and commanding respect from enemies who hate them.
