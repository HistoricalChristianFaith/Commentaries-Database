But in another place he says, Hearing the voice, but seeing no man. Acts 9:7 It is not at variance: no, there were two voices, that of Paul and the Lord's voice: in that place, the writer means Paul's voice (Hom. xix. p. 124, note 2); as in fact (Paul) here adds, The voice of Him that spoke unto me. Seeing no man: he does not say, that they did not see the light: but, no man, that is, none speaking. And good reason that it should be so, since it behooved him alone to have that voice vouchsafed unto him. For if indeed they also had heard it, (the miracle) would not have been so great. Since persons of grosser minds are persuaded more by sight, those saw the light, and were afraid. In fact, neither did the light take so much effect on them, as it did on him: for it even blinded his eyes: by that which befell him, (God) gave them also an opportunity of recovering their sight, if they had the mind. It seems to me at least, that their not believing was providentially ordered, that they might be unexceptionable witnesses. And he said unto me it says, I am Jesus of Nazareth, Whom you persecute. comp. Acts 9:5 Well is the name of the city (Nazareth) also added, that they might recognize (the Person): moreover, the Apostles also spoke thus. ch. 2:22; 4:10; 10:38 And Himself bore witness, that they were persecuting Him. And they that were with me saw indeed the light, and were afraid, but they heard not the voice of Him that spoke to me. And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told you of all things which are appointed for you to do. And when I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus. And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews which dwelt there, came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him. Enter into the city, it says, and there it shall be spoken to you of all that is appointed for you to do.
