"And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth. Now when we had discovered Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed into Syria, and landed at Tyre." He came to Lycia, and having left Cyprus, he sailed down to Tyre. Possibly that ship in which they had come was making a stay there: wherefore they shifted to another, and not having found one going to Caesarea, but finding this for Phenice, they embarked in it and pursued their voyage, having left Cyprus also and Syria: but the expression, "having left it on the left hand," is not said simply in that meaning, but that they made speed not to get to Syria either.
