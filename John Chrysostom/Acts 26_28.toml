Paul did not understand what the phrase ἐ ν ὀλίγῳ meant: he thought it meant ἐ ξ ὀλιγου (i.e. with little cost or trouble), wherefore also he answers (as) to this: so unlearned was he. And he said not, I do not wish (that), but, I pray that not only thou, but also all that hear. Mark how free from flattery his speech is.— I pray that this day they may be all such as I am, except these bonds.
