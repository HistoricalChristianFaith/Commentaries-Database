Do you behold the glory of His inheritance? That "He has raised us up together," is plain. But that He "has made us sit with Him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus," how does this hold? It holds as truly, as that He has raised us together. For as yet no one is actually raised,  excepting that inasmuch as as the Head has risen, we also are raised, just as in the history, when Jacob did obeisance, his wife also did obeisance to Joseph. [Genesis 37:9-10] And so in the same way "has He also made us to sit with Him." For since the Head sits, the body sits also with it, and therefore he adds "in Christ Jesus." Or again, if it means, not this, it means that by the laver of Baptism He has "raised us up with Him." How then in that case has He made "us to sit with Him?" Because, says he, "if we suffer we shall also reign with Him," [2 Timothy 2:12] if we be dead with Him we shall also live with Him. Truly there is need of the Spirit and of revelation, in order to understand the depth of these mysteries. And then that you may have no distrust about the matter, observe what he adds further.
