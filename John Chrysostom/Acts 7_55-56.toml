He mentions the cause of his angelic appearance: "But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God." And in this manner He appeared to him: that, were it but so, the Jews might receive Him: for since the idea of His sitting at the right hand of God was offensive to them, for the present he brings forward only what relates to His Resurrection. This is the reason also why his face was glorified. For God, being merciful, desired to make their machinations the means of recalling them unto Himself.

And when he said, "I see the heavens opened, they stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord." And yet in what respect are these things deserving of accusation? "Upon him," the man who has wrought such miracles, the man who has prevailed over all in speech, the man who can hold such discourse! As if they had got the very thing they wanted, they straightway give full scope to their rage.
