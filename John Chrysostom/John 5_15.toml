Again observe him continuing in the same right feeling. He says not, This is he who said, Take up your bed, but when they continually advanced this seeming charge, he continually puts forward the defense, again declaring his Healer, and seeking to attract and attach others to Him. For he was not so unfeeling as after such a benefit and charge to betray his Benefactor, and to speak as he did with an evil intention. Had he been a wild beast, had he been something unlike a man and of stone, the benefit and the fear would have been enough to restrain him, since, having the threat lodged within, he would have dreaded lest he should suffer a worse thing, having already received the greatest pledges  of the power of his Physician. Besides, had he wished to slander Him, he would have said nothing about his own cure, but would have mentioned and urged against Him the breach of the Sabbath. But this is not the case, surely it is not; the words are words of great boldness and candor; he pro  claims his Benefactor no less than the blind man did. For what said he? He made clay, and anointed my eyes John 9:6; and so this man of whom we now speak, It is Jesus who made me whole.
