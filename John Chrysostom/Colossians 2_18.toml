For [this man] has not seen angels and yet acts as though he had. Therefore Paul says, “vainly puffed up by his carnal mind,” not about any true fact. About this doctrine, he is puffed up and puts forward a false humility. He acts and thinks carnally, not spiritually. His reasoning is simply human reason alone.

The term meaning “to rob you of your prize” is employed when one person is victorious, but the prize of victory is given to another, when though a victor, you are robbed of the victor’s prize.

But what is the general drift of Paul’s words? There are some who maintain that we must be brought near by angels, not by Christ; for Christ to do so would seem too great an act on our behalf. Paul continually emphasizes what has been done by Christ.
