For what is really marvelous is this, that though they were held in prison and made answerable to charges, though they were imprisoned and beaten, their enemies were still at a loss and in a quandary, since the very things by which they expected to prevail brought about their own downfall. For neither king nor people, neither ranks of demons nor the devil himself had the power to get the better of the apostles, but all were overcome at a very great disadvantage, seeing everything they had planned against them fall on their own heads. Because of this he also says, “we are more than conquerors.” For this rule of victory was new: to prevail through their adversaries and never be overcome, but go forth to these struggles as masters of the end.

"What shall we do?" O the folly! to suppose that those who had tasted of the conflict, would now take fright at it: to expect, impotent as their efforts had proved in the beginning, to effect something new, after such a specimen of oratory as had been exhibited! The more they wished to hinder, the more the business grew upon their hands. But what say they? "For that indeed a notable miracle hath been done by them is manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny it."
