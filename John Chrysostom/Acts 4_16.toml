For what is really marvelous is this, that though they were held in prison and made answerable to charges, though they were imprisoned and beaten, their enemies were still at a loss and in a quandary, since the very things by which they expected to prevail brought about their own downfall. For neither king nor people, neither ranks of demons nor the devil himself had the power to get the better of the apostles, but all were overcome at a very great disadvantage, seeing everything they had planned against them fall on their own heads. Because of this he also says, “we are more than conquerors.” For this rule of victory was new: to prevail through their adversaries and never be overcome, but go forth to these struggles as masters of the end.
