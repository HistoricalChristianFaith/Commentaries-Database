[Hebrews 10:38] "Now the just" (he says) "shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, My soul shall have no pleasure in him." This is a great encouragement when one shows that they have succeeded in the whole matter and are losing it through a little indolence. [Hebrews 10:39] "But we are not of them that draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul."
