“He will not let me catch my breath.” That is, I am filled with a multitude of afflictions. “He has filled me with bitterness, for indeed he is superior in power. Who, then, shall resist his judgment?” Job does not want to say simply that God is superior to him in power but also that God is able to do whatever he wants.
