Let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth, is said as an extreme expression, as much as to say, If it were possible, that you should not know yourself, and that your very hands should be hid from your sight, that is what you should most strive after.

If therefore you desire spectators of your good deeds, behold you have not merely Angels and Archangels, but the God of the universe.
