This is similar to what he said earlier, “By this shall all know that you are my disciples, if you love one another.” And how will they believe this? “Because,” he says, “you are a God of peace.” And, if therefore the [disciples] keep that same peace that they have learned [from me], their hearers will know the teacher by the disciples. But if they quarrel, people will deny that they are the disciples of a God of peace and will not allow that I, not being peaceable, have been sent from you. Do you see how he proves his unanimity with the Father to the very end?
