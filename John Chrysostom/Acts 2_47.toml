How had they favor with all the people? On account of their alms deeds. For do not look to the fact, that the chief priests for envy and spite rose up against them, but rather consider that they had favor with the people.— And the Lord added to the Church daily (ἐ πὶ τὸ αὐτό) [together] such as should be saved.— And all that believed were together. Once more, the unanimity, the charity, which is the cause of all good things!
