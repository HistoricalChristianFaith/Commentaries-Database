And she being instructed beforehand by her mother, said, “Give me here John the Baptist’s head on a platter.”Her reproach is twofold: first, that she danced, then that she pleased him and so pleased him as to obtain even murder for her reward.
Do you see how savage he was, how senseless, how foolish? He puts himself under the obligation of an oath while to her he gives full power over her request.
But when Herod saw the evil actually ensuing, “he was sorry,” it is said. Yet in the first instance he had put him in prison. Why then is he sorry? Such is the nature of virtue. Even among the wicked admiration and praises are its due. But alas for her madness! When she also ought to admire, yes, to bow down to him for trying to redress her wrong, she rather even helps to arrange the plot, lays a snare and asks a diabolical favor.
But he was afraid “for the oath’s sake,” it is said, “and those that sat with him at dinner.” Why did he not fear that which is far more fearful? Surely if Herod was afraid of having witnesses to perjury, much more should he fear having so many witnesses of a murder so lawless.
