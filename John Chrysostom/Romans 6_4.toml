Here Paul hints at the subject of the resurrection along with the duty of a careful walk. In what way? He means: Do you believe that Christ died and that he rose again? If so, then believe that the same will happen to you.… For if you have shared in his cross and burial, how much more will you share in his resurrection as well? For now that the greater is done away with (i.e., sin), it is not right to go on doubting about the lesser, viz., the doing away of death. HOMILIES ON ROMANS 10.SEVERIAN:“Newness of life” means that we have put off the old life of sin and that our rebirth promises a new way of life.
