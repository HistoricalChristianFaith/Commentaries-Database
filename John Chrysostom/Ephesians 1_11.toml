Paul earnestly endeavors on all occasions to display the unspeakable loving-kindness of God towards us, to the utmost of his power. For that it is impossible to do so adequately, hear his own words. O! The depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God; how unsearchable are His judgments, and His ways past tracing out. Romans 11:33 Still, notwithstanding, so far as it is possible, he does display it. What then is this which he is saying; In whom also we were made a heritage, being predestinated? Above he used the word, He chose us; here he says, we were made a heritage. But inasmuch as a lot is a matter of chance, not of deliberate choice, nor of virtue, (for it is closely allied to ignorance and accident, and oftentimes passing over the virtuous, brings forward the worthless into notice,) observe how he corrects this very point: having been foreordained, says he, according to the purpose of Him who works all things. That is to say, not merely have we been made a heritage, as, again, we have not merely been chosen, (for it is God who chooses,) and so neither have we merely been allotted, (for it is God who allots,) but it is according to a purpose. This is what he says also in the Epistle to the Romans, Romans 8:28-30 To them that are called according to His purpose; and whom He called, them He also justified, and whom He justified, them he also glorified. Having first used the expression, to them that are called according to a purpose, and at the same time wishing to declare their privilege compared with the rest of mankind, he speaks also of inheritance by lot, yet so as not to divest them of free will. That point then, which more properly belongs to happy fortune, is the very point he insists upon. For this inheritance by lot depends not on virtue, but, as one might say, on fortuitous circumstances. It is as though he had said, lots were cast, and He has chosen us; but the whole is of deliberate choice. Men predestinated, that is to say, having chosen them to Himself, He has separated. He saw us, as it were, chosen by lot before we were born. For marvellous is the foreknowledge of God, and acquainted with all things before their beginning.

But mark now how on all occasions he takes pains to point out, that it is not the result of any change of purpose, but that these matters had been thus modeled from the very first, so that we are in no wise inferior to the Jews in this respect; and how, in consequence, he does every thing with this view. How then is it that Christ Himself says, I was not sent, but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel? Matthew 15:24 And said again to his disciples, Go not into any way of the Gentiles, and enter not into any city of the Samaritans. Matthew 10:5 And Paul again himself says, It was necessary that the word of God should first be spoken to you. Seeing ye thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles. Acts 13:46 These expressions, I say, are used with this design, that no one may suppose that this work came to pass incidentally only. According to the purpose, he says, of Him who works all things after the counsel of His will. That is to say, He had no after workings; having modeled all things from the very first, thus he leads forward all things according to the counsel of His will. So that it was not merely because the Jews did not listen that He called the Gentiles, nor was it of mere necessity, nor was it on any inducement arising from them.

Since inheritance is a matter of fortune, not of choice or virtue, it often depends on obscure or fortuitous circumstances, overlooking virtue. It may bring to the fore those who are of no account. But notice how Paul qualifies this statement.… He says “have been destined,” that is, God has set us apart for himself. It is as if to say God saw us before we became heirs. The foreknowledge of God is wonderful and sees all things before they occur.
