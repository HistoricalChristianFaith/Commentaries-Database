Ver. 23. "But foolish and unlearned questions avoid, knowing that they do gender strifes."

Do you see how he everywhere draws him off from questions; not that he was not able to overthrow them; for he was well able. For had he not been able he would have said, Be diligent, that you may be able to refute them; as when he says, "Give attendance to reading, for by so doing you shall both save yourself and them that hear you." [1 Timothy 4:13-16] But he knew that it was useless to enter at all into these disputes, that there will be no end of it, save contentions, enmities, insults, and reproaches. These "questions" therefore "avoid"; so that there are other questions, some relating to the Scriptures, some to other things.
