"I thank God, speaking  with tongues more than ye all."

And this he does also in another place intending, namely, to take away the advantages of Judaism and to show that henceforth they are nothing, he begins by declaring that himself had been endowed with them, yea, and that in very great excess; and then he calls them "loss," thus saying, "If any man thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I more: circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee; as touching zeal, persecuting the Church; as touching the righteousness which is the law, found blameless." [Philippians 3:4-7] And then, having signified himself to have the advantage of all, he says, "Howbeit what things were gain to me, those have I counted loss for Christ." So also he does here, saying, "I speak with tongues more than ye all." Do not therefore glory as though you only had the gift. For I also possess it, yea more than you.

Paul claims the gift for himself in order to show how unimportant it is. He does the same thing elsewhere when he points out that he is a better-qualified Jew than his critics are..
