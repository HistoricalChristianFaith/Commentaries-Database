Then (to show) God's fullness of ways and means (εὐμήχανον), In which time, it says, Moses was born, and was exceeding fair. Acts 7:20 If the former circumstance was wonderful, that Joseph was sold by his brethren, here again is another circumstance more wonderful still, that the king nourished the very person who was to overthrow his dominion, being himself the person that was to perish. Do you observe all along a figurative enacting, so to say, of the resurrection of the dead? But it is not the same thing for God himself to do a thing, and for a thing to come to pass in connection with man's purpose (προαίρεσις). For these things indeed were in connection with man's purpose [but the Resurrection by itself, independently.]

And when he was cast out, Pharaoh's daughter took him up, and nourished him for her own son.
