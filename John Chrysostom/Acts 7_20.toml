"In which time," it says, "Moses was born, and was exceeding fair." If the former circumstance was wonderful, that Joseph was sold by his brethren, here again is another circumstance more wonderful still, that the king "nourished" the very person who was to overthrow his dominion, being himself the person that was to perish. Do you observe all along a figurative enacting, so to say, of the resurrection of the dead? But it is not the same thing for God himself to do a thing, and for a thing to come to pass in connection with man's purpose. For these things indeed were in connection with man's purpose, but the Resurrection by itself, independently.

"In which time Moses was born and was exceeding fair." This is the wonder, that he who is to be their champion, is born, neither after nor before, these things, but in the very midst of the storm. "And was nourished up in his father's house three months." But when man's help was despaired of, and they cast him forth, then did God's benefit shine forth conspicuous.
