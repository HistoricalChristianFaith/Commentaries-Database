Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion of almsgiving, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but you would not. But it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving. Unto the brethren which dwelt in Judæa; for they were enduring great hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.

Do you see how for them the famine was an encouragement to salvation, an opportunity to give alms and a harbinger of many blessings? And so it could have been for you, if you were so inclined. But you were not. The famine was foretold so that they might prepare themselves beforehand for almsgiving. For they were enduring terrible hardships, but before this they were not suffering from famine. And they sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. “The disciples,” it says, “each according to his ability.” Do you see that as soon as they believed, they bore fruit not only for their own people, but also for those far away?
