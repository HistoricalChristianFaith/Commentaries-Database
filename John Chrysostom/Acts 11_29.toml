Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion of almsgiving, a harbinger of many blessing. And (so it might have been) to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but you would not. But it is predicted, that they might be prepared beforehand for almsgiving. Unto the brethren which dwelt in Jud√¶a; for they were enduring great hardships, but before this, they were not suffering from famine. Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
