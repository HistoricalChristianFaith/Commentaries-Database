"Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren which dwelt in Judea." Mark how the famine becomes to them the means of salvation, an occasion of alms-giving, a harbinger of many blessings. And so it might have been to you, one may say, if you were so minded, but ye would not.

They did not wait for the famine to come, but before this they sent: "according as each had the ability." And observe, among the Apostles, others are put in charge with this trust, but here Paul and Barnabas. For this was no small order of Providence. Besides, it was the beginning, and it was not fit they should be offended.

"As each had the ability, they sent." But now, none does this, although there is a famine more grievous than that. For the cases are not alike, for all to bear the calamity in common, and, while all the rest abound, for the poorer to be famishing. And the expression shows that the givers also were poor, for, it says, "as each of them had the means." A twofold famine, even as the abundance is twofold: a severe famine, a famine not of hearing the word of the Lord, but of being nourished by alms. Then, both the poor in Judea enjoyed the benefit, and so did those in Antioch who gave their money; yea, these more than those.
