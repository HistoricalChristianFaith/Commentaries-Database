Both above, when going to do this miracle, He first healed them that were maimed in body, and here He does the self-same thing; from the healing of the blind and the lame, He goes on to this again.

But why might it be, that then His disciples said, Send away the multitude, but now they said not so; and this, though three days had past? Either being themselves improved by this time, or seeing that the people had no great sense of hunger; for they were glorifying God for the things that were done.

But see how in this instance too He does not proceed at once to the miracle, but calls them forth thereunto. For the multitudes indeed who had come out for healing dared not ask for the loaves; but He, the benevolent and provident one, gives even to them that ask not, and says unto His disciples, I have compassion, and will not send them away fasting.

For lest they should say that they came having provisions for the way, He says, They continue with me now three days; so that even if they came having any, it is all spent. For therefore He Himself did not this on the first and second day, but when all had been consumed by them, in order that having first been in want, they might more eagerly accept His work.

Therefore He says, Lest they faint in the way; implying both their distance to be great, and that they had nothing left.

Then, if you are not willing to send them away fasting, wherefore do you not work the miracle? That by this question and by their answer He might make the disciples more heedful, and that they might show forth their faith, coming unto Him, and saying, Make loaves.

But not even so did they understand the motive of His question; wherefore afterwards He says to them, as Mark relates, Are your hearts so hardened? Having eyes, see ye not? And having ears, hear ye not? Mark 8:17-18

Since, if this were not so, wherefore does He speak to the disciples, and signify the multitude's worthiness to receive a benefit, and add also the pity He Himself feels?

But Matthew says, that after this He also rebuked them, saying, O you of little faith, do ye not yet understand, nor remember the five loaves of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Nor the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many baskets ye took up? Matthew 16:8-10 So completely do the evangelists harmonize one with another.
