and not as we who pass our time in lamentations and tears, in our calamities; but with more fearlessness they passed their time, as having got to a distance from those hindering them, and as being among men not afraid of the Jews: which also helped. And they came to Cyprus, where they had the sea between them, and greater freedom from anxiety: so they made no account of the fear of men, but (still) they gave the precedence to the regard of the Law: they spoke to Jews only. But there were in Antioch certain men of Cyprus and Cyrene: these, of all others, least cared for the Jews: who spoke unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus.

Acts 13:46 Accordingly they went about, preaching to Gentiles also.

The persecution brought a not inconsiderable success. “For by turning everything to their good, God cooperates with those who love him.” Had their purpose been to work zealously to establish the church, they would not have done anything different.
