See how this was sufficient to aggravate the good man’s fear. Far from realizing precisely his brother’s intent, Jacob was terrified to learn the number of those approaching and suspected that they were bent on hostilities and so wanted to catch up with him. Note the text says, “Jacob was in a state of fear and perplexity.” Fear disturbed his thinking, and instead of knowing what to do, he was at a loss; hence Jacob was terrified of almost everything, and, with the prospect of death before him, “he divided all the people with him into two camps.” You see, he said, “If he comes upon one camp and attacks it, the other will have the chance of being saved.” While it was Jacob’s fear and great terror that suggested this, … seeing himself caught in a trap he had recourse to the invincible Lord and invoked the promises made him by the God of all, as if to say to him, “Now the time has come for a good man to enjoy your complete assistance on account of the virtue of his forebears and the promises made by you.”
