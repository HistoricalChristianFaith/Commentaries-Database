After that He comes and says to Peter, as it is said, What, couldest thou not watch one hour with me? Mark 14:37 All were sleeping, and He re bukes Peter, hinting at him, in what He spoke. And the words, with me, are not employed without reason; it is as though He had said, You could not watch with me one hour, and will you lay down your life for me? And what follows also, intimates this self-same thing.
