“And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.” Look at Peter’s unassuming conduct, look at his moderation, how he does not stay with this lady or with someone of prominence but with a tanner. By all his actions he leads people to humility. He allows neither the poor to be ashamed nor the great to be elated. For they needed his instruction, those who believed through the miracles.
