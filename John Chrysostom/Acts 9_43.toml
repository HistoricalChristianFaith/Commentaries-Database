"And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner." Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor the great to be elated! "Many days;" for they needed his instruction, who had believed through the miracles.
