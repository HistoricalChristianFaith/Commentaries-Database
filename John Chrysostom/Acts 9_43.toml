Mark the unassuming conduct, mark the moderation of Peter, how he does not make his abode with this lady, or some other person of distinction, but with a tanner: by all his acts leading men to humility, neither suffering the mean to be ashamed, nor the great to be elated! Many days; for they needed his instruction, who had believed through the miracles.— Let us look then again at what has been said.

“And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.” Look at Peter’s unassuming conduct, look at his moderation, how he does not stay with this lady or with someone of prominence but with a tanner. By all his actions he leads people to humility. He allows neither the poor to be ashamed nor the great to be elated. For they needed his instruction, those who believed through the miracles.
