He states also the reason, why he gives thanks that he had baptized no one. What then is this reason? "Lest anyone should say that you were baptized into my own name." Why, did he mean that they said this in those other cases? Not at all; but, "I fear," says he, "lest the disease should proceed even to that. For if, when insignificant persons and of little worth baptize, a heresy arises, had I, the first announcer of Baptism, baptized many, it was likely that they forming a party, would not only call themselves by my name, but also ascribe the Baptism to me." For if from the inferiors so great an evil arose, from those of higher order it would perhaps have gone on to something far more grievous.
