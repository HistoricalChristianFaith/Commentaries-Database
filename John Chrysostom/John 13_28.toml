It is not easy to see how the disciples did not understand him when they had asked, “Who is he,” and he had replied, “He it is to whom I shall give the bread.” [How is it that they did not understand him], unless it was that he spoke too low to be heard and that John lay on his breast when he asked the question. In other words, he did it for the very reason that the traitor might not be made known.… For had Christ made him known … perhaps Peter would have killed him. And so it was, then, that none at the table knew what our Lord meant. But why didn’t John know? Because he could not conceive how a disciple could fall into such wickedness: he was far from such wickedness himself and therefore did not suspect it of others.… What they thought he meant we are told in what follows.
