3. Wonderful insensibility! How could it be that he was neither softened nor shamed; but rendered yet more shameless, went out. The do quickly, is not the expression of one commanding, nor advising, but of one reproaching, and showing him that He desired to correct him, but that since he was incorrigible, He let him go. And this, the Evangelist says, no man of those that sat at the table knew. Some one may perhaps find here a considerable difficulty, if, when the disciples had asked, Who is it? and He had answered, He to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it, they did not even so understand; unless indeed He spoke it secretly, so that no man should hear. For John on this very account, leaning by His breast, asked Him almost close to His ear, so that the traitor might not be made manifest; and Christ answered in like manner, so that not even then did He discover him. And though He spoke emphatically,  Friend, that you do, do quickly, even so they understood not. But he spoke thus to show that the things were true which had been said by Him to the Jews concerning His death. For He had said to them, I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again: and, No man takes it from Me. John 10:18 As long then as He would retain it, no man was able (to take it); but when He resigned it, then the action became easy. All this He implied when He said, That you do, do quickly. Yet not even then did He expose him,  for perhaps the others might have torn him in pieces, or Peter might have killed him. On this account no man at the table knew. Not even John? Not even he: for he could not have expected that a disciple would arrive  at such a pitch of wickedness. For since they were far from such iniquity themselves, they could not suspect such things concerning others. As before He had told them, I speak not of you all John 13:18, yet did not reveal the person; so here, they thought that it was said concerning some other matter.

It was night, says the Evangelist, when he went out. Why tellest thou me the time? That you may learn his forwardness, that not even the time restrained him from his purpose. Yet not even did this make him quite manifest,  for the others were at this time in confusion, occupied by fear and great distress, and they knew not the true reason of what had been said but supposed  that He spoke thus, in order that Judas might give somewhat to the poor. For He cared greatly for the poor, teaching us also to bestow much diligence on this thing. But they thought this, not without a cause, but because he had the bag. Yet no one appears to have brought money to Him; that the female disciples nourished Him of their substance, it has said, but this  it has nowhere intimated. Luke 8:3 But how did He who bade His disciples bear neither scrip, nor money, nor staff, Himself bear a bag to minister to the poor? That you may learn, that it behooves even him who is exceedingly needy and crucified, to be very careful on this point. For many things He did in the way of dispensation  for our instruction. The disciples then thought that He said this, that Judas should give something to the poor; and not even this shamed him, His not being willing even to the last day to make him a public example. We too ought to do the like, and not parade the sins of our companions, though they be incurable. For even after this He gave a kiss to the man who came to betray Him, and endured,  such an action as that was, and then proceeded to a thing of far greater daring,  the Cross itself,  to the death of shame, and there again He manifested His lovingkindness. And here He calls it glory, showing us that there is nothing so shameful and reproachful which makes not brighter him who goes to it, if it be done according to the will of God. At least after the going forth of Judas to the betraying, He says,

It is not easy to see how the disciples did not understand him when they had asked, “Who is he,” and he had replied, “He it is to whom I shall give the bread.” [How is it that they did not understand him], unless it was that he spoke too low to be heard and that John lay on his breast when he asked the question. In other words, he did it for the very reason that the traitor might not be made known.… For had Christ made him known … perhaps Peter would have killed him. And so it was, then, that none at the table knew what our Lord meant. But why didn’t John know? Because he could not conceive how a disciple could fall into such wickedness: he was far from such wickedness himself and therefore did not suspect it of others.… What they thought he meant we are told in what follows.
