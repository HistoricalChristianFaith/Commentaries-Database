Ver. 7. "In all things showing yourself a pattern of good works."

Let the elder women, he says, teach the younger, but do you yourself exhort young men to be soberminded. And let the luster of your life be a common school of instruction, a pattern of virtue to all, publicly exhibited, like some original model, containing in itself all beauties, affording examples whence those who are willing may easily imprint upon themselves any of its excellences.
