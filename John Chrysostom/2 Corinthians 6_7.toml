The things on the left refer to those things which seem to be painful, because it is these which bring the reward.

In the word of truth.

 A thing he says in many places, that 'we continued neither to handle the word of God deceitfully nor to adulterate it.'

In the power of God. That which he always does ascribing nothing to himself but the whole to God, and imputing whatsoever he has done aright to Him, this he has done here also. For since he uttered great things, and affirmed that he had manifested in all things an irreproachable life and exalted wisdom, he ascribes this to the Spirit and to God. For neither were those commonplace things which he had said. For if it be a difficult thing even for one who lives in quiet to do aright and be irreproachable, consider him who was harassed by so great temptations, and yet shone forth through all, what a spirit he was of! And yet he underwent not these alone, but even far more than these, as he mentions next. And what is indeed marvelous is, not that he was irreproachable though sailing in such mighty waves, nor that he endured all nobly, but all with pleasure even. Which things, all, he makes clear to us by the next words, saying,

By the armor of righteousness on the right and the left.

3. Do you see his self-possession of soul and well-strung spirit? For he shows that afflictions are arms not only which strike not down, but do even fortify and make stronger. And he calls those things 'left,' which seem to be painful; for such those are which bring with them the reward. Wherefore then does he call them thus? Either in conformity with the conception of the generality, or because God commanded us to pray that we enter not into temptation.

What saying thou? That you enjoy honor, and setting down this as a great thing? 'Yes,' he says. Why, forsooth? For to bear dishonor indeed is a great thing, but to partake of honor requires not a vigorous soul. Nay, it needs a vigorous and exceeding great soul, that he who enjoys it may not be thrown and break his neck. Wherefore he glories in this as well as in that, for he shone equally in both. But how is it a weapon of righteousness? Because that the teachers are held in honor induces many unto godliness. And besides, this is a proof of good works, and this glorifies God. And this is, further, an instance of the wise contrivance of God, that by things which are opposite He brings in the Preaching. For consider. Was Paul bound? This too was on behalf of the Gospel. For, says he, the things which happened unto me have fallen out unto the progress of the Gospel; so that most of the brethren, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word without fear. Philippians 1:12-14 Again, did he enjoy honor? This too again rendered them more forward. By evil report and good report. For not only did he bear those things nobly which happen to the body, the 'afflictions,' and whatever he enumerated, but those also which touch the soul; for neither are these wont to disturb slightly. Jeremiah at least having borne many temptations, gave in upon these, and when he was reproached, said, I will not prophesy, neither will I name the Name of the Lord.  Jeremiah 20:9 And David too many places complains of reproach. Isaiah also, after many things, exhorts concerning this, saying, Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye overcome by their reviling. Isaiah 51:7. Septuagint And again, Christ also to His disciples; When they shall speak all manner of evil against you falsely, rejoice and be exceeding glad, Matthew 5:11-12 He says, for great is your reward in heaven. Elsewhere too He says, And leap for joy. Luke 6:23 But He would not have made the reward so great, had not the contest been a great one. For in tortures the body also shares the anguish with the soul; for the pain is both of the body and of the soul; but here it is of the soul alone. Many at any rate have fallen by these alone, and have lost their own souls. And to Job also the reproaches of his friends appeared more grievous than the worms and the sores. For there is nothing, there is nothing more intolerable to those in affliction than a word capable of stinging the soul. Wherefore along with the perils and the toils he names these also, saying, By glory and dishonor. At any rate, many of the Jews also on account of glory derived from the many would not believe. For they feared, not lest they should be punished, but lest they should be put out of the synagogue. Wherefore He says, How can you believe which receive glory one of another? John 5:44 And we may see numbers who have indeed despised all dangers, but have been worsted by glory.

4. As deceivers, and yet true.

This is, by evil report and good report.
