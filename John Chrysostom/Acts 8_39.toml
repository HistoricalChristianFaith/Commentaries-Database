And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. But why did the Spirit of the Lord bear him away? Hereby the occurrence was shown to be more wonderful. Even then, the eunuch did not know him. Consequently this was done, that Philip might afterwards be a subject of wonder to him. For, it says, he went on his way rejoicing.

And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip; in order that the occurrence might be shown to be of God; that he might not consider it to be merely man. And he went, it says, on his way rejoicing. This hints, that he would have been grieved had he known: for the greatness of his joy, having had the Spirit also vouchsafed to him, he did not even see things present.

It was well and expedient therefore that the Spirit caught Philip away; else the eunuch would have desired to go with him, and Philip would have grieved him by declining to comply with his request, the time being not yet come. So that had he known him, he would not have been so delighted.
