Now it is likely that Isaac also made for there on account of his intention to continue on from there into Egypt; for proof of this, listen to what Scripture says: “God appeared to him and said, ‘Don’t go down into Egypt.’ ” I do not want you to make that long journey, he is saying, but to stay here. Instead of allowing you to experience that hardship, I am going to put into effect the promise made to your father; the promises to him will be fulfilled in you, and you will experience the pledges to him. “Don’t go down into Egypt but dwell in the land that I show you, and be a sojourner in that land.”
