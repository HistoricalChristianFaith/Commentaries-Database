For when being sorrowful they began to say, Is it I, Lord? He answered and said, He that dips with me in the dish, the same shall betray me. The Son of Man goes, as it is written of Him, but woe to the man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed. It had been good for that man if he had not been born.

Now some say that he was so bold as not to honor his Master, but to dip with Him: but to me Christ seems to have done this too, to shame him the more, and bring him over to a better disposition. For this act again has something more in it.

But these things we ought not to pass by at random, but they should be instilled in our minds, and wrath would find no place at any time.

For who, bearing in mind that supper, and the traitor sitting at meat with the Saviour of all, and Him who was to be betrayed thus meekly reasoning, would not put away all venom of wrath and anger? See at any rate how meekly He conducts Himself towards him, The Son of Man goes, as it is written of Him.

And these things again He said, both to restore the disciples, that they might not think the thing was a sign of weakness, and to amend the traitor.
