What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The man was uncircumcised. He had nothing in common with the Jews—they would all accuse him as a transgressor: “You went into the house of uncircumcised men, and ate with them”; this was a thing altogether offensive to them. Observe then what is providentially managed. [Peter] himself also says, “I have never eaten,” not being himself afraid—far be the thought from us—but it is so ordered by the Spirit, in order that he may have it to say in answer to those accusing him, that he did object: for it was altogether necessary for them to observe the law. He was in the act of being sent to the Gentiles: therefore that these also may not accuse him, see how many things are shaped [by the providence of God]. For, that it may not seem to be a mere fancy, “this was done three times.” He said, “Not so, Lord, for I have never eaten anything common or unclean. And the voice came to him, ‘What God has cleansed, you must not call common.’ ” It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the entire message is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these also. This is what the linen sheet denotes. The earth, then, and the wild beasts in it, are the Gentiles. The command, “Kill and eat,” denotes that he must go to them also; and that this is done three times denotes triune baptism.
