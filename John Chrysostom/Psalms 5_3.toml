Let those heed this who come to prayer only after countless activities.… “One must precede sunrise in giving you thanks,” Scripture says, remember, “and entreat you before the dawning of the day.” Now, you would not tolerate someone inferior to you preceding you in giving homage to the emperor; in this case, however, while the soul pays homage you are asleep, and you yield pride of place to creatures and do not anticipate the whole of creation that is made for you. You do not give him thanks; instead, when you get up, you wash your face and hands but ignore the fact your soul is uncleansed. Do you not realize that as the body is cleansed with water, so the soul is with prayer? So wash your soul before your body. Many evil stains besmirch it; expunge them by prayer. If, in fact, we hedged our mouth around in this fashion, we should lay a fine foundation for daily life.
