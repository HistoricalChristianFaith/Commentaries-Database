"Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death. not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them." Having assumed here two objections, he in the first place removes them. For what reason have you to say, he means, that you know not the things which ought to be done? At best, even if you did not know, you are to blame in having left God who instructs you. But as it is by many arguments we have shown that you do know, and transgress willingly. But are you drawn by passion? Why then do you both cooperate therewith and praise it? For they "not only do such things," he says, "but have pleasure in them that do them." Having then put the more grievous and the unpardonable sin first, that he might have done with it (for he that praiseth the sin is far worse than even he that trespasseth); having then put this the first, he by this method grapples more powerfully with him in the sequel.
