He had said in the former epistle that “the Spirit speaks expressly, that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith.” And elsewhere in this epistle he foretells that something of this kind will afterwards happen; and here again he does the same thing: “This know, that in the last days perilous times shall come.” And this he pronounces not only from the future but from the past: “As Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses.” And again from reasoning: “In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver.” But why does he do this? In order that Timothy may not be troubled, nor any one of us, when there are evil men. If there were such in the time of Moses and will be in later times, it is no wonder that there are such in our times.
