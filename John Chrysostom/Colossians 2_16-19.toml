Having first said darkly, "Take heed lest there shall be any one that makes spoil of you after the tradition of men" [Colossians 2:8]; and again, further back, "This, I say, that no one may delude you with persuasiveness of speech" [Colossians 2:4]; thus preoccupying their soul, and working in it anxious thoughts; next, having inserted those benefits, and increased this effect, he then brings in his reproof last, and says, "Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a feast day, or a new moon, or a sabbath day." Do you see how he depreciates them? If you have obtained such things, he says, why make yourselves accountable for these petty matters? And he makes light of them, saying, "or in the part  of a feast day," for in truth they did not retain the whole of the former rule, "or a new moon, or a sabbath day." He said not, "Do not then observe them," but, "let no man judge you." He showed that they were transgressing, and undoing, but he brought his charge against others. Endure not those that judge you, he says, nay, not so much as this either, but he argues with those persons, almost stopping their mouths, and saying, You ought not to judge. But he would not have reflected on these. He said not "in clean and unclean," nor yet "in feasts of Tabernacles, and unleavened bread, and Pentecost," but "in part of a feast": for they ventured not to keep the whole; and if they did observe it, yet not so as to celebrate the feast. "In part," he says, showing that the greater part is done away. For even if they did keep sabbath, they did not do so with precision. "Which are a shadow of the things to come"; he means, of the New Covenant; "but the body" is "Christ's." Some persons here punctuate thus, "but the body" is "of Christ," i.e. the truth has come in with Christ: others thus; "The Body of Christ let no man adjudge away from you," that is, thwart you of it. The term καταβραβευθῆναι, is employed when the victory is with one party, and the prize with another, when though a victor you are thwarted. You stand above the devil and sin; why do you again subject yourself to sin? Therefore he said that "he is a debtor to fulfill the whole law" [Galatians 5:3]; and again, "Is Christ" found to be "the minister of sin" [Galatians 2:17]? Which he said when writing to the Galatians. When he had filled them with anger through saying, "adjudge away from you," then he begins; "being a voluntary,"  he says, "in humility and worshiping of Angels, intruding into things he has not seen, vainly puffed up by his fleshly mind." How "in humility," or how "puffed up"? He shows that the whole arose out of vainglory. But what is on the whole the drift of what is said? There are some who maintain that we must be brought near by Angels, not by Christ, that were too great a thing for us. Therefore it is that he turns over and over again what has been done by Christ, "through the Blood of His Cross" [Colossians 1:20]; on this account he says that "He suffered for us"; that "He loved us." [1 Peter 2:21] And besides in this very same thing, moreover, they were elevated afresh. And he said not "introduction by," but "worshiping of" Angels. "Intruding into things he has not  seen." [Ephesians 2:4] For he has not seen Angels, and yet is affected as though he had. Therefore he says, "Puffed up by his fleshly mind vainly," not about any true fact. About this doctrine, he is puffed up, and puts forward a show of humility. By his carnal mind, not spiritual; his reasoning is of man. "And not holding fast the Head," he says, "from whom all the body." All the body thence has its being, and its well-being. Why, letting go the Head, do you cling to the members? If you are fallen off from it, you are lost. "From whom all the body." Every one, be he who he may, thence has not life only, but also even connection. All the Church, so long as she holds The Head, increases; because here is no more passion of pride and vainglory, nor invention of human fancy.

Mark that "from  whom," meaning the Son. "Through the joints and bands," he says, "being supplied, and knit together, increases with the increase of God"; he means, that which is according to God, that of the best life.
