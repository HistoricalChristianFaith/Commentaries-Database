Nevertheless, I say, fear not. Paul comforts you saying, “God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted above that which you are able, but will with the temptation also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to bear it.” He indeed himself has said, “I will never leave you or forsake you.” For had he resolved to punish us in deed and in actual endurance, he would not have given us over to terror during so many days. For when he would not punish, he frightens; since if he were intending to punish, fear would be superfluous, and threatening superfluous. But now, we have sustained a life more grievous than countless deaths; fearing and trembling during so many days, and being suspicious of our very shadows; and paying the punishment of Cain;29 and in the midst of our sleep, starting up, through constant agony of mind. So that if we have kindled God’s wrath, we have appeased him in the endurance of such a punishment. For if we have not paid the satisfaction due to our sins, yet it has been enough to satisfy the mercy of God.
