That is, If you can lay hold on My words, declare it; but if you can not, why do you strike Me? Do you see that the judgment-hall is full of tumult, and trouble, and passion, and confusion? The high priest asked deceitfully and treacherously, Christ answered in a straightforward manner, and as was meet. What then was next to be done? Either to refute, or to accept what He said. This however is not done, but a servant buffets Him. So far was this from being a court of justice, and the proceedings those of a conspiracy, and a deed of tyranny. Then not having even so made any farther discovery, they send Him bound to Caiaphas.

See how the judgment hall is full of commotion, trouble, passion and confusion? The high priest deceitfully and treacherously questions Jesus. Christ answers in a straightforward way, which was only right. And so what should be done next? They should either disprove or admit what he said. And yet, this is not what they do. Instead, a servant hits him. It is not a trial they are carrying on but a conspiracy and a tyranny. Not knowing what else to do, they send him to Caiaphas.
