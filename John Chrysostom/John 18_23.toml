See how the judgment hall is full of commotion, trouble, passion and confusion? The high priest deceitfully and treacherously questions Jesus. Christ answers in a straightforward way, which was only right. And so what should be done next? They should either disprove or admit what he said. And yet, this is not what they do. Instead, a servant hits him. It is not a trial they are carrying on but a conspiracy and a tyranny. Not knowing what else to do, they send him to Caiaphas.
