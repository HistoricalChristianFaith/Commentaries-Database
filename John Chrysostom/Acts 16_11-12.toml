"Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis; and from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, and a colony." That is, even the voyage made this manifest: for there was no tardiness. It became the very root of Macedonia. It is a high distinction for a city, the being a colony. "And in this city we were tarrying certain days."
