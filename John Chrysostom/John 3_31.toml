Having uttered something great and sublime concerning Him, he again brings down his discourse to a humbler strain. For the expression, what He has heard and seen, is suited rather to a mere man. What He knew He knew not from having learned it by sight, or from having heard it, but He included the whole in His Nature, having come forth perfect from the Bosom of His Father, and needing none to teach Him. For, As the Father, He says, knows Me, even so know I the Father. John 10:15 What then means, He speaks that He has heard, and testifies that He has seen? Since  by these senses we gain correct knowledge of everything, and are deemed worthy of credit when we teach on matters which our eyes have embraced and our ears have taken in, as not in such cases inventing or speaking falsehoods, John desiring here to establish this point,  said, What He has heard and seen: that is, nothing that comes from Him is false, but all is true. Thus we when we are making curious enquiry into anything, often ask, Did you hear it? Did you see it? And if this be proved, the testimony is indubitable, and so when Christ Himself says, As I hear, I judge John 5:30; and, What I have heard from My Father, that I speak  John 15:15; and, We speak  that We have seen John 3:11; and whatsoever other sayings He utters of the kind, are uttered not that we might imagine that He says what He does being taught of any, (it were extreme folly to think this,) but in order that nothing of what is said may be suspected by the shameless Jews. For because they had not yet a right opinion concerning Him, He continually betakes Himself to His Father, and hence makes His sayings credible.

2. And why do you wonder if He betake Himself to the Father, when He often resorts to the Prophets and the Scriptures? As when He says, They are they that testify of Me. John 5:39 Shall we then say that He is inferior to the Prophets, because He draws testimonies from them? Away with the thought. It is because of the infirmity of His hearers that He so orders His discourse, and says that He spoke what He spoke having heard it from the Father, not because He needed a teacher, but that they might believe that nothing that He said was false. John's meaning is of this kind: I desire to hear what He says, for He comes from above, bringing thence those tidings which none but life knows rightly; for 'what He has seen and heard,' is the expression of one who declares this.

And no man receives His testimony. Yet He had disciples, and many besides gave heed to His words. How then says John, No man? He says no man, instead of few men, for had he meant no man at all, how could he have added,

1. A dreadful thing is the love of glory, dreadful and full of many evils; it is a thorn hard to be extracted, a wild beast untamable and many headed, arming itself against those that feed it; for as the worm eats through the wood from which it is born, as rust wastes the iron whence it comes forth, and moths the fleeces, so vainglory destroys the soul which nourishes it; and therefore we need great diligence to remove the passion. Observe here how long a charm John uses over  the disciples affected by it, and can scarcely pacify them. For he softens  them with other words besides those already mentioned. And what are these others? He that comes from above, he says, is above all; he that is of the earth, is earthly, and speaks of the earth. Since you make much ado with my testimony,  and in this way say that I am more worthy of credit than He, you needs must know this, that it is impossible for One who comes from heaven to have His credit strengthened by one that inhabites earth.

And what means above all, what is the expression intended to show to us? That Christ has need of nothing, but is Himself sufficient for Himself, and incomparably greater than all; of himself John speaks as being of the earth, and speaking of the earth. Not that he spoke of his own mind, but as Christ said, If I have told you of earthly things and you believe not, so calling Baptism, not because it was an earthly thing, but because He compared it when He spoke with His own Ineffable Generation, so here John said that he spoke of earth, comparing his own with Christ's teaching. For the speaking of earth means nothing else than this, My things are little and low and poor compared with His, and such as it was probable that an earthly nature would receive. In Him 'are hid all the treasures of wisdom.' Colossians 2:5 That he speaks not of human reasonings is plain from this. He that is of the earth, says he, is earthly. Yet not all in him was earthly, but the higher parts were heavenly, for he had a soul, and was partaker of a Spirit which was not of earth. How then says he that he is earthly? Do you see not that he means only, I am small and of no esteem, going on the ground and born in the earth; but Christ came to us from above. Having by all these means quenched their passion, he afterwards speaks more openly of Christ; for before this it was useless to utter words which could never have gained a place in the understanding of his hearers: but when he has pulled up the thorns, he then boldly casts in the seed, saying,

As the worm gnaws through the wood from which it is born, and rust destroys the iron from which it came, and moths consume fleece, so pride destroys the soul that nourishes it. Therefore we need perseverance to get rid of it. John himself can hardly subdue it in his disciples even with all of his cogent arguments. He has to say again what he has said above, “He that comes from above is above all.” … He means: you make much of my testimony and say that the witness is more worthy to be believed than Jesus to whom I bear witness. Know this, that it is impossible for the one who comes from heaven to be accredited by an earthly witness.… He is above all, being perfect in himself and above comparison.

“Speaks of the earth” does not mean that John spoke from his own understanding but that, in comparison with Christ’s doctrine, he spoke of the earth. It is as if he said, my doctrine is simple and humble when compared with Christ’s. While it is appropriate for an earthbound teacher, there is no comparison with the one in whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.… And yet John was not altogether earthly, for he had a soul and a spirit, and these were not of the earth. What does he mean then by saying that he is “earthly”? He says this only to express his own worthlessness and that he is one born on the earth, creeping on the ground. There is no comparison with Christ, who comes from above.
