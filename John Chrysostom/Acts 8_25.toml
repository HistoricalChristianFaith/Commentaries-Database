Testified, probably because of him (Simon), that they may not be deceived; that thenceforth they may be safe. Having preached, it says, the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem. Why do they go there again where was the tyranny of the bad, where were those most bent upon killing them? Just as generals do in wars, they occupy that part of the scene of war which is most distressed. And preached the Gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. Observe them again, how they do not (προηγουμένως) of set purpose come to Samaria, but driven by stress of persecution, just as it was in the case of Christ; and how when the Apostles go there, it is to men now believers, no longer Samaritans. But when the Apostles, it says, which were at Jerusalem heard this, they sent unto them Peter and John. Sent them, again, to rid them of magic. And besides, (the Lord) had given them a pattern at the time when the Samaritans believed. And in many villages, it says, of the Samaritans, they preached the Gospel. John 4:39 Observe how actively employed even their journeys were, how they do nothing without a purpose.
Such travels should we also make. And why do I speak of travels? Many possess villages and lands, and give themselves no concern, nor make any account of this. That baths may be provided, their revenues increased, courts and buildings erected, for this they take plenty of pains: but for the husbandry of souls, not so. When you see thorns— answer me— you cut them up, you burn, you utterly destroy them, to rid your land of the hurt thence arising. And do you see the laborers themselves overrun with thorns, and dost not cut them up, and are you not afraid of the Owner Who shall call you to account? For ought not each individual believer to build a Church, to get a Teacher, to cooperate (συναίconvert (πεῖσαι) him. By the means which are in your power, convert him; by kindness, by good offices, by gentleness, by courting (κολακεί& 139Churches: nay, sooner everything than this! Wherefore I beseech and implore, as a favor I entreat, yea as a law I lay it down, that there be no estate to be seen destitute of a Church. Tell not me, There is one hard by; there is one in the neighboring properties; the expense is great, the income not great. If you have anything to expend upon the poor, expend it there: better there than here. Maintain a Teacher, maintain a Deacon, and a sacerdotal body complete. As by a bride, whether a wife whom you take, or a daughter whom you give in marriage, so act by the Church: give her a dowry. So shall your estate be filled with blessing. For what shall not be there of all that is good? Is it a small thing, tell me, that your wine-press should be blessed; a small thing, tell me, that of your fruits God is the first to taste, and that the first fruits are there (with Him)? And then even for the peace of the laboring people this is profitable. Then as one whom they must respect, there will be the presbyter among them and this will contribute to the security of the estate. There will be constant prayers there through you (infra, note 1, p. 119) hymns and Communions through you; the Oblation on each Lord's Day. For only consider what a praise it will be, that, whereas others have built splendid tombs, to have it said hereafter: Such a one built this, you have reared Churches! Bethink you that even until the coming of Christ you shall have your reward, who hast reared up the altars of God.

Suppose an Emperor had ordered you to build an house that he might lodge there, would you not have done everything to please him? And here now it is palace of Christ, the Church, the Church which you build. Look not at the cost, but calculate the profit. Your people yonder cultivate your field: cultivate thou their souls: they bring to you your fruits, raise thou them to heaven. He that makes the beginning is the cause of all the rest: and you will be the cause that the people are brought under Christian teaching (κατηχουμένων) both there, and in the neighboring estates. Your baths do but make the peasants less hardy, your taverns give them a taste for luxury, and yet you provide these for credit's sake. Your markets and fairs, (πανηγύρεις) on the other hand, promote covetousness. But think now what a thing it would be to see a presbyter, the moving picture of Abraham, gray-headed, girded up, digging and working with his own hands? What more pleasant than such a field! Their virtue thrives. No intemperance there, nay, it is driven away: no drunkenness and wantonness, nay, it is cast out: no vanity, nay, it is extinguished. All benevolent tempers shine out the brighter through the simplicity of manners. How pleasant to go forth and enter into the House of God, and to know that one built it himself: to fling himself on his back in his litter, and after the bodily benefit of his pleasant airing, be present both at the evening and the morning hymns, have the priest as a guest at his table, in associating with him enjoy his benediction, see others also coming there! This is a wall for his field, this its security. This is the field of which it is said, The smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed. Genesis 27:27 If, even without this, the country is pleasant, because it is so quiet, so free from distraction of business, what will it not be when this is added to it? The country with a Church is like the Paradise of God. No clamor there, no turmoil, no enemies at variance, no heresies: there you shall see all friends, holding the same doctrines in common. The very quiet shall lead you to higher views, and receiving you thus prepared by philosophy, the presbyter shall give you an excellent cure. For here, whatever we may speak, the noise of the market drives it all out: but there, what you shall hear, you will keep fixed in your mind. You will be quite another man in the country through him: and moreover to the people there he will be director, he will watch over them both by his presence and by his influence in forming their manners. And what, I ask, would be the cost? Make for a beginning a small house (ἐ ν τάξει ναοὕ) to serve as temple. Your successor will build a porch, his successor will make other additions, and the whole shall be put to your account. You give little, and receive the reward for the whole. At any rate, make a beginning: lay a foundation. Exhort one another, vie one with another in this matter. But now, where there is straw and grain and such like to be stored, you make no difficulty of building: but for a place where the fruits of souls may be gathered in, we bestow not a thought; and the people are forced to go miles and miles, and to make long journeys, that they may get to Church! Think, how good it is, when with all quietness the priest presents himself in the Church, that he may draw near unto God, and say prayers for the village, day by day, and for its owner! Say, is it a small matter, that even in the Holy Oblations evermore your name is included in the prayers, and that for the village day by day prayers are made unto God?— How greatly this profits you for all else! It chances that certain (great) persons dwell in the neighborhood, and have overseers: now to you, being poor, one of them will not deign even to pay a visit: but the presbyter, it is likely, he will invite, and make him sit at his table. How much good results from this! The village will in the first place be free from all evil suspicion. None will charge it with murder, with theft: none will suspect anything of the kind.— They have also another comfort, if sickness befall, if death.— Then again the friendships formed there by people as they go side by side (to and from the Church) are not struck up at random and promiscuously: and the meetings there are far more pleasant than those which take place in marts and fairs. The people themselves also will be more respectable, because of their presbyter. How is it you hear that Jerusalem was had in honor in the old times above all other cities? Why was this? Because of the then prevailing religion. Therefore it is that where God is honored, there is nothing evil: as, on the contrary, where He is not honored, there is nothing good. It will be great security both with God and with men. Only, I beseech you, that you be not remiss: only may you put your hand to this work. For if he who brings out the precious from the vile, shall be as the mouth of God Jeremiah 15:19; he who benefits and recovers so many souls, both that now are and that shall be even until the coming of Christ, what favor shall not that person reap from God! Raise thou a garrison against the devil: for that is what the Church is. Thence as from headquarters let the hands go forth to work: first let the people hold them up for prayers, and then go their way to work. So shall there be vigor of body; so shall the tillage be abundant; so shall all evil be kept aloof. It is not possible to represent in words the pleasure thence arising, until it be realized. Look not to this, that it brings in no revenue: if thou do it at all in this spirit, then do it not at all; if you account not the revenue you get thence greater than from the whole estate beside; if you be not thus affected, then let it alone; if you do not account this work to stand you more in stead than any work beside. What can be greater than this revenue, the gathering in of souls into the threshing-floor which is in heaven! Alas, that you know not how much it is, to gain souls! Hear what Christ says to Peter, Feed My sheep. John 21:15-17 If, seeing the emperor's sheep, or herd of horses, by reason of having no fold or stable, exposed to depredation, thou were to take them in hand, and build a fold or stables, or also provide a shepherd or herdsman to take charge of them, what would not the emperor do for you in return? Now, you gather the flock of Christ, and puttest a shepherd over them, and do you think it is no great gain you are earning? But, if for offending even one, a man shall incur so great a punishment, how can he that saves so many, ever be punished? What sin will he have thenceforth? For, though he have it, does not this blot it out? From the punishment threatened to him that offends, learn the reward of him that saves. Were not the salvation of even one soul a matter of great importance, to offend would not move God to so great anger. Knowing these things, let us apply ourselves immediately to this spiritual work. And let each invite me, and we will together help to the best of our ability. If there be three joint-owners, let them do it by each bearing his part: if but one, he will induce the others also that are near. Only be earnest to effect this, I beseech you, that in every way being well-pleasing unto God, we may attain unto the eternal blessings, by the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with Whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost together be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever world without end. Amen.

Why do they return to where the tyranny of evil was, where the people were especially thirsty for their blood? This is what generals do in wars: they take control of the part of the battle that is most in distress. Notice again that it is not by choice that they go to Samaria, but driven by persecution, just as it was in the case of Christ, and how the apostles are going to people who are now believers and no longer Samaritans. “Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard this,” it says, “they sent to them Peter and John.” They sent them again to free them from magic. And besides, [the Lord] had given them a pattern at the time when the Samaritans believed. “And in many villages,” it says, “of the Samaritans, they preached the gospel.” Look how even their journeys were actively employed and how they do nothing without a purpose.
