"And they, when they had testified, and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem." "Testified," probably because of him (Simon), that they may not be deceived; that thenceforth they may be safe. "Having preached," it says, "the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem." Why do they go thither again where was the tyranny of the bad, where were those most bent upon killing them? Just as generals do in wars, they occupy that part of the scene of war which is most distressed.

"And preached the Gospel in many villages of the Samaritans." Observe them again, how they do not of set purpose come to Samaria, but driven by stress of persecution, just as it was in the case of Christ; and how when the Apostles go thither, it is to men now believers, no longer Samaritans. "But when the Apostles," it says, "which were at Jerusalem heard this, they sent unto them Peter and John." "Sent" them, again, to rid them of magic. And besides, the Lord had given them a pattern at the time when the Samaritans believed. "And in many villages," it says, "of the Samaritans, they preached the Gospel." Observe how actively employed even their journeys were, how they do nothing without a purpose.
