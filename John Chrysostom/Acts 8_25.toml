Why do they return to where the tyranny of evil was, where the people were especially thirsty for their blood? This is what generals do in wars: they take control of the part of the battle that is most in distress. Notice again that it is not by choice that they go to Samaria, but driven by persecution, just as it was in the case of Christ, and how the apostles are going to people who are now believers and no longer Samaritans. “Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard this,” it says, “they sent to them Peter and John.” They sent them again to free them from magic. And besides, [the Lord] had given them a pattern at the time when the Samaritans believed. “And in many villages,” it says, “of the Samaritans, they preached the gospel.” Look how even their journeys were actively employed and how they do nothing without a purpose.
