How then, says some one, does He not go up unto the feast, but, when all are pressing to Jerusalem, goes Himself into Galilee, and not Himself alone, but takes His disciples with Him, and proceeds thence to Capernaum? Because henceforth He was quietly annulling the Law, taking occasion from the wickedness of. the Jews.

Why doesnâ€™t he go up to the feast, some might ask, especially when everyone else is pressing towards Jerusalem? Why instead does he go into Galilee, and even at that, he does not go alone but takes his disciples with him and proceeds to Capernaum? He did this because he was quietly annulling the law, taking occasion from the wickedness of the Jews.
