Why doesn’t he go up to the feast, some might ask, especially when everyone else is pressing towards Jerusalem? Why instead does he go into Galilee, and even at that, he does not go alone but takes his disciples with him and proceeds to Capernaum? He did this because he was quietly annulling the law, taking occasion from the wickedness of the Jews.
