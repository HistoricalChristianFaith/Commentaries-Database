God told Paul that it was enough that he could raise the dead, cure the blind, cleanse lepers and do other miracles. He did not need exemption from danger and fear as well, or complete freedom to preach without any form of hindrance. Indeed, when these troubles come, Godâ€™s power of deliverance is shown, and the gospel triumphs in spite of persecution. The more the trials increased, the more grace increased as well.
