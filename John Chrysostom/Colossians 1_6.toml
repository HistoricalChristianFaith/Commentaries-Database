He now gives them credit. "Is come," he said metaphorically. He means, it did not come and go away, but that it remained, and was there. Then because to the many the strongest confirmation of doctrines is that they hold them in common with many, he therefore added, "As also it is in all the world."

It is present everywhere, everywhere victorious, everywhere established.

"And is bearing fruit, and increasing,  as it does in you also."

"Bearing fruit." In works. "Increasing." By the accession of many, by becoming firmer; for plants then begin to thicken when they have become firm.

"As also among you," says he.

He first gains the hearer by his praises, so that even though disinclined, he may not refuse to hear him.

"Since the day ye heard it."

Marvelous! That you quickly came unto it and believed; and straightway, from the very first, showed forth its fruits.

"Since the day ye heard, and knew the grace of God in truth."

Not in word, says he, nor in deceit, but in very deeds. Either then this is what he means by "bearing fruit," or else, the signs and wonders. Because as soon as you received it, so soon ye knew the grace of God. What then immediately gave proofs of its inherent virtue, is it not a hard thing that that should now be disbelieved?

“Bearing fruit.” In works. “Increasing.” By the coming to faith of many, by becoming firmer; for plants then begin to thicken when they have become firm.

Paul speaks metaphorically when he writes, “is come.” He means, it did not come and go away, but that it remained and was there. Many doctrines are most strongly confirmed if they are held in common with many. Therefore Paul added, “As also it is in all the world.” The gospel is present everywhere, everywhere victorious, everywhere established.

Bearing fruit. In works. Increasing. By the accession of many, by becoming firmer; for plants then begin to thicken when they have become firm.
