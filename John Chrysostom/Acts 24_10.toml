Then Paul; after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a just judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself. This is not the language of flattery, his testifying to the judge's justice: no, the adulation was rather in that speech of the orator, By thee we enjoy great quietness. If so, then why are ye seditious? What Paul sought was justice. Knowing thee to be a just judge, I cheerfully, says he, answer for myself. Then also he enforces this by the length of time: that he had been judge of many years. Why then, he is no stranger or alien or revolutionary person, seeing he had known the judge for many years. And he does well to add the epithet just, that he Felix might not look to the chief priest, nor to the people, nor the accuser. See, how he did not let himself be carried away into abuse, although there was strong provocation.
