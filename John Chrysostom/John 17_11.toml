That is, Although I appear no longer in the flesh, yet by these am I glorified. But why does He say continuously, that, I am not in the world; and that, because I leave them I commit them to You; and that, when I was in the world I kept them? For if one should take these words in their simple sense, many absurdities will follow. For how could it be reasonable to say, that He is no longer in the world, and that when He departs He commits them to another? Since these are the words of a mere man parting from them forever. Do you see how He speaks for the most part like a man, and in a way adapted to their state of mind, because they thought that they had a greater degree of safety from His presence? Wherefore He says, While I was with them, I kept them. John 14:28 Yet He tells them, I come to you; and, I am with you till the end. Matthew 28:20 How then  says He these words, as if about to be parted from them? He addresses Himself, as I said before, to their thoughts,  that they may take breath a little when  they hear Him speaking thus, and delivering them over to the care of the Father. For since, after hearing many exhortations from Him, they were not persuaded, He then holds converse with the Father, manifesting His affection for them. As though He had said, Since You call Me to Yourself, place these in safety; for I come to You. What sayest Thou? Are You not able to keep them? Yea, I am able. Wherefore then do You speak thus? That they may have My joy fulfilled  John 17:13; that is, may not be confounded, as being imperfect. And by these words He showed that He had spoken all these things so, to give them rest and joy. For the saying appears to be contradictory. Now I am no longer in the world, and these are in the world. This was what they were suspecting. For a while therefore He condescends to them, because had He said, I keep them, they would not have so well believed; wherefore He says, Holy Father, keep them through Your own Name; that is, by your help.

“For the will of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is one.” This is what he wants us to be as well when he says, “That they may be one, as you and I are one.” There is nothing that can equal unanimity and concord, for this is how one becomes many. If two or ten are of one mind, the one is no longer one, but each one is multiplied tenfold, and you will find the one in the ten and the ten in the one. And if they have an enemy, he who attacks the one (as having attacked the ten) is defeated, for he is the target of ten opponents instead of one. Is someone in need? No, he is not in need, for he is wealthy in his greater part, that is, in the nine. And the needy part, the lesser, is concealed by the wealthy part, the greater. Each of these has twenty hands, twenty eyes and as many feet. For he does not see with his own eyes alone but with those of the others as well. He does not walk with his own feet alone but with those of the others. He does not work with his own hands alone but with theirs. He has ten souls, for not only does he think about himself, but those souls also think about him. And if they are made into a hundred, it will still be the same, and their power will be extended even more. Don’t you see how the excess of love makes the one both irresistible and multiplied? See how one can even be in many places, the same both in Persia and in Rome? Don’t you see that what nature cannot do, love can?… See what a multiplier love is when it can even make one a thousand. Why then do we not acquire this power and place ourselves in safety? This is better than all power or riches. This is more than health, than light itself. It is the groundwork for courage.
