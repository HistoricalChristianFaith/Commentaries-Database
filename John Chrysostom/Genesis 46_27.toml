Why did sacred Scripture indicate the number to us precisely? So that we might be in a position to know how God’s prediction took effect that said, “I will make you into a great nation there.” You see, from those seventy-five persons the people of Israel grew into six hundred thousand. You notice how it was not idly or to no purpose that it taught us the number of those that went down to Egypt, but for us to know from how few that great number came and not to lose confidence in God’s promises. I mean, when you consider that after the death of Jacob and Joseph the king of the Egyptians went to such lengths to reduce their numbers and prevent them from growing, be amazed and overcome at God’s providence and the fact that his wishes can never fail, no matter how many people try their utmost.
