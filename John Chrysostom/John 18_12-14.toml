(Hom. lxxxiii. 2) In exultation, to show what they had done, as if they were raising a trophy.

(Hom. lxxxiii) That no one however might be disturbed at the sound of the chains, the Evangelist reminds them of the prophecy that His death would be the salvation of the world: Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. Such is the overpowering force of truth, that even its enemies echo it.

"Then Jesus was taken; and they bound Him, and led Him away to Annas." Why to Annas? In their pleasure they made a show of what had been done, as though forsooth they had set up a trophy. "And he was father-in-law to Caiaphas."

"Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people." Why doth the Evangelist again remind us of his prophecy? To show that these things were done for our salvation. And such is the exceeding force of truth, that even enemies proclaimed these things beforehand. For lest the listener, hearing of bonds, should be confounded, he reminds him of that prophecy, that the death of Jesus was the salvation of the world.
