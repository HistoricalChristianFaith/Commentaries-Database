"And if Christ hath not been raised, then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain."

Although what followed in due course would have been, "but if Christ be not risen, ye fight against things evident, and against so many prophets, and the truth of facts;" nevertheless he states what is much more fearful to them: "then is our preaching vain, your faith also is vain." For he wishes to shake thoroughly their mind: "we have lost all," saith he, "all is over, if He be not risen." Seest thou how great is the mystery of the oeconomy? As thus: if after death He could not rise again, neither is sin loosed nor death taken away nor the curse removed. Yea, and not only have we preached in vain, but ye also have believed in vain.
