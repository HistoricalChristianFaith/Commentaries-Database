And wherefore said He not, Marvel not that He is the Son of Man, for He is also the Son of God, but rather mentioned the resurrection? He did indeed put this above, by saying, shall hear the Voice of the Son of God. And if here He is silent on the matter, wonder not; for after mentioning a work which was proper to God, He then permits His hearers to collect from it that He was God, and the Son of God. For had this been continually asserted by Himself, it would at that time have offended them, but when proved by the argument of miracles, it rendered His doctrine less burdensome. So they who put together syllogisms, when having laid down their premises  they have fairly  proved the point in question, frequently do not draw the conclusion themselves, but to render their hearers more fairly disposed, and to make their victory more evident, cause the opponent himself to give the verdict, so that the by-standers may the rather agree with them when their opponents decide in their favor. When therefore He mentioned the resurrection of Lazarus, He spoke not of the Judgment (for it was not for this that Lazarus arose); but when He spoke generally He also added, that they that have done good shall go forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment. Thus also John led on his hearers by speaking of the Judgment, and that he that believes not on the Son, shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides on him John 3:36: so too Himself led on Nicodemus: He that believes in the Son, He said to him, is not judged, but he that believes not is judged already John 3:18; and so here He mentions the Judgment-seat  and the punishment which shall follow upon evil deeds. For because He had said above, He that hears My words and believes in Him that sent Me, is not judged, lest any one should imagine that this alone is sufficient for salvation, He adds also the result of man's life,  declaring that they which have done good shall come forth unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of judgment. Since then He had said that all the world should render account to Him, and that all at His Voice should rise again, a thing new and strange and even now disbelieved by many who seem to have believed, not to say by the Jews at that time, hear how He goes to prove it, again condescending to the infirmity of His hearers.

Paul of Samosata renders it not so; but how? Hath given Him authority to execute judgment, 'because' He is the Son of Man.  Now the passage thus read is inconsequent, for He did not receive judgment because He was man, (since then what hindered all men from being judges,) but because He is the Son of that Ineffable Essence, therefore is He Judge. So we must read, That He is the Son of Man, marvel not at this. For when what He said seemed to the hearers inconsistent, and they deemed Him nothing more than mere man, while His words were greater than suited man, yea, or even angel, and were proper to God only, to solve this objection He adds,

Paul of Samosata reads it, “Has given him power to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.” But this connection has no meaning, for Jesus does not receive the power to judge because he was human (otherwise, on this supposition, what would prevent everyone from being judges), but because he is the ineffable Son of God. This is the reason he is called Judge. We must read it then, “Because he is the Son of man, do not marvel at this.” The fact that Christ’s hearers thought he was a mere man, coupled with the fact that what he asserted of himself was too lofty to be true of people (or even angels or of any being short of God himself), was a strong obstacle in the way of their believing. Our Lord notices this and removes this obstacle. “Do not marvel,” he says, “that he is the Son of man. For the hour is coming when all who are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.”
