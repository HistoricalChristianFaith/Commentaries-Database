Paul of Samosata reads it, “Has given him power to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.” But this connection has no meaning, for Jesus does not receive the power to judge because he was human (otherwise, on this supposition, what would prevent everyone from being judges), but because he is the ineffable Son of God. This is the reason he is called Judge. We must read it then, “Because he is the Son of man, do not marvel at this.” The fact that Christ’s hearers thought he was a mere man, coupled with the fact that what he asserted of himself was too lofty to be true of people (or even angels or of any being short of God himself), was a strong obstacle in the way of their believing. Our Lord notices this and removes this obstacle. “Do not marvel,” he says, “that he is the Son of man. For the hour is coming when all who are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God.”
