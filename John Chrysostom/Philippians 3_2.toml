The Jews attached great solemnity to circumcision…. Therefore Paul mutilates its name and says, “Beware of the concision.” He refrains from saying that circumcision is evil, that circumcision is superfluous, so as not to alarm these people, but he conveys his point more wisely, turning them away from the act indeed but being gracious in his words, or rather more intent upon the issue…. He does not say that we try this circumcision and see whether it is better. He does not even give it the name circumcision. For what is he saying? “That circumcision is mutilation.” For when this happens unlawfully, it is nothing but a curtailment of the flesh, a “concision.” Either this was the reason or else it was because they were trying to cut up the church in pieces. .

The Jews are no longer children. The Gentiles were once called dogs but now these [Judaizing Christians] are. Why so? Because, just as the Gentiles were once strangers to Christ and God, so these have now become. And he alludes to their stubborn shamelessness and their great tenacity against the faithful. .

Beware, he says, of the concision. The rite of circumcision was venerable in the Jews' account, forasmuch as the Law itself gave way thereto, and the Sabbath was less esteemed than circumcision. For that circumcision might be performed the Sabbath was broken; but that the Sabbath might be kept, circumcision was never broken; and mark, I pray, the dispensation of God. This is found to be even more solemn than the Sabbath, as not being omitted at certain times. When then it is done away, much more is the Sabbath. Wherefore Paul makes a concision of the name, and says, Beware of the concision; and he did not say that circumcision is evil, that it is superfluous, lest he should strike the men with dismay, but he manages it more wisely, withdrawing them from the thing, but gratifying them with the word, nay, rather with the thing too, in a more serious way. But not so in the case of the Galatians, for since in that case the disease was great, he immediately adopts the remedy of amputation with open front and with all boldness; but in this case, as they had done nothing of the sort, he vouchsafes them the gratification of the title, he casts out the others, and says, Beware of the concision; for we are the circumcision— how?— who worship God in spirit, and have no confidence in the flesh. He said not that we test the one circumcision and the other, which is the better of the two; but he would not even allow it a share in the name; but what does he say? That that circumcision is concision. Why? Because they do nothing but cut the flesh up. For when what is done is not of the law, it is nothing else than a concision and cutting up of the flesh; it was then either for this reason that he called it so, or because they were trying to cut the Church in two; and we call the thing cutting up in those who do this at random, without aim and without skill. Now if you must seek circumcision, he says, you will find it among us, who worship God in spirit, i.e. who worship spiritually.
