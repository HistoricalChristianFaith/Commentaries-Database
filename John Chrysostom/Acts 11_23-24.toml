But observe this holy man - Barnabas, I mean - how he looked not to his own interests, but hasted to Tarsus. "Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart, they would cleave unto the Lord. For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost, and of faith: and much people was added unto the Lord." He was a very kind man, and single-hearted, and considerate.

"And he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord, for he was a good man." By "good man," I take it, he means one that is kind, sincere, exceedingly desirous of the salvation of his neighbors - "for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. To cleave unto the Lord with purpose of heart" this is said with encomium and praise. "And much people was added unto the Lord:" for like rich land this city received the word, and brought forth much fruit.

And "when" Barnabas, it says, "came and had seen the grace of God," - not the diligence of men - "he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord": and by this he converted more. "And much people was added unto the Lord." Why do they not write to Paul, but send Barnabas? They did not yet know the virtue of the man: but it is providentially ordered that Barnabas should come. As there was a multitude, and none to hinder, well might the faith grow, and above all because they had no trials to undergo.
