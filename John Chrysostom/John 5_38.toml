It was not even in their power to assert what they boasted the most about, that is, that they had received and obeyed God’s commands. Therefore he adds, “You do not have his word abiding in you,” that is, the commandments, the Law and the Prophets. Although God instituted them, you do not have them. For if the Scriptures everywhere tell you to believe in me and you still do not believe, it is clear that his word has departed from you. “For you do not believe him whom he has sent.”
