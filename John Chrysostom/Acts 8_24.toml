"Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me." Even this he did only formally, as words of course, when he ought to have wept and mourned as a penitent. For that he says, "Pray ye for me," is a confession that he has done wrong.

Observe him, what a miscreant he is; when he was convicted, then he believed: when again he was convicted, then he became humble. Simon believed only in an intellectual sense, being impressed with wonder, rather than convinced of sin. So, now, it is fear of calamity and penalty, not repentance, which leads him to ask the apostles to pray for him. "Seeing his miracles," he was amazed, and came over. He thought to be able to escape detection: he thought the thing was an art: but when he had not power to defeat the Apostles, again he fears the multitude, and is afraid to deny it.

He was struck with dismay first by the former circumstance, that he was overcome by the miracles and secondly by this, that his thoughts are made manifest. Therefore he now takes himself a long way off, to Rome, thinking the Apostle would not soon come there.
