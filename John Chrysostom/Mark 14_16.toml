Ostom: Whilst Judas was plotting howto betray Him, the rest of the disciples were taking care of the preparation of the Passover: where it is said, “And the first day of unleavened bread, when they killed the Passover, His disciples said unto Him, ‘Where wilt thou that we goand prepare where thou mayest eat the Passover?’ “.
ostom: Not our Passover, but in the meanwhile that of the Jews; but He did not only appoint ours, but Himself became our Passover. Why too did He eat it? Because He was “made under the Law, to redeem them that were under the Law,” and Himself gave rest to the Law. And lest any one should say that He did away with it, because He could not fulfil its hard and difficult obedience, He first Himself fulfilled it, and then set it to rest.
