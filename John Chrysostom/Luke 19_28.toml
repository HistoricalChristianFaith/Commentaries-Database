At the beginning of His ministry our Lord showed Himself indifferent to the Jews, but when He had given sufficient token of His power, He transacts every thing with the highest authority. Many are the miracles which then took place. He foretold to them, you shall find an unbroken colt. He foretell also that no one should hinder them, but as soon as they heard it, should hold their peace.
