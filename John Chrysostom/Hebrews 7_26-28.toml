You see that the whole passage is said of the humanity. But when I say the humanity, I mean the humanity having divinity, not dividing one from the other, but leaving you to suppose what is suitable.… He says, “such a high priest also became us, who is holy, blameless.” “Blameless”—what is that? Without wickedness, about which another prophet says, “there was no deceit in his mouth.” That is, he is not crafty. Could any one say this concerning God? And is one not ashamed to say that God is not crafty, nor deceitful? Concerning him, however, in respect of the flesh, it might be reasonable to say it.
