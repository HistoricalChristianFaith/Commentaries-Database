Let those Anomoeans listen who, out of curiosity, are investigating into the essence of the Lord of angels. Daniel, to whom the eyes of the lions showed reverence, Daniel, who had a more than human power in his human body, could not endure the presence of his fellow servant but lay on the ground before the angel and could not breathe. For he said, “My bowels were turned within me at what I saw, and no breath was left in me.” But these Anomoeans, who are so far removed from the virtue of that just man, profess to know with all exactness the highest and first of essences, the very essence of God, who has created myriads of these angels. And yet Daniel did not have the strength to look on a single one of them.
