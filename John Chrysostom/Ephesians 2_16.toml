"And might reconcile them both in one body unto God through the Cross." He saith, not merely "might reconcile," but "might reconcile thoroughly" indicating that heretofore human nature had been easily reconciled, as, e.g., in the case of the saints and before the time of the Law. "In one body," saith he, and that His own, "unto God." How is this effected? By Himself, he means, suffering the due penalty.

"Through the cross having slain the enmity thereby." Nothing can be more decisive, nothing more expressive than these words. His death, saith the Apostle, hath "slain" the enmity. He hath "wounded" and "killed" it, not by giving charge to another, nor by what He wrought only, but also by what He suffered. He does not say "having dissolved," he does say "having cancelled," but what is stronger than all, "having slain," so that it never should rise again. How then is it that it does rise again? From our exceeding depravity. For as long as we abide in the body of Christ, as long as we are united, it rises not again, but lies dead; or rather that former enmity never rises again at all. But if we breed another, it is no longer because of Him, who hath destroyed and put to death the former one. It is thou, forsooth, that travailest with a fresh one. "For the mind of the flesh," saith he, "is enmity against God;" if we are in nothing carnally-minded, there will be no fresh enmity produced, but that "peace" shall remain.
