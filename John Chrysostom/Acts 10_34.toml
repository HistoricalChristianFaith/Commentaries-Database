"God [you remember] is no respecter of person." Rather, if he finds even one person in such a multitude doing what pleases him, far from scorning him he regales him with his particular providence and shows the greater care for him the more closely he has chosen the way of virtue at a time when there are others who are bent on evil.

"Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons." That is, be he uncircumcised or circumcised. This also Paul declaring, saith, "For there is no respect of persons with God."

And Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons. This he said also by way of justifying himself with the Jews then present. For, being at the point to commit the Word to these Gentiles, he first puts this by way of apology. What then? Was He "a respecter of persons" beforetime? God forbid! For beforetime likewise it was just the same.
