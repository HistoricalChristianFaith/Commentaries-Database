"But now God has set the members each one of them in the body, even as it pleased Him."

Even as he said of the Spirit, "as He will," so also here, "as it pleased Him." Now do not thou seek further into the cause, why it is thus and why not thus. For though we have ten thousand reasons to give, we shall not be so able to show them that it is well done, as when we say, that as the best Artificer pleased, so it came to pass. For as it is expedient, so He wills it. Now if in this body of ours we do not curiously enquire about the members, much more in the Church. And see his thoughtfulness in that he does not state the difference which arises from their nature nor that from their operation, but that from their local situation. For "now," says he, "God has set the members each one of them in the body even as it pleased Him." And he said well, "each one," pointing out that the use extends to all. For you can not say, "This He has Himself placed but not that: but every one according to His will, so it is situated." So that to the foot also it is profitable that it should be so stationed, and not to the head only: and if it should invert the order and leaving its own place, should go to another, though it might seem to have bettered its condition, it would be the undoing and ruin of the whole. For it both falls from its own, and reaches not the other station.

God has placed each part of the body where he has chosen, so we must not enquire any further as to why he has done it the way he has. For even if we could come up with ten thousand explanations, we would never find one better than thisâ€”that it pleased the Creator to make it the way he chose.
