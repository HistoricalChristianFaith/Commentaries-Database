Whether then it be I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.

Having exalted the Apostles and abased himself, then again having exalted himself above them that he might make out an equality: (for he did effect an equality, when he showed that he had advantages over them as well as they over him,) and having thereby proved himself worthy of credit; neither so does he dismiss them, but again ranks himself with them, pointing out their concord in Christ. Nevertheless he does it not so as that he should seem to have been tacked on to them,  but as himself also to appear in the same rank. For so it was profitable for the Gospel. Wherefore also he was equally earnest, on the one hand, that he might not seem to overlook them; on the other, that he might not be on account of the honor paid to them held cheap by those that were under his authority. Therefore he also now makes himself equal again, saying,

"Whether then it be I or they, so we preach." "From whomsoever," says he, "ye choose to learn, learn; there is no difference between us." And he said not, "if you will not believe me, believe them;" but while he makes himself worthy of credit and says that he is of himself sufficient, he affirms the same also of them by themselves. For the difference of persons took no effect, their authority being equal. And in the Epistle to the Galatians he does this, taking them with him, not as also standing in need of them, but saying indeed that even himself was sufficient: "For they who were of repute imparted nothing to me:" [Galatians 2:6] nevertheless, even so I follow after agreement with them. "For they gave unto me," says he, "their right hands." [Galatians 2:9] For if the credit of Paul were always to depend on others and to be confirmed by testimony from others, the disciples would hence have received infinite injury. It is not therefore to exalt himself that he does this, but fearing for the Gospel. Wherefore also he here says, making himself equal, "Whether it be I or they, so we preach."

Well did he say, "we preach," indicating his great boldness of speech. For we speak not secretly, nor  in a corner, but we utter a voice clearer than a trumpet. And he said not, "we preached," but, "even now 'so we preach.'" "And so ye believed." Here he said not, "ye believe," but, "ye believed." Because they were shaken in mind, therefore he ran back to the former times, and proceeds to add the witness from themselves.
