"Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another and so much the more as ye see the day approaching."

What is, "not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together"? He knew that much strength arises from being together and assembling together. "For where two or three are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them"; and again, "That they may be One, as we also are"; and, "They had all one heart and one soul." And not this only, but also because love is increased by the gathering of ourselves together; and love being increased, of necessity the things of God must follow also. "And earnest prayer was made by the people." "As the manner of some is." Here he not only exhorted, but also blamed them.

Then he adds the perfect thing, love. "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together," which some (he says) do, and divide the assemblies. For "a brother helped by a brother is as a strong city."
