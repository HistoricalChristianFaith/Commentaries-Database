But how is it, one may say, that Paul commands, "If any man that is called a brother be a fornicator or covetous, with such an one no, not to eat?" In the first place, it is not as yet manifest, whether to teachers also he gives this charge, and not rather to brethren only. Next, these were not yet of the number of the perfect, nor of those who had become brethren. And besides, Paul commands, even with respect to them that had become brethren, then to shrink from them, when they continue as they were, but these had now ceased, and were converted.

But none of these things shamed the Pharisees, but they accuse Him to His disciples, saying, "Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?"

And when the disciples seem to be doing wrong, they intercede with Him, saying, "Behold thy disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-day;" but here to them they discredit Him. All which was the part of men dealing craftily, and wishing to separate from the Master the choir of the disciples.
