But none of these things shamed the Pharisees, but they accuse Him to His disciples, saying,

Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners? Matthew 9:11

And when the disciples seem to be doing wrong, they intercede with Him, saying, Behold your disciples do that which is not lawful to do on the sabbath-day; Matthew 12:2 but here to them they discredit Him. All which was the part of men dealing craftily, and wishing to separate from the Master the choir of the disciples. What then says Infinite Wisdom?
