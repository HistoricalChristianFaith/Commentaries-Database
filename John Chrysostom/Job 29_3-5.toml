If he actually searched for his former happiness, that was in order to show the providence of God; this is clear when he says, “In the days when God watched over me.” Then he gives evidence of this godly watch. “When his lamp,” he says, “shone over my head.” This means, you will make the light of my lamp shine, because a lamp is really necessary, if the present darkness is deep, if the difficulties of my situation are serious, as well as the assaults of physical suffering, and the plots of the wicked and the fights and attacks of cruel demons. All this shows that “by his light I walked through darkness.” You see that darkness invades everything and that “light shines through darkness.” But, as natural darkness is useful to have rest, it is not useful because of its own nature but thanks to the wisdom of God, who has created everything.
