There are some failings which age has, that youth has not. Some indeed it has in common with youth, but in addition it has  a slowness, a timidity, a forgetfulness, an insensibility, and an irritability. For this reason he exhorts old men concerning these matters, "to be vigilant."  For there are many things which at this period make men otherwise than vigilant, especially what I mentioned, their general insensibility, and the difficulty of stirring or exciting them. Wherefore he also adds, "grave, temperate."  Here he means prudent. For temperance is named from the well-tempered  mind. For there are, indeed there are, among the old, some who rave and are beside themselves, some from wine, and some from sorrow. For old age makes them narrowminded.

"Sound in faith, in charity [love], in patience."

He has well added "in patience," for this quality more especially befits old men.
