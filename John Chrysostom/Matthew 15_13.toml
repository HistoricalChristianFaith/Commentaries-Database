Why therefore does Messiah say, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted”? Those who are diseased with the ideas of the Manichaeans say that this was said about the law. But what Jesus had said before this shuts their mouths. For if he were speaking about the law, why did he earlier make a defense on its behalf and fight for it when he said, “Why are you transgressing the commandment of God because of your tradition?” And why does he bring in the prophet [Isaiah] in front of everyone? Contrary to what the Manichaeans say, Jesus says these things about the Pharisees themselves and their traditions. For God said, “Honor your father and your mother.” This statement from God surely is a plant of god.
