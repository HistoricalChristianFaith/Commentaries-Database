"I adjure you by the Lord that this Epistle be read unto all the holy brethren."

And this command is rather from love, and not so much in the way of teaching; that with them also, he means, I may be conversing. And he does not merely command, but adjures them, and this from a fervent mind, that even though they should despise him, for the sake of the adjuration they may practice what is commanded. For men had a great dread of that appeal, but now that too is trampled under foot.
