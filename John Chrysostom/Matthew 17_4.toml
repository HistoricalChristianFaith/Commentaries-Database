He does not take them up immediately upon the promise being made, but six days after, for this reason, that the other disciples might not be touched with any human passion, as a feeling of jealousy; or else that during these daysâ€™ space, those disciples who were to be taken up might become kindled with a more eager desire.
He took these three because He set them before others. But observe how Matthew does not conceal who were preferred to himself; the like does John also when he records the preeminent praise given to Peter. For the company of Apostles was free from jealousy and vain glory.

What then says the ardent Peter? It is good for us to be here. Matthew 17:4 For because he had heard that Christ was to go to Jerusalem and to suffer, being in fear still and trembling for Him, even after His reproof, he dared not indeed approach and say the same thing again, Be it far from you; Matthew 16:22 but from that fear obscurely intimates the same again in other words. That is, when he saw a mountain, and so great retirement and solitude, his thought was, He has great security here, even from the place; and not only from the place, but also from His going away no more unto Jerusalem. For he would have Him be there continually: wherefore also he speaks of tabernacles. For if this may be, says he, we shall not go up to Jerusalem; and if we go not up, He will not die, for there He said the scribes would set upon Him.

But thus indeed he dared not speak; but desiring however to order things so, he said undoubtingly, It is good for us to be here, where Moses also is present, and Elias; Elias who brought down fire on the mountain, and Moses who entered into the thick darkness, and talked with God; and no one will even know where we are.

Do you see the ardent lover of Christ? For look not now at this, that the manner of his exhortation was not well weighed, but see how ardent he was, how burning his affection to Christ. For in proof that not so much out of fear for himself he said these things, hear what he says, when Christ was declaring beforehand His future death, and the assault upon Him: I will lay down my life for Your sake. John 13:37 Though I should die with You, yet will I not deny You. Matthew 26:35

And see how even in the very midst of the actual dangers he counselled amiss for himself. We know that when so great a multitude encompassed them, so far from flying, he even drew the sword, and cut off the ear of the high priest's servant. To such a degree did he disregard his own interest, and fear for his Master. Then because he had spoken as affirming a fact, he checks himself, and thinking, what if he should be again reproved, he says, If You will, let us make here three tabernacles, one for You and one for Moses, and one for Elias.

What do you say, O Peter? Did you not a little while since distinguish Him from the servants? Are you again numbering Him with the servants? Do you see how exceedingly imperfect they were before the crucifixion? For although the Father had revealed it to him, yet he did not always retain the revelation, but was troubled by his alarm; not this only, which I have mentioned, but another also, arising from that sight. In fact, the other evangelists, to declare this, and to indicate that the confusion of his mind, with which he spoke these things, arose from that alarm, said as follows; mark, He knew not what to say, for they were sore afraid; Mark 9:6 but Luke after his saying, Let us make three tabernacles, added, not knowing what he said. Luke 9:33 Then to show that he was holden with great fear, both he and the rest, he says, They were heavy with sleep, and when they were awake they saw His glory; meaning by deep sleep here, the deep stupor engendered in them by that vision. For as eyes are darkened by an excessive splendor, so at that time also did they feel. For it was not, I suppose, night, but day; and the exceeding greatness of the light weighed down the infirmity of their eyes.
