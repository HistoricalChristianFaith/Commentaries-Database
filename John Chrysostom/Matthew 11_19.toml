Whence He puts this question, shewing that nothing had been omitted that ought to be done for their salvation, saying, “To whom shall I liken this generation?.
“We have played music to you, and ye have not danced;” that is, I have shewedyou an unrestricted life, and ye are not convinced; “We have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented;” that is, John lived a hard life, and ye heeded himnot. Yet does not he speak one thing, and I another, but both speak the samething, because both have one and the same object. “For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He hath a demon. The Son of man came”.
What excuse then shall be given for them? Therefore He adds, “And wisdom is justified of her children;” that is, though ye were not convinced, yet have yenothing whereof to accuse me, as also of the Father the Prophet speaks, “Thatthou mightest be justified in thy sayings.” For though nought be effected in you by that goodness which is extended to you, yet He fulfils all His part that you may not have the shadow of excuse for your ungrateful doubt.
You should not be surprised at His using trite instances, such as that respecting the children; for He spoke to the weakness of His hearers; as Ezekiel spoke many things adapted to the Jews, but unworthy of the greatness of God.
