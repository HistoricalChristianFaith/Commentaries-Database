For another cause also He did not preach till John was in prison, that the multitude might not be split into two parties; or as John did no miracle, all men would have been drawn to Christ by His miracles.

Also observe how that in this His first address He says nothing of Himself openly; and that very suitably to the case, for they had yet no right opinion concerning Him. In this commencement moreover He speaks nothing severe, nothing burdensome, as John had concerning the axe laid to the root of the condemned tree, and the like; but he puts first things merciful, preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of heaven.

“From that time.” What time? After John was cast into prison. But why didn’t he start preaching this from the beginning? What occasion did John provide? Didn’t the witness of his works already make this proclamation? He began only at this time to preach in a public way, so that his unique divine identity might become recognized, of which the patriarchs and prophets had already spoken by way of anticipation, as in the voice of Zechariah: “And you, my child, will be called a prophet of the Most High.” And that he might leave no occasion for impetuous Pharisaic interpretations, he remarked, “For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’ The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Here is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ But wisdom is proved right by her actions.” It was necessary, furthermore, that he be correctly identified not by his own words alone but by another. Otherwise, even after so many and such powerful testimonies and demonstrations, they would merely dismiss him by saying “You are testifying on your own behalf; your testimony is not valid.” If John had said nothing, and if Jesus had first come into their midst and testified only of himself, you can imagine what they would have said. So he did not preach publically before John’s coming, nor did he work miracles until John was cast into prison, lest the people be confused.
