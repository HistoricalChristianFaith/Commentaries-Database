Ver. 12. "Yea, and all those that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."

But why, he says, should I speak only of myself? Each one that will live godly will be persecuted. Here he calls afflictions and sorrows, "persecutions," for it is not possible that a man pursuing the course of virtue should not be exposed to grief, tribulation, and temptations. For how can he escape it who is treading in the strait and narrow way, and who has heard, that "in the world you shall have tribulation"? [John 16:33] If Job in his time said, "The life of man upon earth is a state of trial" [Job 7:1, Septuagint]; how much more was it so in those days?

Here he calls afflictions and sorrows “persecutions.” Anyone who pursues the course of virtue should not expect to avoid grief, tribulation and temptations.

If the road is narrow and difficult, how can it be that “My yoke is easy and my burden is light”? He says difficult because of the nature of the trials but easy because of the willingness of the travelers. It is possible for even what is unendurable by nature to become light when we accept it with eagerness. Remember that the apostles who had been scourged returned rejoicing that they had been found worthy to be dishonored for the name of the Lord.
