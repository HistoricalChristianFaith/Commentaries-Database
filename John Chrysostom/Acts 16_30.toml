Do you mark how the wonder overpowered him? (a) He wondered more at Paul's kindness; he was amazed at his manly boldness, that he had not escaped when he had it in his power, that he hindered him from killing himself. (c) And they said, believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house. And they spoke unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.

Why, what had they said? Observe, he does not, on finding himself safe, think all is well; he is overcome with awe at the miraculous power.

Do you mark what happened in the former case, and what here? There a girl was released from a spirit, and they cast them into prison, because they had liberated her from the spirit. Here, they did but show the doors standing open, and it opened the doors of his heart, it loosed two sorts of chains; that (prisoner) kindled the (true) light; for the light in his heart was shining. And he sprang in, and fell before them; and he does not ask, How is this? What is this? But straightway he says, What must I do to be saved? What then answers Paul? Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, you and your house.

Observe, he did not respond because he had been saved, but because he was astonished by their virtue. Do you see what happened in the earlier case and what happened here? Earlier a girl was released from a spirit and they threw them in jail, because they had freed her from the demon. Here they only showed him the doors opened, and it opened the doors of his heart, loosened the double chains and kindled the light. For the light in his heart was bright. “And he rushed in and fell before them,” and he did not ask, “How did this happen? What happened?” Instead, right away he says, “What must I do to be saved?” And what does Paul answer? “Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved,” he says, “you and your household.” This especially draws men, that their household too will be saved. “And they spoke the word to him and to all that were in his house.” He washed them and was washed. He washed their wounds; he himself was washed of his sins. He fed and was fed. “And he rejoiced,” it says. And yet it was nothing but words alone and good hope. This was a sign of his having believed, that he was released from all. What is worse than a jailer? What more savage, more ruthless? Nevertheless it was with great honor that [the jailer] received them. It was not when he was saved that he rejoiced but when “he had believed in God.”
