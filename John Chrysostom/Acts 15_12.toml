"Then all the multitude kept silence." There was no arrogance in the Church. After Peter Paul speaks, and none silences him: James waits patiently, not starts up for the next word. Great the orderliness of the proceedings. No word speaks John here, no word the other Apostles, but held their peace, for James was invested with the chief rule, and think it no hardship. So clean was their soul from love of glory. Peter indeed spoke more strongly, but James here more mildly: for thus it behooves one in high authority, to leave what is unpleasant for others to say, while he himself appears in the milder part.
