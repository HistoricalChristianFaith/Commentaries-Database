You had compassion on them that were in bonds. You see that he is speaking concerning himself and the rest who were in prison. Thus ye did not account bonds to be bonds: but as noble wrestlers so stood ye: for not only ye needed no consolation in your own [distresses], but even became a consolation to others.

And ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods. O! What full assurance of faith! Hebrews 10:22 Then he also sets forth the motive, not only consoling them for their struggles, but also that they might not be shaken from the Faith. When ye saw your property plundered (he means) ye endured; for already ye saw Him who is invisible, as visible: which was the effect of genuine faith, and you showed it forth by your deeds themselves.

Well then, the plundering was perhaps from the force of the plunderers, and no man could prevent it; so that as yet it is not clear, that you endured the plundering for the faith's sake. (Although this too is clear. For it was in your power if you chose, not to be plundered, by not believing.) But ye did what is far greater than this; the enduring such things even with joy; which was altogether , and worthy of those noble souls, who rejoiced when scourged. For, it says, they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the Name. Acts 5:41 But he that endures with joy, shows that he has some reward, and that the affair is no loss but a gain.

Moreover the expression ye took shows their willing endurance, because, he means, you chose and accepted.

Knowing (he says) that you have for yourselves in heaven a better and an enduring substance; instead of saying, firm, not perishing like this.
