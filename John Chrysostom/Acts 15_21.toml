"For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day." Since then they had heard of the Law, with good reason he enjoins these things from the Law, that he may not seem to make it of no authority. And yet observe how he does not let them be told these things from the Law, but from himself, saying, It is not that I heard these things from the Law, but how? "We have judged." Then the decree is made in common. This above all quieted them. For this cause I affirm that it is good so to write to them. Then why do we not write the same injunctions to Jews also? Moses discourses unto them. See what condescension to their weakness! Where it did no harm, he set him up as teacher, and indulged them with a gratification which hindered nothing, by permitting Jews to hear him in regard of these matters, even while leading away from him them of the Gentiles. See what wisdom! He seems to honor him, and to set him up as the authority for his own people, and by this very thing he leads away the Gentiles from him!
