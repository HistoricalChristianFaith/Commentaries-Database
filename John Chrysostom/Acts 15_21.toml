Moses discourses to them. Look how great is the condescension [to their weakness]! Where it did no harm, he set him up as teacher and indulged them with a gratification that hindered nothing, permitting Jews to listen to him in regard to these matters while leading away the Gentiles. Look at his wisdom! He seemed to honor him and to set him up as the authority for his own people, but at the same time he led the Gentiles away from him. Why shouldn’t they learn from him? Because of the strangeness of these things. He shows that even the Jews need observe no more [than these necessary things]. And if we do not write to them, it is not because they are bound to observe anything more but because they have one to tell them. And he does not say, “do not offend them” or “do not turn them back,” which is what Paul said to the Galatians, but “do not trouble them.” He shows that success in this case would bring nothing but nuisance. Thus he made an end of the whole matter. And while he seems to preserve the law by adopting these rules from it, he unbinds it by taking these alone.
