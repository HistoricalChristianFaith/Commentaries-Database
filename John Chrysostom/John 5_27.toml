And wherefore does He continually  dwell upon resurrection and judgment? For He says, As the Father raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will: and again, the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son: and again, As the Father has life in Himself so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and again, They that have heard [the Voice of the Son of God] shall live; and here again, Hath given to Him authority to execute judgment. Wherefore does He dwell on these things continually? I mean, on judgment, and life, and resurrection? It is because these subjects are able most of any to attract even the obstinate hearer.  For the man who is persuaded that he shall both rise again and shall give account to Christ  of his transgressions, even though he have seen no other sign, yet having admitted this, will surely run to Him to propitiate his Judge.
