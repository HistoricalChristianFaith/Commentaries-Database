"So Christ was once  offered." By whom offered? Evidently by Himself. Here he says that He is not Priest only, but Victim also, and what is sacrificed.  On this account are [the words] "was offered." "Was once offered" (he says) "to bear  the sins of many." Why "of many," and not "of all"? Because not all believed. For He died indeed for all, that is His part: for that death was a counterbalance  against the destruction of all men. But He did not bear the sins of all men, because they were not willing.

And what is [the meaning of] "He bare the sins"? Just as in the Oblation we bear up our sins and say, "Whether we have sinned voluntarily or involuntarily, do Thou forgive,"  that is, we make mention of them first, and then ask for their forgiveness. So also was it done here. Where has Christ done this? Hear Himself saying, "And for their sakes I sanctify  Myself." [John 17:19] Lo! He bore the sins. He took them from men, and bore them to the Father; not that He might determine anything  against them [mankind], but that He might forgive them.

"Unto them that look for Him shall He appear" (he says) "the second time without sin unto salvation." What is "without sin"? It is as much as to say, He sins not. For neither did He die as owing the debt of death, nor yet because of sin. But how "shall He appear"? To punish, you say. He did not however say this, but what was cheering; "shall He appear unto them that look for Him, without sin unto salvation." So that for the time to come they no longer need sacrifices to save themselves, but to do this by deeds.
