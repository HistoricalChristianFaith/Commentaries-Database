Consider along with me the wickedness of those who were their accusers, and how maliciously and bitterly they brought the accusation!… They did not merely mention the nation, but they also bring to mind their [the Jews’] honorable positions, that they may inflame the wrath of the king. It is almost as if they had said, “These slaves, these captives, who are without a city, you have made rulers over us. But they show contempt for such an honor and treat insolently the one who has given them this honor!” They go on then to say, “The Jews whom you have set over the province of Babylon do not obey or serve your gods.” The accusation becomes their greatest praise; and the crimes imputed, their encomium; a testimony that is unassailable as it is brought forward by their enemies.
