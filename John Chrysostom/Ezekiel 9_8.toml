You see, even if it is the wicked who perish, nevertheless the souls of good people are likely to show compassion when they see people being punished; and you will find each of the good people and the inspired writers making earnest supplication for them.

It is, after all, the practice of the prophets and the just to grieve not only for themselves but for the rest of humanity. If you are inclined to check that, you will find them all giving evidence of this compassion—for example, you can listen to Isaiah’s words, “Don’t put yourself out to comfort me for the destruction of the daughter of my people”; or Jeremiah, … “Who will pour water on my head and provide a fountain of tears for my eyes?” or Ezekiel, “Alas, Lord, will you destroy what remains of Israel?”
