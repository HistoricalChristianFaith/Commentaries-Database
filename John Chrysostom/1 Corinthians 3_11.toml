The foundation is already in place, and no one can change it. Let us therefore build on it and cling to it in the way that branches cling to the vine, so that there is no gap between us and Christ. For the minute a gap opens up between the vine and its branches, the branches wither and perish. Similarly, if a building is not cemented to its foundation, it will collapse. Therefore, let us not merely cling to Christ, but let us be cemented to him, for if we stand apart we shall perish.
