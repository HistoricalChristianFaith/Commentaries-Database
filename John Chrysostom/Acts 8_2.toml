But he, being full of the Holy Ghost, looked up steadfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God. And when he said, I see the heavens opened, they stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord. (v. 56, 57.) And yet in what respect are these things deserving of accusation? Upon him, the man who has wrought such miracles, the man who has prevailed over all in speech, the man who can hold such discourse!

But after all these things, not only did he not believe, but also aimed at Him with a thousand hands: for this is why it says, And Saul was consenting unto his death.— And this blessed man does not simply pray, but does it with earnestness: having kneeled down. Mark his divine death! So long only the Lord permitted the soul to remain in him. And having said this, he fell asleep. Acts 7:60— And they were all scattered abroad throughout the region of Judea and Samaria.
