It is obvious that sacrifices were established as an instruction to inspire right living in the people and were not given as an end in themselves. When the people refused to do those works that were necessary in order to busy themselves with only sacrifices, God said that he would no longer accept the sacrifices.
The entire book of Leviticus offers laws that are very strict regarding sacrifices. Moreover, there are numerous laws concerning sacrifices scattered throughout the book of Deuteronomy, as well as other books. How then can God ask, “Who has required these things from your hands?” This is to teach us that God’s will was not to make laws in this way but that the people suffered from slothfulness in not abiding by this command. - "Commentary on Isaiah 1.4"
