"Wherefore also" - that they may not think the affair a breach of the law on his part, nor Cornelius suppose that because he was in a station of command therefore he had complied, but that they may ascribe all to God - "wherefore also I came without gainsaying as soon as I was sent for:" though not only to keep company, but even to come unto him was not permitted. "I ask therefore, for what intent ye have sent for me." Already Peter had heard the whole matter from the soldiers also, but he wishes them first to confess, and to make them amenable to the Faith.
