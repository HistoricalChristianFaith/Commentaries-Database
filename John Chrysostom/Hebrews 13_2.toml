Therefore (he says) some have entertained angels unawares. Do you see how great was the honor, how great the gain!

What is unawares? They entertained them without knowing it. Therefore the reward also was great, because he entertained them, not knowing that they were Angels. For if he had known it, it would have been nothing wonderful. Some say that he here alludes to Lot also.
