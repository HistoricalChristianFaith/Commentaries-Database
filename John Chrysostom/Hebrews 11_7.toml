"By faith Noah, being warned of God  of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house; by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by Faith."

1. "By faith" (he says) "Noah being warned of God." As the Son of God, speaking of His own coming, said, "In the days of Noah they married and were given in marriage" [Luke 17:26-27], therefore the Apostle also recalled to their mind an appropriate image. For the example of Enoch, was an example only of Faith; that of Noah, on the other hand, of unbelief also. And this is a complete consolation and exhortation, when not only believers are found approved, but also unbelievers suffer the opposite.

For what does he say? "By faith being warned of God."  What is "being warned of God"? It is, "It having been foretold to him." But why is the expression "divine communication"  [Luke 2:26] used? For in another place also it is said, "and it was communicated  to him by the Spirit," and again, "and what says the divine communication?"  [Romans 11:4] Do you see the equal dignity of the Spirit? For as God reveals,  so also does the Holy Spirit. But why did he speak thus? The prophecy is called "a divine communication."

"Of things not seen as yet," he says, that is of the rain.

"Moved with fear, prepared an ark." Reason indeed suggested nothing of this sort; For "they were marrying and being given in marriage"; the air was clear, there were no signs [of change]: but nevertheless he feared: "By faith" (he says) "Noah being warned of God of things not seen as yet, moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house."

How is it, "By the which he condemned the world"? He showed them to be worthy of punishment, since they were not brought to their senses even by the preparation.

"And he became" (he says) "heir of the righteousness which is by Faith": that is, by his believing God he was shown to be righteous. For this is the [part] of a soul sincerely disposed towards Him and judging nothing more reliable than His words, just as Unbelief is the very contrary.  Faith, it is manifest, works righteousness. For as we have been warned of God respecting Hell, so was he also: and yet at that time he was laughed at; he was reviled and ridiculed; but he regarded none of these things.

“Noah became,” he says, “an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.” That is, by his believing God, he was shown to be righteous. For this is the part of a soul sincerely disposed toward God and judging nothing more reliable than God’s words, just as unbelief is the very contrary. Faith, it is clear, works righteousness. For as we have been warned of God respecting hell, so was Noah. Yet at that time he was laughed at, reviled and ridiculed, but he regarded none of these things.
