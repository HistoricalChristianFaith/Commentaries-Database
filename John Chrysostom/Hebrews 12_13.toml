He speaks as to runners, and boxers, and warriors. Do you see how he arms them, how he encourages them? Walk straight, he says. Here he speaks with reference to their thoughts; that is to say, not doubting. For if the chastisement be of love, if it begin from loving care, if it end with a good result (and this he proves both by facts and by words, and by all considerations), why are you dispirited? For such are they who despair, who are not strengthened by the hope of the future. Walk straight, he says, that your lameness may not be increased, but brought back to its former condition. For he that runs when he is lame, galls the sore place. Do you see that it is in our power to be thoroughly healed?
