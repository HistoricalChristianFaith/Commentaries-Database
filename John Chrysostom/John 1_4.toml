(Hom. v. [iv.] in Joan. c. 1, 2) Or to give an other explanation. We will not put the stop at without Him was not any thing made, as the heretics do. For they wishing to prove the Holy Ghost a creature, read, That which was made in Him, was life. But this cannot be so understood. For first, this was not the place for making mention of the Holy Ghost. But let us suppose it was; let us take the passage for the present according to their reading, we shall see that it leads to a difficulty. For when it is said, That, which was made in Him, was life; they say the life spoken of is the Holy Ghost. But this life is also light; for the Evangelist proceeds, The life was the light of men. Where fore according to them, he calls the Holy Ghost the light of all men. But the Word mentioned above, is what he here calls consecutively, God, and Life, and Light. Now the Word was made flesh. It follows that the Holy Ghost is incarnate, not the Son. Dismissing then this reading, we adopt a more suitable one, with the following meaning: All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made which was made: there we make a stop, and begin a fresh sentence: In Him was life. Without Him was not any thing made which wan made; (γενητὸν) i. e. which could be made. You see how by this short addition, he removes any difficulty which might follow. For by introducing without Him was not any thing made, and adding, which was made, be includes all things invisible, and excepts the Holy Spirit: for the Spirit cannot be made. (δημιουργίας) To the mention of creation, succeeds that of providence. In Him was life1. As a fountain which produces vast depths of water, and yet is nothing diminished at the fountain head; so worketh the Only-Begotten. How great soever His creations be, He Himself is none the less for them. By the word life here is meant not only creation, but that providence by which the things created are preserved. But when you are told that in Him was life, do not suppose Him compounded; for, as the Father hath life in Himself, so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself. (John 5:26) As then you would not call the Father compounded, so neither should you the Son.

We will not put the break at “without him was not any thing made,” as the heretics do. For they are trying to prove the Holy Spirit is a creature and so read, “That which was made in him was life.” But this cannot be so understood. For first of all, this was not the place for mentioning the Holy Spirit.… But let us suppose it was; let us take the passage for the present according to their reading, and we shall see that it leads to a difficulty. For when it is said, “That which was made in him was life,” they say the life spoken of is the Spirit. But this life is also light, for the Evangelist proceeds, “The life was the light of men [humankind].” And so, according to them, “light of men” here means the Spirit.… But the Word mentioned above is what he here calls consecutively God and life and light. If now this Word was life and if this Word and the life became flesh … it follows that the Spirit is incarnate, not the Son.…Dismissing then this reading, we adopt a more suitable one, with the following meaning: “All things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.” There we make a break and begin a fresh sentence: “In him was life. Without him was not any thing made which was as made,” that is, that could be made. You see how by this short addition he removes any difficulty that might follow. For by introducing “without him was not any thing made” and adding “which was made,” he includes all things invisible but excludes the Spirit.… For the Spirit is uncreated. Do you see the precision of his teaching?

John spoke of the work of creation, that “all things were made by him, and without him was not anything made that was made.” And so now he goes on to speak concerning his providence, where he says, “In him was life.” That no one may doubt how so many and so great things were “made by him,” he adds, “In him was life.” For as [it is] with the fountain, which is the mother of the great deeps—however much you take away, you do not lessen the fountain—so [it is] with the energy of the Only Begotten. However much you believe has been produced and made by it, it has not diminished. Or, to use a more familiar example, I will use the instance of light, which the apostle himself added immediately, saying, “And the life was the light.” Light, however many millions of times it may enlighten, suffers no diminution of its own brightness. In the same way also God, before commencing his work and after completing it, remains alike indefectible, undiminished, unwearied by the greatness of the creation. No, if it were necessary that ten thousand or even an infinite number of such worlds were created, he still remains the same, sufficient for them all not merely to produce but also to control them after their creation. For the word life here refers not merely to the act of creation but also to the providence engaged in maintaining the things created.

It also lays down beforehand the doctrine of the resurrection and is the beginning of these marvelous good tidings, since when “life” has come to be with us, the power of death is dissolved; and when “light” has shone upon us, there is no longer darkness, but life always remains within us, and death cannot overcome it. So that what is asserted of the Father might be asserted absolutely of [Christ] also, that “in him we live and move and have our being.” As Paul has shown when he says, “By him were all things created” and “by him all things consist.” Thus, [Christ] has been called also “root” and “foundation.”
