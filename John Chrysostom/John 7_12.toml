I think they were exasperated by the place where the miracle had been wrought, and were  greatly infuriated and afraid, not so much from anger at what had gone before, as from fear lest He should again work something similar. But all fell out contrary to what they desired, and against their will they rendered Him conspicuous.

And some said, He is a good man; others said, Nay, but He deceives the people.

Methinks the first of these opinions was that of the many, the other that of the rulers and priests. For to slander Him suited their malice and wickedness. He deceives, say they, the people. How, tell me? Was it by seeming to work, not really working miracles? But experience witnesses  the contrary.

The former, I think, was the opinion of the multitude, the one, that is, who pronounced him a good man. The latter is the opinion of the priests and rulers, as is shown by their saying, “He deceives the people” not “He deceives us.” … Observe that the corruption is in the rulers. The common people are sound in their judgment but do not have freedom of speech, as is generally the case.
