"But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how great things he must suffer for My name's sake." "Not only," saith He, "shall he be a believer, but even a teacher, and great boldness shall he show: before Gentiles and kings"-such shall be the spread of the doctrine!-that just as He astonished him by the former, so He may startle him even more by the latter.

And justly he is called "a vessel" (or, instrument)-for reason shows that evil is not a physical quality: "a vessel of election" (or, chosen instrument), He saith; for we choose that which is approved. For there was indeed need of strength. Since He says, "a vessel of election," that thou mayest not imagine that God is to do all, He adds, "to bear My Name before Gentiles and kings, and the children of Israel." Ananias has heard what he most desired-that against the Jews also he will take his stand: this above all gave him courage. "For I," saith He, "will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name's sake." At the same time also this is said by way of putting Ananias to the blush: If he, that was so frantic, shall suffer all things, and thou not willing even to baptize him!

And what is wonderful indeed is, that he shall first know "how great things he shall suffer," and then shall take the field against the perils.
