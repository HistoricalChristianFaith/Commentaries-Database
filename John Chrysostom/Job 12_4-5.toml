“Did I lose my common sense, by any chance,” Job says, “because I fell into misery?” Here he presents himself as a righteous man, not by testifying to his perfect virtue but to the fact that he did not do anything wrong to anyone and that nobody can blame him. “And that my houses should be spoiled by transgressors,” it was necessary that this happened, he says. It had been ordained from above. “However,” he says, “do not believe that these misfortunes will stop for me. Indeed, if I, who have committed no act of injustice, suffer so, the wicked will suffer even more so.”
