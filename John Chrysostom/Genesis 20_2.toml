“Abraham moved from there to the southern land,” the text goes on, “and dwelt between Kadesh and Shur, sojourning at Gerar.” Moved on from where? From the place where he was camped, where he was given the privilege of hosting the Lord of all with the angels. Moving from there, the text says, “he sojourned in Gerar.” Notice the life of these good people, how restrained and austere it was, how they shifted place with ease and conducted their life like pilgrims or nomads, pitching their tent at one time in this place, at another in that, as though living in a strange land. They are unlike us, who live in a strange land as though in our home country, erecting extravagant mansions, porches and covered walks, possessing land, building baths and countless other luxuries.By contrast see the good man holding all his possessions in his household and flocks alone. [He is] never staying in one place but at one time pitching his tent in Bethel, at another by the oak of Mamre, at another going down to Egypt and now camping at Gerar, submitting to all this with ease and giving clear evidence in every way of gratitude to his own Lord. Despite such wonderful promises and guarantees given him by God, he saw himself beset by such imposing difficulties and encountering such varied and differing trials. Yet he stood unshaken like some piece of steel, showing his godly attitude and proving no less resolute in any of the problems surrounding him. See in the present instance too, dearly beloved, the kind of trial that befell him at Gerar and the wonderful caliber of the just man’s virtue. What everyone else found unbearable and could not bring themselves to accept he put up with without complaint and without demanding from the Lord explanation of what happened, as many people do, even though weighed down with countless burdens of sin. When they encounter some difficulties, they become meddlesome and inquisitive, saying, “Why has this or that happened?” The just man, on the contrary, didn’t behave like that; hence he enjoyed greater favor from on high. This, after all, is truly the mark of a dutiful servant, not to pry into reasons for what is done by the master but to accept everything in silence and with deep thanks.
