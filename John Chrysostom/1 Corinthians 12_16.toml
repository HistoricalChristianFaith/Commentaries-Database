"And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?"

For if the one being made inferior and the other superior, does not allow their being of the body, the whole is done away. Do not say therefore, "I am not the body, because I am inferior." For the foot also has the inferior post, yet is it of the body: for the being or not being part of the body, is not from the one lying in this place and the other in that; (which is what constitutes difference of place;) but from the being conjoined or separated. For the being or not being a body, arises from the having been made one or not. But do thou, I pray, mark his considerate way, how he applies their words to our members. For as he said above, "These things have I in a figure transferred to myself and Apollos," [1 Corinthians 4:6] just so likewise here, to make his argument free from invidiousness and acceptable, he introduces the members speaking: that when they shall hear nature answering them, being thus convicted by experience herself and by the general voice, they may have nothing further to oppose. "For say, if you will," says he, "this very thing, murmur as you please, you cannot be out of the body. For as the law of nature, so much more does the power of grace guard all things and preserve them entire." And see how he kept to the rule of having nothing superfluous; not working out his argument on all the members, but on two only and these the extremes; having specified both the most honorable of all, the eye, and the meanest of all, the feet. And he does not make the foot to discourse with the eye, but with the hand which is mounted a little above it; and the ear with the eyes. For because we are wont to envy not those who are very far above us, but those who are a little higher, therefore he also conducts his comparison thus.

Note that Paul couples the foot with the hand, which is mounted a little above it, and the ear with the eye likewise. This is because we are prone to envy not those who are far above us but those who are only a little bit above.
