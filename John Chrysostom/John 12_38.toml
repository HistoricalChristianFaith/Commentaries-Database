Here again observe that the words “because” and “spoke” refer not to the cause of their unbelief but to the event. For it was not “because” Isaiah spoke that they did not believe. Rather, it was because they were not about to believe, which is why [Isaiah] spoke. Why then doesn’t the Evangelist express it this way instead of making the unbelief proceed from the prophecy, not the prophecy from the unbelief? And further on he puts this very thing more emphatically, saying, “Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah had said.” He wants to establish by many proofs the unerring truth of Scripture, and that what Isaiah foretold happened in no other way than what he said would happen. For in case anyone should say, “Why did Christ come? Didn’t he know that they would not listen to him?” he introduces the prophets, who knew this also. But he came that they might have no excuse for their sin. For what the prophet foretold, he foretold that it would certainly happen. If they were not most certainly going to happen, he could not have foretold them. And they were certainly going to happen because these people were incurable.
