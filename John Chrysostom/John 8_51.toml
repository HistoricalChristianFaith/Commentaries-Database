Here he speaks not only of faith but also of a pure life. Above he said “shall have everlasting life,” but here he says “shall not see death.” At the same time he intimates that they could do nothing against him, for if the one who keeps his word does not die, much less is it possible that he himself should die. At least this is how they understood what he said.
