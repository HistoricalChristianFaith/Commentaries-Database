When this question is raised, John does not rebuke his disciples for fear they might leave and turn to some other school. Rather, he replies gently, “A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven.” Do not be surprised that he seems to speak somewhat humbly of Christ, especially when you consider that it was not appropriate to tell the whole truth to minds prepossessed with such a passion as envy. He only tries at present to alarm them by showing them that they are making war against none other than God himself when they attack Christ.… It is as if he said it is no wonder that Christ does such excellent works and that everyone comes to him when you consider that the one who does it all is God. Human efforts are easily seen through, are feeble and short-lived. These actions of Jesus are not like that. They are not therefore of human but of divine origin.
