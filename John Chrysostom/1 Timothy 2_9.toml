Equally with men, women are called to approach God without wrath or doubting, lifting up holy hands, not following their own desires, nor being covetous or rapacious.… Paul however requires something more of women, that they adorn themselves “in modest apparel, with self-effacement and sobriety” … such attire as covers them completely, and decently, not with superfluous ornaments, for the one is becoming, the other is not.

For what reason will you be able to state, what defense, when the Lord lays these pearls to your charge and brings the poor who have perished with hunger into your midst? On this account Paul said, “not with braided hair, or gold, or pearls or costly raiment.” For these would be a snare.… Take off all ornament and place it in the hands of Christ through the poor.
