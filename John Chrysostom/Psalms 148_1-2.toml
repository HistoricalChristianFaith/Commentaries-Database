However, what God actually is, not only have the prophets not seen, but not even angels or archangels. If you ask them, you will not hear them reply anything about his substance, but only singing, “Glory to God in the highest and peace on earth among people of good will.” If you desire to learn something even from the cherubim or seraphim, you will hear the mystical melody of his holiness and that “heaven and earth are full of his glory.” If you inquire of the higher powers, you will discover nothing else than that their one work is to praise God, for, “Praise him, all his powers,” the psalmist said.
