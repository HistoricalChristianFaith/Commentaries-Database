"For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine." Before they grow stiffnecked, preoccupy them all. For this reason he says, "in season, out of season"; do everything, so as to have willing disciples. "But after their own lusts," he says, "shall they heap to themselves teachers." Nothing can be more expressive than these words. For by saying "they shall heap to themselves," he shows the indiscriminate multitude of the teachers, as also by their being elected by their disciples. "They shall heap to themselves teachers," he says, "having itching ears." Seeking for such as speak to gratify and delight their hearers. "And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned unto fables." This he foretells, not as willing to throw him into despair, but to prepare him to bear it firmly, when it shall happen. As Christ also did in saying, "They will deliver you up, and they will scourge you, and bring you before the synagogues, for My name's sake." (Matt. x. 17.) And this blessed man elsewhere says, "For I know this, that after my departures shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock." (Acts xx. 29.) But this he said that they might watch, and duly use the present opportunity.
