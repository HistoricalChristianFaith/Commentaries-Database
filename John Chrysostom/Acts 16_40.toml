They departed, not in obedience to the magistrates, but hastening to the work of preaching. For the city had been sufficiently benefited by the miracle. It was necessary that they remain no longer. For the miracle seems greater in the absence of those who worked it; it speaks louder by itself. The faith of the jailer was a voice in itself. What can equal this? He is put in chains and he loosens, though in chains, a twofold bond. He who put him in chains he releases by being in chains. Truly these are works of grace.
