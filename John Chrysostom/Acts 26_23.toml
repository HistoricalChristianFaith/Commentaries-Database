"Whether the Christ was to suffer:" then the Resurrection and the promise, "Whether He, as the first to rise from the dead, should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles." Festus saw the boldness, and what says he? For Paul was all along addressing himself to the king-he was in a manner annoyed.

Now this had a stronger claim upon belief, as having actually come to pass: but since he alone saw Christ, he again fetches proof of it from the prophets. And see how he does not discourse alike in the court of justice, and in the assembly of his own people; there indeed he says, "ye slew Him:" but here no such thing, that he might not kindle their anger more: but he shows the same thing, by saying, "Whether the Christ was to suffer." He so frees them from accusations: for the prophets, he says, say this. Therefore receive ye also the rest.
