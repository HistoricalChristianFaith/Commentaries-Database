Which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and steadfast, and which enters into that within the veil: whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made High Priest forever after the order of Melchisedec. He shows, that while we are still in the world, and not yet departed from [this] life, we are already among the promises. For through hope we are already in heaven.  He said, Wait; for it shall surely be. Afterwards giving them full assurance, he says, nay rather by hope. And he said not, We are within, but 'It has entered within,' which was more true and more persuasive. For as the anchor, dropped from the vessel, does not allow it to be carried about, even if ten thousand winds agitate it, but being depended upon makes it steady, so also does hope.

And see how very suitable an image he has discovered: For he said not, Foundation; which was not suitable; but, Anchor. For that which is on the tossing sea, and seems not to be very firmly fixed, stands on the water as upon land, and is shaken and yet is not shaken. For in regard to those who are very firm, and philosophic, Christ with good reason made that statement, saying, Whosoever has built his house on a rock. Matthew 7:24 But in respect of those who are giving way, and who ought to be carried through by hope, Paul has suitably set down this. For the surge and the great storm toss the boat; but hope suffers it not to be carried hither and there, although winds innumerable agitate it: so that, unless we had this [hope] we should long ago have been sunk. Nor is it only in things spiritual, but also in the affairs of this life, that one may find the power of hope great. Whatever it may be, in merchandise, in husbandry, in a military expedition, unless one sets this before him, he would not even touch the work. But he said not simply Anchor, but sure and steadfast [i.e.] not shaken. Which enters into that within the veil; instead of 'which reaches through even to heaven.'
