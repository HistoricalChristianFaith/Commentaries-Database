[Paul] left them in Ephesus so that they might teach. Indeed those who had stayed with him for such a long time had learned many things; he had not, however, completely detached them from the Jewish customs.

"And with him Priscilla" - lo, a woman also - "and Aquila." But these he left at Ephesus. With good reason, namely, that they should teach. For having been with him so long time, they were learning many things: and yet he did not at present withdraw them from their custom as Jews. "And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews."
