This verse seems to point toward Barnabas, who was commissioned along with Paul.

And not only so.

What is, and not only so? 'Not only on this account,' he says, 'is respect due to him, that he is approved as a preacher and is praised by all.'

Therefore we sought out such persons, and entrusted not the whole to one person only, that he might escape this suspicion also; but we sent both Titus and another with him. Then to interpret this same expression, to the glory of the Lord and your ready mind:
