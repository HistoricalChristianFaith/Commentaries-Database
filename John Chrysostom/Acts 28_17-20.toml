He wished to exculpate both himself and others; himself, that they might not accuse him, and by so doing hurt themselves; and those others, that it might not seem that the whole thing was of their doing. For it was likely that a report was prevalent, that he had been delivered up by the Jews; and this was enough to alarm them. He therefore addresses himself to this, and defends himself as to his own conduct.

"Who having examined me," says he, "found nothing in me." When those ought to have rescued, they "delivered him into the hands of the Romans." And such the superabundance, because those had not power to condemn but delivered him prisoner. "Not as having aught to accuse my nation of," am I come. See what friendliness of expression "my nation:" he does not hold them as aliens. He does not say, I do not accuse, but, "I have not whereof to accuse:" although he had suffered so many evils at their hands. But nothing of all this does he say, nor make his speech offensive: neither does he seem to be sparing them as matter of favor. For this was the main point, to show that they delivered him prisoner to the Romans, when those ought to have condemned him. "For this cause," he says, "I wished to see you:" that it might not be in any man's power to accuse me, and to say what naturally might suggest itself, that having escaped their hands I have come for this: not to bring evils upon others, but myself fleeing from evils. "I was compelled to appeal unto Caesar."
