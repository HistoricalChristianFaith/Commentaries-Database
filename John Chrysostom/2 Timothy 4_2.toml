Ver. 2. "Preach the word: be instant in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine."

What means "in season, out of season"? That is, have not any limited season: let it always be your season, not only in peace and security, and when sitting in the Church. Whether thou be in danger, in prison, in chains, or going to your death, at that very time reprove. Withhold not rebuke, for reproof is then most seasonable, when your rebuke will be most successful, when the reality is proved. "Exhort," he says. After the manner of physicians, having shown the wound, he gives the incision, he applies the plaster. For if you omit either of these, the other becomes useless. If you rebuke without convicting, you will seem to be rash, and no one will tolerate it, but after the matter is proved, he will submit to rebuke: before, he will be headstrong. And if you convict and rebuke, but vehemently, and do not apply exhortation,  all your labor will be lost. For conviction  is intolerable in itself if consolation be not mingled with it. As if incision, though salutary in itself, have not plenty of lenitives to assuage the pain, the patient cannot endure cutting and hacking, so it is in this matter.

"With all longsuffering and doctrine." For he that reproves is required to be longsuffering, that he may not believe hastily, and rebuke needs consolation, that it may be received as it ought. And why to "longsuffering" does he add "doctrine"? "Not as in anger, not as in hatred, not as insulting over him, not as having caught an enemy. Far be these things from you." But how? As loving as sympathizing with him, as more distressed than himself at his grief, as melted at his sufferings? "With all longsuffering and doctrine." No ordinary teaching is implied.

Whether you are in danger, in prison, in chains or going to your death, at that very time do not hesitate to admonish. Do not withhold your admonition. For it is then most seasonable, when your rebuke will be most successful, when the circumstance is at hand. “Exhort,” he says. After the manner of physicians, having shown the wound, he makes the incision, he applies the remedy. If you omit either of these, the other becomes useless. If you rebuke without convicting, you will seem to be rash, and no one will tolerate it. After the matter is proved, one will submit to rebuke. But before this, he will be headstrong. If you convict and rebuke, but vehemently, but do not apply exhortation, all your labor will be lost. For conviction is intolerable in itself if consolation is not mingled with it.

Therefore, let food, and bathing, and banqueting, and the other necessities of life have a definite time. But let instruction about the love of truth from above have no set hour—let all the time belong to it. “In season, out of season, reprove, entreat, rebuke,” Scripture says. And the prophet, “On his law he will meditate day and night.” And Moses too asked the Jews to do this continually.
