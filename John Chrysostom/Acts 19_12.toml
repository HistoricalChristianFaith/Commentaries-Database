What Christ is saying is this, "Whoever believes in me will, in my name, do greater signs than I have done." And these are the greater signs that they did: their shadows raised the dead. Thus was the power of Christ especially proclaimed, since it was not so marvelous that he performed miracles while living, as it was that, when he had died, others were able to do greater than [Christ] in his own name. This itself was the most irrefutable demonstration of the resurrection. He would not, even had he been seen, have been believed to such an extent, since they could have said that he was a phantasm, but should someone see greater signs occur from the mere mention of his name—even when he was among humankind in the flesh—that one, unless terribly shameless, would not have refused to believe.

"So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them." Not touched the wearer only and so were healed, but also receiving them, they laid them upon the sick and so healed them. "He that believeth on Me," saith Christ, "doeth greater works than those which I do." This, and the miracle of the shadows is what He meant in those words. Wonderful, how great the power of them that have believed! Mark the infatuated Jewish hardness. Having seen his garments working miracles, they paid no heed to it. What could be greater than this? But, on the contrary, it resulted in just the opposite effect.
