Already at the outset he has secured a hold upon their minds by saying, "This Paul hath turned away much people, saying, that they be no gods, which are made with men's hands." See what it is that the heathen are so indignant at; because he said that "they which be made of men are no gods." Throughout, he drives his speech at their craft. Then that which most grieved them he brings in afterwards. But, with the other gods, he would say, we have no concern, but that "the temple also of the great goddess Diana is in danger to be destroyed." Then, lest he should seem to say this for the sake of lucre, see what he adds: "Whom the whole world worshippeth." Observe how he showed Paul's power to be the greater, proving all their gods to be wretched and miserable creatures, since a mere man, who was driven about, a mere tentmaker, had so much power.

For, lest they should consider within themselves how strange, that a human being should have such power as this, and if a human being has power to effect such things, why then one ought to be persuaded by that man, he adds: "not only is this our craft in danger to be set at naught, but also," as if forsooth alleging a greater consideration, "the temple of the great goddess Diana," etc. "whom all Asia and the world worshippeth."
