And he went out, and followed him; and wist not that it was true which was done by the Angel; but thought he saw a vision. The Lord would have the pleasure come to him all at once, and that he should first be at liberty, and then be sensible of what had happened. The circumstance also of the chains having fallen off from his hands, is a strong argument of his not having fled.

And he wist not that it was true that was done by the Angel, but thought he saw a vision: well he might, by reason of the excessive greatness of the things taking place. Do you mark what a thing it is for a miracle to be excessive? how it amazes the beholder? how it will not let the thing be believed? For if Peter thought he saw a vision, though he had girded himself and put on his shoes, what would have been the case with another?

And he wist not that it was true. If he thought it was true that was happening, he would have been astonished, he would not have remembered all the circumstances: but now, seeming to be in a dream, he was free from perturbation.
