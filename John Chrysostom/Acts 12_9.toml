[Peter] thought he was seeing a vision. Well might he think that, considering the excessive greatness of the things taking place. Do you see what it means for a miracle to be excessive? How it strikes the onlooker dumb, how it does not permit him to disbelieve? If Peter thought he was seeing a vision throughout such a long period of time, even though he had put on his belt and shoes, what would have happened to another person? “And passing,” it says, “the first guard and the second, they came to the iron gate. And they went out and passed on through one street, and immediately the angel departed from him.” What happened within was more marvelous; from here on it is more human. When there was no hindrance, the angel departed. For Peter would not have gotten away otherwise, with so many hindrances in place. It was truly mind-boggling.
