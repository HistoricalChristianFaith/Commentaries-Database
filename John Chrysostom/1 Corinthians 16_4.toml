"And if it be meet for me to go also, they shall go with me."

Here again he exhorts them to liberality. As thus: "if it be so much," says he, "as to require my presence also, neither will I decline this." But he did not in the first instance promise this, nor say, "When I have come I will carry it." For he would not have made so much of it, if he had so set it down from the first. Afterwards however he adds it well and seasonably. Here then you have the reason why he did not immediately promise, nor yet altogether hold his peace concerning it: but having said, "I will send," then at length he adds himself also. And here too again he leaves it to their own decision; in saying, "If it be meet for me to go also:" whereas this rested with them, namely, to make their collection large; so large even, as to affect his plans and cause him in person to make the journey.
