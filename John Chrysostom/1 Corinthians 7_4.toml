The wife does not have power over her own body but is both the servant and the mistress of the husband. If you reject this, you have offended God. But if you want to withdraw yourself sexually, it should only be with your husbandâ€™s permission, and then only for a short time. In other parts of Scripture the husband is given certain prerogatives in marriage, but not here. Where chastity is concerned, husband and wife have equal rights.
