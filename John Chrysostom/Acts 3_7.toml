“ ‘In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, walk.’ And he took him by the right hand and raised him up.” Such was also the way of Christ. Often he healed by word, often by an act, often he also held out his hand, when the people were somewhat weak in faith, so that the cure should not seem to occur by itself. “And he took him by the right hand and raised him up.” This act made manifest the resurrection, for it was an image of the resurrection.
