Jesus is all but saying here, “How are you harmed by the trouble of the world, provided that you are at peace with me? For this peace is not the same as the world’s peace. The world’s peace is external and often more hurtful than profitable, and it is of no real advantage to those who possess it. But I give you the kind of peace that calls for peace with one another. This makes you stronger.”
