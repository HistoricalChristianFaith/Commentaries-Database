When He had then raised the spirit of all, and had persuaded them to feel confidence both with respect to themselves and to all the world, He added, that Many that were first shall be last, and last first. But this although it be spoken also without distinction concerning many others likewise, it is spoken also concerning these men and concerning the Pharisees, who did not believe, even as before also He had said, Many shall come from east and west and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out. Matthew 8:11-12
