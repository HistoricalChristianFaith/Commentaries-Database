For we who have believed, he says, do enter into rest. From what this is evident, he adds: as He said, as I have sworn in My wrath, if they shall enter into My rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world. This indeed, is not evidence that we shall enter in, but that they did not enter in. What then? Thus far he aims to show that as that rest does not hinder the speaking of another rest, so neither does this [exclude] that of Heaven. Up to this point then, he wishes to show that they [the Israelites] did not attain to the rest.
