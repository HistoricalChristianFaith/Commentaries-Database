He taught them that such matters do not demand a judicial sentence, but they were doing everything out of order. And he does not say, “It is not my duty,” but “I do not choose,” so that they may not trouble him again. Thus Pilate said in the case of Christ, “Take him, and judge him according to your law.” But they were just like drunkards and madmen. “And he drove them from the judgment seat”—he effectively closed the tribunal against them. “Then all seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.” This thing, of all others, set them on to this violence: their persuasion that the governor would not even let himself become aware of it. It was a splendid victory. O the shame they were put to! For it is one thing to have come off victorious from a controversy and another for those to learn that he cared nothing for the affair.

“Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord, with his whole house: and many of the Corinthians hearing believed and were baptized.” “With his whole house”: observe the converts in those times doing this with their entire household. [Paul] refers to this Crispus where he writes, “I baptized none save Crispus and Gaius.” This [same] I take to be called Sosthenes—evidently a believer, insomuch that he is beaten and is always present with Paul.

This man let us also imitate: to them that beat us, let us return blow for blow, by meekness, by silence, by long-suffering. More grievous these wounds, greater this blow and more heavy.… You, a human being, insult your fellow man? You, a servant, your fellow servant? But why do I wonder at this, when many even insult God? Let this be a consolation to you when suffering insult. Are you insulted? God also is insulted. Are you reviled? God also was reviled. Are you treated with scorn? Why, so was our Master also. In these things he shares with us but not so in the contrary things. For he never insulted another unjustly: God forbid! He never reviled, never did a wrong. So that we are those who share with him, not you. For to endure when insulted is God’s part; to be merely abusive is the part of the devil.
