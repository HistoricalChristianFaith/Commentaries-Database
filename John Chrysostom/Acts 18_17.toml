He taught them that such matters do not demand a judicial sentence, but they were doing everything out of order. And he does not say, “It is not my duty,” but “I do not choose,” so that they may not trouble him again. Thus Pilate said in the case of Christ, “Take him, and judge him according to your law.” But they were just like drunkards and madmen. “And he drove them from the judgment seat”—he effectively closed the tribunal against them. “Then all seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.” This thing, of all others, set them on to this violence: their persuasion that the governor would not even let himself become aware of it. It was a splendid victory. O the shame they were put to! For it is one thing to have come off victorious from a controversy and another for those to learn that he cared nothing for the affair.
