He taught them that such matters do not demand a judicial sentence, but they were doing everything out of order. And he does not say, “It is not my duty,” but “I do not choose,” so that they may not trouble him again. Thus Pilate said in the case of Christ, “Take him, and judge him according to your law.” But they were just like drunkards and madmen. “And he drove them from the judgment seat”—he effectively closed the tribunal against them. “Then all seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue and beat him before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.” This thing, of all others, set them on to this violence: their persuasion that the governor would not even let himself become aware of it. It was a splendid victory. O the shame they were put to! For it is one thing to have come off victorious from a controversy and another for those to learn that he cared nothing for the affair.

"And he drave them from the judgment-seat"--he effectually closed the tribunal against them. "Then all having seized Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things": but their beating him he did not take as an insult to himself. So petulant were the Jews. This thing, of all others, set them on to this violence--their persuasion that the governor would not even let himself down to notice it. It was a splendid victory. O the shame they were put to! For it is one thing to have come off victorious from a controversy, and another for those to learn that he cared nothing for the affair. "And Gallio cared for none of these things": and yet the whole was meant as an insult to him! But, forsooth, as if they had received authority they did this. Why did he Sosthenes, though he also had authority, not beat them? But they were otherwise trained: so that the judge should learn which party was more reasonable. This was no small benefit to those present--both the reasonableness of these, and the audacity of those. He was beaten, and said nothing. This man let us also imitate: to them that beat us, let us return blow for blow, by meekness, by silence, by long-suffering. More grievous these wounds, greater this blow, and more heavy.
