"In labor and travail."

Perils succeed to labors, labors to perils, one upon other and unintermitted, and allowed him not to take breath even for a little.

"In journeyings often, in hunger and thirst and nakedness, besides those things that are without."

What is left out is more than what is enumerated. Yea rather, one cannot count the number of those even which are enumerated; for he has not set them down specifically, but has mentioned those the number of which was small and easily comprehended, saying, "thrice" and "thrice," [2 Corinthians 11:25] and [again] "once;" but of the others he does not mention the number because he had endured them often.
