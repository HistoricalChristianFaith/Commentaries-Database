"For there stood by me this night the angel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve, saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo God hath given thee all them that sail with thee." So that righteous men, though they may be in a tempest, or on the sea, or in the deep, suffer nothing dreadful, but even save others together with themselves. If here was a ship in danger and suffering wreck, and prisoners were saved for Paul's sake, consider what a thing it is to have a holy man in a house: for many are the tempests which assail us also, tempests far more grievous than these natural ones, but He can also give us to be delivered, if only we obey holy men as those in the ship did, if we do what they enjoin. For they are not simply saved, but themselves also contributed to other men's believing. Though the holy man be in bonds, he does greater works than those who are free.
