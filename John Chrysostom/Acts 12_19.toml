Some people may be at a loss to explain how God allowed his champions to be put to death. And why did the soldiers die on account of Peter, although it was possible for God, after he had saved Peter, to rescue them as well? But it was not yet the time of judgment, to render to each according to his deserts. Besides, it was not Peter who put them into his hands. For what most annoyed Herod was being mocked. Just as when his grandfather was deceived by the wise men, it cut him to the heart being made a laughingstock. “He examined the sentries,” it says, “and ordered that they should be put to death.” And yet he had heard from them (for he examined them) that the chains had been discarded, that Peter had taken his sandals and that until that night he was with them. But what did the sentries conceal? Why didn’t they also flee? Surely, Herod ought to have been amazed and astonished at this. This becomes clear to everyone through these men’s death. The wickedness of Herod is discovered, and that the wonder is of God.
