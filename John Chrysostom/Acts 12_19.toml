Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what was become of Peter. And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that they should be put to death. And he went down from Judea to Cæsarea, and there abode.

Some persons, it is likely, are at a loss how to explain it, that God should quietly look on while (His) champions are put to death, and now again the soldiers on account of Peter: and yet it was possible for Him after (delivering) Peter to rescue them also. But it was not yet the time of judgment, so as to render to each according to his deserts. And besides, it was not Peter that put them into his hands. For the thing that most annoyed him was the being mocked; just as in the case of his grandfather when he was deceived by the wise men, that was what made him (feel) cut to the heart— the being (eluded and) made ridiculous. And having put them to the question, it says, he ordered them to be led away to execution. Matthew 2:16 And yet he had heard from them— for he had put them to the question— both that the chains had been left, and that he had taken his sandals, and that until that night he was with them. Having put them to the question: but what did they conceal? Why then did they not themselves also flee? He ordered them to be led away to execution: and yet he ought to have marvelled, ought to have been astonished at this. The consequence is, by the death of these men (the thing), is made manifest to all: both his wickedness is exposed to view, and (it is made clear that) the wonder (is) of God. And he went down from Judea to Cæsarea, and there abode: and Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country. And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them. And the people gave a shout, saying, 'It is the voice of a god, and not of a man,' And immediately the angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten of worms, and gave up the ghost.

He is now going to mention (a matter of) history: this is the reason why he adds the names, that it may be shown how he keeps to the truth in all things. And, it says, having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country.

Some people may be at a loss to explain how God allowed his champions to be put to death. And why did the soldiers die on account of Peter, although it was possible for God, after he had saved Peter, to rescue them as well? But it was not yet the time of judgment, to render to each according to his deserts. Besides, it was not Peter who put them into his hands. For what most annoyed Herod was being mocked. Just as when his grandfather was deceived by the wise men, it cut him to the heart being made a laughingstock. “He examined the sentries,” it says, “and ordered that they should be put to death.” And yet he had heard from them (for he examined them) that the chains had been discarded, that Peter had taken his sandals and that until that night he was with them. But what did the sentries conceal? Why didn’t they also flee? Surely, Herod ought to have been amazed and astonished at this. This becomes clear to everyone through these men’s death. The wickedness of Herod is discovered, and that the wonder is of God.
