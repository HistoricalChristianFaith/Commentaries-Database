it is not put as affronting (though) it is in fact what they did in the case of the prophets: Talk not to us, said they, with talk— Isaiah 30:10: but since you put it from you— it, he says, not us: for the affront on your part is not to us. For that none may take it as an expression of their piety (that he says,) You judge not yourselves worthy, therefore he first says, You put it from you, and then, We turn unto the Gentiles. The expression is full of gentleness. He does not say, We abandon you, but so that it is possible— he would say— that we may also turn hither again: and this too is not the consequence of the affront from you, for so has (the Lord) commanded us.—

Do you mark how by their contentious behavior they the more extended the preaching, and (how the Apostles here) gave themselves the more to the Gentiles, having (by this very thing) pleaded their justification, and made themselves clear of all blame with their own people (at Jerusalem)? (c) See how by their envy they bring about great things, other (than they looked for): they brought it about that the Apostles spoke out boldly, and came to the Gentiles! For this is why he says, And speaking out boldly, Paul and Barnabas said. They were to go out to the Gentiles: but observe the boldness coming with measure: for if Peter pleaded in his justification, much more these needed a plea, none having called them there. Acts 11:4 But by saying To you first, he showed that to those also it was their duty (to preach), and in saying Necessary, he showed that it was necessary to be preached to them also. But since you turn away from it— he does not say, Woe unto you, and You are punished, but We turn unto the Gentiles. With great gentleness is the boldness fraught! (a) Also he does not say, You are unworthy, but Have judged yourselves unworthy. Lo, we turn unto the Gentiles. For so has the Lord commanded us, saying, I have sent you to be a light of the Gentiles, that you should be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
