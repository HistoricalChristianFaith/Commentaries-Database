"Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye put it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles." Do you mark how by their contentious behavior they the more extended the preaching, and how the Apostles here gave themselves the more to the Gentiles, having by this very thing pleaded their justification, and made themselves clear of all blame with their own people at Jerusalem? See how by their "envy" they bring about great things, other than they looked for: they brought it about that the Apostles spake out boldly, and came to the Gentiles! For this is why he says, "And speaking out boldly, Paul and Barnabas said."

But see what boldness of speech! "It was necessary," he says, "that the word should have been spoken first to you, but since ye put it from you" - it is not put as affronting though it is in fact what they did in the case of the prophets: "Talk not to us," said they, "with talk": "but since ye put it from you" - it, he saith, not us: for the affront on your part is not to us. For that none may take it as an expression of their piety that he says, "Ye judge not yourselves worthy," therefore he first says, "Ye put it from you," and then, "We turn unto the Gentiles." The expression is full of gentleness. He does not say, We abandon you, but so that it is possible - he would say - that we may also turn hither again: and this too is not the consequence of the affront from you, "for so hath the Lord commanded us."

They were to go out to the Gentiles: but observe the boldness coming with measure: for if Peter pleaded in his justification, much more these needed a plea, none having called them there. But by saying "To you first," he showed that to those also it was their duty to preach, and in saying "Necessary," he showed that it was necessary to be preached to them also. "But since ye turn away from it" - he does not say, "Woe unto you," and "Ye are punished," but "We turn unto the Gentiles." With great gentleness is the boldness fraught! Also he does not say, "Ye are unworthy," but "Have judged yourselves unworthy. Lo, we turn unto the Gentiles."
