He has spoken of the bitter passion, of wrath; he now comes to the lesser evil: for that lust is the lesser evil, hear how Moses also in the law says, first, "You shall do no murder" [Exodus 20:13], which is the work of wrath, and then, "You shall not commit adultery" [Exodus 20:14], which is of lust.

Next he passes on to lust, which comes after wrath, as we see in the law of Moses, who first says “You shall not murder,” which springs from wrath, and then “You shall not commit adultery,” which springs from lust. For just as bitterness, clamor and every evil, including blasphemy and the like, belong to the anger-prone, passionate nature, so do fornication, impurity and covetousness belong to the lust-prone, appetitive nature. Just as he earlier prohibited clamorous disorder because it is a vehicle of anger, so he now prohibits filthy and loose talk, because it is a vehicle of lust.
