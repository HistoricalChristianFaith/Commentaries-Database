What is the source of grace for you? And peace? “From God our Father,” Paul writes. In this place Paul does not mention the name of Christ. I will ask those who speak disparagingly of the Spirit, in what way is God the Father of servants? Who wrought these mighty achievements? Who made you a saint? Who faithful? Who a son of God? He who made you worthy to be trusted is the same who caused you to be entrusted with all.

Grace to you and peace from God our Father. Whence comes grace to you? Whence peace? From God, says he, our Father. Although he uses not in this place the name of Christ.

I will ask those who speak disparagingly of the Spirit, Whence is God the Father of servants? Who wrought these mighty achievements? Who made you a saint? Who faithful? Who a son of God? He who made you worthy to be trusted, the same is also the cause of your being entrusted with all.

For we are called faithful, not only because we have faith, but also because we are entrusted of God with mysteries which not even angels knew before us. However, to Paul it was indifferent whether or not to put it thus.
