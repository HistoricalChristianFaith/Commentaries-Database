"And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together. And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean." Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any such, have come to you: but what says he? "Ye know" - God commanded this - "that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation." Then he goes on to say, "And to me God has shown" - this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him - "that I should call no man" - that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, "no human being," says he - "common or unclean."

Do you mark Peter's freedom from all vainglory? But, that he is sent of God, this indeed he mentions; of the manner in which he was sent, he speaks not at present; when the need has arisen, seeing he had said, "Ye know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation," he simply adds, "but to me God hath shown," etc. There is nothing of vainglory here. "All ye," he says, "know." He makes their knowledge stand surety for him.
