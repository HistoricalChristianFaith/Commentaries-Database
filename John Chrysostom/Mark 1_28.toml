Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: The word, Spirit, is applied to an Angel, the air, the soul, and even the Holy Spirit. Lest therefore by the sameness of the name we should fall into error, he adds, “unclean.” And he is called unclean on account of his impiousness and far removal from God, and because he employs himself in all unclean and wicked works.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: As if he said, Methinks that Thou art come; for he had not afirm and certain knowledge of the coming of God. But he calls Him “holy” not as one of many, for every prophet was also holy, but he proclaims that the was the One holy; by the article in Greek he shows Him to be the One, but by his fear he shows Him to be Lord of all.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: Further, the Truth did not wish to have the witness of uncleanspirits.Wherefore there follows, “And Jesus threatened him, saying "Whence a healthful precept is given to us; let us not believe devils, howsoever they may proclaim the truth. It goes on, “And the unclean spirit tearinghim”For because the man spoke as one in his senses and uttered his words with discretion, lest it should be thought that he put together his words not from the devil but out of his own heart, He permitted the man to be torn by the devil, that He might show that it was the devil who spoke.
