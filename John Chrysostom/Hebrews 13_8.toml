In these words, Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and for ever, yesterday means all the time that is past: today, the present: for ever, the endless which is to come. That is to say: You have heard of an High Priest, but not an High Priest who fails. He is always the same. As though there were some who said, 'He is not, another will come,' he says this, that He who was yesterday and today, is the same also for ever. For even now the Jews say, that another will come; and having deprived themselves of Him that is will fall into the hands of Antichrist.

In these words, “Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever,” “yesterday” means all the time that is past; “today,” the present; “forever,” the endless which is to come. That is to say, “You have heard of a high priest, but not a high priest who fails.” He is always the same. As though there were some who said, “He is not, another will come,” he says this, that he who was “yesterday and today,” is “the same also forever.”
