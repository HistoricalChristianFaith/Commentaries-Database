Christ spoke of the betrayer; he foretold that all would run away; he predicted his own death. “I shall smite the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.” He foretold who was going to deny him, when he would do so, and how many times it would happen. He predicted everything accurately. After he had foretold all these things as a sufficient proof that he possessed knowledge of what was going to happen, he went to a certain place to pray. The heretics say that the prayer is the prayer of the divinity; we say it is the prayer of the plan of redemption.
