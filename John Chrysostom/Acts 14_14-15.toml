"Which when the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of, they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out, and saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you." See how on all occasions they are clean from the lust of glory, not only not coveting, but even repudiating it when offered: just as Peter also said, "Why gaze ye on us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made him to walk"? so these also say the same. And Joseph also said of the dreams, "Is not their interpretation of God?" And Daniel in like manner, "And to me also, not through the wisdom that is in me was it revealed." And Paul everywhere says this, as when he says, "And for these things who is sufficient? Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think aught as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God."

Let us imitate them: let us think nothing our own, seeing even faith itself is not our own, but more God's than ours. "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and this," saith he, "not of ourselves; it is the gift of God." Then let us not think great things of ourselves, nor be puffed up, being as we are, men, dust and ashes, smoke and shadow.

Mark the vehemence with which all this is done by the Apostles: "rent their clothes, ran in, cried out," all from strong affection of the soul, revolted by the things that were done. For it was a grief, indeed a grief inconsolable, that they should needs be thought gods, and introduce idolatry, the very thing which they came to destroy! This also was a contrivance of the devil-but he did not prevail. But what say they? "We also are men of like passions with you." At the very outset they overthrew the evil. They said not simply, "Men," but "As ye." Then, that they may not seem to honor the gods, hear what they add: "Preaching unto you, that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, Who made heaven, the sea, and all things that are therein." Observe how they nowhere mention things invisible.

First by the sight they checked them, by rending their garments. This did Joshua the son of Nun upon the occasion of the defeat of the people. Then think not that this action was unworthy of them: for such was the eagerness, they would not otherwise have restrained it would not otherwise have quenched the conflagration. Therefore when need is to do something that is fit to be done, let us not decline it. For if even after all this they hardly persuaded them, if they had not acted thus, what might have been the consequence? For if they had not done thus, they would have been thought to make a show of humility, and to be all the more desirous of the honor. And observe their language, how in rebuking it is moderated, alike full of wonder and of rebuke. This above all it was that hindered them, the saying, "Preaching unto you to turn from these vanities unto God." We are men indeed, they say, but greater than these: for these are dead things. Mark how they not only subvert the false, but teach the true, saying nothing about things invisible-"Who made," say they, "heaven and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein."
