For there women bore rule of old, and this was the law among them. Philip did not yet know for whose sake he had come into the desert: (d) but what was there to hinder his learning all (these particulars) accurately, while in the chariot? Was reading the prophet Esaias.

And the Angel of the Lord spoke unto Philip, saying, arise and go toward the south unto the way that goes down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert. And he arose and went.

It seems to me, this (Philip) was one of the seven; for from Jerusalem he would not have gone southwards, but to the north; but from Samaria it was towards the south. The same is desert: so that there is no fear of an attack from the Jews. And he did not ask, Wherefore? But arose and went. And, behold, it says, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem for to worship, was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Esaias the prophet. (v. 27, 28.) High encomiums for the man, that he, residing in Ethiopia and beset with so much business, and when there was no festival going on, and living in that superstitious city, came to Jerusalem for to worship. Great also is his studiousness, that even sitting in his chariot he read. And, it says, the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join yourself to this chariot. And Philip ran there to him, and heard him reading the prophet Esaias, and said, Do you understand what you read? And he said, How can I, except some man should guide me?

Notice also the reason for his journey, sufficient to reveal his God-fearing attitude of mindâ€”I mean, how long a journey he undertakes so as to pay adoration to the Lord. You see, they were still of the mind that worship was conducted in one place only and consequently traveled long distances to offer prayers there. For this reason, of course, he arrived at the place of the temple and Jewish cult so as to [offer] adoration to the Lord.
