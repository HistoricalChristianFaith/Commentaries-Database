That [the Jews] may not seem to be in the condition of persons cast off he adds, “You know the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace by Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all).” He says this for the sake of the Jews, that he may persuade them also. This is why he forces Cornelius to speak. He says that he “is Lord of all.” But observe at the very outset, “The word,” he says, “which he sent to Israel”; he gives them the preeminence. Then [Peter] adduces these Gentiles themselves as witnesses, “You know,” says he, “the word which was proclaimed throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John preached, how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.” He does not mean, You know Jesus, for they did not know him, but he speaks of the things done by him.
