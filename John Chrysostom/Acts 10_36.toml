"The word which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: He is Lord of all." This he says also for the sake of those present, of the Jews, that He may persuade them also: this is why he forces Cornelius to speak. "He," saith he, "is Lord of all." But observe at the very outset, "The word," says he, "which He sent unto the children of Israel;" he gives them the preeminence.

First he discourses of His being Lord and in exceeding elevated terms, seeing he had to deal with a soul more than commonly elevated, and that took all in with ardor. Then he reserves for the Jews the privilege of their birth. "The word," he says, "which He sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace," not bringing judgment. He is sent to the Jews also: yet for all this He did not spare them. "Preaching peace through Jesus Christ. He is Lord of all."
