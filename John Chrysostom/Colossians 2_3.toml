“In whom are all the treasures.” Christ himself knows all things. “Hid,” for don’t think that you truly and already have all things. These are hidden also even from angels, not from you only; so that you ought to ask all things from him. He himself gives wisdom and knowledge. Now by saying “treasures,” he shows their magnificence, by saying “all,” that he is ignorant of nothing, by “hid,” that he alone knows.
