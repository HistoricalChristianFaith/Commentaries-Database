"King Agrippa," he says, "believest thou"-he does not say, the Resurrection, but-"the prophets?" Then he forestalls him, and says: "I know that thou believest." "In a little" (i.e. within a little,) "almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian." Paul did not understand what the phrase "in a little" meant: he thought it meant "with little cost or trouble", wherefore also he answers as to this: so unlearned was he.
