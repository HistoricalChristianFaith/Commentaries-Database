What is it which they counsel to do?  They wish to stir up the people, as though they themselves would be in danger on suspicion of establishing a kingdom. For if, says one of them, the Romans learn  that this Man is leading the multitudes, they will suspect us,  and will come and destroy our city. Wherefore, tell me? Did He teach revolt? Did He not permit you to give tribute to C&aelig;sar? Did not ye wish to make Him a king, and He fly from you? Did He not follow  a mean and unpretending  life, having neither house nor anything else of the kind? They therefore said this, not from any such expectation, but from malice. Yet it so fell out contrary to their expectation, and the Romans took their nation and city when they had slain Christ. For the things done by Him were beyond all suspicion. For He who healed the sick, and taught the most excellent way of life, and commanded men to obey their rulers, was not establishing but undoing a tyranny. But, says some one, we conjecture from former (impostors). But they taught revolt, He the contrary. Do you see that the words were but a pretense? For what action of the kind did He exhibit? Did He lead about with Him  pompous  guards? Had He a train of chariots? Did He not seek the deserts? But they, that they may not seem to be speaking from their own ill feeling,  say that all the city is in danger, that the common good is being plotted against, and that they have to fear the worst. These were not the causes of your captivity, but things contrary to them; both of this last, and of the Babylonish, and of that under Antiochus which followed: it was not that there were worshipers among you, but that there were among you those who did unjustly, and excited God to wrath, this caused you to be given up into bondage. But such a thing is envy, allowing men to see nothing which they ought to see, when it has once for all blinded the soul. Did He not teach men to be meek? Did He not bid them when smitten on the right cheek to turn the other also? Did He not bid them when injured to bear it? To show greater readi  ness to endure evil, than others have to inflict it? Are these, tell me, the signs of one establishing a tyranny, and not rather of one pulling a tyranny down?

4. But, as I said, a dreadful thing is malice, and full of hypocrisy; this has filled the world with ten thousand evils; through this malady the law courts are filled, from this comes the desire of fame and wealth, from this the love of rule, and insolence,  through this the roads have wicked robbers and the sea pirates,  from this proceed the murders through the world, through this our race is rent asunder, and whatever evil you may see, you will perceive to arise from this. This has even burst into  the churches, this has caused ten thousand dreadful things from the beginning, this is the mother of avarice, this malady has turned all things upside down, and corrupted justice. For gifts, It says, blind the eyes of the wise, and as a muzzle on the mouth turn away reproofs. Sirach 20:29, Septuagint. and marg. of E.V. This makes slaves of freemen, concerning this we talk every day, and no good comes of it, we become worse than wild beasts; we plunder orphans, strip widows, do wrong to the poor, join woe to woe. Alas! That the righteous has perished from the earth! Micah 7:1-2 It is our part too henceforth to mourn, or rather we have need to say this every day. We profit nothing by our prayers, nothing by our advice and exhortation, it remains therefore that we weep. Thus did Christ; after having many times exhorted those in Jerusalem, when they profited nothing, He wept at their hardness.  This also do the Prophets, and this let us do now. Henceforth is the season for mourning and tears and wailing; it is seasonable for us also to say now, Call for the mourning women, and send for the cunning women, that they may cry aloud Jeremiah 9:17; perhaps thus we shall be able to cast out the malady of those who build splendid houses, of those who surround themselves with lands gotten by rapine. It is seasonable to mourn; but do ye take part with me in the mourning, you who have been stripped and injured, by your mournings bring down my tears. But while mourning we will mourn, not for ourselves but for them; they have not injured you, but they have destroyed themselves; for you have the Kingdom of heaven in return for the injustice done you, they hell in return for their gain. On this account it is better to be injured than to injure. Let us bewail them with a lamentation not of man's making,  but that from the Holy Scriptures with which the Prophets also wailed. With Isaiah let us wail bitterly, and say, Woe, they that add house to house, that lay field to field, that they may take somewhat from their neighbor; will you dwell alone upon the earth? Great houses and fair, and there shall be no inhabitants in them. Isaiah 5:8-9

Let us mourn with Nahum, and say with him, Woe to him that builds his house on high. Perhaps Jeremiah 22:13 Or rather let us mourn for them as Christ mourned for those of old. Woe to you that are rich, for you have received your consolation. Luke 6:24 Let us, I beseech you, not cease thus lamenting, and if it be not unseemly, let us even beat our breasts for the carelessness of our brethren. Let us not weep for him who is already dead, but let us weep for the rapacious man, the grasping, the covetous, the insatiable. Why should we mourn for the dead, in whose case it is impossible henceforth to effect anything? Let us mourn for these who are capable even of change. But while we are lamenting, perhaps they will laugh. Even this is a worthy cause for lamentation, that they laugh when they ought to mourn. For had they been at all affected by our sorrows, it would have behooved us to cease from sorrowing on account of their promise of amendment; but since they are of an insensible disposition, let us continue to weep, not merely for the rich, but for the lovers of money, the greedy, the rapacious. Wealth is not an evil thing, (for we may use it rightly when we spend it upon those who have need,) but greediness is an evil, and it prepares  deathless punishments. Let us then bewail them; perhaps there will be some amendment; or even if they who have fallen in do not escape, others at least will not fall into the danger, but will guard against it. May it come to pass that both they may be freed from their malady, and that none of us may ever fall into it, that we all may in common obtain the promised goods, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

But what is it that these leaders are planning to do? They want to stir up the people, as though they themselves would be in danger on suspicion of establishing a kingdom. “For if,” says one of them, “the Romans learn that this man is leading the multitudes, they will suspect us and will come and destroy our city.” Tell me, where did he teach revolt? Did he not permit you to give tribute to Caesar? Didn’t you want to make him a king and instead he fled from you? Didn’t he lead a normal and unpretentious life, homeless and having no possessions of his own? Therefore they said this, not from any such expectation but out of malice. And yet things happened contrary to their expectations, so much so that the Romans took their nation and city when they had killed Christ. For everything he did was beyond all suspicion.
