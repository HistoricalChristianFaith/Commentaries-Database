That it belongs to God alone to know people’s secrets, hear what the prophet says: “You alone know the heart,” and again, “God examines the heart and the seat of emotions,” and Jeremiah, too, says, “The heart is inscrutable above all things, and he is man, and who shall know him?” and, “People shall look on the face but God on the heart.” - "Homilies on the Gospel of Matthew 29.2"
