Do you see that Nazareth was where He was discoursing? Are not his brethren, it is said, such a one, and such a one? And what of this? Why, by this especially you ought to have been led on to faith. But envy you see is a poor base thing, and often falls foul of itself. For what things were strange and marvellous, and enough to have gained them over, these offended them.
