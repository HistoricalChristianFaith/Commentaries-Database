He who will not seek in the well-being of his neighbor his own benefit will not attain to the crown for this reason: God himself has so decided that human beings should be mutually bound together. When one awakens a sleeping child and asks him to follow his brother, left to himself he is often unwilling. If, however, we place in his brother’s hand an object the child desires, he will pursue his brother to obtain what he desires. It is the same case here. God has placed our benefit in the hand of our neighbor so that we will pursue one another and not be torn apart.If you wish, apply this illustration to the one who addresses you today. For my benefit depends on you, as yours does on me. Thus, on the one hand, it is to your profit to be taught the things that please God, for these things have been entrusted to me that you might receive them from me and therefore might be compelled to run to me. On the other hand, it is to my benefit that you should be made better: for the reward which I shall receive for this will be great. This again, however, lies in you; and therefore am I compelled to follow after you that you may improve and that I may profit from your improvement. And so also Paul says, “For what is my hope? Are not you that?” And again, “My hope and my joy, and the crown of my rejoicing.”
