God heard their prayer and manifested this by shaking the place. For “when they had prayed,” it is said, “the place was shaken.” Why did this happen? Listen to the words of the prophet: “He looks on the earth and it trembles.” For by this he revealed that he is present to their prayers. And again, another prophet says, “The earth was shaken and trembled at the presence of the Lord.” And God did this both to make it more fearsome and to lead them to courage. After those threatening conditions, they gained increased boldness. Since it was the beginning of their ministry and they had prayed for a sensible sign for their persuasion (this never happens again afterwards), great was the encouragement they received. In fact, they had no means of proving that he was risen except by miraculous signs. Thus it was not only their own assurance that they sought but also that they might not be put to shame, that they might speak with boldness. “The place was shaken,” and that made them all the more unshaken.

“And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken.” This was the proof that they were heard and of his visitation. “And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit.” What is “they were filled”? It means that they were inflamed and the Gift burned within them. “And they spoke the word of God with boldness. And the company of those who believed were of one heart and soul.” Do you see that together with the grace of God they also contributed their part? For it must be observed that everywhere together with the grace of God they also do their part. Just as Peter said above, “I have no silver and gold,” and again, “they were all together,” here, having mentioned that they were heard, Luke proceeds to speak also of their virtue. As he is about to embark on the narrative of Sapphira and Ananias, with a view to showing the detestable conduct of that pair he first discusses the noble behavior of the rest. Now tell me, did their love beget their poverty, or the poverty the love? In my opinion, the love begot the poverty, and then the poverty drew tight the cords of love. For notice what he says, they were all “of one heart and soul.” Look, heart and soul the same.
