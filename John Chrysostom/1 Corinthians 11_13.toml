"Judge ye in yourselves: is it seemly that a woman pray unto God veiled?" Again he places them as judges of the things said, which also he did respecting the idol-sacrifices. For as there he says, "judge ye what I say:" [c. 1 Corinthians 10:15] so here, "judge in yourselves:" and he hints something more awful here. For he says that the affront here passes on unto God: although thus indeed he does not express himself, but in something of a milder and more enigmatical form of speech: "is it seemly that a woman pray unto God unveiled?"

Paul has a habit of referring to ordinary everyday things in order to shame his hearers. After all, if even barbarians know these things, what is wrong with them? Can they not see the obvious?
