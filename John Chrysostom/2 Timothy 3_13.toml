Ver. 13. "But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse, deceiving, and being deceived."

Let none of these things, he says, disturb you, if they are in prosperity, and thou in trials. Such is the nature of the case. From my own instance you may learn that it is impossible for man, in his warfare with the wicked, not to be exposed to tribulation. One cannot be in combat and live luxuriously, one cannot be wrestling and feasting. Let none therefore of those who are contending seek for ease or joyous living. Again, the present state is contest, warfare, tribulation, straits, and trials, and the very scene of conflicts. The season for rest is not now, this is the time for toil and labor. No one who has just stripped and anointed himself thinks of ease. If you think of ease, why did you strip, or prepare to fight? "But do I not maintain the fight?" you say. What, when you do not conquer your desires, nor resist the evil bias of nature?

Do not allow yourself to be distressed, he says, if some people prosper, while you are in the midst of suffering. Such is the nature of the case.
