You have received as your patrimony the desire never to allow the teachings of our faith to degenerate into heresy. What makes this clear? In the time of your ancestors, people came here from Judea who were muddying the clear waters of the doctrine taught by the apostles. They were exhorting your ancestors to practice circumcision and to observe the Mosaic law. Those who then lived in your city did not remain silent, nor did they put up with this innovation. They were like courageous hounds who saw wolves attacking and destroying the entire flock. They sprang after the wolves and did not let up chasing them and driving them away. They saw to it that the apostles from every corner of the world sent them their decision in the form of a letter that would protect them from any attack launched against the faithful by those innovators and all such as might come thereafter.

And mark with what forbearance of all harsh vituperation of those brethren they indite their epistle. "Forasmuch as we have heard, that certain which went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, Ye must be circumcised, and keep the Law: to whom we gave no such commandment." Sufficient was this charge against the temerity of those men, and worthy of the Apostles' moderation, that they said nothing beyond this. And observe, they do not put it, That certain from us ordered you to keep the Law, but, "Troubled you with words, subverting your souls" - nothing could be more proper than that word: none of the other speakers has so spoken of the things done by those men. "The souls," he says, already strongly established, these persons are taking down again as in speaking of a building, displacing them from the foundation. "To whom," he says, "we gave no such commandment."
