Thus also Paul persecuted Him, in persecuting them that are His; wherefore too He said. "Why persecutest thou me?" Thus therefore let us feel, as bestowing on Christ Himself when we bestow. For indeed His words are more sure than our sight. When therefore thou seest a poor man, remember His words, by which He declared, that it is He Himself who is fed. For though that which appears be not Christ, yet in this man's form Christ Himself receiveth and beggeth.

And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? Fell to the earth: for excess of light is wont to shock, because the eyes have their measure: it is said also that excess of sound makes people deaf and stunned as in a fit. But him it only blinded, and extinguished his passion by fear, so that he should hear what was spoken.

Saul, Saul, saith He, why persecutest thou me? And He tells him nothing: does not say, Believe, nor anything whatever of the kind: but expostulates with him, all but saying, What wrong, great or small, hast thou suffered from Me, that thou doest these things?
