But they did not hear him, keeping their disobedience, even after the miracles: "To whom," he says, "our fathers would not obey:" after the wonders done in those forty years. And not only so, but just the contrary: "but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt."

Then follows the charge, in the first instance, against the patriarchs [after], the "signs and wonders," after the receiving of the "lively oracles: To whom," he says, "our fathers would not obey." But concerning those, Ezekiel says that they are not "living;" as when he says, "And I gave you statutes that are not good." It is with reference to those that he says, "Living. But thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt"-the place where they groaned, where they cried, whence they called upon God.
