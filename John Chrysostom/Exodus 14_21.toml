Now the Jews also had crossed the Red Sea, under the leadership of Moses, but there is a great difference here. Moses accomplished everything by praying and in the manner of a servant, whereas Christ acted altogether by his own power. And in the episode of the Red Sea the water gave way by means of the wind which then was blowing, so as to make a passage on dry land, while in this episode a greater wonder took place. Though the sea kept its own nature, even so it carried the Lord on its surface, to bear out that scriptural testimony to one “who walks upon the seas as on a pavement.”
