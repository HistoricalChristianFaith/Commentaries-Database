"And Moses verily was faithful in all His house, as a servant, for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken." See also another point of superiority, that which is derived from the Son and the servants. You see again that by the appellation of The Son, he intimates true relationship.

"For a testimony of those things which shall be spoken." What meanest thou? Doth God receive the witness of man? Yes, certainly. For if He call to witness heaven and earth and hills (saying by the prophet, "Hear, O heaven, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken" - and "Hear ye ravines, foundations of the earth, for the Lord hath a controversy with His people"), much more men; that is, that they may be witnesses, when themselves the Jews are shameless.
