The Promise then, he says, the fathers received; you, the reality. (j) And observe, he nowhere mentions right deeds of theirs, but (only) benefits on God's part: He chose: Exalted: Suffered their manners: these are no matters of praise to them: They asked, He gave. But David he does praise (and him) only, because from him the Christ was to come. I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, which shall fulfil all My will.

And when he had removed him, He raised up unto them David to be their king: to whom also He gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after My own heart, which shall fulfil all My will. Of this man's seed has God according to His promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus.
