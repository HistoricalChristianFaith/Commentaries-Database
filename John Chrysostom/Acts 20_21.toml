And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the Church. And when they had come to him, he said unto them, You know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons, serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews: and how I kept back nothing that was profitable unto you, but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.

See him, hasting to sail by, and yet not overlooking them, but taking order for all. Having sent for the rulers, through those he discourses to them (the Ephesians): but it is worthy of admiration, how finding himself under a necessity of saying certain great things about himself, he tries to make the least he can of it (πειρἅτα μετριάζειν). You know. For just as Samuel, when about to deliver up the government to Saul says in their presence, Have I taken anything of your hands? You are witnesses, and God also 1 Samuel 12:3-5; (so Paul here). David also, when disbelieved, says, I was with the flock keeping my father's sheep: and when the bear came, I scared her away with my hands 1 Samuel 17:34-35: and Paul himself too says to the Corinthians, I have become a fool; you have compelled me. 2 Corinthians 12:11 Nay, God Himself also does the same, not speaking of himself upon any and every occasion, but only when He is disbelieved, then He brings up His benefits. Accordingly, see what Paul does here: first he adduces their own testimony: that you may not imagine his words to be mere boasting, he calls the hearers themselves as witnesses of the things he says, since he was not likely to speak lies in their presence. This is the excellence of a teacher, to have for witnesses of his merits those who are his disciples. And what is wonderful, Not for one day nor for two, says he, have I continued doing this. He wishes to cheer them for the future, that they may bravely bear all things, both the parting from him, and the trials about to take place— just as it was in the case of Moses and Joshua. And see how he begins: How I have been with you the whole time, serving the Lord with all humility of mind. Observe, what most becomes rulers: hating pride Exodus 18:21, Septuagint, says (Moses): which (qualification) is especially in point for rulers, because to them there is (almost) a necessity of becoming arrogant. This (humility) is the groundwork of all that is good, as in fact Christ says, Blessed are the poor in spirit. Matthew 5:3 And (here) not simply, with humility of mind, but, with all humility. For there are many kinds of humility, in word and in action, towards rulers, and toward the ruled. Will you that I mention to you some kinds of humility? There are some who are lowly towards those who are lowly, and high towards the high: this is not the character of humility. Some then are such. Then, that he may not seem to be arrogant, he lays a foundation beforehand, removing that suspicion: For, if, says he, I have acted 'with all humility of mind,' it is not from arrogance that I say the things I say. Then for his gentleness, ever with much condescension making them his fellows. With you, he says, have I been, serving the Lord; he makes the good works common to them with himself: none of it his own peculiar. What? (you will say) why, against God could he possibly bear himself arrogantly? And yet there are many who do bear themselves arrogantly against God: but this man not even against his own disciples. This is the merit of a teacher, by his own achievements of virtue to form the character of his disciples. Then for his fortitude, upon which also he is very concise. With many tears, he says, and temptations which befell me by the lying in wait of the Jews. Do you see that he grieves at their doings? But here too he seems to show how sympathizing he was: for he suffered for those who were going to perdition, for the doers themselves: what was done to himself, he even rejoiced at it; for he belonged to that band which rejoiced that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for that Name Acts 5:41: and again he says, Now I rejoice in my sufferings for you Colossians 1:24: and again, For our light affliction, which is but for the moment, works for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. 2 Corinthians 4:17. These things, however, he says, by way of making the least of his merits (μετριάζων). But there he show his fortitude, not so much of daring, as of enduring: I, says he, have been evil entreated, but it was with you: and what is indeed the grievous part of the business, at the hands of Jews. Observe, he puts here both love and fortitude. Mark, here, I pray you, a character of teaching: I kept back nothing, he says, ungrudging fullness, unshrinking promptness— of what was profitable unto you: because there were things which they did not need to learn. For as the hiding some things would have been like grudging, so the saying all things would be folly. This is why he adds, that was profitable unto you. But have showed you, and have taught you: have not only said, but also taught: not doing this either as a mere matter of form. For that this is what he means, observe what he says: publicly, and from house to house: thereby representing the exceeding toil, the great earnestness and endurance. Both Jews, and Greeks. Not (addressing myself) to you alone. Testifying: here, the boldness of speech: and that, even though we do no good, yet we must speak: for this is the meaning of testifying, when we speak to those who do not pay attention: and so the word διαμαρτύρασθαι is for the most part used. I call heaven and earth to witness Deuteronomy 4:26, διαμαρτύρομαι, Moses says: and now Paul himself, Διαμαρτυρόμενος both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God. What do you testify? That they should be careful about their manner of life: that they should repent, and draw near to God. Both to Jews and Greeks— for neither did the Jews know Him— both by reason of their works, he says, repentance towards God, and, by reason that they knew not the Son, he adds, and faith in the Lord Jesus. To what end, then, do you say these things? To what end do you put them in mind of them? What has come of it? Have you anything to lay to their charge? Having first alarmed their feeling, then he adds, And now, behold, I go bound in the Spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there: save that the Holy Ghost witnesses in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me. But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of the grace of God.
