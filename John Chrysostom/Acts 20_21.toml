"Both Jews, and Greeks." Not (addressing myself) to you alone. "Testifying:" here, the boldness of speech: and that, even though we do no good, yet we must speak: for this is the meaning of "testifying," when we speak to those who do not pay attention: and so the word diamarturasthai is for the most part used. "I call heaven and earth to witness" (Deut. iv. 26), diamarturomai, Moses, says: and now Paul himself, Diamarturomenoj "both to Jews and Greeks repentance toward God." What testifiest thou? That they should be careful about their manner of life: that they should repent, and draw near to God. "Both to Jews and Greeks"-for neither did the Jews know Him-both by reason of their works, he says, "repentance towards God," and, by reason that they knew not the Son, he adds, "and faith in the Lord Jesus."
