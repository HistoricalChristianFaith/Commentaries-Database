And having brought them into the house, He puts to them a further question. For in many cases He made a point of healing on entreaty, lest any should suppose Him to be rushing upon these miracles through vainglory: and not on this account alone, but to indicate also that they deserve healing, and that no one should say, If it was of mere mercy that He saved, all men ought to be saved. For even His love to man has a kind of proportion; depending on the faith of them that are healed. But not for these causes only does He require faith of them, but forasmuch as they called Him Son of David, He to lead them up to what is higher, and to teach them to entertain the imaginations they ought of Himself, says, Believe ye that I am able to do this? He did not say, Believe ye that I am able to entreat my Father, that I am able to pray but, that I am able to do this?

What then is their word? Yea, Lord. They call Him no more Son of David, but soar higher, and acknowledge His dominion.
