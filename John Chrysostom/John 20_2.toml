Do you see how she did not yet know anything clearly concerning the resurrection? Instead, she thought the body had been removed, which is what she simply tells to the disciples. And the Evangelist has not deprived the woman of such praise, nor did he think it shameful that they should have learned these things first from her who had passed the night in watching. This shows how his love of the truth is on display everywhere.
