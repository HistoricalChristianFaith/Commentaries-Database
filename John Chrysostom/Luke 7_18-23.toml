John therefore, being cast into prison, takes the opportunity, when his disciples were most in need of Jesus, to send them to Christ. For it follows, And John calling two of his disciples sent them to Jesus, saying, Art thou he that should come, &c.

Christ would work miracles and teach as soon as he came to well-known sections of his own country, and this had been foretold.Isaiah went on to tell of other marvels and showed how Christ cured the lame, and how he made the blind to see and the mute to speak. “Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of the deaf unstopped.” After that he spoke of the other marvels: “Then shall the lame man leap like a hart, and the tongue of the dumb sing for joy.” This did not happen until his coming.
