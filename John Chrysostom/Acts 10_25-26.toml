"And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped him." This, both to teach the others, and by way of giving thanks to God, and showing his own humility: thereby making it plain, that though he had been commanded, yet in himself he had great piety. What then did Peter? "But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man." Do you mark how, before all else the Apostles teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them?

Mark how on every side it is shown how worthy he is! So the Eunuch there desired Philip to come up and sit in the chariot, although not knowing who he was, upon no other introduction than that given by the Prophet. But here Cornelius fell at his feet. "Stand up, I myself also am a man." Observe how free from adulation his speech is on all occasions, and how full of humility.
