But we must ask how it could be that he demanded faith of none of those he healed. For he did not here say what we later find him saying, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” He had not yet given proof of his power. The very act of approaching him and of bringing others to him exhibited no small faith. For they brought them even long distances. They would never have brought them unless they had persuaded themselves of great things concerning him.

If we have any bodily ailment, we contrive everything possible to be rid of what pains us. Yet when our soul is ailing, we delay and draw back. For this reason we are not delivered from bodily ailments. The indispensible corrective has become for us secondary, while the dispensible secondary matters seem indispensable. While we leave unattended the fountain of our ills, we still hope to have the streams unpolluted.
