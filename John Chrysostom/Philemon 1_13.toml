Ver. 13. "Whom I would have retained with me, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me in the bonds of the Gospel."

Do you see after how much previous preparation, he has at length brought him honorably before his master, and observe with how much wisdom he has done this. See for how much he makes him answerable, and how much he honors the other. You have found, he says, a way by which you may through him repay your service to me. Here he shows that he has considered his advantage more than that of his slave, and that he respects him exceedingly.

Be careful to observe how much groundwork is necessary before Paul honorably brought Onesimus before his master. Observe how wisely he has done this. See for how much he makes Philemon answerable and how much he honors Onesimus. You have found, he says, a way by which you may through Onesimus repay your service to me. Here Paul shows that he has considered Philemonâ€™s advantage more than that of his slave and that he deeply respects him.
