5. For, he says, both He that sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren. Behold again how he brings [them] together, honoring and comforting them, and making them brethren of Christ, in this respect that they are of one. Then again guarding himself and showing that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh, he introduces, For He who sanctifies, [i.e.] Christ, and they who are sanctified, ourselves. Do you see how great is the difference? He sanctifies, we are sanctified. And above he said, the Captain of their salvation. For there is one God, of whom are all things. 1 Corinthians 8:6
