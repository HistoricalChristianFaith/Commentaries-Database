Where is it that the Scriptures have spoken of sin and its causes? It accuses the people who lived before the flood for their illegitimate unions. Hear how it cites the cause: “The sons of God, having seen how the daughters of men were fair, took them as wives.” And so? Beauty was the cause of sin? It could never be so. In fact, beauty is the work of the wisdom of God. And a work of God could never become the cause of wickedness. Was it, then, a sin for having seen them? No, for this is also nature’s work. What is it then? Having seen them with evil intentions—that, indeed, is very much the result of a corrupt will. Therefore also a wise man provided this exhortation: “Do not gaze on the beauty of others.” He did not say, “Do not look,” because it so happens that this occurs spontaneously; rather, he says, “Do not gaze on,” excluding the intentional consideration, the importunate gaze, the prolonged contemplations that derive from a corrupt soul and are prey to desire. But what damage, if one objects, could derive from this? “Following this,” it is said, “love lights up like fire.” Like fire, indeed, after it has reached hay or straw does not waste time but simultaneously sticks to wood and ignites a splendid flame, so also the fire of desire that is within us, after it becomes glued to a beautiful and splendid image through the instrumentality of the eyes, immediately burns the souls of the one who watches.
