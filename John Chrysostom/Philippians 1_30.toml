Do you see the praises of the men of that time? But we endure not so much as buffetings or blows, neither insult nor loss of our possessions: they were straightway zealous, and all of them strove as martyrs, while we have grown cold in love toward Christ. Again I am constrained to accuse things present; and what shall I do? It is against my will, yet am I constrained. Were I able by my silence of things which are done, by holding my peace, and not mentioning anything, to remove them, it would behoove me to be silent. But if the contrary comes to pass; if not only are these things not removed by our silence, but even become worse, we are forced to speak. For he who rebukes sinners, if he does nought else, suffers them not to go farther. For there is no such shameless and rash soul, as not to turn, and remit the extravagance of its evil deeds, on hearing any one continually rebuking it. There is, there is indeed, even in the shameless, a small portion of shame. For God has sown in our nature the seeds of shame; for since fear was insufficient to bring us to a right tone, He has also prepared many other ways for avoiding sin. For example, that a man should be accused, fear of the enacted laws,  love of reputation, the desire of forming friendships; for all these are paths to avoid sin. Ofttimes that which was not done for God's sake, was done through shame; that which was not done for God's sake, was done for fear of men. That which we seek for is, in the first place not to sin, and we shall afterwards succeed in doing this for God's sake. Else why did Paul exhort those, who were about to overcome  their enemies, not by the fear of God, but on the score of waiting for the vengeance?  "For by so doing," he says, "you shall heap coals of fire upon his head." [Romans 12:20] For this is his first wish, that our virtue should be established. As I said then, there is in us a sense of shame. We have many good natural affections, which lead to virtue; as, for example, all of us men are naturally moved to pity, and no other good thing so inheres in our nature, but this alone. Whence any one might reasonably enquire, wherefore these seeds have above all others been sown in our nature, by which we melt  at tears, by which we are turned to compassion, and are ready to pity. No one is naturally idle,  no one is naturally regardless of his reputation, no one is naturally above emulation, but pity lies deep in every one's nature, however fierce and ungentle he be. And what wonder? We pity beasts, such a superabundance of pity lies deep in us. If we see a lion's cub, we are somewhat affected; much more in the case of one of our race. See, how many maimed are there! And this is sufficient to lead us to pity. Nothing so much pleases God as mercy.  Wherefore with this the priests were anointed, and the kings, and the prophets, for they had, in oil, a type of God's love to man; and they further learned, that rulers should have a greater share of mercy.  It showed that the Spirit is to come to men through mercy, since God pities and is kind to man. For, "You have mercy upon all," it is written, "for You can do all things." [Wisdom 11:23] For this cause they were anointed with oil: and indeed it was from mercy He appointed the priesthood. And kings were anointed with oil; and would one praise a ruler, he can make mention of nothing so becoming him as mercy. For pity is peculiar to power. Consider that the world was established by pity,  and then imitate your Lord. "The mercy of man is toward his neighbor, but the mercy of the Lord is upon all flesh." [Sirach 18:13] How "upon all flesh"? Whether you mean sinners, or just men, we all need the mercy of God; we all enjoy it, be it Paul, be it Peter, or be it John. And listen to their own words; there is no need of mine. For what says this blessed one? "But I obtained mercy, because I did it ignorantly." [1 Timothy 1:13] What then, was there afterwards no need of mercy? Hear what he says; "But I labored more abundantly than they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me." [1 Corinthians 15:10] And of Epaphroditus he says, "For indeed he was sick, near unto death; but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow." [Philippians 2:27] And again he says, "We were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, insomuch that we despaired even of life. Yea, we ourselves have had the answer of death within ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God, who delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver." [2 Corinthians 1:8-10] And again, "And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion; and the Lord will deliver me." [2 Timothy 4:17-18] And everywhere we shall find him glorying in this, that by mercy he was saved. Peter, too, became so great, because mercy was shown him. For hear Christ saying to him, "Satan has desired to sift you as wheat; and I made supplication for you, that your faith fail not." [Luke 22:31-32] John, too, became so great through mercy, and in short all of them. For listen to Christ when He says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you." [John 15:16] For we all have need of the mercy of God, as it is written, "The mercy of God is upon all flesh."  But if these men needed the mercy of God, what should one say of the rest? For why, tell me, does He "make the sun to rise on the evil and the good"? Did He withhold the rain for one year, would He not destroy all? And what if He caused overwhelming rain? What if He rained down fire? What if He sent flies? But what do I say? If He were so to do  as He once did, would not all perish? If He were to shake the earth, would not all perish? It is now seasonable to say, "What is man, that You are mindful of him?" [Psalm 8:4] Were He only to threaten the earth, all men would become one tomb. "As a drop of water from the bucket," it is written, "so are the nations in His sight, they shall be counted as very small dust, as the turning of the balance." [Isaiah 40:15] It were as easy for Him to destroy all things, and to make them again, as for us to turn the balance. He then who has such power over us, and sees us sinning every day, and yet punishes us not, how is it but by mercy He bears with us? Since beasts too exist by mercy: "You, Lord, will preserve both men and beasts." [Psalm 36:7] He looked upon the earth, and filled it with living things. And wherefore? For your sake! And wherefore did He make you? Through His goodness.

There is nothing better than oil. It is the cause of light, and there also it is the cause of light.  "Then shall your light break forth as the morning" [Isaiah 58:8], says the Prophet, if you show pity upon your neighbour. And as natural oil contains light, so then does mercy [alms] grant us a great, a marvelous light. Much mention does Paul, too, make of this mercy. In one place, hear him say, "Only that we should remember the poor." [Galatians 2:10] And in another, "If it be meet for me to go also." [1 Corinthians 16:4] And in every place, turn where you will, you see him anxious about this very thing. And again, "And let our people also learn to maintain good works." [Titus 3:14] And again, "These things are good and profitable unto men." [Titus 3:8] Listen to a certain other one who says, "Alms  do deliver from death" [Tobit 12:9]; If You take away pity, "Lord, Lord, who shall stand" [Psalm 130:3]; and it is said, If You enter "into judgment with your servant" [Psalm 143:2]; "A great thing is man"; why? "and an honorable thing is a merciful man." [Proverbs 20:6, Septuagint] For this is the true character of man, to be merciful, yea rather the character of God, to show mercy. Do you see, how strong is the mercy of God? This made all things, this formed the world, this made the angels, it was through mere goodness. For this cause, too, He threatened hell, that we may attain unto the kingdom, and through mercy we do attain unto the kingdom. For wherefore did God, being alone, create so many beings? Was it not through goodness? Was it not through love to men? If you ask why such and such things are, you will always find your answer in Goodness. Let us show mercy to our neighbors, that mercy may be shown to us. These acts of mercy  we show not so much to them, as lay up for ourselves against That Day. When the flame of the fire is great, this oil (mercy) is that which quenches the fire, and this brings light to us. Thus by this means shall we be freed from the fire of hell. For whence will He be compassionate and show mercy? Mercy comes of love! Nothing incenses God so much as to be pitiless. "A man was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents, and he was moved with compassion, and forgave him. And there were owing to that man from his fellow-servant a hundred pence, and he caught him by the throat. Therefore the Lord delivered him to the tormentors, till he should pay what was due." Let us on hearing this be merciful to those who are our debtors in money or in sins. Let no one remember evils, if at least he does not wish to injure himself; for he does not so much aggrieve the other (as he injures himself). For he  either will follow him with vengeance, or he has not done so; but dost you yourself, while not forgiving your neighbor his sins, seek for a kingdom? Lest this should happen to us, let us forgive all, (for it is ourselves that we pardon,) that God may forgive us our sins, and so we may obtain the good things which are in store, through the grace and lovingkindness, etc.

Again he encourages them. He shows them that they are engaged in the very same struggle that Paul himself is engaged in. Everywhere they undergo the same struggles and contests. They are united with him in bearing these tribulations with him. “These are trials that you not only have heard about but,” he says, “are also seeing.” .

Having the same conflict which you saw in me; i.e. you have also an example. Here again he raises them up, by showing them that everywhere their conflicts were the same with his, their struggles were the same with his, both severally, and in that they united with him in bearing trials. He said not, you have heard, but ye saw, for he strove too at Philippi. Truly this is an exceeding virtue. Wherefore writing to the Galatians, also he said, Did ye suffer so many things in vain, if it be indeed in vain. Galatians 3:4 And again, writing to the Hebrews, he said, But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after you were enlightened, you endured a great conflict of suffering; partly, being made a gazing-stock both by reproaches and afflictions. Hebrews 10:32-33 And writing again to Macedonians, that is, to the Thessalonians, he said, For they themselves report concerning us, what manner of entering in we had unto you. 1 Thessalonians 1:9 And again, For yourselves, brethren, know our entering in unto you, that it has not been found vain. 1 Thessalonians 2:1 And in like sort does he witness the same things of them all, labors and strivings. But such things ye will not now find among us; now it is much if one suffer a little in goods alone. And in respect of their goods also he witnesses great things of them. For to some he says, For you took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions Hebrews 10:34; and to others, For it has been the good pleasure of Macedonia and Achaia to make a certain contribution for the poor Romans 15:26; and your zeal has stirred up very many of them. 2 Corinthians 9:2
