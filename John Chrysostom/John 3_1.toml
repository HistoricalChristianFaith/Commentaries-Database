This man appears also in the middle of the Gospel, making defense for Christ; for he says, Our law judges no man  before it hear him John 7:51; and the Jews in anger replied to him, Search and look, for out of Galilee arises no prophet. Again after the crucifixion he bestowed great care upon the burial of the Lord's body: There came also, says the Evangelist, Nicodemus, which came to the Lord  by night, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pound weight. John 19:39 And even now he was disposed towards Christ,  but not as he ought, nor with proper sentiments respecting Him, for he was as yet entangled in Jewish infirmity. Wherefore he came by night, because he feared to do so by day. Yet not for this did the merciful God reject or rebuke him, or deprive him of His instruction, but even with much kindness conversed with him and disclosed to him very exalted doctrines, enigmatically indeed, but nevertheless He disclosed them. For far more deserving of pardon was he than those who acted thus through wickedness. They are entirely without excuse; but he, though he was liable to condemnation, yet was not so to an equal degree. How then does the Evangelist say nothing of the kind concerning him? He has said in another place, that of the rulers also many believed on Him, but because of the Jews  they did not confess (Him), lest they should be put out of the synagogue John 12:42; but here he has implied the whole by mentioning his coming by night. What then says Nicodemus?

Rabbi, we know that You are a Teacher come from God: for no man can do the miracles that You do, except God be with him.

2. Nicodemus yet lingers  below, has yet human thoughts concerning Him, and speaks of Him as of a Prophet, imagining nothing great from His miracles. We know, he says, that You are a Teacher come from God. Why then do you come by night and secretly, to Him that speaks the things of God, to Him who comes from God? Why do you not converse with Him openly? But Jesus said nothing like this to him, nor did He rebuke him; for, says the Prophet, A bruised reed shall He not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; He shall not strive nor cry Isaiah 42:2-3; as quoted Matthew 12:19-20: and again He says Himself, I came not to condemn the world, but to save the world. John 12:47

No man can do these miracles, except God be with him.

Still here Nicodemus speaks like the heretics, in saying, that He has a power working within Him,  and has need of the aid of others to do as He did. What then says Christ? Observe His exceeding condescension. He refrained for a while from saying, I need not the help of others, but do all things with power, for I am the Very Son of God, and have the same power as My Father, because this would have been too hard for His hearer; for I say now what I am always saying, that what Christ desired was, not so much for a while to reveal His own Dignity, as to persuade men that He did nothing contrary to His Father. And therefore in many places he appears in words confined by limits,  but in His actions He does not so. For when He works a miracle, He does all with power, saying, I will, be thou clean. Matthew 8:3 Talitha, arise. Mark 5:41; not verbally quoted Stretch forth your hand. Mark 3:5 Your sins be forgiven you. Matthew 9:2 Peace, be still. Mark 4:39 Take up your bed, and go unto your house. Matthew 9:6 Thou foul spirit, I say unto you, come out of him. Mark 9:25; not verbally quoted Be it unto you even as you will. Matthew 15:28 If any one say (anything) unto you, you shall say, The Lord has need of him. Mark 11:3 This day shall you be with Me in Paradise. Luke 23:43 You have heard that it was said by them of old time, You shall not kill; but I say unto you, that whosoever is angry with his brother without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment. Matthew 5:21-22 Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men. Mark 1:17 And everywhere we observe that His authority is great; for in His actions no one  could find fault with what was done. How was it possible? Had His words not come to pass, nor been accomplished as He commanded, any one might have said that they were the commands of a madman; but since they did come to pass, the reality of their accomplishment stopped men's mouths even against their will. But with regard to His discourses, they might often in their insolence charge Him with madness. Wherefore now in the case of Nicodemus, He utters nothing openly, but by dark sayings leads him up from his low thoughts, teaching him, that He has sufficient power in Himself to show forth miracles; for that His Father begot Him Perfect and All-sufficient, and without any imperfection.

But let us see how He effects this. Nicodemus says, Rabbi, we know that You are a Teacher come from God, for no man can do the miracles that You do, except God be with him. He thought he had said something great when he had spoken thus of Christ. What then says Christ? To show that he had not yet set foot even on the threshold of right knowledge, nor stood in the porch, but was yet wandering somewhere without the palace, both he and whoever else should say the like, and that he had not so much as glanced towards true knowledge when he held such an opinion of the Only-Begotten, what says He?

As yet however he was withheld by Jewish infirmity: and therefore he came in the night, being afraid to come in the day. Of such the Evangelist speaks elsewhere, Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue.
He did not however conceive any great idea of them from His miracles; and attributed to Him as yet only a human character, speaking of Him as a Prophet, sent to execute a commission, and standing in need of assistance to do His work; whereas the Father had begotten Him perfect, self-sufficient, and free from all defect. It being Christâ€™s design however for the present not so much to reveal His dignity, as to prove that He did nothing contrary to the Father; in words He is often humble, while His acts ever testify His power. And therefore to Nicodemus on this occasion He says nothing expressly to magnify Himself; but He imperceptibly corrects his low views of Him, and teaches him that He was Himself all-sufficient, and independent in His miraculous works. Hence He answers, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a man be bornagain, the cannot see the kingdom of God.
He says therefore, Except a man be born again, be cannot see the kingdom of God: as if He said, You are not yet born again, i.e. Of God, by a spiritual begetting; and therefore your knowledge of Me is not spiritual, but carnal and human. But I say to you, that neither you, nor any one, except he be born again of God, shall be able to see the glory which is around me, but shall be out of the kingdom: for itis the begetting by baptism, which enlightens the mind. Or the meaning is, Except you areborn from above, and have received the certainty of my doctrines, you wander out of the way, and are far from the kingdom of heaven. By which words our Lord discloses His nature, showing that He is more than what He appears to the outward eye. The expression, From above, means, according to some, from heaven, according to others, from the beginning. Had the Jews heard it, they would have left Him in scorn; but Nicodemus shows the love of adisciple, by staying to ask more questions.
