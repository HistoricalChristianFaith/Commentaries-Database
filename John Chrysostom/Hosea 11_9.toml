The philanthropy of God does not tolerate [abandonment]. “What can I do for you? Shall I view you as I did Sodom and destroy you like Gomorrah? My heart is upset.” Here the love of God appears to imitate the passionate human being or, better yet, the affectionate mother. “My heart is upset, just as a woman would say about her child. My heart is upset just like the mother’s.” However, the previous metaphor was only partially adequate. “My heart is troubled in my regret”? God is troubled! Let no one ever think it! God forbid!
