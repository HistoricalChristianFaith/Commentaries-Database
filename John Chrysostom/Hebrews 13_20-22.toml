Do you see how he shows that virtue is born neither wholly from God nor yet from ourselves alone? First, by saying, “make you perfect in every good work,” he means you have virtue indeed but need to be made complete. What is “good work and word”? So as to have both life and doctrines right, “according to his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight.”

Therefore, having first asked their prayers, he then himself also prays for all good things on them: “Now may the God of peace,” he says; do not therefore be at variance one with another. “Who brought again from the dead the great shepherd of the sheep.” This is said concerning the resurrection.… Again he confirms to them even to the end, his discourse concerning the resurrection: “by the blood of the eternal covenant, our Lord Jesus Christ.” “Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in you that which is pleasing in his sight.” Again he bears high testimony to them, for that is made “perfect” which, having a beginning, is afterwards completed. And he prays for them, which is the act of one who yearns for them. And, while in the other epistles he prays in the prefaces, here he does it at the end. “Working in you,” he says, “that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.”
