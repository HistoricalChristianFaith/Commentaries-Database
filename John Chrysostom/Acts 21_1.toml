"And they accompanied them," it says, "unto the ship. And it came to pass, that after we had torn ourselves from them" - so much did they love him, such was their affection towards him - "and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Coos, and the day following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara." Methinks Paul also wept. "Having torn ourselves away," he says: he shows the violence of it by saying, "having torn ourselves away from them." And with reason: otherwise they could never have got to sea. What means, "We came with a straight course unto Coos?" Instead of saying, "we did not go round nor make stay in other places." See how he hastes on.
