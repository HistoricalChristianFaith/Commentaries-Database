The more insignificant they were, the brighter the grace working great results by small means. “And he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord, for he was a good man.” I think by “good” here he means a kind, unaffected person, very much eager for the salvation of his neighbors. “For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith.” “With steadfast purpose,” he says. With encomium and praise, for, like rich land, this city received the word and brought forth much fruit.
