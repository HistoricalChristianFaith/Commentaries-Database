When he has spoken anything great and sublime, he quickly retires, giving way to their anger so that the passion may abate and cease through his absence. And thus he acted at that time. But why does the Evangelist mention the place? That you may learn that he went there to remind them of the things that had been done there and said by John, and of his testimony. At least when they came there, they immediately remembered John. Therefore also they said, “John indeed did no miracle,” since how did it follow that they should add this unless the place had brought the Baptist to their memory, and they had come to remember his testimony? And observe how they form incontrovertible syllogisms: “John indeed did no miracle,” “but this man does,” someone says and “so his superiority is shown. If therefore people believed in the one who did no miracles, how much more must they believe this man?” Then, since it was John who bore the witness—in case his having done no miracle might seem to prove him unworthy of being a witness—they added, “Yet if he did no miracle, still everything he said about this man was true.” And so, Christ is no longer proven to be trustworthy by means of John. Instead, John is shown to be trustworthy by what Christ had done.
