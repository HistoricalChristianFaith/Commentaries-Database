Ver. 9. "And let us not be weary in well doing."

And here he points out the difference between ambition of this kind, and in temporal affairs, by saying, "Be not deceived ; God is not mocked; for whatsoever a man sows, that shall he also reap. For he that sows unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that sows unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life." As in the case of seeds, one who sows pulse cannot reap grain, for what is sown and what is reaped must both be of one kind, so is it in actions, he that plants in the flesh, wantonness, drunkenness, or inordinate desire, shall reap the fruits of these things. And what are these fruits? Punishment, retribution, shame, derision, destruction. For of sumptuous tables and viands the end is no other than destruction; for they both perish themselves, and destroy the body too. But the fruit of the Spirit is of a nature not similar but contrary in all respects to these. For consider; have you sown almsgiving? The treasures of heaven and eternal glory await you: have you sown temperance? honor and reward, and the applause of Angels, and a crown from the Judge await you.
