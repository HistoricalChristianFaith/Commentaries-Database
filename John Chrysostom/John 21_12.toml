“They knew that it was the Lord,” and therefore they did not ask him, “Who are you?” But seeing that his form was altered and full of awe, they were greatly amazed and wanted to ask something about it. But fear, and their knowledge that he was not someone else but the same person, checked the inquiry, and they only ate what he created for them by exercising greater power than before. For here he no longer looks to heaven, nor does he perform those human acts he did before, thereby showing that those things that he did previously were done by way of condescension.
