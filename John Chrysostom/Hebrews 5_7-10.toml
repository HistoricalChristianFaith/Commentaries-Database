Do you see that Paul sets forth nothing else than Christ’s care and the exceptional greatness of his love? For what does the expression “with loud cries” mean? The gospel nowhere says this, nor that he wept when praying, nor that he uttered a cry. Do you see that it was condescension?

Let the heretics who deny the flesh be ashamed. What do you mean? The Son of God was “heard for his godly fear”? What more would anyone say of the prophets? And what sort of logical connection is there between “he was heard for his godly fear” and “although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered”? Would anyone say these things of God? Why, who would be so insane? And who, even if he were beside himself, would have said this?

If he, though the Son, gains obedience from his sufferings, how much more shall we? Do you see how many things Paul says about obedience in order to persuade them to obedience?… “Through what he suffered” he continually “learned” to obey God, and he was “made perfect” through sufferings. This, then, is perfection, and by this means we must arrive at perfection. For not only was he himself saved; he also became an abundant supply of salvation to others.
