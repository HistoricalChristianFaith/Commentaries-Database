5. "For," he says, "both He that sanctifies, and they who are sanctified, are all of one, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren." Behold again how he brings [them] together, honoring and comforting them, and making them brethren of Christ, in this respect that they are "of one."  Then again guarding himself and showing that he is speaking of that which is according to the flesh, he introduces, "For He who sanctifies," [i.e.] Christ, "and they who are sanctified," ourselves. Do you see how great is the difference?  He sanctifies, we are sanctified. And above he said, "the Captain of their salvation. For there is one God, of whom are all things."  [1 Corinthians 8:6]

"For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren." Do you see how again he shows the superiority? For by saying, "He is not ashamed," he shows that the whole comes not of the nature of the thing, but of the loving affection of Him who was "not ashamed" of anything, [yea] of His great humility. For though we be "of one," yet He sanctifies and we are sanctified: and great is the difference.  Moreover "He" is of the Father, as a true Son, that is, of His substance; "we," as created, that is, brought out of things that are not, so that the difference is great. Wherefore he says, "He is not ashamed to call them brethren" [Hebrews 2:12], "saying, I will declare Your name unto My brethren." [Psalm 22:22] For when He clothed Himself with flesh, He clothed Himself also with the brotherhood, and at the same time came in the brotherhood.
