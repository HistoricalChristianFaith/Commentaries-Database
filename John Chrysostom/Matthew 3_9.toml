Now some say, that concerning the Gentiles he says these things, calling them stones, metaphorically; but I say, that the expression has also another meaning. But of what kind is this? Think not, says he, that if you should perish, you would make the patriarch childless. This is not, this is not so. For with God it is possible, both out of stones to give him men, and to bring them to that relationship; since at the beginning also it was so done. For it was like the birth of men out of stones, when a child came forth from that hardened womb.

This accordingly the prophet also was intimating, when he said, Look unto the hard rock, whence you are hewn, and to the hole of the pit, whence you are dug: look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you. Isaiah 51:1-2 Now of this prophecy, you see, he reminds them, showing that if at the beginning he made him a father, as marvellously as if he had made him so out of stones, it was possible for this now also to come to pass. And see how he both alarms them, and cuts them off: in that he said not, He had already raised up, lest they should despair of themselves, but that He is able to raise up: and he said not, He is able out of stones to make men, but what was a much greater thing, kinsmen and children of Abraham.

Do you see how for the time he drew them off from their vain imagination about things of the body, and from their refuge in their forefathers; in order that they might rest the hope of their salvation in their own repentance and continence? Do you see how by casting out their carnal relationship, he is bringing in that which is of faith?

4. Mark then how by what follows also he increases their alarm, and adds intensity to their agonizing fear.

For having said that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham, he added, And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees, by all means making his speech alarming. For as he from his way of life had much freedom of speech, so they needed his severe rebuke, having been left barren now for a long time. For why do I say (such are his words) that you are on the point of falling away from your relationship to the patriarch and of seeing others, even those that are of stones, brought in to your pre-eminence? Nay, not to this point only will your penalty reach, but your punishment will proceed further. For now, says he, the axe is laid unto the root of the trees. There is nothing more terrible than this turn of his discourse. For it is no longer a flying sickle, nor the taking down of a hedge, nor the treading under foot of the vineyard; Isaiah 5:5 but an axe exceeding sharp, and what is worse, it is even at the doors. For inasmuch as they continually disbelieved the prophets, and used to say, Where is the day of the Lord: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it, Isaiah 5:19 by reason that it was many years before what they said came to pass; to lead them off from this encouragement also, he sets the terrors close to them. And this he declared by saying now, and by his putting it to the root. For the space between is nothing now, says he, but it is laid to the very root. And he said not, to the branches, nor to the fruits, but to the root. Signifying, that if they were negligent, they would have incurable horrors to endure, and not have so much as a hope of remedy. It being no servant who is now come, as those before Him were, but the very Lord of all, bringing on them His fierce and most effectual vengeance.

Yet, although he has terrified them again, he suffers them not to fall into despair; but as before he said not He has raised up, but He is able to raise up children to Abraham (at once both alarming and comforting them); even so here also he did not say that it has touched the root, but it is laid to the root, and is now hard by it, and shows signs of no delay. However, even though He has brought it so near, He makes its cutting depend upon you. For if you change and become better men, this axe will depart without doing anything; but if you continue in the same ways, He will tear up the tree by the roots. And therefore, observe, it is neither removed from the root, nor applied as it is does it cut at all: the one, that you may not grow supine, the other to let you know that it is possible even in a short time to be changed and saved. Wherefore he does also from all topics heighten their fear, thoroughly awakening and pressing them on to repentance. Thus first their falling away from their forefathers; next, others being introduced instead; lastly, those terrors being at their doors, the certainty of suffering incurable evils (both which he declared by the root and the axe), was sufficient to rouse thoroughly those even that were very supine, and to make them full of anxiety. I may add, that Paul too was setting forth the same, when he said, A short word will the Lord make upon the whole world. Romans 9:28

Although John terrified them with his preaching, he did not permit them to fall into despair. He did not say “God has raised up” but “God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” In this way he simultaneously alarmed and comforted them.
