Do you see that these men so ill spoken of are found most to come to Him? For one said, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth? John 1:46, and another, Search and look, for out of Galilee arises no prophet. John 7:52 These things they said insulting Him, because He was supposed by the many to be of Nazareth, and they also reproached Him with being a Samaritan; You are a Samaritan, said one, and hast a devil. John 8:48 Yet behold, both Samaritans and Galil&aelig;ans believe, to the shame of the Jews, and Samaritans are found better than Galil&aelig;ans, for the first received Him through the words of the woman, the second when they had seen the miracles which He did.
