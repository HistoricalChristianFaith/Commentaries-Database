Do you see that the people who have the worst things spoken about them are the ones found most often coming to him? For one said, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” Another said, “Search and look, for out of Galilee arises no prophet.” They said these things as an insult to him, because many people thought he was from Nazareth. They also reproached him with being a Samaritan; “You are a Samaritan,” said one, “and have a devil.” Yet behold, both Samaritans and Galileans believe, to the shame of the Jews, and Samaritans are found better than Galileans, for the first received him through the words of the woman, the second received him when they had seen the miracles that he did.
