How fitting are the instruments of the priests! They came against him “with swords and clubs.” Judas himself was with them, one of the Twelve. In the interest of fair disclosure the Evangelist still calls him “one of the Twelve,” unashamedly. “Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, ‘The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him.’ ” O with what depravity had the traitor’s soul been inflamed! With what kind of eyes did he then look at his Master? With what mouth did he kiss him? O accursed purpose! What sign did he devise? What did he dare? What sort of clue of betrayal did he give? Whoever I kiss! He was emboldened by his Master’s gentleness. Yet it by itself was sufficient to shame him. The kiss deprived him of all excuse, for he was betraying one incomparably meek.But why does he say [“Seize the one I kiss”?] Often when Jesus had been under attack and possible seizure, he had gone out from the crowd, through the middle of it, without their even knowing it.
