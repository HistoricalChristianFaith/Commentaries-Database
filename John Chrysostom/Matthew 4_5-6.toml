What can the reason be that with each temptation the devil adds, “If you are the Son of God”? He is acting just like he did in the case of Adam, when he disparaged God by saying, “In the day you eat, your eyes will be opened.” So he does in this case, intending thereby to signify that our first parents had been beguiled and outsmarted and had received no benefit. So even in the temptation of Jesus he insinuates the same thing, saying, “In vain God has called you Son and has beguiled you by his gift. For, if this is not so, give us some clear proof that you are from that power.” And, because Christ had reasoned with him from Scripture, he does the same, bringing in the testimony of the prophet.
