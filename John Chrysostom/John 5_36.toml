For had ye been willing to admit faith according to the (natural) consequence of the facts, I would have brought you over by My works more than he by his words. But since you will not, I bring you to John, not as needing his testimony, but because I do all 'that you may be saved.' For I have greater witness than that of John, namely, that from My works; yet I do not merely consider how I may be made acceptable to you by credible evidence, but how by that (of persons) known  to and admired by you. Then glancing at them and saying that they rejoiced for a season in his (John's) light, He declared that their zeal was but temporary and uncertain. 

He called John a torch,  signifying that he had not light of himself, but by the grace of the Spirit; but the circumstance which caused the absolute distinction  between Himself and John, namely, that He was the Sun of righteousness, this He put not yet; but merely hinting as yet at this He touched  them sharply, by showing that from the same disposition which led them to despise John, neither could they believe in Christ. Since it was but for a season that they admired even the man whom they did admire, and who, had they not acted thus, would soon have led them by the hand to Jesus. Having then proved them altogether unworthy of forgiveness, He went on to say, I have greater witness than that of John. What is that? It is that from His works.

For the works, He says, which the Father has given Me to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of Me that the Father sent  Me.

By this He reminded them of the paralytic restored, and of many other things. The words perhaps one of them might have asserted were mere boast, and said by reason of John's friendship towards Him, (though indeed it was not in their power to say even this of John, a man equal to the exact practice of wisdom,  and on this account admired by them,) but the works could not even among the maddest of them admit this suspicion; therefore He added this second testimony, saying, The works which the Father has given Me to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of Me that the Father sent Me.

3. In this place He also meets the accusation respecting the violation of the Sabbath. For since those persons argued, How can he be from God, seeing that he keeps not the Sabbath? John 9:16, therefore He says, Which My Father has given unto Me. Yet in truth, He acted with absolute power, but in order most abundantly to show that He does nothing contrary to the Father, therefore He has put the expression of much inferiority. Since why did He not say, The works which the Father has given Me testify that I am equal to the Father? For both of these truths were to be earned from the works, that He did nothing contrary, and that He was equal to Him who begot Him; a point which He is establishing elsewhere, where He says, If you believe not Me, believe the works: that you may know and believe that I am in the Father and the Father in Me.  John 10:38 In both respects, therefore, the works bore witness to Him, that He was equal to the Father, and that He did nothing contrary to Him. Why then said He not so, instead of leaving out the greater and putting forward this? Because to establish this was His first object. For although  it was a far less thing to have it believed that He came from God, than to have it believed that God was equal with Him, (for that belonged to the Prophets also,  but this never,) still He takes much pains as to the lesser point, as knowing that, this admitted,  the other would afterwards be easily received. So that making no mention of the more important portion of the testimony, He puts  its lesser office, that by this they may receive the other also. Having effected this, He adds,
