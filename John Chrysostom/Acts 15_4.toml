See what a providence is here! And observe they do not come accusing those at Antioch, but "declaring all things that God had done with them." Thus they say nothing of what had happened in the matter of the Jews. But still they brought forward none of these charges: but when they have proved the matter, then the Apostles write in stronger terms.
