He well says, "reckon," because there is no setting that, which he is speaking of, before the eyes as yet. And what are we to reckon? One may ask. That we "are dead unto sin, but alive unto God. In Jesus Christ our Lord." For he that so lives will lay hold of every virtue, as having Jesus Himself for his ally. For that is what, "in Christ," means, for if He raised them when dead, much more when alive will He be able to keep them so.

Paul says: “Consider yourselves” … because complete freedom from sin is not a reality as yet.… We are told to live for God in Jesus Christ our Lord and to lay hold of every virtue, having Jesus as our ally in the struggle.
