He suffers them not however, on the other hand, to wait until the sorrows, but what says He? But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee. For not from Heaven does He appear at once, neither will He depart into any distant country, but in the same nation, in which He had also been crucified, nearly in the same place, so as hereby again to assure them that He that was crucified was the very same that rose again, and in this way to comfort them more abundantly when in sorrow. Therefore also He said in Galilee, that being freed from the fears of the Jews they might believe His saying. For which cause indeed He appeared there.

He does not permit them to become sorrowful but immediately says, “But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.” For he does not immediately appear from heaven on a single occasion and then depart to a distant country. Rather, he promises to come in resurrected form to the same nation in which he had also been crucified, and nearly to the same place. All this was to give complete assurance that he had indeed been crucified and that he indeed rose again, thereby to comfort them more abundantly when in sorrow. Therefore also he specified “to Galilee,” in order that being freed from the fears of the Jews they might believe his saying. This is why he indeed appeared there.
