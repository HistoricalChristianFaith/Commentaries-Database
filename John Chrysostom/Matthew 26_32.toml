He does not permit them to become sorrowful but immediately says, “But after I am risen again, I will go before you into Galilee.” For he does not immediately appear from heaven on a single occasion and then depart to a distant country. Rather, he promises to come in resurrected form to the same nation in which he had also been crucified, and nearly to the same place. All this was to give complete assurance that he had indeed been crucified and that he indeed rose again, thereby to comfort them more abundantly when in sorrow. Therefore also he specified “to Galilee,” in order that being freed from the fears of the Jews they might believe his saying. This is why he indeed appeared there.
