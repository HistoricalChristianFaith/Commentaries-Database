Here again he insists much upon lowliness of mind, the subject he had started this exhortation with. For there was a probability of their being full of high-mindedness, both on account of their city (see p. 343), and from sundry other causes; he therefore keeps drawing off (ὑ ποσύρει], 2 manuscripts ὐ πορύττει) the morbid matter, and lowers the inflammation. For there is nothing that makes such schisms in the Churches as vanity does. And what does he mean by, "Be of the same mind one towards another?" Has a poor man come into your house? Be like him in your bearing, do not put on any unusual pompous air on account of your riches. There is no rich and poor in Christ. Be not then ashamed of him because of his external dress, but receive him because of his inward faith. And if you see him in sorrow, do not disdain to comfort him, nor if you see him in prosperity, feel abashed at sharing his pleasure, and being gladdened with him, but be of the same mind in his case, that you would be of in your own. For it says, "Be of the same mind one towards another." For instance, if you think yourself a great man, therefore think him so likewise. Do you suspect that he is mean and little? Well then, pass this same sentence upon yourself, and cast aside all unevenness. And how is this to be? By your casting aside that reckless temper. Wherefore he proceeds: "Mind not high things, but condescend to men of low estate." That is, bring yourself down to their humble condition, associate with them, walk with them, do not be humbled in mind only, but help them also, and reach forth your hand to them, not by means of others, but in your own person, as a father taking care of a child, as the head taking care of the body. As he says in another place, "being bound with them that are in bonds." [Hebrews 13:3] But here he means by those of low estate not merely the lowly-minded, but those of a low rank, and which one is apt to think scorn of.

"Be not wise in your own conceits." This is, do not think that you can do for yourselves. Because the Scripture says in another place besides, "Woe to them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight." [Isaiah 5:22] And by this again, he secretly draws off recklessness, and reduces conceit and turgidity. For there is nothing that so elates men and makes them feel different from other people, as the notion that they can do by themselves. Whence also God has placed us in need one of another, and though thou be wise you will be in need of another: but if you think that you are not in need of him, you will be the most foolish and feeble of men. For a man of this sort bares himself of all succor, and in whatever error he may run into, will not have the advantage either of correction or of pardon, and will provoke God by his recklessness, and will run into many errors. For it is the case, aye, and often too, that a wise man does not perceive what is needful, and a man of less shrewdness hits upon somewhat that is applicable. And this happened with Moses and his father-in-law, and with Saul and his servant, and with Isaac and Rebecca. Do not then suppose that you are lowered by needing another man. For this exalts you the more, this makes you the stronger, and the brighter too, and the more secure.

Here again Paul insists on humility, which is how he started this whole exhortation. For since there was a probability that the Romans would be high minded because of the greatness of their city and for many other reasons, he keeps drawing off the sickness of pride.… There is nothing so likely to cause schisms in the church as vanity.…If a poor man comes into your house, behave like him and do not put on airs because of your riches. In Christ there is no rich or poor. Do not be ashamed of him because of his outward dress, but receive him because of his inward faith. If you see him in sorrow, do not hesitate to comfort him, and if he is prospering, do not feel shy about sharing in his pleasure.… If you think you are a great person, then think others are also. If you think they are humble and lowly, then think the same of yourself.
