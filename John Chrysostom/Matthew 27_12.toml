This at any rate Pilate then asked. What then said Christ? You say. He confessed that He was a king, but a heavenly king, which elsewhere also He spoke more clearly, replying to Pilate, My kingdom is not of this world; John 18:36 that neither they nor this man should have an excuse for accusing Him of such things. And He gives a reason that cannot be gainsaid, saying, If I were of this world, my servants would fight, that I should not be delivered. For this purpose I say, in order to refute this suspicion, He both paid tribute, Matthew 22:17 and commanded others to pay it, and when they would make Him a king, He fled. John 6:15

Wherefore then did he not bring forward these things, it may be said, at that time, when accused of usurpation? Because having the proofs from His acts, of His power, His meekness, His gentleness, beyond number, they were willfully blind, and dealt unfairly, and the tribunal was corrupt. For these reasons then He replies to nothing, but holds His peace, yet answering briefly (so as not to get the reputation of arrogance from continual silence) when the high priest adjured Him, when the governor asked, but in reply to their accusations He no longer says anything; for He was not now likely to persuade them. Even as the prophet declaring this self-same thing from of old, said, In His humiliation His judgment was taken away.

At these things the governor marvelled, and indeed it was worthy of admiration to see Him showing such great forbearance, and holding His peace, Him that had countless things to say. For neither did they accuse Him from knowing of any evil thing in Him, but from jealousy and envy only. At least when they had set false witness, wherefore, having nothing to say, did they still urge their point? And when they saw Judas was dead, and that Pilate had washed his hands of it, why were they not pricked with remorse. For indeed He did many things even at the very time, that they might recover themselves, but by none were they amended.
