In his first epistle, Paul said that he would send Timothy with the letter, but now he associates Timothy with him. Why is this? Evidently Timothy had already accomplished his mission and returned to be with Paul. Having been for some time in Asia, they had crossed into Macedonia, from which he wrote this letter. By associating Timothy with himself, Paul increased respect for him and displayed his own great humility, since Timothy was far less well known than Paul. But love brings all things together.

Once more, Paul calls the Corinthians a church, in order to bind them together, and “saints,” implying that if anyone is impure he is not included in this greeting.

Why does Paul address the Christians of the entire province, and not merely those of the city? The reason, I think, is that they were all involved in a single, common problem and were therefore all in need of the same remedy.
