"For," he says, "in that He has suffered Himself being tempted, He is able to succor them that are tempted." This is altogether low and mean, and unworthy of God. "For in that He has suffered Himself," he says. It is of Him who was made flesh that he here speaks, and it was said for the full assurance of the hearers, and on account of their weakness. That is (he would say) He went through the very experience of the things which we have suffered; "now" He is not ignorant of our sufferings; not only does He know them as God, but as man also He has known them, by the trial wherewith He was tried; He suffered much, He knows how to sympathize. And yet God is incapable of suffering: but he describes here what belongs to the Incarnation, as if he had said, Even the very flesh of Christ suffered many terrible things. He knows what tribulation is; He knows what temptation is, not less than we who have suffered, for He Himself also has suffered.

(What then is this, "He is able to succor them that are tempted"? It is as if one should say, He will stretch forth His hand with great eagerness, He will be sympathizing.)

3. Since they wished for something great, and to have an advantage over the [converts] from the Gentiles, he shows that they have an advantage in this while he did not hurt those from the Gentiles at all. In what respect now is this? Because of them is the salvation, because He took hold of them first, because from that race He assumed flesh. "For," he says, "He takes not hold of angels, but of the seed of Abraham He takes hold." Hereby he both gives honor to the Patriarch, and shows also what "the seed of Abraham" is. He reminds them of the promise made to him, saying, "To you and to your seed will I give this land" [Genesis 13:15]; showing by the very least thing, the nearness [of the relationship] in that they were "all of one." But that nearness was not great: [so] he comes back to this, and thenceforward dwells upon the dispensation which was after the flesh, and says, Even the mere willing to become man was a proof of great care and love; but now it is not this alone, but there are also the undying benefits which are bestowed on us through Him, for, he says, "to make reconciliation for the sins of the people."

Why said he not, of the world, instead of "the people"? For He bare away the sins of all. Because thus far his discourse was concerning them [the Hebrews]. Since the Angel also said to Joseph, "You shall call His name Jesus, for He shall save His people." [Matthew 1:21] For this too ought to have taken place first, and for this purpose He came, to save them and then through them the rest, although the contrary came to pass. This also the Apostles said at the first, "To you [God] having raised up His Son, sent [Him] to bless you" [Acts 3:26]: and again, "To you was the word of this Salvation sent." [Acts 13:26] Here he shows the noble birth of the Jews, in saying, "to make reconciliation for the sins of the people." For a while he speaks in this way. For that it is He who forgives the sins of all men, He declared both in the case of the paralytic, saying, "Your sins are forgiven" [Mark 2:5]; and also in that of Baptism: for He says to the disciples, "Go and teach all nations, baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." [Matthew 28:19]

“For,” he says, “because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.” This seems altogether low and mean and unworthy of God—to suffer and be tempted. “For because he himself has suffered,” he says. But it is of him who was made flesh that he here speaks. This was said for the full assurance of the hearers and on account of their weakness. That is, he would say, he went through the very experience of that which we have suffered. Now he is not ignorant of our sufferings, not only because as God he knows them, but also because as man he knows them through the trial with which he was tested. Since he suffered many things, he knows how to sympathize with suffering. It is certainly true that God is impassible, but the statement here is made of the incarnation, as though it were said, “The flesh of Christ itself suffered many fearful things.” He knows what tribulation is. He knows what temptation is, not less than we who have suffered, for he himself also has suffered.

Even if there is no persecution or tribulation, still there are other afflictions that befall us every day, and if we do not bear these, we should scarcely endure those. “No temptation has overtaken you,” it is said, “that is not common to man.” Let us then indeed pray to God that we may not come into temptation; but if we come into it, let us bear it nobly. For it is indeed a trait of prudent people not to throw themselves upon dangers; but this is the trait of noble persons and true philosophers. Let us not lightly cast ourselves upon dangers, for that is rashness; but, if we are led into them and called by circumstances, let us not yield, for that is cowardice, and, if indeed the gospel calls us, let us not refuse. In a simple case, when there is no reason or need or necessity that calls us in the fear of God, let us not rush in, for this is mere display and useless ambition. But should any of those things which are injurious to religion occur, then, though it be necessary to endure ten thousand deaths, let us refuse nothing. Do not risk trials when you find things that concern godliness prospering as you desire. Why draw down needless dangers that bring no gain?These things I say because I wish you to observe the laws of Christ, who commands us to “pray that we may not enter into temptation” and commands us to “take up the cross and follow” him. For these things are not contradictory; rather, they are exceedingly in harmony. Do be prepared like a valiant soldier. Be continually in your armor, sober, watchful and ever looking for the enemy. Do not, however, breed wars, for this is not the act of a soldier but of a mover of sedition. But if … the trumpet of godliness calls you, go forth immediately and make no account of your life, and enter with great eagerness into the contests, break the phalanx of the adversaries, bruise the face of the devil, set up your trophy. If, however, godliness is in nowise harmed, and if no one lays waste to our doctrines (those, I mean, which relate to the soul) or compels us to do anything displeasing to God, do not be meddlesome.
