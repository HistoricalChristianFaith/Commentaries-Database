"Then they suborned men, which said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words." In the case of the Apostles they were annoyed that they preached the Resurrection, and that much people flowed unto them: but in this case, that they were getting their diseases healed. The things for which they ought to give thanks, they made matter of blame: O the madness! The men who overcame them by works, they expected to overcome by words! It is just what they did in the case of Christ, and always they forced them to words. For they were ashamed to seize them without more ado, having nothing to charge them with. And observe, not the persons themselves who bring them to judgment bear witness against them; for they would have been refuted: but they simply hire others, that it may not seem to be an act of mere violence. It is all of a piece with their proceeding in the case of Christ.

For "we have heard him," they say, "speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God." O ye shameless ones! Ye work blasphemous deeds, and think nothing of it. This is why Moses is added - because the things of God were no great concern to them: and it is ever and always Moses that they make mention of: "This Moses, which brought us out."
