O you shameless ones! You work blasphemous deeds, and think nothing of it. This is why Moses is added— because the things of God were no great concern to them: and it is ever and always Moses that they make mention of: This Moses, which brought us out. Acts 7:40 And they stirred up the people.

In the case of the Apostles they were annoyed that they preached the Resurrection, and that much people flowed unto them: but in this case, that they were getting their diseases healed. Acts 4:2 The things for which they ought to give thanks, they made matter of blame: O the madness! The men who overcame them by works, they expected to overcome by words! It is just what they did in the case of Christ, and always they forced them to words. For they were ashamed to seize them without more ado, having nothing to charge them with. And observe, not the persons themselves who bring them to judgment bear witness against them; for they would have been refuted: but they simply hire others, that it may not seem to be an act of mere violence. It is all of a piece with their proceeding in the case of Christ. And observe the power of the preaching, that, though they are not only scourged but stoned, it still prevails: not only, private individuals as they are, dragged to the bar, but assailed from all quarters: and, their enemies themselves being witnesses, not only were these worsted, but they were not able even to resist

That they may establish the charge, the phrase is, he speaks against God, and against Moses. And with this object too they disputed, that they might force him to say somewhat. But he now discoursed more openly, and perhaps spoke of the cessation of the Divine Law: or, spoke it not, but hinted as much: since had he spoken plainly, there had been no need of suborned men, nor yet of false witnesses. The synagogues were diverse: [to wit, Of the Libertines]: of the Cyrenians, i.e. those in the parts beyond Alexandria [of the Alexandrians, etc.]. There also they seem to have had synagogues according to their different nations; for many stayed behind there, that they might not be obliged to be continually travelling. The Libertines perhaps were freedmen of the Romans. As there were many foreigners dwelling there, so they had their synagogues, where the Law was to be read. Disputing with Stephen. Observe him, not taking upon him to teach, but forced to do so. The miracles once more brought him into ill-will; but when he overcame in argument, it was false-witness! For they did not wish to kill intolerable to them. They could not resist, etc.: then they suborned men. Everywhere out of hand, but by means of a sentence, that they might hurt their reputation also: and leaving those (the Apostles), they attack these (the disciples), thinking in this way to terrify those also. They say not, he speaks, but, he ceases not to speak. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceases not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law. (v. 12, 13.) Ceases not, say they, as if he made this his business. For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.

For the battle was not man's, but God's against men. And there were many combined together; not only they in Jerusalem, but others as well. Acts 6:9 For we have heard him, say they, speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God. Acts 6:11 O you shameless ones! You work blasphemous deeds, and think nothing of it. This is why Moses is added— because the things of God were no great concern to them: and it is ever and always Moses that they make mention of: This Moses, which brought us out. Acts 7:40 And they stirred up the people. Acts 6:12 Fickleness of the multitude! And yet how could a man who was a blasphemer have so succeeded? How could a blasphemer work such miracles among the people? But the undisciplined multitude made them strong who had the worst of it (in argument).— This was what most annoyed them.
