Let us also consider these things in our temptations when we suffer anything from wicked people, “looking to the Beginner and Finisher of our faith.” Let us consider that it is by wicked people and for virtue’s sake and for his sake [that we suffer]. For if we reflect on these things, everything will be easier and more tolerable. Since one is even proud when suffering for those he loves, what kind of feeling will such a person have who suffers for the sake of God? For if Jesus, for our sake, calls that shameful thing, the cross, “glory,” how much more should we think that way! And if we can so despise sufferings, much more shall we be able to despise riches and covetousness. We ought then, when about to endure anything unpleasant, to think not of the toils but of the crowns. For as merchants take into account not the seas only but also the profits, so should we count on heaven and confidence in God. If acquiring things seems pleasant, simply remember that this is not what Christ called us to, and it will immediately appear displeasing. And if it is hard for you to give to the poor, do not keep adding things up in your mind, but rather immediately transport your thoughts to the harvest that results from the sowing. And when it is hard to despise the love of a strange woman, think of the crown that comes after the struggle, and you shall easily bear the struggle. For if fear diverts a person from unseemly things, much more should the love of Christ. Virtue is difficult. But let us cast around its form the greatness of the promise of things to come. Indeed, those who are virtuous, even apart from these promises, see [virtue] beautiful in itself. This is why they go after it and work for it, because it seems good to God and not because it is a job they have to do.

“And these things,” says he, “I did not tell you at the beginning.” Why didn’t he tell them at the beginning? He did not tell them so that no one might say that he was guessing based on the ordinary course of events. And why did he enter into a matter of such unpleasantness? I knew these things, he says, from the beginning and did not speak of them—not because I did not know them but “because I was with you.” And this again was spoken after a human manner, as though he had said, I didn’t tell you because you were in safety, and it was in your power to question me when you wanted to, and all the storms blew on me [not you], and so it was superfluous to tell you these things at the beginning. But did he not tell them this? Did he not call the Twelve and say to them, “You shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake,” and, “they shall scourge you in the synagogues”? How then can he say, “I did not tell you these things at the beginning”? He can say this because he had foretold their scourging and their being brought before princes, but not that their death should appear so desirable that the action should even be deemed a service to God. For this more than anything was enough to terrify them—that they were to be judged as impious and corrupters. We might also add that in that earlier place he spoke of what they should suffer from the Gentiles, but here he has added in a stronger way the acts of the Jews also, and told them that it was almost at their doors.
