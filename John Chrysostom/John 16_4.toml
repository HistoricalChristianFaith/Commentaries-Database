So, judging from these words, deem the rest also trustworthy. For you will not be able to say, that I flatteringly told you only those things which would please you, nor that the words were words of deceit; for one who intended to deceive, would not have told you beforehand of matters likely to turn you away. I have therefore told you before, that these things might not fall upon you unexpectedly, and trouble you; and for another reason besides, that you might not say, that I did not foreknow that these things would be. Remember then that I have told you. And indeed the heathen always covered their persecutions of them by a pretense of their wickedness, driving them out as corrupters; but this did not trouble the disciples who had heard beforehand, and knew for what they suffered. The cause of what took place was sufficient to rouse their courage. Therefore He everywhere handles this, saying, they have not known Me; and, for My sake they shall do it; and, for My Name's sake, and for the Father's sake; and, I suffered first; and, from no just cause they dare these things.

4. Let us too consider these things in our temptations, when we suffer anything from wicked men, looking to the Beginner  and Finisher of our faith Hebrews 12:2, and considering that it is by wicked men, and that it is for virtue's sake, and for His sake. For if we reflect on these things, all will be most easy and tolerable. Since if one suffering for those he loves is even proud of it, what feeling of things dreadful will he have who suffers for the sake of God? For if He, for our sake, calls that shameful thing, the Cross, glory John 13:31, much more ought we to be thus disposed. And if we can so despise sufferings, much more shall we be able to despise riches, and covetousness. We ought then, when about to endure anything unpleasant, to think not of the toils but of the crowns; for as merchants take into account not the seas only, but also the profits, so ought we to reckon on heaven and confidence towards God. And if the getting more seem a pleasant thing, think that Christ wills it not, and straightway it will appear displeasing. And if it be grievous to you to give to the poor, stay not your reckoning at the expense, but straightway transport your thoughts to the harvest which results from the sowing; and when it is hard to despise the love of a strange woman, think of the crown which comes after the struggle, and you shall easily bear the struggle. For if fear diverts a man from unseemly things, much more should the  love of Christ. Difficult is virtue; but let us cast around her form the greatness of the promise of things to come. Indeed those who are virtuous, even apart from these promises, see her beautiful in herself, and on this account go after her, and work because it seems good to God, not for hire; and they think it a great thing to be sober-minded, not in order that they may not be punished, but because God has commanded it. But if any one is too weak for this, let him think of the prizes. So let us do in respect of alms-doing, let us pity our fellow-men, let us not, I entreat,  neglect them when perishing with hunger. How can it be otherwise than an unseemly thing, that we should sit at the table laughing and enjoying ourselves, and when we hear others wailing as they pass through the street, should not even turn at their cries, but be angry with them, and call them cheat? What do you mean, man? Does any one plan a cheat for a single loaf of bread? Yes, says some one. Then in this case above all let him be pitied; in this case above all let him be delivered from his need. Or if you are not minded to give, do not insult either; if you will not save the wreck, do not thrust it into the gulf. For consider, when you push away the poor man who comes to you, who you will be when you call upon God. With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again. Matthew 7:2 Consider how he departs, crushed, bowed down, lamenting; besides his poverty having received also the blow from your insolence. For if you count the begging a curse, think what a tempest it makes, begging to get nothing, but to go away insulted. How long shall we be like wild beasts, and know not nature itself through greediness? Many groan at these words; but I desire them not now, but always, to have this feeling of compassion. Think, I pray you, of that day when we shall stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, when we shall beg for mercy, and Christ, bringing them forward, shall say, For the sake of a single loaf, of a single obol, so great a surge did ye raise in these souls! What shall we reply? What defense shall we make? To show that He will bring them forward, hear what He says; Inasmuch as you did it not to one of these, you did it not to Me. Matthew 25:45 They will no more say anything to us, but God on their behalf will upbraid us. Since the rich man saw Lazarus too,  and Lazarus said nothing to him, but Abraham spoke for him; and thus it will be in the case of the poor who are now despised by us. We shall not see them stretching out their hands in pitiful state, but being in rest; and we shall take the state which was theirs (and would that it were that state only, and not one much more grievous) as a punishment. For neither did the rich man desire to be filled with crumbs there, but was scorched and tormented sharply, and was told, You in your lifetime received your good things, and likewise Lazarus evil things. Luke 16:25 Let us not then deem wealth any great thing; it will help us on our way to punishment, if we take not heed, just as, if we take heed, poverty also becomes to us an addition of enjoyment and rest. For we both put off our sins if we bear it with thankfulness, and gain great boldness before God.

5. Let us then not be ever seeking security here, in order that we may enjoy security there; but let us accept the labors which are in behalf of virtue, and cut off superfluities, and seek nothing more than we need, and spend all our substance on those who want. Since what excuse can we have, when God promises heaven to us, and we will not even give Him bread? When He indeed for you makes the sun to rise, and supplies all the ministry of the Creation, but thou dost not even give Him a garment, nor allow Him to share your roof? But why speak I of sun and moon? He has set His Body before you, He has given you His Precious Blood; and do you not even impart to Him of your cup? But have you done so for once? This is not mercy; as long as, having the means, you help not, you have not yet fulfilled the whole duty. Thus the virgins who had the lamps, had oil, but not in abundance. Why, you ought, even did you give from your own, not to be so miserly, but now when you give what is your Lord's, why do you count every little? Will ye that I tell you the cause of this inhumanity? When men get together their wealth through greediness, these same are slow to give alms; for one who has learned so to gain, knows not how to spend. For how can a man prepared for rapine adapt himself to its contrary? He who takes from others, how shall he be able to give up his own to another? A dog accustomed to feed on flesh cannot guard the flock; therefore the shepherds kill such. That this be not our fate, let us refrain from such feasting. For these men too feed on flesh, when they bring on death by hunger. Do you see not how God has allowed to us all things in common? If amid riches He has suffered men to be poor, it is for the consolation of the rich, that they may be able by showing mercy towards them to put off their sins. But thou even in this hast been cruel and inhuman; whence it is evident, that if you had received this same power in greater things, you would have committed ten thousand murders, and wouldest have debarred men from light,  and from life altogether.  That this might not take place, necessity has cut short insatiableness in such matters.

If you are pained when you hear these things, much more I when I see them taking place. How long shall you be rich, and that man poor? Till evening, but no farther; for so short is life, and all things so near their end,  and all things henceforth so stand at the door, that the whole must be deemed but a little hour. What need have you of bursting  storehouses, of a multitude of domestics and house-keepers? Why have you not ten thousand proclaimers of your almsdoing? The storehouse utters no voice, yet will it bring upon you many robbers; but the storehouses of the poor will go up to God Himself, and will make your present life sweet, and put away all your sins, and you shall gain glory from God, and honor from men. Why then grudgest you yourself such good things? For you will not do so much good to the poor, as to yourself, when you benefit them. You will right their present state; but for yourself you will lay up beforehand the glory and confidence which shall be hereafter. And this may we all obtain, by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom with the Father and the Holy Ghost be the glory and the might for ever. Amen.

Let us also consider these things in our temptations when we suffer anything from wicked people, “looking to the Beginner and Finisher of our faith.” Let us consider that it is by wicked people and for virtue’s sake and for his sake [that we suffer]. For if we reflect on these things, everything will be easier and more tolerable. Since one is even proud when suffering for those he loves, what kind of feeling will such a person have who suffers for the sake of God? For if Jesus, for our sake, calls that shameful thing, the cross, “glory,” how much more should we think that way! And if we can so despise sufferings, much more shall we be able to despise riches and covetousness. We ought then, when about to endure anything unpleasant, to think not of the toils but of the crowns. For as merchants take into account not the seas only but also the profits, so should we count on heaven and confidence in God. If acquiring things seems pleasant, simply remember that this is not what Christ called us to, and it will immediately appear displeasing. And if it is hard for you to give to the poor, do not keep adding things up in your mind, but rather immediately transport your thoughts to the harvest that results from the sowing. And when it is hard to despise the love of a strange woman, think of the crown that comes after the struggle, and you shall easily bear the struggle. For if fear diverts a person from unseemly things, much more should the love of Christ. Virtue is difficult. But let us cast around its form the greatness of the promise of things to come. Indeed, those who are virtuous, even apart from these promises, see [virtue] beautiful in itself. This is why they go after it and work for it, because it seems good to God and not because it is a job they have to do.

“And these things,” says he, “I did not tell you at the beginning.” Why didn’t he tell them at the beginning? He did not tell them so that no one might say that he was guessing based on the ordinary course of events. And why did he enter into a matter of such unpleasantness? I knew these things, he says, from the beginning and did not speak of them—not because I did not know them but “because I was with you.” And this again was spoken after a human manner, as though he had said, I didn’t tell you because you were in safety, and it was in your power to question me when you wanted to, and all the storms blew on me [not you], and so it was superfluous to tell you these things at the beginning. But did he not tell them this? Did he not call the Twelve and say to them, “You shall be brought before governors and kings for my sake,” and, “they shall scourge you in the synagogues”? How then can he say, “I did not tell you these things at the beginning”? He can say this because he had foretold their scourging and their being brought before princes, but not that their death should appear so desirable that the action should even be deemed a service to God. For this more than anything was enough to terrify them—that they were to be judged as impious and corrupters. We might also add that in that earlier place he spoke of what they should suffer from the Gentiles, but here he has added in a stronger way the acts of the Jews also, and told them that it was almost at their doors.
