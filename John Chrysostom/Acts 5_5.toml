This miracle is greater than that of the lame man, in respect of the death inflicted, and the knowing what was in the thought of the heart, even what was done in secret.

That man was punished, and others profited thereby. Not without cause. And yet, signs had been wrought before: true, but there was not such a sense of fear. So true is that saying, The Lord is known by executing judgments. Psalm 9:16 The same thing had occurred in the case of the Ark: Uzzah was punished and fear came upon the rest. 2 Samuel 6:7 But in that instance the king through fear removed from him the Ark; but here the disciples became more earnestly heedful.
