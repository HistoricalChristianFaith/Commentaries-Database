(Hom. lii. 2) As they had brought Galilee as an objection against Him, and doubted His being one of the Prophets, as if that was all He claimed to be, He wished to show that He was not one of the Prophets, but the Lord of the whole earth: Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the Light of the world: not of Galilee, or of Palestine, or of Judæa.

(Hom. lii. 2) Walketh not in darkness, i. e. spiritually abideth not in error. Here He tacitly praises Nicodemus and the officers, and censures those who had plotted against Him; as being in darkness and error, and unable to come to the light.

Not of Galilee, not of Palestine, nor of Jud&aelig;a. What then say the Jews?

Since they were continually bringing up Galilee and “the prophet” (as if that was all he claimed to be), he wanted to show that he was not one of the prophets but the Master of the world. “I am the Light of the world,” not only of Galilee, or of Palestine, or of Judea.

He uses “light” and “darkness” in a spiritual sense, meaning “do not remain in error.” Here he tacitly praises Nicodemus … and the officers … and censures those who were secretly plotting against him as being in darkness and error but who will be unable to overcome the light.
