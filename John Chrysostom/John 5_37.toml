How then did God speak and Moses answered? How did David hear a tongue that he did not know? Did people ever hear the voice of God [speaking out of the midst of the fire], as you [Moses] have heard his voice and seen his shape? Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel are said to have seen him, and many others. So what does Christ mean here? He means to impress upon them the philosophical understanding that God has neither voice nor shape but is superior to such modes of speaking about him. For as in saying, “You have never heard his voice,” he does not mean to say that he has a voice but that they just cannot hear it. And also, when he says, “Nor have they ever seen his form,” no tangible, sensible or visible shape is implied to belong to God.… But why, he says, do I bring these things up? I do so because not only have you never heard his voice or seen his shape, but it is not even in your power to assert what you are most proud and assured of: that you have received and kept his commandments.
