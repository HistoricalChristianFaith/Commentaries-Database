For indeed there is nothing equal to this virtue. Would you learn the power of this virtue? “Though Moses and Samuel stood before me,” says God, “my soul would not regard them.” Nevertheless those whom Moses and Samuel were not able to snatch away from God’s wrath, this precept when observed was able to snatch away. Hence it is that he continually exhorts those to whom he had spoken of these things, saying, “Let none of you revengefully imagine evil against your brother in his heart,” and “Let none of you think of his neighbor’s malice.” It is not said merely, forego wrath; but do not retain it in your mind; do not think of it; part with all your resentment; do away with the sore. For you suppose that you are paying him back the injury; but you are first tormenting yourself, and setting up your rage as an executioner within you in every part, and tearing up your own bowels. For what can be more wretched than a person perpetually angry? And just as maniacs never enjoy tranquility, so also one who is resentful and retains an enemy will never have the enjoyment of any peace. Incessantly raging, [such a person] daily increases the tempest of his thoughts, calling to mind his words and his acts, and detesting the very name of one who has aggrieved him. If you but mention his enemy, he becomes furious at once, and sustains great inward anguish; and should he only by chance get a bare glimpse of him, he fears and trembles, as if encountering the worst evils.
