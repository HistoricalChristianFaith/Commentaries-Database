Be it with crying, why also strong [crying] and tears?

Having offered, (he says), and having been heard in that He feared. What do you say? Let the Heretics be ashamed. The Son of God was heard in that He feared. And what more could any man say concerning the prophets? And what sort of connection is there, in saying, He was heard in that He feared, though He were Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered? Would any man say these things concerning God? Why, who was ever so mad? And who, even if he were beside himself, would have uttered these things? Having been heard, (he says), in that He feared, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered. What obedience? He that before this had been obedient even unto death, as a Son to His Father, how did He afterwards learn? Do you see that this is spoken concerning the Incarnation?

Tell me now, did He pray the Father that He might be saved from death? And was it for this cause that He was exceeding sorrowful, and said, If it be possible, let this cup pass from Me? Matthew 26:38-39 Yet He nowhere prayed the Father concerning His resurrection, but on the contrary He openly declares, Destroy this temple and within three days I will raise it up. John 2:19 And, I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. No man takes it from Me, I lay it down of Myself. John 10:18 What then is it; why did He pray? (And again He said, Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death. And they shall deliver Him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third day He shall rise again Matthew 20:18-19, and said not, My Father shall raise Me up again.) How then did He pray concerning this? But for whom did He pray? For those who believed on Him.

And what he means is this, 'He is readily listened to.' For since they had not yet the right opinion concerning Him, he said that He was heard. Just as He Himself also when consoling His disciples said, If you loved Me, you would rejoice, because I go to My Father John 14:28, and My Father is greater than I. But how did He not glorify Himself, He who made Himself of no reputation Philippians 2:7, He who gave Himself up? For, it is said, He gave Himself up for our sins. See And again, Who gave Himself a ransom for us all. 1 Timothy 2:6 What is it then? You see that it is in reference to the flesh that lowly things are spoken concerning Himself: So also here, Although He were Son, He was heard in that He feared, it is said. He wishes to show, that the success was of Himself, rather than of God's favor. So great (he says) was His reverence, that even on account thereof God had respect unto Him.

He learned, he says, to obey God. Here again he shows how great is the gain of sufferings. And having been made perfect, he says, He became the Author of salvation to them that obey Him. (Cf. supra, pp. 384, 391.) But if He, being the Son, gained obedience from His sufferings, much more shall we. Do you see how many things he discourses about obedience, that they might be persuaded to it? For it seems to me that they would not be restrained. From the things, he says, which He suffered He continually learned to obey God . And being made perfect through sufferings. This then is perfection, and by this means must we arrive at perfection. For not only was He Himself saved, but became to others also an abundant supply of salvation. For being made perfect He became the Author of salvation to them that obey Him.
