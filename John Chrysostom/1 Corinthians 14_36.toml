"What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you alone?"

Thus he brings in the other Churches also as holding this law, both abating the disturbance by consideration of the novelty of the thing, and by the general voice making his saying acceptable. Wherefore also elsewhere he said, "Who shall put you in remembrance of my ways which be in Christ, even as I teach everywhere in all the Churches." [1 Corinthians 4:17] And again, "God is not a God of confusion, but of peace, as in all the Churches of the saints." [1 Corinthians 14:33] And here, "What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you alone?" i.e., "neither first, nor alone are you believers, but the whole world." Which also writing to the Colossians he said, "even as it is bearing fruit and increasing in all the world," [Colossians 1:6] speaking of the Gospel.

But he turns it also at another time to the encouragement of his hearers; as when he says that theirs were the first fruits, and were manifest unto all. Thus, writing to the Thessalonians he said, "For from you has sounded forth the word of God," and, "in every place your faith to God-ward is gone forth." [1 Thessalonians 1:8] And again to the Romans, "Your faith is proclaimed throughout the whole world." For both are apt to shame and stir up, as well the being commended of others, as that they have others partakers in their judgment. Wherefore also here he says; "What? Was it from you that the word of God went forth? Or came it unto you only?" "For neither can you say this," says he; "we were made teachers to the rest, and it cannot be right for us to learn of others;" nor, "the faith remained in this place only, and no precedents from other quarters ought to be received." Do you see by how many arguments he put them to shame? He introduced the law, he signified the shamefulness of the thing, he brought forward the other Churches.

3. Next, what is strongest of all he puts last, saying, "God ordains these things even at this time by me."
