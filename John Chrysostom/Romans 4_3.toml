The Master proclaimed that Abraham was just because he outran the weakness of his human nature. He strained with his whole mind toward the power of him who had made the promise.

"For what saith the Scripture? Abraham believed in God, and it was counted unto him for righteousness."

After mentioning the Scripture above he goes on to secure also the judgment of the speakers, and shows that justification took place in the uncircumcision. Then from these grounds he solves another objection which is starting up. For if when in uncircumcision, one might say he was justified, to what purpose was the circumcision brought in? "He received it," he says, "a sign and seal of the righteousness that was by the faith, which he had being yet uncircumcised."
