But they, though it was so, shook their heads (incredulously): And they said unto her, You are mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. And they said, It is his angel. But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened the door, and saw him, they were astonished. But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go show these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place. (v. 16, 17.) But let us review the order of the narrative.

“And they said to her: ‘You are mad!’ But she confidently affirmed that it was so. And they said, ‘It is his angel.’ ” This is true because everyone has an angel. And what does the angel want? From the time of the night this is what they expected. “But Peter continued knocking; and when they had opened, they saw him and were amazed. But he motioned them with his hand” and produced a great silence, so that they might hear what had happened to him. He was now much more sought after by the disciples, not only because he was saved but also on account of his arrival and immediate departure. His friends heard about everything clearly, and strangers would have too, if indeed they had wished to, but they did not. This also happened in the case of Christ. “Tell these things,” he said, “to James and to the brothers.” Is he not free from vainglory? He did not even say, “Make these things known to people everywhere” but “to the brothers.” … It was to prevent them from saying, “It was his angel,” after his departure, that they say this first and then see the man himself, who controverts that idea. Had it been the angel, he would not have knocked at the door or withdrawn to another place. They were assured of this by what happened the next day.
