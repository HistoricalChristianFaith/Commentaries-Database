"And what communion hath light with darkness? And what concord hath Christ with Beliar? Or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?"

Seest thou how he uses the bare names, and how adequately to his purpose of dissuasion. For he did not say, 'neglect of righteousness,' [but] what was stronger [iniquity]; nor did he say those who are of the light, and those who are of the darkness; but he uses opposites themselves which can not admit of their opposites, 'light and darkness.' Nor said he those who are of Christ, with those who are of the devil; but, which was far wider apart, Christ and Beliar, so calling that apostate one, in the Hebrew tongue. "Or what portion hath a believer with an unbeliever?" Here, at length, that he may not seem simply to be going through a censure of vice and an encomium of virtue, he mentions persons also without particularizing. And he said not, 'communion,' but spoke of the rewards, using the term "portion."
