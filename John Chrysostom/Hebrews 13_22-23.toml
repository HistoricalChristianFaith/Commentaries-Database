5. "And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation, for indeed I have written a letter unto you in few words." Do you see that what he wrote to no one [else], he writes to them? For (he means) I do not even trouble you with long discourse.

I suppose that they were not at all unfavorably disposed towards Timothy: wherefore he also put him forward.  For [Hebrews 13:23] "know ye," he says, "that our brother Timothy is set at liberty,  with whom, if he come shortly, I will see you." "Set at liberty," he says; from whence? I suppose he had been cast into prison: or if not this, that he was sent away from Athens. For this also is mentioned in the Acts.
