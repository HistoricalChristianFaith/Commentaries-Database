It was exceedingly right to admire the consideration of our Lawgiver. He could have brought forward his illustration from among people. He could have spoken of Moses, Elijah, John, and others like them. But, so that he might touch them more to the quick, he made mention of the irrational beings. For had he spoken of those righteous men, these would have been able to say, “We have not yet become like them.” But now by passing them over in silence and bringing forward the fowls of the air, he has cut off from them every excuse. Therefore, he imitates in this place also the old law. Yes, for the old covenant likewise looks to the bee, to the ant, to the turtle and to the swallow.
