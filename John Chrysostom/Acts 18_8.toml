With his whole house: observe the converts in those times doing this with their entire household. This Crispus he means where he writes, I baptized none save Crispus and Gaius. 1 Corinthians 1:14 This (same) I take to be called Sosthenesâ€” (evidently) a believer, insomuch that he is beaten, and is always present with Paul. And the Lord said in the night, etc. Now even the number (of the much people) persuaded him, but Christ's claiming them for His own (moved him) more. Yet He says also, Fear not: for the danger was become greater now, both because more believed, and also the ruler of the synagogue. This was enough to rouse him. Not that he was reproved as fearing; but that he should not suffer anything; I am with you, and none shall set upon you to hurt you.
