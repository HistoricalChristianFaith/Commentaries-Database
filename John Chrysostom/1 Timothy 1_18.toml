When again he speaks of a charge, which implies something burdensome, he adds, “This charge I commit to you, my son Timothy.” He charges him as his son, not so much with arbitrary or despotic authority. Rather as a father, he says, “My son, Timothy.”

The offices of teacher and priest are of great dignity, and to bring forward one that is worthy requires God’s own calling. So it was of old, and so it is now. This choice is to be made apart from human sentiments, not looking to any temporal consideration, swayed neither by friendship nor by enmity.… In those days the calling of a priest was “in accordance with prophecy.” But what does that imply? That nothing human is to interfere with the leading of the Holy Spirit. For prophecy is not only the telling of things future but also of the present.
