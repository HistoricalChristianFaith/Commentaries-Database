But neither did the garden cause him to remember what had been said there, nor the great affection that Jesus had there shown by those words. Instead, he banished all of these from his mind due to the pressure of anxiety. But why have all the Evangelists written the same thing about him? They did so not to accuse the disciple but because they wanted to teach us how great an evil it is to trust in ourselves instead of committing everything to God. But you have to admire the tender care of his master, who, though a prisoner and bound, took great forethought for his disciple. He raises Peter up when he was down, by his look, and launches him into a sea of tears.
