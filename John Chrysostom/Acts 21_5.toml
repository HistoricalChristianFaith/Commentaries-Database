And there again they part from each other with prayer. "And when we had accomplished those days, we departed, and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till we were out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed. And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again." See how great was the entreaty. And again they part with prayer. "But after we had accomplished the days," i.e. had fulfilled the appointed days, "we separated, and went on our way: they all bringing us on our way with wives and children." Also in Ptolemais they stay one day, but in Caesarea many.
