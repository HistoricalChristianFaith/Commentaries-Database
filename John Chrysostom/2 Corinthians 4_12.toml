"So then death works in us, but life in you."

Speaking no more of death in the strict sense , but of trials and of rest. 'For we indeed,' he says, 'are in perils and trials, but you in rest; reaping the life which is the fruit of these perils. And we indeed endure the dangerous, but you enjoy the good things; for you undergo not so great trials.'
