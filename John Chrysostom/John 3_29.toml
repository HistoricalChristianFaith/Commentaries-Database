But how does he who said, “whose sandals I am not worthy to unloose,” now call himself his “friend”? It is not to exalt himself or to boast that he says this. Rather, it is from [his] desire to show that he too very much looks forward to this (i.e., the exaltation of Christ) and that these things happen not against his will or to his disadvantage. Rather, he desires and is eager for them. It was with a special view to these very things that all his actions had been performed. He has very wisely shown this by the term “friend.” For on occasions like marriages, the servants of the bridegroom are not as glad and joyful as his “friends” are. It was not from any desire to prove equality of honor (away with the thought) that he calls himself friend, but only due to his great pleasure and from condescension to their weakness. For he previously declared his service by saying, “I am sent before him.” On this account and because they thought that he was troubled at what had taken place, he called himself the “friend of the Bridegroom” to show not only that he was not troubled, but that he was actually quite happy over the whole turn of events.

But what does it mean: “He who stands and hears him rejoices greatly, because of the bridegroom’s voice”? He transfers the expression from the parable to the subject at hand. For after mentioning the bridegroom and the bride, he shows how the bride is brought home, that is, by a “voice” and by teaching. For this is how the church is wedded to God. Therefore Paul also says, “Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God.” At this “voice,” he says, “I rejoice.” And he adds “who stand,” in order to show that his office had ceased, that he had given over to him “the bride” and must for the future himself stand and hear him. He was a servant and minister, and his hope and joy are now realized. Therefore he says, “This, my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.”
