"Assayed," it says, "to join himself to the disciples." He did not come up to them unabashed, but with a subdued manner. "Disciples" they were all called at that time by reason of their great virtue, for there was the likeness of the disciples plainly to be seen.

"He assayed," it says, "to join himself to the disciples. And they were afraid of him." By this again is shown the ardor of Paul's character: not only from the mouth of Ananias, and of those who wondered at him there, but also of those in Jerusalem: "they believed not that he was a disciple:" for truly that was beyond all human expectation. He was no longer a wild beast, but a man mild and gentle! And observe how he does not go to the Apostles, such is his forbearance, but to the disciples, as being a disciple. He was not thought worthy of credit.
