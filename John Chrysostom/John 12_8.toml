But none of these things [that he said] turned back that savage madman [i.e., Judas]. And yet, really Jesus said and did far more than this: he washed his feet that night, made him a sharer in the table and the salt, which is a thing that should restrain even the souls of robbers. He also spoke other words, enough to melt a stone, and he did this, not a long time before but on the very day in order that not even time might cause it to be forgotten. But none of this affected Judas.
