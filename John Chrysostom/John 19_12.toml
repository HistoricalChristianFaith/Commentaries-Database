For when they profited nothing by bringing charges drawn from their own law, they wickedly betook themselves to external laws, saying,

Every one that makes himself a king speaks against C&aelig;sar.

And where has this Man appeared as a tyrant? Whence can you prove it? By the purple robe? By the diadem? By the dress?  By the soldiers? Did not He ever walk unattended, save by His twelve disciples, following in every point a humble mode of living, both as to food, and clothing, and habitation? But O what shamelessness and ill-time cowardice! For Pilate, deeming that he should now incur some danger were he to overlook these words, comes forth as though to enquire into the matter,  (for the sitting down showed this,) but without making  any enquiry, he gave Him up to them, thinking to shame them. For to prove that he did it for this purpose, hear what he says.

Pilate ought therefore to have accurately inquired whether Jesus had aimed at sovereignty and set his hand to expel Caesar from the kingdom. But he makes no such exact inquiry, and therefore Christ answered him nothing, because he knew that he asked all the questions idly. Besides, since his works bore witness to him, he would not prevail by word or compose any defense, showing that he came voluntarily to this condition.… Pilate, thinking that he might now incur some danger if he were to overlook these words, comes forth as though to inquire into the matter (for the “sitting down” showed this), but without making any inquiry, he gave Jesus up to them, thinking to shame them.
