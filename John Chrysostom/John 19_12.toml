Pilate ought therefore to have accurately inquired whether Jesus had aimed at sovereignty and set his hand to expel Caesar from the kingdom. But he makes no such exact inquiry, and therefore Christ answered him nothing, because he knew that he asked all the questions idly. Besides, since his works bore witness to him, he would not prevail by word or compose any defense, showing that he came voluntarily to this condition.… Pilate, thinking that he might now incur some danger if he were to overlook these words, comes forth as though to inquire into the matter (for the “sitting down” showed this), but without making any inquiry, he gave Jesus up to them, thinking to shame them.
