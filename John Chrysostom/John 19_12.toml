For when they profited nothing by bringing charges drawn from their own law, they wickedly betook themselves to external laws, saying,

Every one that makes himself a king speaks against C&aelig;sar.

And where has this Man appeared as a tyrant? Whence can you prove it? By the purple robe? By the diadem? By the dress?  By the soldiers? Did not He ever walk unattended, save by His twelve disciples, following in every point a humble mode of living, both as to food, and clothing, and habitation? But O what shamelessness and ill-time cowardice! For Pilate, deeming that he should now incur some danger were he to overlook these words, comes forth as though to enquire into the matter,  (for the sitting down showed this,) but without making  any enquiry, he gave Him up to them, thinking to shame them. For to prove that he did it for this purpose, hear what he says.
