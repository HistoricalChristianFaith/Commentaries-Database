But how can you prove this? By His purple, His diadem, His chariot, His guards? Did He not wall; about with His twelve disciples only, and every thing mean about Him, food, dress, and habitation? .
He went outto examine into the matter: his sitting down on the judgment seat shows this.
Pilate, despairing of moving them, did not examine Him, as he intended, but delivered Him up. And he says to the  Jews, Behold your King! .
A speech that should have softened their rage; but they were afraid of letting Him go, lest He might draw away the multitude again. For the love of rule is a heavy crime, and sufficient to condemn a man. They cried out, Away with Him, away with Him. And they resolved upon the most disgraceful kind of death, Crucify Him, in order to prevent all memorial of Him afterwards.
They voluntarily brought themselves under punishment, and God gave them up to it. With one accord they denied the kingdom of God, and God suffered them to fall into their own condemnation; for they rejected the kingdom of Christ, and called down upon their own heads that of Caesar.

For when they profited nothing by bringing charges drawn from their own law, they wickedly betook themselves to external laws, saying,

Every one that makes himself a king speaks against C&aelig;sar.

And where has this Man appeared as a tyrant? Whence can you prove it? By the purple robe? By the diadem? By the dress?  By the soldiers? Did not He ever walk unattended, save by His twelve disciples, following in every point a humble mode of living, both as to food, and clothing, and habitation? But O what shamelessness and ill-time cowardice! For Pilate, deeming that he should now incur some danger were he to overlook these words, comes forth as though to enquire into the matter,  (for the sitting down showed this,) but without making  any enquiry, he gave Him up to them, thinking to shame them. For to prove that he did it for this purpose, hear what he says.
