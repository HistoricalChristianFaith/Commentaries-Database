"And when I was come again to Jerusalem," etc. How was it, that being a Jew, and there brought up and taught, he did not stay there? Nor did he abide there, unless he had a mind to furnish numberless occasions against him: everywhere just like an exile, fleeing about from place to place. "While I prayed in the temple," he says, "it came to pass that I was in a trance." To show that it was not simply a phantom of the imagination, therefore "while he prayed" the Lord stood by him. And he shows that it was not from fear of their dangers that he fled, but because they would "not receive" his "testimony."
