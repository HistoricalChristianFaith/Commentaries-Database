For he supposed, etc. And yet it was by deeds that his championship was shown; what intelligence was there need of here? But still for all this they understood not. And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another? Acts 7:26-28 Do you mark with what mildness he addresses them? He who had shown his wrath in the case of the other, shows his gentleness in his own case. But he that did his neighbor wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? Will you kill me, as you did the Egyptian yesterday? Mark; the very words which they said to Christ: Who made You ruler and judge over us? So habitual a thing was it for Jews to wrong (their benefactors) when in the act of receiving benefits! And again, mark the atrocious baseness: (μιαρίαν al. μοχθηρίαν, Sav. marg.)

See how up to this point he is not yet offensive to them; how they listened to him while he said all this. And his face, we read, was as the face of an angel Acts 6:15.— For he supposed, etc. And yet it was by deeds that his championship was shown; what intelligence was there need of here? But still for all this they understood not. And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and would have set them at one again, saying, Sirs, you are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
