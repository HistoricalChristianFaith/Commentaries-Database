After that, because he had enjoined on them great things, to raise their courage he reassures them that he will be with them always, “even to the end of the world.” Now do you see the relation of his glory to his previous condescension? His own proper power is again restored. What he had said previously was spoken during the time of his humiliation. He promised to be not only with these disciples but also with all who would subsequently believe after them. Jesus speaks to all believers as if to one body. Do not speak to me, he says, of the difficulties you will face, for “I am with you,” as the one who makes all things easy. Remember that this is also said repeatedly to the prophets in the Old Testament. Recall Jeremiah objecting that he is too young and Moses and Ezekiel shrinking from the prophet’s office. “I am with you” is spoken to all these people. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

What does he finally say to them when he sees them? “All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.” He is still speaking to them according to his humanity, for they had not yet received the Spirit which was able to raise them to higher things. “Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age.” He gives them one charge with a view toward teaching and another charge concerning his commandments. He makes no mention of the future of the Jews. He does not scold Peter for his denial or any one of the others for their flight. Having put into their hands a summary of Christian teaching, which is expressed in the form of baptism, he commands them to go out into the whole world. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

What then says He unto them, when He sees them? All power is given unto me in heaven and on earth. Again He speaks to them more after the manner of man, for they had not yet received the spirit, which was able to raise them on high.
