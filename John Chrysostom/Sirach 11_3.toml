God shows that the prescriptions of the Law are not arduous. His requests of humankind are not inordinate. In fact, those beings without reason, and even the most senseless among them, easily obey what he commands. Someone might allege, however, that they instinctually have the capacity to know. Therefore it is possible that what they rightly do by instinct we do through our own choice. “The ox knows his owner.” Not only does he place before them how exceptional his gift is, but he further intensifies his accusation against their inordinate wickedness by comparing them not with other human beings but with the elements of nature—those, in particular, who are without reason and are the most senseless among them. He says that they are even worse than these. This is also what Jeremiah does, bringing into play the turtledove and the swallow. Solomon, too, does something similar, returning the one who lives an idle life to now face the ant, now the bee.
