For nothing was ever more humble than he, who, being leader of so great a people, and having overwhelmed in the sea the king and the host of all the Egyptians, as if they had been flies, and having wrought so many wonders both in Egypt and by the Red Sea and in the wilderness, and received such high testimony, yet felt exactly as if he had been an ordinary person. As a soninlaw he was humbler than his fatherinlaw; Moses took advice from him and was not indignant. Nor did he say, “What is this? After such and so great achievements, have you come to us with your counsel?” Homilies on  Corinthians
