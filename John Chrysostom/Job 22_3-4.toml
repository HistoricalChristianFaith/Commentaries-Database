“What does it matter to the Lord, if you were blameless in your works?” That is, it has no importance for God. “Or does he gain any profit from the righteousness of your conduct?” It cannot be said that, in fact, it contributes to him any advantage, he says. Since Job in every possible manner had said that God did this and because of him I am suffering, Eliphaz wants to show that [his afflictions] do not come from God. “Or, in order to make a case against you, will he accuse you and enter into judgment with you?” Yes, you can be as righteous as you want, it does not matter for him, and he has no consideration for you, that is, what you do deserves little interest on the part of God. In fact, if he really wanted to judge you, he would have found your faults.
