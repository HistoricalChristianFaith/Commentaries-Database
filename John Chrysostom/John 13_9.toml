Vehement in deprecation, he becomes yet more vehement in acquiescence; but both from love. For why said He not wherefore He did this, instead of adding a threat? Because Peter would not have been persuaded. For had He said, Suffer it, for by this I persuade you to be humbleminded, Peter would have promised it ten thousand times, in order that his Master might not do this thing. But now what says He? He speaks of that which Peter most feared and dreaded, the being separated from Him; for it is he who continually asks, Where are You going? John 13:36 Wherefore also he said, I will give  even my life for You. John 13:37 And if, after hearing, What I do you know not now, but you shall know hereafter, he still persisted, much more would he have done so had he learned (the meaning of the action). Therefore said He, but you shall know hereafter, as being aware, that should he learn it immediately he would still resist. And Peter said not, Tell me, that I may suffer You, but (which was much more vehement) he did not even endure to learn, but withstands Him,   saying, You shall never wash my feet. But as soon as He threatened, he straightway relaxed his tone. But what means, You shall know after this? After this? When?

As vehement as Peter was in self-deprecation, he was even more vehement in acquiescing. But he did both from love. For why didn’t Jesus say why he was doing what he did, instead of adding a threat? He did so because Peter would not have been persuaded. For had he said, “Let this be done to you because I am trying to persuade you to be humble minded,” Peter would have promised it ten thousand times so that his Master might not do this thing. But now what does Jesus say? He speaks of that which Peter most feared and dreaded—being separated from him. For it is Peter who continually asks, “Where are you going?” Therefore he also said, “I will give even my life for you.” And if, after hearing, “What I do you do not understand now, but you will know later,” he still persisted, much more would he have done so had he learned [the meaning of the action]. Therefore Jesus says, “but you shall know later,” being aware that should he learn it immediately he would still resist.
