As vehement as Peter was in self-deprecation, he was even more vehement in acquiescing. But he did both from love. For why didn’t Jesus say why he was doing what he did, instead of adding a threat? He did so because Peter would not have been persuaded. For had he said, “Let this be done to you because I am trying to persuade you to be humble minded,” Peter would have promised it ten thousand times so that his Master might not do this thing. But now what does Jesus say? He speaks of that which Peter most feared and dreaded—being separated from him. For it is Peter who continually asks, “Where are you going?” Therefore he also said, “I will give even my life for you.” And if, after hearing, “What I do you do not understand now, but you will know later,” he still persisted, much more would he have done so had he learned [the meaning of the action]. Therefore Jesus says, “but you shall know later,” being aware that should he learn it immediately he would still resist.
