When they were past the first and the second ward, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of its own accord. Behold, a second miracle. And they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him. When the angel departed, then Peter understood.

And when they had passed the first and the second ward, they came to the iron gate, which opened unto them of its own accord: and yet the things that had happened within the prison were more marvellous: but this was now more after the manner of man. And having gone out, they went along one street and immediately the Angel departed from him. When there was no hindrance, then the Angel departed. For Peter would not have gone along, there being so many hindrances.

When they were past the first and the second ward - see also how strong the guard was - they came unto the iron gate.
