Observe the wisdom of the Evangelist. He mentions this for the third time, to set forth the excellency of the Baptist, and their wickedness and folly. And Luke also says, that when the multitudes supposed him to be the Christ, he again removes their suspicion.  This is the part of an honest servant, not only not to take to himself his master's honor, but also to reject it  when given to him by the many. But the multitudes arrived at this supposition from simplicity and ignorance; these questioned him from an ill intention, which I have mentioned, expecting, as I said, to draw him over to their purpose by their flattery. Had they not expected this, they would not have proceeded immediately to another question, but would have been angry with him for having given them an answer foreign to their enquiry, and would have said, Why, did we suppose that? Did we come to ask you that? But now as taken and detected in the fact, they proceed to another question, and say,

[The Jews] were influenced by a kind of human sympathy for John [the Baptist], whom they were reluctant to see made subordinate to Christ because of the many marks of greatness about him. [For example], there was in the first place his illustrious descent, since he was the son of a chief priest. There was also his hard training and his contempt for the world. … In Christ, however, the contrary was apparent. He was of humble birth, for which they reproach him by asking, “Is not this the carpenter’s son?” … And the country that he was supposed to have come from had such a bad reputation that even Nathanael said, “Can anything good come from Nazareth?” He also had an ordinary way of living and clothes like everyone else wore.… When John then was constantly sending them to Christ … therefore, they send someone to him, thinking by their flattery that they will induce him to confess that he was the Christ. They do not therefore send inferior people to him … servants and Herodians, as they did to Christ, but priests and Levites. And no indiscriminate party are these, but those [priests and Levites] of Jerusalem, that is, the more honorable ones.… They send them to ask, “Who are you?” … They send them not because they want to be informed but in order to induce him to do what I have said.…John replies then to their intention, not to their interrogation.… “And he confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, ‘I am not the Christ.’ ” And observe the wisdom of the Evangelist. He repeats the same thing three times to show John’s virtue and [the priests’ and Levites’] wickedness and foolishness.… For it is the character of an honest servant not only to forbear taking to himself his lord’s glory but even to reject it when many offer it to him. The multitude indeed believed from ignorance that John [the Baptist] was the Christ, but in [the priests and Levites] it was malice, and in this spirit they put the question to him, expecting to draw him over to their purpose by their flattery. If they had not expected this to happen, they would not have proceeded immediately to another question. Instead, they would have been angry with him for giving them an answer outside of what they were asking.… When caught, however, and it was discovered what they had in mind, they proceed to another question: “And they asked him, ‘What then? Are you Elijah?’ ”
