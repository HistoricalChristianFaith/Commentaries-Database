The first of all qualities that a priest or bishop ought to possess is that he must purify his soul entirely of ambition for the office.… The right course, I think, is to have so reverent an estimation of the office as to avoid its responsibility from the start.… But if anyone should cling to a position for which he is not fit, he deprives himself of all pardon and provokes God’s anger the more by adding a second and more serious offense.… It is indeed a terrible temptation to covet this honor. And in saying this, I do not contradict St. Paul but entirely agree with what he says. What are his words? “If a man seeks the office of a bishop, he desires a good work.” What is terrible is to desire the absolute authority and power of the bishop but not the work itself.
