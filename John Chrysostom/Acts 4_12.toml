"Neither is there salvation in any other," Peter says. What wounds, think you, must these words inflict on them! "For there is none other name," he continues, "under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved." Here he utters also lofty words. For when the object is, not to carry some point successfully, but only to show boldness he does not spare; for he was not afraid of striking too deep. Nor does he say simply, "By another;" but, "Neither is there salvation in any other": that is, He is able to save us. In this way he subdued their threatening.

And when there was need to teach, observe how they speak and allege many prophecies; but when the point was to use boldness of speech, then they only speak peremptorily. Thus "Neither," says he, "is there any other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." It is manifest to all, he says, because not to us alone was that Name given; he cites even themselves as witnesses. "For there exists not another name under heaven, whereby we must be saved." This is the language of a soul which has renounced this present life. His exceeding out-spokenness proves here, that when he speaks in lowly terms of Christ, he does it not of fear, but of wise forbearance: but now that it was the fitting time, he speaks not in lowly terms: by this very thing intending to strike dismay into them.
