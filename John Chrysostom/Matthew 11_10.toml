Having before set down the testimony of the Jews, He then applies that of the prophets; or rather, He puts in the first place the sentence of the Jews, which must have been a very strong demonstration, the witness being borne by his enemies; secondly, the man's life; thirdly, His own judgment; fourthly, the prophet; by all means stopping their mouths.

Then lest they should say, But what if at that time indeed he were such an one, but now is changed? He added also what follows; his garments, his prison, and together with these the prophecy.

Hom xxxvii: Sufficient had been now done for John’s disciples; they returned certified concerning Christ by the wonderful works which they had seen. But it behoved that the multitude also should be corrected, which had conceived many things amiss from the question of John’s disciples, not knowing the purpose of John in sending them. They might say, He who bare such witness to Christ, is now of another mind, and doubts whether this be He. Doth he this because hehath jealousy against Jesus! Has the prison taken away his courage? Or spake he before but empty and untrue words?.
They had not gone out at this time into the desert to see John, for he was not now in the deaert, but in prison; but He speaks of the past time while John was yet in the desert, and the people flocked to him.
And note that making no mention of any other fault, He clears John of fickleness, which the multitude had suspected him of, saying, “A reed shaken bythe wind?”.
Having described his habits of life from his dwelling-place, his dress, and the concourse of men to hear him, He now brings in that he is also a prophet, “But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto you, and more than aprophet.”.
Then he shows in what respect He is greater, saying, “This is he of whom it is written, Behold, I send my angel before thy face.”.
He shows wherein it is that John is greater than the Prophets, namely, in that he is nigh unto Christ, as he says, “I send before thy face,” that is, nearThee, as those that walk next to the king’s chariot are more illustrious than others, so likewise is John because of his nearness to Christ.
Also the other Prophets were sent to announce Christ’s coming, but John to prepare His way, as it follows, “who shall make ready thy way before thee;”

But suppose someone might say, “What if John had one opinion earlier but later changed his mind?” This is why Jesus spoke further about his garments, his imprisonment and his role in prophecy. Having said that he is greater than a prophet, Jesus signifies also in what way he is greater. And in what is he greater? In being so very near the One who was to come. For “behold, I send,” he says, “my messenger before your face,” which means in proximity to Messiah. For as with kings, those who ride near the chariot are more illustrious than the rest, just so John also appears in his course near the advent itself.
