“Redeem those who are ready to be slain; spare no effort.” [Solomon] did not say, “Enquire curiously, and learn who they are,” and yet for the most part they who are led away to execution are wicked. This especially is charity. For he that does good to a friend does it not altogether for God’s sake; but he that does good to one unknown acts purely for God’s sake. Do not spare your money; even if it is necessary to spend all, yet give.But we, when we see persons in extreme distress, bewailing themselves, suffering things more grievous than ten thousand deaths, and oftentimes unjustly, we [I say] are sparing of our money and unsparing of our brothers. We are careful of lifeless things but neglect the living soul!
