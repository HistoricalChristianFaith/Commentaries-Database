Observe the piety of the children: they showed no indignation, no anger, no gainsaying, but they came forth … as though they were going forth from heaven itself.… And what the prophet says of the sun, that “he is as a bridegroom going out of his chamber,” so one could also say such a thing of them. But though he [the sun] goes forth [like the bridegroom], yet did they come out with even more glory than he, for he indeed goes forth to enlighten the world with natural light, they to enlighten the world in a different way, I mean, spiritually. For because of them the king immediately issued a decree, “The signs and wonders that the most high God has worked for me I am pleased to recount.” … So they went forth, shedding a yet more glorious radiance, beaming indeed in that very region, even more so by way of the king’s writings, being diffused over the world and thus dispelling the darkness that everywhere prevails.
