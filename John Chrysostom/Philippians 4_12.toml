In everything, says he, and in all things I have learned the secret, i.e. I have had experience of all things in this long time, and these things have all succeeded with me. But since boasting might seem to have a place here, see how quickly he checks up, and says, I can do all things in Christ that strengthens me. The success is not my own, but His who has given me strength. But since they who confer benefits, when they see the receiver not well affected toward them, but despising the gifts, are themselves rendered more remiss, (for they considered themselves as conferring a benefit and refreshment,) if therefore Paul despises the refreshment, they must necessarily become remiss, in order then that this may not happen, see how he heals it again. By what he has said above, he has brought down their proud thoughts, by what follows he makes their readiness revive, by saying, Howbeit ye did well, that you had fellowship with my affliction. Do you see, how he removed himself, and again united himself to them. This is the part of true and spiritual friendship. Think not, says he, because I was not in want, that I had no need of this act of yours. I have need of it for your sake. How then, did they share his afflictions? By this means. As he said when in bonds, You all are partakers with me of grace. Philippians 1:7 For it is grace to suffer for Christ, as he himself says in another place, For to you it is given from God not only to believe in Him, but also to suffer for Him. Philippians 1:29 For since those former words by themselves might have made them regardless, for this cause he consoles them, and receives them, and praises them again. And this in measured words. For he said not, gave, but had fellowship, to show that they too were profited by becoming partakers of his labors. He said not, you did lighten, but you did communicate with my affliction, which was something more elevated. Do you see the humility of Paul? Do you see his noble nature? When he has shown that he had no need of their gifts on his own account, he afterward uses freely such lowly words as they do who make a request; since you are wont to give. For he refuses neither to do, nor say anything. That is, Think not that my words show want of shame, wherein I accuse you, and say, 'Now at length you have revived,' or are those of one in necessity; I speak not thus because I am in need, but why? From my exceeding confidence in you, and of this also ye yourselves are the authors.

Do you see how he soothes them? How are you the authors? In that you hasted to the work before all the others; and have given me confidence to remind you of these things. And observe his elevation; he accuses them not while they did not send, lest he should seem to regard his own benefit, but when they had sent, then he rebuked them for the time past, and they received it, for he could not seem after that to regard his own benefit.

Abundance does not yield either knowledge or virtue. How so? Because just as penury occasions much wrongdoing, so does plenty. Many who have become affluent have become derelict. They do not know how to bear their good fortune. But not so with Paul, for what he received he spent on others. He emptied himself for others.
