He alludes to the prediction addressed to Ananias concerning him at Damascus, when the Lord said, "Go your way, for he is a chosen vessel unto Me, to bear My name before the Gentiles and Kings." [Acts 9:15]

By "dispensation of grace," he means the revelation made to him. As much as to say, I learned it not from man. [Galatians 1:12] He vouchsafed to reveal it even to me, though but an individual for your sakes. For Himself said to me, says he, "Depart, for I will send you forth far hence unto the Gentiles." [Acts 22:21] "If so be that you have heard" for a dispensation it was, a mighty one; to call one, uninfluenced from any other quarter, immediately from above, and to say, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me?" and to strike him blind with that ineffable light! "if so be that you have heard,"  says he, "of the dispensation of that grace of God which was given me to you-ward."

He is hinting at what was said about him in Damascus to Ananias, when the Lord said, “Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the sons of Israel.” By “dispensation of grace” he means the revelation made to him. It is as if he were saying: “I did not learn it from any human. God chose to reveal it to me for your benefit, though I am only an individual.”
