See what a cheering inducement to alms is here! "And all the widows," it says, "stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them." Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it!

"Having washed her," it says, "they laid her in an upper chamber:" that is, they did all that was right for the dead body. Then Peter having come, "knelt down, and prayed; and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, arise." They did not perform all their miracles with the same ease. But this was profitable for them: for truly God took thought not only for the salvation of others, but for their own. He that healed so many by his very shadow, how is it that he now has to do so much first? There are cases also in which the faith of the applicants cooperated.
