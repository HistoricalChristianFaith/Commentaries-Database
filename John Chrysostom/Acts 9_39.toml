Let us not concern ourselves with grave monuments or memorials. This is the greatest memorial: gather the widows around; tell them his name; ask them all to offer prayers and supplications on his behalf. This will overcome God; for although it was not done by the [dead] man himself, it is through him that another is responsible for the almsgiving. This too is of the mercy of God. “Widows standing around and weeping” know how to rescue people not from the present death but from the death that is to come. Many have enjoyed the benefit of these alms performed by others on their behalf. For they found, if not perfect deliverance, at least some consolation.
