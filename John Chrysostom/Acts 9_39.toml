They do not beseech, but leave it to him to give her life (σωτηρίαν.) See what a cheering inducement to alms is here! And all the widows, it says, stood round him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them. Peter went into the apartment, as one who took it calmly, but see what an accession came of it! It is not without a meaning that the Writer has informed us of the woman's name, but to show that the name she bore (φερώνυμος ἦν) matched her character; as active and wakeful was she as an antelope. For in many instances there is a Providence in the giving of names, as we have often told you. She was full, it says, of good works: not only of alms, but of good works, first, and then of this good work in particular. Which, it says, Dorcas made while she was with them. Great humility! Not as we do; but they were all together in common, and in company with them she made these things and worked. But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning him to the body said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.

Let us not concern ourselves with grave monuments or memorials. This is the greatest memorial: gather the widows around; tell them his name; ask them all to offer prayers and supplications on his behalf. This will overcome God; for although it was not done by the [dead] man himself, it is through him that another is responsible for the almsgiving. This too is of the mercy of God. “Widows standing around and weeping” know how to rescue people not from the present death but from the death that is to come. Many have enjoyed the benefit of these alms performed by others on their behalf. For they found, if not perfect deliverance, at least some consolation.
