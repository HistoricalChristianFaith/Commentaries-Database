Who is that other disciple? It is the writer himself. And why doesn’t he name himself? When he lay on the bosom of Jesus, he with reason concealed his name. But now why does he do this? He does it for the same reason. Here also he mentions a deed greatly to his credit, that when all had run away, John followed. Therefore John conceals himself and puts Peter before him. He was obliged to mention himself so that you might understand that he narrates more exactly than the rest what took place in the hall since he was there inside. But observe how he detracts from his own praise. For, in case anyone should ask, “How, when all had retreated, did this man enter in farther than Simon?” he says that he “was known to the high priest,” so that no one should wonder that he followed, or admire him for his courage.
