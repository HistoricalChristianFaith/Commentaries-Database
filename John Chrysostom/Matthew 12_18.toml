The prophet celebrates His meekness, and His unspeakable power, and opens to the Gentiles a great door and effectual; he foretells also the ills that are to overtake the Jews, and signifies His unanimity with the Father. For behold, says He, my servant, whom I have chosen, my beloved, in whom my soul is well pleased. Now if He chose Him, not as an adversary does Christ set aside the law, nor as being an enemy of the lawgiver, but as having the same mind with Him, and the same objects.
