See how this good man foretells everything to him and gives Jacob sufficient support for his comfort by forecasting to him his return and possession of the land and the fact that not only will he grow into a multitude but also that a league of nations will come from his descendants. On hearing this the young man carried out his father’s wishes and traveled to Meso-potamia to his mother’s brother, Laban.… Do you see, dearly beloved, how much perspicacity this loving mother showed in rescuing Jacob from danger by supplying a plausible excuse for his journey, neither highlighting Esau’s wickedness nor revealing the reason to the father but giving appropriate advice to her son so that he might be persuaded through fear to accept what was said by her and propose a convincing plan to his father? Hence the good man went along with what she said and sent Jacob on his way after plying him with his blessings.
