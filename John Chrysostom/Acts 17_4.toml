"And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few." The writer mentions only the sum and substance of the discoursing: he is not given to redundancy, and does not on every occasion report the sermons.

And that they might not think that they did it all by their own strength, but rather that God permitted it, two things resulted, namely, "Some of them were persuaded," and others did the contrary: the Jews moved with envy. And from the fact that the being called was itself a matter of God's fore-ordering, they neither thought great things of themselves as if the triumph were their own, nor were terrified as being responsible for all.

The "devout Greeks" would include such as were Jewish proselytes and such as were worshippers of the true God and attended the synagogue services, without being connected with Judaism. The "first women" were probably female proselytes to Judaism. These heard the Apostle with interest, but the more ardent and fanatical Jews, reinforced by the baser element - the loungers from the market place, made a tumult of opposition.
