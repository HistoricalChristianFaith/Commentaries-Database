“And every transgression or disobedience,” he says. Not this one or that one, but “every” one. Nothing, he says, remained unavenged but “received a just recompense of reward” instead of punishment. Why does he speak like this? Such is the manner of Paul, not to make much account of his phrases but indifferently to put down words of evil sound, even in matters of good meaning. As also in another place he says, “Bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ.” And again he has put “recompense” for punishment, as here he calls punishment “reward.”
