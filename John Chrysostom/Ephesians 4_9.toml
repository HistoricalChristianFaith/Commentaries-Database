Do not suppose when you hear this that he has changed the subject. For his design here is just the same as in the epistle to the Philippians. When he was exhorting them there to be humble he showed them Christ. So he does also here too, showing that even Christ descended to the lowest parts of the earth.

The “lower parts of the earth” here means death, by a human metaphor. … And why does he mention this region here? What sort of captivity is he speaking of? That of the devil. He has taken captive the tyrant, the devil and death, the curse and sin.
