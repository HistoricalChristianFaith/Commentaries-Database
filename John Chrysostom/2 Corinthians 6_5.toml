"In stripes, in imprisonments, in tossings to and fro." Yet every one of these by itself was intolerable, the being scourged only, and being bound only, and being unable through persecution to remain fixed any where, (for this is "in tossings to and fro,") but when both all, and all at once, assail, consider what a soul they need. Then along with the things from without, he mentions those imposed by himself. "In labors, in watchings, in fastings; in pureness." But by "pureness" here, he means either chasteness again, or general purity, or incorruptness, or even his preaching the Gospel freely.
