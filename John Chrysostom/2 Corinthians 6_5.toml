In stripes, in imprisonments, in tossings to and fro. 

Yet every one of these by itself was intolerable, the being scourged only, and being bound only, and being unable through persecution to remain fixed any where, (for this is in 'tossings to and fro,') but when both all, and all at once, assail, consider what a soul they need. Then along with the things from without, he mentions those imposed by himself.

In labors, in watchings, in fastings; in pureness.

But by pureness here, he means either chasteness again, or general purity, or incorruptness, or even his preaching the Gospel freely.

In knowledge. What is in knowledge? In wisdom such as is given from God; that which is truly knowledge; not as those that seem to be wise and boast of their acquaintance with the heathen discipline, but are deficient in this.

In long-suffering, in kindness. For this also is a great note of a noble soul, though exasperated and goaded on every side, to bear all with long-suffering. Then to show whence he became such, he added;

In the Holy Ghost. 'For in Him,' he says, 'we do all these good works.' But observe when it is that he has mentioned the aid of the Holy Ghost. After he had set forth what was from himself. Moreover, he seems to me to say another thing herein. What then is this? Namely, 'we have both been filled with abundance of the Spirit and hereby also give a proof of our Apostleship in that we have been counted worthy of spiritual gifts.' For if this be grace also, yet still he himself was the cause who by his good works and his toils attracted that grace. And if any should assert that besides what has been said, he shows that in his use of the gifts of the Spirit also he gave none offense; he would not miss of his meaning. For they who received the [gift of] tongues among them and were lifted up, were blamed. For it is possible for one even in receiving a gift of the Spirit, not to use it aright. 'But not so we,' he says, 'but in the Spirit also, that is, in the gifts also, we have been blameless.'

In love unfeigned. This was the cause of all those good things; this made him what he was; this caused the Spirit also to abide with him, by Whose aid also all things were rightly done of him.

Any one of these things is intolerable, but taken together, think what kind of soul is needed to endure them!
