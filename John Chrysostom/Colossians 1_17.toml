And He is before all things, he says. This is befitting God. Where is Paul of Samosata? And in Him all things consist, that is, they are created into Him. He repeats these expressions in close sequence; with their close succession, as it were with rapid strokes, tearing up the deadly doctrine by the roots. For, if even when such great things had been declared, still after so long a time Paul of Samosata sprung up, how much more [would such have been the case], had not these things been said before? And in Him, he says, all things consist. How consist in one who was not? So that the things also done through Angels are of Him.
