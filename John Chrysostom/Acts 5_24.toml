And observe, by report of others they are apprised of all the circumstances: they see the prison remaining closed with safety, and the guards standing before the doors. A twofold security is here, as was the case at the sepulcher, having both the seal and the men to watch. See how they fought against God! Say, was this, that befell them, of human doing? Who led them forth when the doors were shut? How did they come out with guards standing before the door? In truth, they must be mad or drunken to talk so. Here are men whom neither prison nor bonds nor closed doors had been able to keep in; and yet they expect to overpower them. Such is their childish folly! Their officers come and confess what has taken place, as if on purpose to debar them from all show of reason. Do you mark how there is miracle upon miracle, differing in kind, some wrought by them, others on them, and these more illustrious than the others?
