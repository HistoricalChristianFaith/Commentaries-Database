Signifying, διαγγέλλων, i.e. καταγγέλλων, publicly notifying: so that it was he who made himself conspicuous. And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia— for (his arrival) most keeps times with theirs — when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men of Israel, help: This is the man, that teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place: and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and has polluted this holy place.

Against this Paul defends himself and shows that he does this not of his choice. How did they persuade him? It was part of the divine plan and condescension on his part. So this was no hindrance to the preaching, since it was they themselves who decided such things. So he does not accuse Peter in any way. For what he himself did here is what Peter did on that occasion when he held his peace and established his doctrine. And he did not say, “But why? It is not necessary to teach those among the Gentiles.” It is not enough that he does not preach so there; he had to do something more to persuade them that you observe the law. Condescension is what it is. Do not be alarmed.
