For it was one thing to take effectual measures for clearing himself, and another to have done these things without the knowledge of any of the parties. It was a step open to no suspicion, the fact of his even bearing the expenses. "Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, signifying the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them." "Signifying," that is, publicly notifying: so that it was he who made himself conspicuous.

"The next day," it says, "he took them:" he deferred it not; for when there is economy in the case, this is the way of it.

But if while preaching the Jewish doctrines, he suffered thus, had he preached the doctrines of the glory of Christ, how would they have endured him? While "purifying himself" he was intolerable, and how should he have been tolerable while preaching? What lay ye to his charge? What have ye heard? He spoke nothing of the kind. He was simply seen, and he exasperated all against him. Well might he then be set apart for the Gentiles: well might he be sent afar off: there also destined to discourse to the Gentiles.
