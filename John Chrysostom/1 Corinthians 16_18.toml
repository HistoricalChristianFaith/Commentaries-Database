"For they refreshed my spirit and yours."

Thus, since it was natural for them to be greatly irritated against these persons, for it was they who had come and showed him all about the division, inasmuch as by them also they had written the questions about the virgins, and about the married persons:â€” mark how he softened them down; both in the beginning of his Epistle by saying, "For it has been signified unto me by them which are of the house of Chloe;" thus at once concealing these and bringing forward the others: (for it should seem that the latter had given their information by means of the former:) and in this place again, "They have supplied your lack, and refreshed my spirit and yours:" signifying that they had come instead of all, and had chosen to undertake so great a journey on their behalf. How then may this, their peculiar praise, become common? "If you will solace me for what was wanting on your part by your kindness towards them; if you will honor, if you will receive, them, if you will communicate with them in doing good." Wherefore he says, "Acknowledge ye then them that are such." And while praising those that came, he embraces also the others in his praise, the senders together with the sent: where he says, "'They refreshed my spirit and yours, therefore acknowledge such as these,' because for your sakes they left country and home." Do you perceive his consideration? He implies that they had obliged not Paul only, but the Corinthians likewise, in that they bore about in themselves the whole city. A thing which both added credit to them, and did not allow the others to sever themselves from them, inasmuch as in their persons they had presented themselves to Paul.

It is obvious that these must have been the people who told Paul about the situation in Corinth, and no doubt the Corinthians would not have thanked them for it. This is why Paul praises them and urges the Corinthians to show them honor and respect.
