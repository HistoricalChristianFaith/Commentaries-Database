If the old law had belonged to the devil, it would not have led people away from idolatry. Rather, it would have drawn them on and cast them into it, for this is the devil’s desire. But now we see the opposite effect produced by the old law. And indeed this very thing, the oath, was ordained of old for this cause: that they might not swear by the idols. “You shall swear,” said he, “by the true God.” There were then no small advantages that the law effected, but rather very great. That they came to the “strong meat” was the work of its care.
