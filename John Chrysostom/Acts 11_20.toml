And they did not say, (What), we, Cyrenians and Cyprians, to attack this splendid and great city! but trusting in the grace of God, they applied themselves to the work of teaching, nor did these (Gentiles) themselves think scorn to learn anything of them. Mark how by small means all is brought about: mark the preaching how it spreads: mark those in Jerusalem, having like care for all, holding the whole world as one house. They heard that Samaria had received the word, and Acts 8:14 to Samaria they send the Apostles: they heard what had befallen at Antioch, and to Antioch they send Barnabas: they also send again, and (these) prophets. For the distance was great, and it was not meet the Apostles at present should separate from thence, that they might not be thought to be fugitives, and to have fled from their own people. But then, almost precisely, is the time of their parting from Jerusalem, when the state (of the Jews) was shown to be past remedy, when the war was close at hand, and they must needs perish: when the sentence was made absolute. For, until Paul went to Rome, the Apostles were there (at Jerusalem). But they depart, not because afraid of the war— how should it be so?— seeing those they went to, were those that should bring the war: and moreover the war breaks out only after the Apostles were dead. For of them (the Apostles) says, The wrath has come upon them unto the end. 1 Thessalonians 2:16 The more insignificant the persons, the more illustrious the grace, working great results by small means.— And he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord, for he was a good man. (v. 23, 24.) By good man, I take it, he means one that is kind, (χρηστὸν) sincere, exceedingly desirous of the salvation of his neighbors— for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Ghost and of faith. To cleave unto the Lord with purpose of heart (this is said): with encomium and praise. And much people was added unto the Lord: for like rich land this city received the word, and brought forth much fruit. Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, etc.

Probably it was because of their not knowing Hebrew, that they called them Greeks. And when Barnabas, it says, came and had seen the grace of God,— not the diligence of men— he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord

for it is likely both that they could now speak Greek, and that there were such men in Antioch. And the hand of the Lord, it says, was with them, that is, they wrought miracles; and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
