"But some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus:" for it is likely both that they could now speak Greek, and that there were such men in Antioch.

"But there were in Antioch certain men of Cyprus and Cyrene:" these, of all others, least cared for the Jews: "who spake unto the Greeks, preaching the Lord Jesus." Probably it was because of their not knowing Hebrew, that they called them Greeks. And they did not say, "What, we, Cyrenians and Cyprians, to attack this splendid and great city!" but trusting in the grace of God, they applied themselves to the work of teaching, nor did these Gentiles themselves think scorn to learn anything of them.
