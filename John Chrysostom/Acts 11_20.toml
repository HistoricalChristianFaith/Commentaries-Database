Probably it was because of their not knowing Hebrew, that they called them Greeks. And when Barnabas, it says, came and had seen the grace of God,— not the diligence of men— he exhorted them to cleave unto the Lord

for it is likely both that they could now speak Greek, and that there were such men in Antioch. And the hand of the Lord, it says, was with them, that is, they wrought miracles; and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.

Look! Not even in tribulation did they succumb to lamentations and tears, as we do, but dedicated themselves to a great and good work and preached the word even more undaunted. They did not ask, “Should we, who are Cyrenians and Cyprians, attack so splendid and great a city?” Instead, trusting in the grace of God, they applied themselves to the work of teaching, and the Gentiles themselves did not disdain to learn from them. Notice how all these things were accomplished through small means; how the preaching grew; and how, similar to those in Jerusalem, they bestowed their care on everyone, treating the entire world as a single household.
