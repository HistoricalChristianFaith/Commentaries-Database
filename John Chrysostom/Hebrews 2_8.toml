"What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that Thou visitest him? You made him a little lower than the angels: You crowned him with glory and honor."  [Hebrews 2:8] "You have put all things in subjection under his feet."

Now although these things were spoken of human nature generally, they would nevertheless apply more properly to Christ according to the flesh. For this, "You have put all things in subjection under his feet," belongs to Him rather than to us.  For the Son of God visited us when we were nothing: and after having assumed our [nature],  and united it to Himself, He became higher than all.

"For," he says, "in that He has put all things in subjection under Him, He left nothing not put under Him: but now we see not yet all things put under Him." What he means is this:— since he had said, "Until I make Your enemies Your footstool" [Hebrews 1:13] — and it was likely that they would still be grieved — then having inserted a few things after this parenthetically, he added this testimony in confirmation of the former. For that they might not say, How is it that He has put His enemies under His feet, when we have suffered so much? He sufficiently hinted at it in the former place indeed (for the word "until" showed, not what should take place immediately, but in course of time) but here he follows it up. For do not suppose (he says) that because they have not yet been made subject, they are not to be made subject: for that they must be made subject, is evident; for, on this account was the prophecy spoken. "For," he says, "in that He has put all things under Him, He left nothing not put under Him." How then is it that all things have not been put under Him? Because they are hereafter to be put under Him.

If then all things must be made subject to Him, but have not yet been made subject, do not grieve, nor trouble yourself. If indeed when the end had come, and all things were made subject, thou were still suffering these things, with reason would you repine: "But now we see not yet all things put under Him." The King has not yet clearly conquered. Why then are you troubled when suffering affliction? The preaching [of the Gospel] has not yet prevailed over all; it is not yet time that they should be altogether made subject.

He said, “Until I make your enemies your footstool.” But it was likely that his hearers would still be grieved … so he added this testimony in confirmation of the subjection. That they might not say, “How is it that he has put his enemies under his feet, when we have suffered so much?” He did … hint at this in the former place, for the word until showed not what should take place immediately, but over the course of time. Nevertheless, here he follows it up. For do not suppose, he says, that because they have not yet been made subject, they are not to be made subject; for that they must be made subject is evident. It is on this account that the prophecy was spoken. “For,” he says, “in that he has put all things under him, he left nothing not put under him.” How then is it that all things have not been put under him? Because they are hereafter to be put under him.
