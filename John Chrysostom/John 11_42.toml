Who ever prayed like Jesus did? Even before uttering any petition, he says, “I thank you that you have heard me,” demonstrating that he did not need prayer. He goes on to say, “And I knew that you always hear me,” not as though he himself were powerless but to show that his will and the Father’s are one. But then why did he pray? He says he did so “for the sake of the people standing by so that they may believe that you have sent me.” … All but saying, If I had been an enemy of God, what is done would not have succeeded.
