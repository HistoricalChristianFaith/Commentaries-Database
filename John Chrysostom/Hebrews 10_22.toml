Having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience. He shows that not faith only, but a virtuous life also is required, and the consciousness to ourselves of nothing evil. Since the holy of holies does not receive with full assurance those who are not thus disposed. For they are holy, and the holy of holies; but here no profane person enters. They were sprinkled as to the body, we as to the conscience, so that we may even now be sprinkled over with virtue itself. And having our body washed with pure water. Here he speaks of the Washing, which no longer cleanses the bodies, but the soul.
