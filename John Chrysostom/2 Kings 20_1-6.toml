For which of the things in our present life seems to you pleasant? A sumptuous table, and health of body, and glory and wealth? No, these delights, if you set them by that pleasure, will prove the bitterest of all things, compared with what is to come. For nothing is more pleasurable than a sound conscience and a good hope. And if you would learn this, let us inquire of him who is on the point of departing hence or of him that is grown old; and when we have reminded him of sumptuous banqueting that he had enjoyed, and of glory and honor and of good works that he had some time practiced and wrought, let us ask in which he exults the more; and we shall see him for the other ashamed and covering his face but for these soaring and leaping with joy. So Hezekiah, too, when he was sick, called not to mind sumptuous feasting or glory or royalty but righteousness. For “remember,” he said, “how I walked before you in an upright way.”
