Knowing therefore the fear of the Lord, we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God; and I hope that we are made manifest also in your consciences.

Knowing therefore, he says, these things, that terrible seat of judgment, we do every thing so as not to give you a handle nor offense, nor any false suspicion of evil practice against us. Do you see the strictness of life, and zeal of a watchful soul? 'For we are not only open to accusation,' he says 'if we commit any evil deed; but even if we do not commit, yet are suspected, and having it in our power to repel the suspicion, brave it, we are punished.'

It is because he knows the judgment which is to come that Paul does everything he can to avoid giving offense in his ministry to the Corinthians.
