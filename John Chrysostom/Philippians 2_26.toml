See how earnestly Paul tries to forestall any tendencies toward lethargy or selfishness. He quickly removes the suspicion that it was through lack of concern for them that he did not come. For nothing is such a stimulus to progress in disciples as the conviction that their master truly cares about them. Paul shows that he feels sorrow on their behalf. This is a sign of his exceptional quality of love.
