“And when the angel that spoke to Cornelius had left, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually; and when he had declared all these things to them, he sent them to Joppa.” Do you see that it is not without purpose that the writer says this? [It shows] that those also “who waited on him continually” were such as he. “And when he had declared the whole matter to them,” observe the unassuming character of the man: for he does not say, “Call Peter to me,” but in order also to induce him to come, he declared the whole matter. This was so ordered by Providence, for he did not choose to use the authority of his rank to fetch Peter to him; therefore “he declared the matter;” such was the moderation of the man. And yet no great notion was to be formed of one lodging with a tanner.
