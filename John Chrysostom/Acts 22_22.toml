"And they lifted up their voices," it says, "and said, Away with him: it is not fit that this fellow should live." Nay, ye are the persons not fit to live; not he, who in everything obeys God. The Jews would not endure to hear out all his harangue, but excessively fired by their wrath, they shouted, it says, "Away with him; for it is not fit that he should live."

The words, "I will send thee to the Gentiles," were those at which the Jews took offence. That a word should come from heaven to Paul in the Temple, commanding him to leave the chosen people and the Holy City and go to the uncircumcised heathen, was a statement verging upon blasphemy. This admission they would regard as proof of Paul's apostasy from Moses. It implied that he regarded the heathen as standing upon the same plane as themselves. The thought roused all their native bigotry. Beyond "this word" they would not hear him, nor did they think that one who should so estimate the privileges and character of the Jews as compared with the Gentiles was fit to live.
