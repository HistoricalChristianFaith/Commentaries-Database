High magnanimity! He shows them too that they are fighting against God. For, he says, Whom you killed, Him has God raised up. The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, Whom you slew and hanged on a tree. Him has God exalted with His right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins. (v. 30, 31.) And again they refer the whole to the Father, that He should not seem to be alien to the Father. And has exalted, says He, with his right hand. He affirms not merely the Resurrection, but the Exaltation also. For to give repentance to Israel. Observe here as before the gain (to them): observe the perfection of doctrine conveyed in the form of apology.
