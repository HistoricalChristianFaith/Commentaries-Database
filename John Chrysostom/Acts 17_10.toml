Why didn’t they stay? Why didn’t they perform miracles? For if he stayed a long time where he was stoned (i.e., at Lystra), all the more could he have stayed here. What was the reason then? Because God did not always want them to perform miracles. For it is no less a miracle for them, persecuted as they are, to prevail without performing miracles. Therefore, just as now he prevails without miracles, often then he wished to prevail in the same way. And so the apostles did not chase after miracles either, as he himself says, “We preach Christ crucified.” To those who seek miracles, to those who seek wisdom, we offer this, which is not able to persuade even with miracles, and we persuade them. This is a great miracle.
