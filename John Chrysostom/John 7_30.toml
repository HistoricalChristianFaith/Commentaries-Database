Do you see that they are invisibly restrained, and their anger bridled? But wherefore says It not, that He had restrained them invisibly, but, Because His hour was not yet come? The Evangelist was minded to speak more humanly and in a lowlier strain, so that Christ might be deemed to be also Man. For because Christ everywhere speaks of sublime matters, he therefore intersperses expressions of this kind. And when Christ says, I am from Him, He speaks not as a Prophet who learns, but as seeing Him, and being with Him.

His saying, however, “Whom you know not,” irritated the Jews, who professed to have knowledge. “And they sought to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.” Mark the invisible check that is kept on their fury, though the Evangelist does not mention it but preserves purposely a humble and human way of speaking in order to impress us with Christ’s humanity. Therefore, he only adds, “Because his hour was not yet come.”
