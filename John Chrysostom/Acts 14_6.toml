They went away into the country, not into the cities only.â€” Observe both the simplicity of the Gentiles, and the malignity of the Jews. By their actions they showed that they were worthy to hear: they so honored them from the miracles only. The one sort honored them as gods, the other persecuted them as pestilent fellows: and (those) not only did not take offense at the preaching, but what say they? The gods, in the likeness of men, have come down to us; but the Jews were offended. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius.
