"Who in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears, to Him that was able to save Him from death, and was heard in that He feared." Seest thou that he sets forth nothing else than His care and the exceeding greatness of His love? For what means the expression "with strong crying"? The Gospel nowhere says this, nor that He wept when He prayed, nor yet that He uttered a cry. Seest thou that it was a condescension? For he could not merely say that He prayed, but also "with strong crying."

Be it with "crying," why also "strong crying and tears"?

"Having offered," (he says), "and having been heard in that He feared." What sayest thou? Let the Heretics be ashamed. The Son of God "was heard in that He feared." And what more could any man say concerning the prophets? And what sort of connection is there, in saying, "He was heard in that He feared, though He were Son, yet learned He obedience by the things which He suffered"? Would any man say these things concerning God? Why, who was ever so mad? And who, even if he were beside himself, would have uttered these things? "Having been heard," (he says), "in that He feared, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered." What obedience? He that before this had been obedient even unto death, as a Son to His Father, how did He afterwards learn? Seest thou that this is spoken concerning the Incarnation?

Tell me now, did He pray the Father that He might be saved from death? And was it for this cause that He was "exceeding sorrowful, and said, If it be possible, let this cup pass from Me"? Yet He nowhere prayed the Father concerning His resurrection, but on the contrary He openly declares, "Destroy this temple and within three days I will raise it up." And, "I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. No man taketh it from Me, I lay it down of Myself." What then is it; why did He pray? And again He said, "Behold we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man shall be betrayed unto the chief priests and scribes, and they shall condemn Him to death. And they shall deliver Him to the Gentiles, to mock, and to scourge, and to crucify Him; and the third day He shall rise again" and said not, "My Father shall raise Me up again." How then did He pray concerning this? But for whom did He pray? For those who believed on Him.

And what he means is this, "He is readily listened to." For since they had not yet the right opinion concerning Him, he said that He was heard. Just as He Himself also when consoling His disciples said, "If ye loved Me, ye would rejoice, because I go to My Father", and "My Father is greater than I." But how did He not glorify Himself, He who "made Himself of no reputation", He who gave Himself up? For, it is said, "He gave Himself" up "for our sins." And again, "Who gave Himself a ransom for us all." What is it then? Thou seest that it is in reference to the flesh that lowly things are spoken concerning Himself: So also here, "Although He were Son, He was heard in that He feared," it is said. He wishes to show, that the success was of Himself, rather than of God's favor. So great (he says) was His reverence, that even on account thereof God had respect unto Him.
