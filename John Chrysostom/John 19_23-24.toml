(Hom. lxxxv) The Evangelist describes the tunic, to show that it was of an inferior kind, the tunics commonly worn in Palestine being made of two pieces.

(Hom. lxxxv) Behold the sureness of prophecy. The Prophet foretold not only what they would part, but what they would not. They parted the raiment, but cast lots for the vesture.

(Hom. lxxxv. 1) According to some, The tunic without seam, woven from above throughout, is an allegory showing that He who was crucified was not simply man, but also had Divinity from above.
