The point is not that the bishop cannot be a young man but that he must not be a new convert.… For if youth only was an objection, why did he himself appoint Timothy, a young man?… But since there were many then who came over from heathen cultures to be baptized, Paul says, “Do not immediately advance to a station of dignity a novice, that is, one of these new converts.” For, if even before he has proved himself as a disciple he is made a teacher, he will soon be lifted up into insolence.

Indeed, nothing so estranges from the mercy of God and gives over to the fire of hell as the tyranny of pride.… Therefore, let us check this puffing up of the soul, and let us cut out this tumor, if we wish to be pure and be rid of the punishment prepared for the devil. Listen to Paul declaring that the proud must suffer those very penalties: “Not a new convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and incur the condemnation passed on the devil.”
