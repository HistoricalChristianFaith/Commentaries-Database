Ver. 6. "Not a novice."  He does not say, not a young man, but not a new convert. For he had said, "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase." [1 Corinthians 3:6] Wishing them to point out such an one, he used this word. For, otherwise, what hindered him from saying, "Not a young man"? For if youth only was an objection, why did he himself appoint Timothy, a young man? (and this he proves by saying to him, "Let no man despise your youth.") [1 Timothy 4:12] Because  he was aware of his great virtue, and his great strictness of life. Knowing which he writes, "From a child you have learned the holy Scriptures." [2 Timothy 3:15] And that he practiced intense fasting is proved by the words, "Use a little wine for your frequent infirmities"; which he wrote to him among other things, as, if he had not known of such good works of his, he would not have written, nor given any such charge to his disciple. But as there were many then who came over from the Heathen, and were baptized, he says, "Do not immediately advance to a station of dignity a novice, that is, one of these new converts." For, if before he had well been a disciple, he should at once be made a Teacher, he would be lifted up into insolence. If before he had learned to be under rule, he should be appointed one of the rulers, he would be puffed up: therefore he adds, "Lest being lifted up with pride, he fall into the condemnation of the devil," that is, into the same condemnation which Satan incurred by his pride.

The point is not that the bishop cannot be a young man but that he must not be a new convert.… For if youth only was an objection, why did he himself appoint Timothy, a young man?… But since there were many then who came over from heathen cultures to be baptized, Paul says, “Do not immediately advance to a station of dignity a novice, that is, one of these new converts.” For, if even before he has proved himself as a disciple he is made a teacher, he will soon be lifted up into insolence.

Indeed, nothing so estranges from the mercy of God and gives over to the fire of hell as the tyranny of pride.… Therefore, let us check this puffing up of the soul, and let us cut out this tumor, if we wish to be pure and be rid of the punishment prepared for the devil. Listen to Paul declaring that the proud must suffer those very penalties: “Not a new convert, lest he be puffed up with pride and incur the condemnation passed on the devil.”
