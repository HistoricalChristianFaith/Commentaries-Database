4. "For it became Him, for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." He speaks here of the Father. Do you see how again he applies the [expression] "by whom"  to Him? Which he would not have done, had it been [an expression] of inferiority, and only applicable to the Son. And what he says is this:— He has done what is worthy of His love towards mankind, in showing His First-born to be more glorious than all, and in setting Him forth as an example to the others, like some noble wrestler that surpasses the rest.

"The Captain of their salvation," that is, the Cause of their salvation. Do you see how great is the space between? Both He is a Son, and we are sons; but He saves, we are saved. Do you see how He both brings us together and then separates us; "bringing," he says, "many sons unto glory": here he brings us together —"the Captain of their salvation," again he separates.

"To make perfect through sufferings."  Then sufferings are a perfecting, and a cause of salvation. Do you see that to suffer affliction is not the portion of those who are utterly forsaken; if indeed it was by this that God first honored His Son, by leading Him through sufferings? And truly His taking flesh to suffer what He did suffer, is a far greater thing than making the world, and bringing it out of things that are not. This indeed also is [a token] of His loving-kindness, but the other far more. And [the Apostle] himself also pointing out this very thing, says, "That in the ages to come He might show forth the exceeding riches of His goodness, He both raised us up together, and made us sit together in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus." [Ephesians 2:7]

"For it became Him for whom are all things and by whom are all things in bringing many sons to glory, to make the Captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings." For (he means) it became Him who takes tender care, and brought all things into being, to give up the Son for the salvation of the rest, the One for the many. However he did not express himself thus, but, "to make perfect through sufferings," showing the suffering for any one, not merely profits "him," but he himself also becomes more glorious and more perfect. And this too he says in reference to the faithful, comforting them by the way: for Christ was glorified then when He suffered. But when I say, He was glorified, do not suppose that there was an accession of glory to Him: for that which is of nature He always had, and received nothing in addition.

By saying “to make perfect through suffering,” he shows that the one who suffers for someone not only helps him but becomes himself more glorious and more perfect.… But when I say he was glorified, do not suppose there was an addition of glory to him; for he always had that glory by nature and received nothing in addition.

Sufferings are a perfecting and a cause of salvation. Do you see that to suffer affliction is not the fate of those who are utterly forsaken, if indeed it was by leading him through sufferings that God first honored his Son? And truly, his taking flesh to suffer what he suffered is a far greater thing than creating the world out of things that are not. This is indeed a token of his lovingkindness, but the other far more.

God has done what is worthy of God’s love toward humankind in showing the firstborn to be more glorious than all and in setting him forth as an example to the others, like some noble wrestler who surpasses the rest.Paul says, “The pioneer of their salvation,” that is, the cause of their salvation. Do you see what a vast difference there is between the two? He is a Son, and we are sons and daughters; but he saves, and we are saved. Do you see how Paul both brings us together and then separates us? By saying, “bringing many sons to glory,” he brings us together; by saying, “the pioneer of their salvation,” he separates us.
