For Job said, in fact, that a change was impossible: “If I wash myself with snow [that will be of no use], you have deeply plunged me into the mire.” That is why Zophar says, “Your face will shine again like pure water.” The whole of Zophar’s reflections is certainly excellent. The fact, however, that he incessantly repeats that Job’s faults have caused his misfortunes is undoubtedly wrong. It is as though Zophar wanted to exhort Job to be converted to virtue, while he was not in sin at all. To say such things demonstrates Zophar’s ignorance and the fact that he understood nothing.
