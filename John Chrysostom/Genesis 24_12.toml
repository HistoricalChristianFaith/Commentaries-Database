“Lord,” he says, “the God of my master Abraham, be my guide today, and have compassion on my master Abraham,” as if to say, “Bring his wishes to effect, and conduct everything according to his intention.” “Have compassion on my master Abraham”: what does “have compassion” mean? Fulfill his desire. Then he said, “Lo, I am standing at the spring, and the daughters of the inhabitants of the city are coming out to draw water. Whichever maiden to whom I say, ‘Lower your water jar that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink and I shall water your camels till they all stop drinking’—let her be the one you have prepared for your servant Isaac, and in this I shall know that you have had compassion on my master Abraham.” Note the servant’s sagacity. He was aware of the patriarch’s hospitality and the fact that the maiden destined to be brought there should have similar qualities to those of the good man. So, far from looking for any other indication, he was anxious to distinguish the maiden’s hospitality from her attitude. He said, “If, in response to my request to her for water, she lowers her water jar and not only heeds my request but also gives evidence of the generosity of her own attitude by saying, ‘I will water your camels as well,’ she will have given me sufficient demonstration of the mildness of her manners by the offer of water.”

Consider, in fact, I ask you, dearly beloved, how important it was that a tender maiden while drawing water not only did not decline the request but also took down the water jar from her shoulders and gave the petitioner his fill, stranger though he was and quite unknown to her. She gave water not only to him but also to all the camels, thus betraying by her behavior indications of her nobility of soul. Did she not realize that many, men included, often decline such requests? Why do I refer to the gift of water? Sometimes, when people holding torches are asked by those approaching them to wait a while so as to allow a lamp to be lit, they refuse even to do this, despite the fire’s suffering no diminution even should those intending to light their torch be beyond count. In this case, on the contrary, a woman, a maiden, carrying a water jar on her shoulders, not only did not object to the request but even was more generous than the request in supplying the drink, hurrying of her own volition to water the camels as well.
