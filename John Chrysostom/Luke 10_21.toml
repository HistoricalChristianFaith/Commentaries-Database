The proof that the Son knows the Father perfectly rests on the fact that he is “the one who is from God.” The Son has clear knowledge of the Father, because he is from God. The fact that he is from God is a sign and indication that he knows him clearly. An inferior essence would not be able to have clear knowledge of a superior essence, even if the difference between them were slight.
