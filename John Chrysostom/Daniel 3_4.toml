See how the struggles are so difficult, how irresistible is the snare, how deep the valley, and a precipice on either hand. But be not afraid. By whatever means the enemy increases his machinations, so much the more does he make evident the courage of the young men. For this reason is there this symphony of so many musicians; for this reason the burning furnace; in order that both pleasure and fear might attack the souls of those gathered.â€¦ Thus was fear as well as pleasure present; the one entering to assault the soul by way of the ears, the other by the eyes. But the noble character of these youths was not by any such means to be conquered.
