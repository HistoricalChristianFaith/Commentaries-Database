Paul is not boasting. All he is doing is writing facts which the Corinthians themselves would acknowledge to be true.

"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge."

For since he spoke great things of himself and seemed to be bearing witness to himself, an odious thing, he again appeals to them as witnesses of what he says. Â For, he says, let no one think that what I say is a boastful flourish of writing; for we declare unto you what yourselves know; and that we lie not ye more than all others can bear us witness. For, when you read, you acknowledge that what ye know that we perform in our actions, this we say also in our writings, and your testimony does not contradict our epistles; but the knowledge which you had before of us is in harmony with your reading.
