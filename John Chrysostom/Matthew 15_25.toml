For whereas before this she had not ventured so much as to come in sight (for she cries, it is said, after us), when one might expect that she should rather depart further off in utter despair, at that very time she comes nearer, and worships, saying, Lord, help me. Matthew 15:25

What is this, O woman? Have you then greater confidence than the apostles? More abundant strength? Confidence and strength, says she, by no means; nay, I am even full of shame. Yet nevertheless my very shamelessness do I put forward for entreaty; He will respect my confidence. And what is this? Heardest thou not Him saying, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel? I heard, says she, but He Himself is Lord. Wherefore neither did she say, Entreat and beseech, but, Help me.
