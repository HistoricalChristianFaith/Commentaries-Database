See how he refers to the Father again when he speaks of punishment. He did not say, “the wrath of the Son,” although the Son is the judge. Rather, he makes the Father the judge in order to alarm them more. He does not mean here that to believe on the Son says everything that needs to be said concerning gaining everlasting life, for elsewhere he says, “Not every one that says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter into the kingdom of heaven.” And the blasphemy against the Holy Spirit is of itself sufficient to send someone into hell.… But we must not think that even a right belief in Father, Son and Holy Spirit is all there is to salvation … for our [faith] also has need of a good life and conversation. Knowing then that the greater part are not moved so much by the promise of good, as by the threat of punishment, he concludes, “But he that believes not the Son shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him.” … And he does not say “in him” but “on him,” meaning that the wrath will never depart from him. And for the same reason he says, “shall not see life,” that is, to show that he did not mean only a temporal death!
