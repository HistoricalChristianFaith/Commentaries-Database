"But if any man think that he behaveth himself unseemly toward his virgin."

Here he seems to be talking about marriage; but all that he says relates to virginity; for he allows even a second marriage, saying, "only in the Lord." Now what means, "in the Lord?" With chastity, with honor: for this is needed everywhere, and must be pursued for else we cannot see God.
