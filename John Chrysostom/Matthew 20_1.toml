Then He adds also a parable, as training those who had fallen short to a great forwardness.

What is to us the intent of this parable? For the beginning does not harmonize with what is said at the end, but intimates altogether the contrary. For in the first part He shows all enjoying the same, and not some cast out, and some brought in; yet He Himself both before the parable and after the parable said the opposite thing. That the first shall be last, and the last first, that is, before the very first, those not continuing first, but having become last. For in proof that this is His meaning, He added, Many are called, but few chosen, so as doubly both to sting the one, and to soothe and urge on the other.

But the parable says not this, but that they shall be equal to them that are approved, and have labored much. For you have made them equal unto us, it is said, that have borne the burden and heat of the day.

What then is the meaning of the parable? For it is necessary to make this first clear, and then we shall clear up that other point. By a vineyard He means the injunctions of God and His commandments: by the time of laboring, the present life: by laborers, them that in different ways are called to the fulfillment of the injunctions: by early in the morning, and about the third and ninth and eleventh hours, them who at different ages have drawn near to God, and approved themselves.
