When he spoke of the heavens, Isaiah said, “It is he who set up the heaven as a vaulted chamber and stretched it out as a tent over the earth.” And he said of the earth, “It is he that comprehends the circle of the earth and made the earth as if it were nothing,” even though the earth is so great and vast.… Despite the fact that the earth is so great and so vast, God made it with such ease that the prophet could find no fitting example. So he said that God made the earth “as if it were nothing.”
