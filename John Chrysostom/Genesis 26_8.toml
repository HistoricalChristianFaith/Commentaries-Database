Now Isaac was there a long time. Abimelech looked out of the window and saw him fondling his wife, Rebekah; he summoned him and said to him, “So she is your wife? Why did you say, ‘She is my sister?’ ” Since the good man was unmasked by this evidence, instead of dissembling any further, he admitted it and gave a clear explanation of why he brought himself to call her his sister. He said, “I was afraid I might be killed on her account; the fear of death drove me to this extreme.”Perhaps, however, he had been forewarned, since Isaac’s father too had saved his own life by devising such a stratagem, and, for this reason, Isaac followed the same path. The king, however, had a lively memory of what he had suffered in the case of the patriarch for abducting Sarah, and at once he admitted his liability to punishment from on high by saying to him, “Why did you do it? Some one of my people could easily have slept with your wife, whereas you would have had us be in ignorance.” This deception, he is saying, we have already undergone at the hands of your father, and in the present case had we not quickly come upon the truth, we were on the verge of undergoing the same. “You would have let us be in ignorance.” You see, that time too they were on the verge of sinning through ignorance, and this time you were within a hairsbreadth of causing us to fall into sin out of ignorance.
