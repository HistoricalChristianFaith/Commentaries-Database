“When every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people, saying, ‘This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you.’ ” Tell me then, why is the book of the covenant sprinkled and also the people, except on account of the precious blood, figured from the first? Why “with hyssop”? It is close and retentive? And why the “water”? It shows forth also the cleansing by water. And why the “wool”? This also was used, that the blood might be retained. In this place blood and water show forth the same thing, for baptism is his passion. “And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship. Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.” Why the “almost”? Why did he qualify it? Because those ordinances were not a perfect purification or a perfect forgiveness of sins, but [they were] half-complete and in a very small degree. But in this case he says, “This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.”Where then is “the book”? He purified their minds. They themselves then were the books of the new covenant. But where are “the vessels used in worship”? They are themselves. And where is “the tabernacle”? Again, they are; for “I will live in them,” he says, “and move among them.”
