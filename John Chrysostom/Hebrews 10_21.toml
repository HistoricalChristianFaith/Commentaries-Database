Let us draw near (he says) with a true heart. To what should we draw near? To the holy things, the faith, the spiritual service. With a true heart, in full assurance of faith, since nothing is seen; neither the priest henceforward, nor the sacrifice, nor the altar. And yet neither was that priest visible, but stood within, and they all without, the whole people. But here not only has this taken place, that the priest has entered into the holy of holies, but that we also enter in. Therefore he says, in full assurance of faith. For it is possible for the doubter to believe in one way, as there are even now many who say, that of some there is a resurrection and of others not. But this is not faith. In full assurance of faith (he says); for we ought to believe as concerning things that we see, nay, even much more; for here it is possible to be deceived in the things that are seen, but there not: here we trust to the senses, but there to the Spirit.
