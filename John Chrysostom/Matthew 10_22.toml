The courts of justice will go against you. Kings will assail you, as will governors, the synagogues of the Jews and the magistrates of the Gentiles. Both rulers and ruled will combat you. He was preparing them not only for what was to befall them in Palestine but also throughout the world. For they were soon to be sent to the Gentiles with this same proclamation. In doing so they would find that the whole world opposes them. In this spiritual warfare all that dwell upon the earth, all peoples, tyrants and kings, will be arrayed against them.
