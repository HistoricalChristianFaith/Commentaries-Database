This was a proof of the genuineness of his resurrection, that after many days he both lived and ate. And Martha ministered; whence it is clear that the meal was in her house, for they received Jesus as loving and beloved. Some, however, say, that it took place in the house of another. Mary did not minister, for she was a disciple. Here again she acted in the more spiritual manner. For she did not minister as being invited, nor did she afford her services to all alike. But she directs  the honor to Him alone, and approaches Him not as a man, but as a God. On this account she poured out the ointment,  and wiped (His feet) with the hairs of her head, which was the action of one who did not entertain the same opinion concerning Him as did others; yet Judas rebuked her, under the pretense forsooth of carefulness. What then says Christ? She has done a good work for My burying.  But why did He not expose the disciple in the case of the woman, nor say to him what the Evangelist has declared, that on account of his own thieving he rebuked her? In His abundant longsuffering He wished to bring him to a better mind.  For because He knew that he was a traitor, He from the beginning often rebuked him, saying, Not all believe, and, One of you is a devil. John 6:64 He showed them that He knew him to be a traitor, yet He did not openly rebuke him, but bare with him, desiring to recall him. How then says another Evangelist, that all the disciples used these words? Matthew 26:70 All used them, and so did he, but the others not with like purpose. And if any one ask why He put the bag of the poor in the hands of a thief, and made him steward who was a lover of money, we would reply, that God knows the secret reason; but that, if we may say something by conjecture, it was that He might cut off from him all excuse. For he could not say that he did this thing  from love of money, (for he had in the bag sufficient to allay his desire,) but from excessive wickedness which Christ wished to restrain, using  much condescension towards him. Wherefore He did not even rebuke him as stealing, although aware of it, stopping the way to his wicked desire, and taking from him all excuse. Let her alone, He says, for against the day of My burying has she done  this. Again, He makes mention of the traitor in speaking of His burial. But him the reproof reaches not, nor does the expression soften  him, though sufficient to inspire him with pity: as if He had said, I am burdensome and troublesome, but wait a little while, and I shall depart. This too he intended in saying,
