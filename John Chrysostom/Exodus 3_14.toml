Moreover, do you wish to learn about his eternity? Listen to what Moses said about the Father. When he had inquired what he should answer if he should be asked by the Egyptians who it was that had sent him, he was bidden to say, “He who is sent me.” Now the words “he who is” mean that he exists always and is without beginning and that he really exists and exists as Lord and Master.
