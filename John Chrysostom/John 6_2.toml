"A great multitude followed Him beholding the miracles that He did." What is here told marks not a very wise state of mind; for when they had enjoyed such teaching, they still were more attracted by the miracles, which was a sign of the grosser state. For "miracles," It saith, "are not for believers, but for unbelievers." The people described by Matthew acted not thus, but how? They all, he saith "were astonished at His doctrine, because He taught as one having authority."
