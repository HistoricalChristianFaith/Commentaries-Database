Though favored with such teaching as Jesus had done, they were influenced less by this than by the miracles—a sign of the low level of faith they had. For miracles, it says, are not for believers but for unbelievers. Those described by Matthew did not act this way; rather, he says, they “were astonished at his doctrine because he taught as one having authority.”

Observe, in a whole year, the evangelist has told us of no miracles of Christ, except of his healing of the paralytic and the nobleman’s son. His purpose was not to enumerate them all (which would have been impossible), but to record the great principal acts of our Lord.
