They do not relax their wickedness even in the face of calamity. And yet, what he was about to do was something far more wonderful. For it is a much greater thing to dispel death that has come and conquered than to ward off death that is imminent. They therefore slander him by those very points through which they ought to have marveled at his power. They allow for the time that he opened the eyes of the blind. And, when they ought to have admired him because of that miracle, they use this latter case as a way to cast a slur upon it, as though it had not even taken place. And not only this â€¦ but even before he has arrived or done anything, they try to prevent him with their accusations without even waiting to see how things will turn out.
