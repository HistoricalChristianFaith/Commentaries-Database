Ver. 10. "Aristarchus my fellow-prisoner salutes you."

Nothing can surpass this praise. This is he that was brought up from Jerusalem with him. This man has said a greater thing than the prophets; for they call themselves "strangers and foreigners," but this one calls himself even a prisoner. Just like a prisoner of war he was dragged up and down, and lay at every one's will to suffer evil of them, yea rather worse even than prisoners. For those indeed their enemies, after taking them, treat with much attention, having a care for them as their own property: but Paul, as though an enemy and a foe, all men dragged up and down, beating him, scourging, insulting, and maligning. This was a consolation to those also (to whom he wrote), when their master even is in such circumstances...

"And Mark, the cousin of Barnabas"; even this man he has praised still from his relationship, for Barnabas was a great man; "touching whom you received commandments; if he come unto you, receive him." Why? Would they not have received him? Yes, but he means, with much attention; and this shows the man to be great. Whence they received these commandments, he does not say.

Ver. 10. "And Mark," he says, "the cousin of Barnabas, touching whom you received commandments, receive him." Perhaps they had received commandments from Barnabas.
