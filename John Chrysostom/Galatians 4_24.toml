Ver. 24. "Which things contain an allegory."

Contrary to usage, he calls a type an allegory; his meaning is as follows; this history not only declares that which appears on the face of it, but announces somewhat farther, whence it is called an allegory. And what has it announced? No less than all the things now present.

Ver. 24. "For these women," he says, "are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar."

"These:" who? The mothers of those children, Sarah and Hagar; and what are they? Two covenants, two laws. As the names of the women were given in the history, he abides by this designation of the two races, showing how much follows from the very names. How from the names?
