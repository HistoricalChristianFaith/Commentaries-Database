Here Jesus shows the weakness of kingship among us. He demonstrates that its strength lies in servants. But that which is above is sufficient of itself. It needs nothing.… And so, he also says that his kingdom is not from this world—not depriving the world of his providence and governance but rather showing, as I said, that his power was not human or perishable.
