He removes them by degrees from their relationship to Abraham, teaching them not to pride themselves so much on that relationship. For just as bondage and freedom depend on one’s actions, so also does one’s relationship to another. Still, he does not directly say, “You are not the seed of Abraham [because] you are murderers of the righteous.” Instead he goes along with them for awhile, affirming that they are Abraham’s seed.… But then, after the witness of his works shuts their mouths, he speaks more boldly: “You seek to kill me.” And if anyone says, “What of it? They were only trying to act justly”—this is not the case either. And so he adds the reason they acted the way they did: “Because my word has no place in you.”
