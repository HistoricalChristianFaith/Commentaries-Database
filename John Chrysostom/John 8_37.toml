Gently and by little does He expel them from that relationship, teaching them not to be high-minded because of it. For as freedom and bondage depend on men's actions, so also does relationship. He said not directly, You are not the seed of Abraham, you the murderers of the righteous; but for a while He even goes along with them, and says, I know that you are Abraham's seed. Yet this is not the matter in question, and during the remainder of this speech He uses greater vehemence. For we  may for the most part observe, that when He is about to work any great thing, after He has wrought it, He uses greater boldness of speech, as though the testimony from His works shut men's mouths. But ye seek to kill Me. What of that, says some one, if they sought to do so justly. But this was not so either; wherefore also He puts the reason;

Because My word has no place in you.

How then was it, says some one, that they believed on Him? As I before said, they changed again. On which account He touched them sharply. If you boast the relationship of Abraham ye ought also to show forth his life. And He said not, You do not contain  my words, but, My word has no place in you, thus declaring the sublimity of His doctrines.

He removes them by degrees from their relationship to Abraham, teaching them not to pride themselves so much on that relationship. For just as bondage and freedom depend on one’s actions, so also does one’s relationship to another. Still, he does not directly say, “You are not the seed of Abraham [because] you are murderers of the righteous.” Instead he goes along with them for awhile, affirming that they are Abraham’s seed.… But then, after the witness of his works shuts their mouths, he speaks more boldly: “You seek to kill me.” And if anyone says, “What of it? They were only trying to act justly”—this is not the case either. And so he adds the reason they acted the way they did: “Because my word has no place in you.”
