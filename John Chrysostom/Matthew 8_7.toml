This at least He did, in an opposite way, in the case also of the Phœnician woman. For here, when not summoned to the house, of His own accord He says, He will come, that you might learn the centurion's faith and great humility; but in the case of the Phœnician woman, He both refuses the grant, and drives her, persevering therein, to great perplexity.

For being a wise physician and full of resources, He knows how to bring about contraries the one by the other. And as here by His freely-offered coming, so there by His peremptory putting off and denial, He unfolds the woman's faith. So likewise He does in Abraham's case, saying, I will by no means hide from Abraham my servant; to make you know that man's kindly affection, and his care for Sodom. And in the instance of Lot, Genesis 19:2 they that were sent refuse to enter into his house, to make you know the greatness of that righteous man's hospitality.

What did Jesus do? Something he had never done before. While on previous occasions he had responded to the wish of his supplicants, in this case he rather springs actively toward it. He offers not only to heal him but also to come to his house. By this we learn of the centurion’s excellent faith. For if he had not made this offer but rather had said, “Go your way, let your servant be healed,” we would not have known these things.
