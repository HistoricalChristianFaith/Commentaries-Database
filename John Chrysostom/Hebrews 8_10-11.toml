“No longer,” he says, “shall the covenant be in writings, but in hearts.” Let the Jew, in that case, show if this was ever carried into effect, but he could not, for it was made a second time in writings after the return from Babylon. But I show that the apostles received nothing in writing, but received it in their hearts through the Holy Ghost. Therefore also Christ said, “When he comes, he will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.”
