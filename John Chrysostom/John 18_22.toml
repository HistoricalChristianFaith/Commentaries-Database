What could be more audacious than this? Shudder, O heaven, be astounded, O earth, at the long-suffering of the Lord, and the senselessness of the servants! Yet what was it that He said? He said not, Why do you ask Me, as if refusing to speak, but wishing to remove every pretext for senseless behavior; and being upon this buffeted, though He was able to shake, to annihilate, or to remove all things, He does not any one of these, but speaks words able to relax any brutality.

What should they do then but either disprove, or admit, what He said? Yet this they do not do: it is not a trial they are carrying on, but afaction, a tyranny. Not knowing what to do further, they send Him to Caiaphas: Now Ann assent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.
