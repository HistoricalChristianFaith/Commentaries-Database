For what reason, tell me, does he now mention the north and describe to us the location of the place? Because from that quarter war generally broke out with the invasion of savages, and generally the inspired authors mention it, calling it “from the north,” and speak in terms of a cauldron boiling from that direction.… This city generally vulnerable from that quarter you made impregnable. In other words, just as if someone were to say about the body, “That weak part I made stronger,” he too is suggesting the same in this verse in the words, “The quarters from which come wailing and weeping,” the basis of disasters, these parts run over with satisfaction, with tranquility; [the place from which] come threats and fears and dangers, [from them come] delight and happiness. No one any longer fears that northern part of creation, no one is anguished, no one is suspicious. All enjoy happiness, for you root it in satisfaction.
