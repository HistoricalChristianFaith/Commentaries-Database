And what manner of prophet said this? Do not be curious nor too busy, for many of the prophetic writings have been lost. This may be seen from the history of the Chronicles. For being negligent and continually falling into ungodliness, some they suffered to perish, others they themselves burned up and cut to pieces. The latter fact Jeremiah relates. The former, he who composed the fourth book of Kings, saying that after a long time the book of Deuteronomy was hardly found, buried somewhere and lost. - "Homilies on the Gospel of Matthew 9.6"
