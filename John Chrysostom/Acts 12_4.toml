the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display. Peter therefore was kept in prison.

For the contest was now for life and death: both the slaying of the one made them fearful, and the casting of the other into prison. And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains; and the keepers before the door kept the prison. And, behold, the angel of the Lord came upon him, and a light shined in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and raised him up, saying, Arise up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.

This was done both of rage, and of fear. He slew, it says, James the brother of John with the sword. Do you mark their courage? For, that none may say that without danger or fear of danger they brave death, as being sure of God's delivering them, therefore he permits some to be put to death, and chief men too, Stephen and James, thereby convincing their slayers themselves, that not even these things make them fall away, and hinder them. Peter therefore was kept in prison: but prayer was made without ceasing of the Church unto God for him.
