Whom having arrested, he put in ward, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers. This was done both of rage, and of fear. He slew James the brother of John with the sword. Do you mark their courage? For, that none may say that without danger or fear of danger they brave death, as being sure of God's delivering them, therefore he permits some to be put to death, and chief men too, Stephen and James, thereby convincing their slayers themselves, that not even these things make them fall away, and hinder them.

He feared lest Peter, in consequence of the slaying of James, should withdraw; and wishing to have him in safe keeping, he put him in prison: "and delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers": the stricter the custody, the more wondrous the display.
