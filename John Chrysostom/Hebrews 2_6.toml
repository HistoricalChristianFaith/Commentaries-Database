Then he brings forward another testimony also and says, but one in a certain place testified, saying. Wherefore did he not mention the name of the prophet, but hid it? Yea, and in other testimonies also he does this: as when he says, but when He brings in again the First-Begotten into the world, He says, And let all the Angels of God worship Him. And again, I will be to Him a Father. And of the Angels He says, Who makes His angels spirits. And, You, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth c. i. 6, 5, 7, 10:â€” so also here he says, but one in a certain place testified, saying. And this very thing (I conceive) is the act of one that conceals himself, and shows that they were well skilled in the Scriptures; his not setting down him who uttered the testimony, but introducing it as familiar and obvious.
