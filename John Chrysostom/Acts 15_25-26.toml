Then to show that they do not act despotically, that all are agreed in this, that with deliberation they write this - "It seemed good to us, being assembled with one accord, to send men of ours whom we have chosen" - then, that it may not look like disparagement of Paul and Barnabas, that those men are sent, observe the encomium passed upon them - "together with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." If "beloved," they will not despise them, if they "have hazarded their lives," they have themselves a right to be believed. The encomium passed upon Paul stopped their mouths. For this is the reason why neither Paul comes alone nor Barnabas with him, but others also from the Church; that he may not be suspected, seeing it was he that advocated that doctrine: nor yet those from Jerusalem alone. It shows that they have a right to be believed.
