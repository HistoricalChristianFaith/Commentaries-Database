Still I would like to ask of our opponents what the words mean that were once uttered by the prophet, “Before me there was no God, and after me there is none.” If the Son is younger than the Father, how can the Father say, “after me there shall be none”? You will not, therefore, also deprive the Only Begotten himself of his substance, will you? Indeed, you must dare to do this or else to accept the one Godhead with the distinct persons of the Father and the Son.
