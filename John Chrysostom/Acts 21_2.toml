Possibly that ship (in which they had come) was making a stay there: wherefore they shifted to another, and not having found one going to CÃ¦sarea, but (finding this) for Phenice, they embarked in it (and pursued their voyage), having left Cyprus also and Syria: but the expression, having left it on the left hand, is not said simply (in that meaning), but that they made speed not to get to Syria either. We landed at Tyre.
