"And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not," so far were they from all display and love of glory.

"And when Paul," etc. Paul then wished to enter in that he might harangue them: for he took his persecutions as occasions for teaching: "but the disciples suffered him not." Mark, how great forethought we always find them taking for him. At the very first they brought him out that they might not in his person receive a mortal blow; and yet they had heard him say, "I must also see Rome." But it was providential that he so predicts beforehand, that they might not be confounded at the event. But they would not that he should even suffer any evil.
