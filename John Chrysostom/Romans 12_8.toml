And this is a species of teaching too. For "if you have any word of exhortation," it says, "speak unto the people." [Acts 13:15] Then to show that it is no great good to follow after virtue unless this is done with the proper rule, he proceeds, "He that gives" (μεταδιδοὺς, imparts), "let him do it with simplicity." For it is not enough to give, but we must do it with munificence also, for this constantly answers to the name of simplicity. Since even the virgins had oil, still, since they had not enough, they were cast out from everything. "He that defends" (A.V. rules, προἵστάμενος,) "with diligence;" for it is not enough to do undertake the defense.  "He that shows mercy, with cheerfulness." For it is not enough to show mercy, but it behooves us to do it with a largeness and an ungrudging spirit, or rather not with an ungrudging, but even with a cheerful and rejoicing one, for not grudging does not amount to rejoicing. And this same point, when he is writing to the Corinthians also, he insisted very strongly upon. For to rouse them to such largeness he said, He that sows sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which sows bountifully shall reap also bountifully. [2 Corinthians 9:6] But to correct their temper he added, "Not grudgingly or of necessity." [2 Corinthians 9:7] For both the shower of mercy ought to have, both ungrudgingness and pleasure. And why do you bemoan yourself of giving alms? (Aristot. Eth. N. ii. 3 and iv. 1.) Why do you grieve at showing mercy, and lose the advantage of the good deed? For if you grieve you do not do mercy, but are cruel and inhuman. For if you grieve, how shall you be able to raise up him that is in sorrow? For it is much if he suspects no ill, even, when you are giving with joyfulness. For since nothing seems to men such a disgrace as to be receiving from others, unless by an exceedingly cheerful look you remove the suspicion, and showest that you are receiving rather than giving, you will even cast down the receiver rather than raise him up. This is why he says, "He that shows mercy, with cheerfulness." For who that is receiving a kingdom, is of sad countenance? Who that is receiving pardon for his sins continues of dejected look? Mind not then the expenditure of the money; but the increase that comes of that expenditure. For if he that sows rejoices though sowing with uncertainty of return, much more should he do so that farms the Heaven. For in this way, even though thou give but little, you will be giving much; even as how much soever you give with a sad countenance, you will have made your much a little. Thus the widow outweighed many talents by the two mites, for her spirit was large. And how is it possible, it may be said, for one that dwells with poverty in the extreme, and empties forth his all, to do this with a ready mind? Ask the widow, and you will hear the way, and will know that it is not poverty  that makes narrow circumstances, but the temper of a man that effects both this and its opposite. For it is possible even in poverty to be munificent (μεγαλόψυχον), and in riches to be niggardly. Hence in giving he looks for simplicity, and in showing mercy for cheerfulness, and in patronizing for diligence. For it is not with money only that he wishes us to render every assistance to those in want, but both with words, and deeds, and in person, and in every other way. And after mentioning the chief kind of aiding (προστασίαν), that which lies in teaching, namely, and that of exhorting (for this is a more necessary kind, in that it nurtures the soul), he proceeds to that by way of money, and all other means; then to show how these may be practised aright, he brings in the mother of them, love.

Exhortation is a form of teaching.… In giving Paul looks for liberality; in showing mercy, for cheerfulness; in caregiving, for diligence. For it is not just with money that Paul wants us to help those in need but with words, deeds, in person and in every other way.
