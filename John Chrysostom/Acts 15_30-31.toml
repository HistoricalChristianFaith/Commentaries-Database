"So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation." Then those brethren also exhorted them: and having established them, for towards Paul they were contentiously disposed, so departed from them in peace. For it might have been done also without letters, but that there may be a law in writing they send this Epistle: again, that they may obey the law the Apostles also told those men the same things, and they did this, and confirmed them.
