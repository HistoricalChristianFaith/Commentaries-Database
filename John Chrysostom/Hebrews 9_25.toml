And not by this alone did he point out the difference, but also by adding that The Priest is nearer to God: for he says, to appear in the presence of God. So that he made the matter august, not only by the [consideration of] heaven, but also by [that of Christ's] entering in [there]. For not merely through symbols as here, but He sees God Himself there.

Do you see that condescension through the lowly things have been said throughout? Why do you then any longer wonder that He intercedes there, where He places Himself as a High Priest? Nor yet, that He should offer Himself often, as the High Priest.

For Christ is not entered into the Holy Places made with hands (he says) which are the figures of the True. (These then are true; and those are figures, for the temple too has been so arranged, as the Heaven of Heavens.)

What do you say? He who is everywhere present, and who fills all things, does not He appear unless He enter into Heaven? You see that all these things pertain to the flesh.

To appear, he says, in the presence of God for us. What is for us? He went up (he means) with a sacrifice which had power to propitiate the Father. Wherefore (tell me)? Was He an enemy? The angels were enemies, He was not an enemy. For that the Angels were enemies, hear what he says, He made peace as to things on earth and things in Heaven. Colossians 1:20 So that He also entered into Heaven, now to appear in the presence of God for us. He now appears, but for us.
