If the Son was born a perfect and complete king, it is also clear that he is a judge and arbiter. For it is especially the mark of a king that he makes decisions and judgments both to grant honors and to punish. And another source might help you to see that he has the power to grant heavenly honors. So we shall bring forward the man who is better than all men, and we shall show that Christ granted this man a crown.… Who is the one who is better than all men? Who other than that tentmaker, that teacher of the entire world, the one who coursed over land and sea as if equipped with wings, the chosen instrument, the attendant of Christ the bridegroom, the one who planted the church, the wise builder, the preacher, the one who ran the course and fought the good fight, the soldier, the trainer of athletes, the one who left memorials of his own virtue everywhere in the world.
