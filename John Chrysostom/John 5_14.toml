Here we learn in the first place that his disease was the consequence of his sins. Second, we learn that there is really a hell; third, that it is a place of lasting and infinite punishment.… But someone might ask, “Do all diseases proceed from sin?” Not all, but most do. Some proceed from different kinds of loose living, since gluttony, intemperance and sloth produce similar sufferings.… But why is it that in the case of these paralytics Christ mentions their sins?… I know that some slander this paralytic, asserting that he was an accuser of Christ and that therefore this speech was addressed to him. But what about the paralytic in Matthew who heard nearly the same words? For Christ also told him, “Your sins are forgiven you.” And so it is clear that this man was not addressed in this way because of what they allege.… Rather, Jesus was securing him against future sins.In healing others, however, he makes no mention of sins at all. And so, it would seem to be the case that the diseases of these men had arisen from their sins, whereas those of the others had come from natural causes only. Or perhaps through these, Jesus is admonishing everybody else.… Or he may have admonished this man, knowing his great patience of mind, anticipating that he would bear an admonition, keeping him healthy both by the benefit of the healing and the fear of future ills.… It is also a disclosure too of his divinity, for he implies in saying, “Sin no more,” that he knew what sins he had formerly committed.
