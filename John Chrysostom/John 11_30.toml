Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him. The Jews then which were with her, and what follows. 

1. A great good is philosophy; the philosophy, I mean, which is with us. For what the heathen have is words and fables only; nor have these fables anything truly wise  in them; since everything among those men is done for the sake of reputation. A great good then is true wisdom, and even here  returns to us a recompense. For he that despises wealth, from this at once reaps advantage,  being delivered from cares which are superfluous and unprofitable;  and he that tramples upon glory from this at once receives his reward, being the slave of none, but free with the real freedom; and he that desires heavenly things hence receives his recompense, regarding present things as nothing, and being easily superior to every grief. Behold, for example, how this woman by practicing true wisdom even here received her reward. For when all were sitting by her as she mourned and lamented, she did not wait that the Master should come to her, nor did she maintain what might have seemed her due, nor was she restrained by her sorrow, (for, in addition to the other wretchedness, mourning women have this malady, that they wish to be made much of on account of their case,) but she was not at all so affected; as soon as she heard, she quickly came to Him.  Jesus was not yet come into the town.  He proceeded somewhat slowly, that He might not seem to fling Himself upon the miracle, but rather to be  entreated by them. At least, it is either with an intention of implying this that the Evangelist has said the, rises up quickly, or else he shows that she ran so as to anticipate Christ's arrival. She came not alone, but drawing after her the Jews that were in the house. Very wisely did her sister call  her secretly, so as not to disturb those who had come together, and not mention the cause either; for assuredly many would have gone back, but now as though she were going to weep, all followed her. By these means again it is proved  that Lazarus was dead.
