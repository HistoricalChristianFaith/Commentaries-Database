"Neither murmur ye, as some of them murmured, and perished by the destroyer."

For what is required is not only to suffer for Christ, but also nobly to bear the things that come on us, and with all gladness: since this is the nature of every crown. Yea, and unless this be so, punishment rather will attend men who take calamity with a bad grace. Wherefore, both the Apostles when they were beaten rejoiced, and Paul gloried in his sufferings.

What is required is not only to suffer for Christ, but to endure what we suffer nobly and with all gladness, since this is the nature of every athleteâ€™s crown. If we do not do so, punishment will come upon us who take disaster with bad grace. This is why the apostles rejoiced when they were beaten, and Paul gloried in his sufferings.
