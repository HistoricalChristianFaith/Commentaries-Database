God often holds some kind of threat over our heads—not so that he may inflict it on us but so that he can draw us to himself. When we return to him, the fear quickly dissipates. Certainly, if we were the same person in temptations that we are when at ease, there would be no need for temptations.But why do I speak of us? Since even those saints of old learned a great lesson, as the prophet says, “It was good for me that you humbled me.” And Jesus likewise said to the apostles, “In the world you will have tribulation.” And Paul alludes to just this when he says, “A thorn in the flesh was given to me; the messenger of Satan to buffet me.” Therefore when he looked for deliverance from temptation, he did not obtain it, because of the greater benefit that would follow from it. And if we should rehearse the whole life of David, we would find him more glorious when he was in danger—both he and everyone else who was like him. For such was the case with Job, who shined more brightly during his troubles, and Joseph too in this way became the more approved, and Jacob also, and his father likewise and his father’s father. For all those who ever donned such crowns of peculiar glory, it was by tribulations and temptations that they first won their crowns. Only then did they have their names recited.
Being conscious of all these things, according to the wise saying, let us “not be hasty in time of calamity.” Rather, let us teach ourselves only one thing: how to bear all nobly and not to be curious or inquisitive about any of the things that are happening. For to know when our tribulations will be over and done with belongs to God who permits them to happen to us. But to bear what is brought on us, with all thankfulness, is all the work of a good disposition on our part. And if this is the case, then all our blessings will follow.
