He brings in the miracle everywhere as evidence because they could not invalidate it. And he draws his own inferences from it too. First, he says, “Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know.” He has no doubt that Jesus was not a sinner. And so, when he has an opportunity, he turns their own words against them and defends Jesus: “Now we know that God does not listen to sinners.”
