“Woe to you when all people speak well of you.” Notice how by the word woe he revealed to us the extent of the punishment awaiting such people. This word woe, after all, is an exclamation of lament, so that it is as if he is lamenting their fate when he says, “Woe to you when all people speak well of you.” Notice too the precision in the expression: he didn’t simply say “people” but “all people.” You see, it is not possible for a virtuous person who travels by the straight and narrow path and follows Christ’s commands to enjoy the praise and admiration of all people—so strong is the impulse of evil and the resistance to virtue.
