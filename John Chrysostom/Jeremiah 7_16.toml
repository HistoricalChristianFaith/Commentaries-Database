He did the same thing in explaining himself to Noah about the flood that he did to Ezekiel when while living in Babylon he caused him to see the people’s evil deeds in Jerusalem. And when he told Jeremiah not to pray, there too he explained himself adding, “Do you not see what they do?” And he does the same thing everywhere as he does here [in Matthew]. For what does he say? “The people of Nineveh shall rise up and shall condemn this generation, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and, behold, a greater one than Jonah is here.”
