Notice immediately how much esteem Joseph enjoys from the outset. After being completely purified by endurance and emerging from prison like some piece of glittering gold, he was brought into Pharaoh’s presence.Do you see how wonderful a thing it is to be helped by grace from on high? See how many things divine providence had arranged so that the events affecting Joseph should come to pass. After surviving that greatest challenge and avoiding the clutches of that wanton Egyptian, he was thrown into prison. It was arranged that Pharaoh’s chief cupbearer and chief baker should be imprisoned there at the same time and should come to know the man’s wisdom through his interpretation of dreams, so that now at the opportune moment the cupbearer should remember and bring him forward.
