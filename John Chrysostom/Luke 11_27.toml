In this answer He sought not to disown His mother, but to show that His birth would have profited her nothing, had she not been really fruitful in works and faith. But if itMet profited Mary nothing that Christ derived His birth from her, without the inward virtue ofher heart, much less will it avail us to have a virtuous father, brother, or son, while we ourselves are strangers to virtue.
