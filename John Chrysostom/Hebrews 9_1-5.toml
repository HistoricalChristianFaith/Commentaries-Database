He has shown from the Priest, from the Priesthood, from the Covenant, that that dispensation was to have an end. From this point he shows it from the fashion of the tabernacle itself. How? This, he says, was the "Holy" and the "Holy of Holies." The holy place then is a symbol of the former period (for there all things are done by means of sacrifices); but the Holy of Holies of this that is now present.

And by the Holy of Holies he means Heaven; and by the veil, Heaven, and the Flesh "entereth into that within the veil": that is to say, "through the veil of His flesh."
