Observe how in all this voyage they nowhere touched at a city, but were cast on an island, and passed the entire winter there or sailing - those being herein under training for faith, his fellow-voyagers, I mean. "And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux." Probably this was painted on it: so addicted were they to their idols.
