For which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren. Do you see how again he shows the superiority? For by saying, He is not ashamed, he shows that the whole comes not of the nature of the thing, but of the loving affection of Him who was not ashamed of anything, [yea] of His great humility. For though we be of one, yet He sanctifies and we are sanctified: and great is the difference. Moreover He is of the Father, as a true Son, that is, of His substance; we, as created, that is, brought out of things that are not, so that the difference is great. Wherefore he says, He is not ashamed to call them brethren Hebrews 2:12, saying, I will declare Your name unto My brethren. Psalm 22:22 For when He clothed Himself with flesh, He clothed Himself also with the brotherhood, and at the same time came in the brotherhood.
