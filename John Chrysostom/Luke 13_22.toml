What then is that which our Lord says elsewhere, My yoke is easy, and my burden is light? There is indeed no contradiction, but theone was said because of the nature of temptations, the other with respect to the feeling of those who overcame them. For whatever is troublesome to our nature may be considered easy when we undertake it heartily. Besides also, though the way of salvation is narrow at its entrance, yet through it we come into a large space, but on the contrary the broad way leads to destruction.
