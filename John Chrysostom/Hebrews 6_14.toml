And yet at the end of the Epistle he says, that all these, having seen the promises afar off, and having embraced them, received them not, that they without us should not be made perfect. Hebrews 11:13 For when God made promise to Abraham (he says) because He could swear by no greater, He swore by Himself, saying, Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you. And so after he had patiently endured, he obtained the promise. c. xi. 39, 40 How then does he say at the end [of the Epistle] that he received not the promises, and here, that after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise? How did he not receive? How did he obtain? He is not speaking of the same things in this place and in the other, but makes the consolation twofold. God made promises to Abraham, and after a long space of time He gave the things [spoken of] in this place, but those others not yet.
