Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem for to worship. And what is this? It means, that I could not immediately have raised a commotion. Because the accuser had nothing to show as done in Jerusalem, observe what he said: among all the Jews throughout the world. Therefore it is that Paul here forcibly attracts him - to worship, he says, I came up, so far am I from raising sedition - and lays a stress upon this point of justice being the strong point.
