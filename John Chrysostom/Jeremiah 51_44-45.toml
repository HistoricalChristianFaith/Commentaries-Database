Therefore, Paul also urged us to this and said, “Expel the wicked man from your midst” and “so that he who has done this deed might be put away from your midst.” Indeed, bad companionship is a terrible thing, a terrible thing! A pestilence does not infect and scabies corrupt those tainted as quickly as the wickedness of evil people does those affected by this malady. For “evil companionships corrupt good morals.” The prophet also said, “Go out of the midst of them, and separate yourselves from them.”
