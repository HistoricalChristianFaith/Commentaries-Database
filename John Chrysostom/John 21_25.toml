Whence it is clear that I could not have written to court favor; for I who, when the miracles were so many, have not even related so many as the others have, but omitting most of them, have brought forward the plots of the Jews, the stonings, the hatred, the insults, the revilings, and have shown how they called Him a demoniac and a deceiver, certainly could not have acted to gain favor. For it behooved one who courted favor to do the contrary, to reject  the reproachful, to set forth the glorious. Since then he wrote what he did from full assurance, he does not decline to produce his own testimony, challenging men separately to enquire into and scrutinize the circumstances. For it is a custom with us, when we think that we are speaking exactly true, never to refuse our testimony; and if we do this, much more would he who wrote by the Spirit. What then the other Apostles when they preached declared, he also says; We are witnesses of the things spoken,  and the Spirit which He has given  to them that obey Him. Acts 5:32 And besides, he was present at all, and did not desert Him even when being crucified, and had His mother entrusted to him; all which things are signs of his love for Him, and of his knowing all things exactly. And if he has said that so many miracles had taken place, marvel thou not, but, considering the ineffable power of the Doer, receive with faith what is spoken. For it was as easy for Him to do whatever He would, as it is for us to speak, or rather much easier; for it sufficed that He should will only, and all followed.

3. Let us then give exact heed to the words, and let us not cease to unfold and search them through, for it is from continual application that we get some advantage. So shall we be able to cleanse our life, so to cut up the thorns; for such a thing is sin and worldly care, fruitless and painful. And as the thorn whatever way it is held pricks the holder, so the things of this life, on whatever side they be laid hold of, give pain to him who hugs and cherishes them. Not such are spiritual things; they resemble a pearl, whichever way thou turn it, it delights the eyes. As thus. A man has done a deed of mercy; he not only is fed with hopes of the future, but also is cheered by the good things here, being everywhere full of confidence, and doing all with much boldness. He has got the better of an evil desire; even before obtaining the Kingdom, he has already received the fruit here, being praised and approved,  before all others,  by his own conscience. And every good work is of this nature; just as conscience also punishes wicked deeds here, even before the pit. For if, after sinning, you consider the future, you become afraid and tremblest, though no man punish you; if the present, you have many enemies, and livest in suspicion, and canst not henceforth even look in the face those who have wronged you, or rather, those who have not wronged you.  For we do not in the case of those evil deeds reap so much pleasure, as we do despondency, when conscience cries out against us, men, without, condemn us, God is angered, the pit travailing to receive us, our thoughts not at rest. A heavy, a heavy and a burdensome thing is sin, harder to bear than any lead. He at least who has any sense of it will not be able to look up ever so little, though he be very dull. Thus, for instance, Ahab, though very impious, when he felt this, walked bending downwards, crushed and afflicted. On this account he clothed himself in sackcloth, and shed fountains of tears. 1 Kings 21:27 If we do this, and grieve as he did, we shall put off our faults as did Zacch&aelig;us, and we too shall obtain some pardon. Luke 19:9 For as in the case of tumors,  and fistulous ulcers,  if one stay not first the discharge which runs over and inflames the wound, how many soever remedies he applies, while the source of the evil is not stopped, he does all in vain; so too if we stay not our hand from covetousness, and check not that evil afflux of wealth, although we give alms, we do all to no  purpose. For that which was healed by it,  covetousness coming after is wont to overwhelm  and spoil, and to make harder to heal than before. Let us then cease from rapine, and so do alms. But if we betake ourselves to precipices, how shall we be able to recover ourselves?  for if one party (that is, alms-doing) were to pull at a falling man from above, while another was forcibly dragging him from below, the only result of such a struggle would be, that the man would be torn asunder. That we may not suffer this, nor, while covetousness weighs us down from below, alms-doing depart and leave us, let us lighten ourselves, and spread our wings,  that having been perfected by the riddance of evil things, and the practice of good,  we may obtain the goods everlasting, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and the Holy Ghost be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever and world without end. Amen.

And so it is clear, [John is saying], that I was not writing to curry favor. For I certainly could not have been acting to gain favor when I have not even related as many miracles (of which there were many) as the others have. I have omitted most of them, instead bringing forward the plots of the Jews, the stoning, the hatred, the insults, the reviling and showing how they called him a demoniac and a deceiver. And so I certainly could not have been acting to gain favor. For anyone who wanted to court favor would have done the opposite, namely, rejecting what was worthy of reproach in favor of the more glorious details. Since then he wrote what he did from full assurance, he does not decline to produce his own testimony, challenging people separately to inquire into and scrutinize the circumstances.

Let us, therefore, pay careful attention to the words, and let us not stop reading and searching them through, for it is from their continual application that we ultimately benefit. We can then cleanse our life so as to cut up the thorns of sin and the cares of the world, which are fruitless and painful. And just as the thorn, however it is held, pricks the holder, so the things of this life, on whatever side they are grasped, give pain to the one who clings and cherishes them. Spiritual things are not like this. They resemble a pearl in that whichever way you turn it, it delights the eyes.â€¦ Let us then lighten ourselves and expand our horizons as we grow in maturity by getting rid of the evil things of this life and practicing the good. Let us obtain everlasting goods, then, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with whom to the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, dominion and honor, now and forever, world without end. Amen.
