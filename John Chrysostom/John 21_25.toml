And so it is clear, [John is saying], that I was not writing to curry favor. For I certainly could not have been acting to gain favor when I have not even related as many miracles (of which there were many) as the others have. I have omitted most of them, instead bringing forward the plots of the Jews, the stoning, the hatred, the insults, the reviling and showing how they called him a demoniac and a deceiver. And so I certainly could not have been acting to gain favor. For anyone who wanted to court favor would have done the opposite, namely, rejecting what was worthy of reproach in favor of the more glorious details. Since then he wrote what he did from full assurance, he does not decline to produce his own testimony, challenging people separately to inquire into and scrutinize the circumstances.

Let us, therefore, pay careful attention to the words, and let us not stop reading and searching them through, for it is from their continual application that we ultimately benefit. We can then cleanse our life so as to cut up the thorns of sin and the cares of the world, which are fruitless and painful. And just as the thorn, however it is held, pricks the holder, so the things of this life, on whatever side they are grasped, give pain to the one who clings and cherishes them. Spiritual things are not like this. They resemble a pearl in that whichever way you turn it, it delights the eyes.… Let us then lighten ourselves and expand our horizons as we grow in maturity by getting rid of the evil things of this life and practicing the good. Let us obtain everlasting goods, then, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ with whom to the Father and the Holy Spirit be glory, dominion and honor, now and forever, world without end. Amen.
