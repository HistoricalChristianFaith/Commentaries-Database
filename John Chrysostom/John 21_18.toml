And yet this he did will, and desired; on which account also He has revealed it to him. For since Peter had continually said, I will lay down my life for You John 13:37, and, Though I should die with You, yet will I not deny You Matthew 26:35: He has given him back  his desire. What then is the, Whither you will not? He speaks of natural feeling, and the necessity of  the flesh, and that the soul is unwillingly torn away from the body. So that even though the will were firm, yet still even then nature would be found  in fault. For no one lays aside the body without feeling, God, as I said before, having suitably ordained this, that violent deaths might not be many. For if, as things are, the devil has been able to effect this, and has led ten thousand to precipices and pits; had not the soul felt such a desire for the body, the many would have rushed to this under any common discouragement. The, whither you will not, is then the expression of one signifying natural feeling.

But how after having said, When you were young, does He again say, When you are old? For this is the expression of one declaring that he was not then young; (nor was he; nor yet old, but a man of middle age. ) Wherefore then did He recall to his memory his former life? Signifying, that this is the nature of what belongs to Him. In things of this life the young man is useful, the old useless; but in Mine, He says, not so; but when old age has come on, then is excellence brighter, then is manliness more illustrious, being nothing hindered by the time of life. This He said not to terrify, but to rouse Him; for He knew his love, and that he long had yearned for this blessing. At the same time He declares the kind of death. For since Peter ever desired to be in the dangers which were for His sake, Be of good cheer, He says, I will so satisfy your desire, that, what you suffered not when young, you must suffer when you are old. Then the Evangelist, to rouse the hearer, has added,

But how is it that after having said, “When you were young,” he added, “When you are old”? By this he meant that Peter was not young at that time (because he was not), though still not yet an old man, but rather one in the prime of life. So why then did he recall to his memory his former life? He did so to make clear to Peter his standard of values. In the eyes of the world the young man is useful, the old useless. In life with me, Jesus says, this is not the case. Rather, when old age has come on, then nobility shines brighter and courage becomes more illustrious, being unimpeded by youthful passion. This he said not to terrify but to rouse Peter, for he knew about his love and that he long had yearned for this blessing. At the same time he declares the kind of death he will die. For since Peter always wanted to be in danger for his sake, “Be of good cheer,” he says, “I will so satisfy your desire that, what you didn’t suffer when you were young, you will suffer when you are old.”
