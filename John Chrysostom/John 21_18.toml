But how is it that after having said, “When you were young,” he added, “When you are old”? By this he meant that Peter was not young at that time (because he was not), though still not yet an old man, but rather one in the prime of life. So why then did he recall to his memory his former life? He did so to make clear to Peter his standard of values. In the eyes of the world the young man is useful, the old useless. In life with me, Jesus says, this is not the case. Rather, when old age has come on, then nobility shines brighter and courage becomes more illustrious, being unimpeded by youthful passion. This he said not to terrify but to rouse Peter, for he knew about his love and that he long had yearned for this blessing. At the same time he declares the kind of death he will die. For since Peter always wanted to be in danger for his sake, “Be of good cheer,” he says, “I will so satisfy your desire that, what you didn’t suffer when you were young, you will suffer when you are old.”
