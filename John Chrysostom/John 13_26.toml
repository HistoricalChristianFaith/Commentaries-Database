Even the manner (of the rebuke) was calculated to put him to shame. He respected not the table, though he shared the bread; be it so; but the receiving the sop from His own hand, whom would not that have won over? Yet him it won not.

Even the way he rebuked Judas was calculated to put him to shame. Judas did not respect the table, though he shared the bread. Be that as it may, who would not have been won over, however, by receiving the bread from Christ’s own hand? Yet it did not win Judas over.
