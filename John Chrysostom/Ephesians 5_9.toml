When Paul says “in all goodness,” he is directing this against those who are wrathful and bitter. When he says “and in all that is right,” he is speaking against covetousness. When he says “and in all that is true,” he speaks against false pleasure. The fruit of the light is evidenced not in the vices he has already spoken of but in their opposites.
