(Hom. lxvii.) Which aggravates the fault of the Jews, who after He had done the same thing twice, yet persisted in their hardness.

But not even thus were the Chief Priests convinced, but at His miracles and the shouts of the children they had indignation.

This was at once a type of the Gentiles, and no small comfort to the Apostles; for that they might not be perplexed, contriving how having no education for the purpose they should preach the Gospel, these children going before them did away that fear; for He who made these to sing His praises, shall give speech to those. This miracle also shows that Christ was the Framer of nature; seeing the children spoke things full of meaning, and agreeing with the Prophets, whereas the men uttered things meaningless, and full of frenzy.

But see the baseness of the Jews. He had wrought so many miracles, and never were they thus amazed at Him; but when they saw a multitude running together, then they marvel. "For all the city was moved, saying, Who is this? But the multitudes said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth of Galilee." And when they thought they were saying something great, even then were their thoughts earthly, and low, and dragging on the ground.
