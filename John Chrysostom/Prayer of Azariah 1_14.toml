“May the Lord make you fruitful, you and your children.” Have you seen another kind of blessing, the increase of the people? For this same reason it says elsewhere that the contrary is a punishment: “We have become smaller than any other nation; we are now humiliated throughout the earth.” And in fact they enjoyed this blessing when they were in Egypt, despite the infinite number of things forbidden them, the forced labor, the tribulations, the cruelty of their persecutors. But nothing caused the Word of God to fail, and the blessing acted in such a way that in two hundred years, they had become six hundred thousand people.
