Please note how Gamaliel discourses with gentleness. He speaks briefly to them and relates no ancient stories (though he could have), but he tells of recent events that are powerful in producing belief. He hints at this himself by saying, “For before these days,” meaning, not many days ago. If he had opened by saying, “Let these men go,” he would have aroused suspicion and his speech would not have been effective. Coming after the examples, however, it acquired its own force.… See how mild his manner is, the speech not long but succinct, and his mention even of those [imposters] without anger. “And all who followed him were scattered,” he says. All this without blaspheming Christ.… Again, he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, “You might even be found opposing God!”
