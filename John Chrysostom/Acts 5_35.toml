But let us look over again what has been spoken. You men of Israel take heed to yourselves (Acts 5:35). See here, I pray you, how mildly Gamaliel reasons, and how he says but a few words to them, and does not recount ancient histories, although he might have done so, but more recent instances, which are most powerful to produce belief. With this view he throws out a hint himself, saying, For before these days Acts 5:36: meaning, not many days before. Now had he at once said, Let these men go, both himself would have fallen into suspicion, and his speech would not have been so effective: but after the examples, it acquired its own proper force. And he mentions not one instance, but a second also: for, says the Scripture, in the mouth of two witnesses Matthew 18:16: and yet he had it in his power to mention even three.

And that he may not be suspected of taking their part, he addresses them as if he and they were of the same opinion, and does not use much vehemence, but as speaking to men intoxicated through passion, he thus expresses himself: You men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men. Acts 5:35 Do not, he would say, go to work rashly and in a hurry.
