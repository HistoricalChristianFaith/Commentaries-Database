“They lead him therefore from Caiaphas to Pilate.” This was done in order that the number of his judges might show, even against their will, how fully tested his truth was. “And it was early.” He was led to Caiaphas before the rooster crowed, but early in the morning to Pilate. By this the Evangelist shows that though he was questioned all during half the night, he was proved guilty in nothing and that as a result he was sent to Pilate. But leaving what passed then to the other Evangelists, he goes to what followed.

John speaks of what follows next. Observe the ridiculous conduct of the Jews. They who had seized the innocent and taken up arms do not enter into the hall of judgment “lest they should be polluted.” And tell me, what kind of pollution was it to set foot in a judgment hall where wrongdoers suffer justice? Those who paid tithes of mint and anise did not think they were polluted when bent on killing unjustly, but they thought that they polluted themselves by even treading in a court of justice. And why did they not kill him instead of bringing him to Pilate? In the first place, the greater part of their rule and authority had been cut away when their affairs were placed under the power of the Romans. And besides, they feared lest they should be punished later if they were accused by him. But what does it mean, “that they might eat the Passover”? He had already done this on the first day of unleavened bread. Either he calls the whole feast “the Passover” or means that they were then keeping the Passover, while Jesus had done so one day sooner, reserving his own sacrifice for the preparation day, when the Passover was celebrated of old. But they, though they had taken up arms, which was unlawful, and were shedding blood, are scrupulous about the place and summon Pilate to themselves.
