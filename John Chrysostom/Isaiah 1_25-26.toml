For we will not mimic the false prophets who say that most things have been done by them. This is the meaning of “to corrupt,” when someone dilutes the wine, or when someone sells something which ought to be given away freely. He seems to me to be both taunting them regarding money and hinting at the fact that they have mingled the things of God with their own things, as I have said. This is the accusation of Isaiah, who says, “Your wine merchants mingle wine with water.” Even if this statement were about wine, one would not sin to say it of doctrine as well. He says, “We do not do this, but we offer to you what we have been given, pouring out the undiluted word.”
