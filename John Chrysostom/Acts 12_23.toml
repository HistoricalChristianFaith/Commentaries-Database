But see how (the writer) here does not hide these things. Why does he mention this history? Say, what has it to do with the Gospel, that Herod is incensed with the Tyrians and Sidonians? It is not a small matter, even this, how immediately justice seized him; although not because of Peter, but because of his arrogant speaking. And yet, it may be said, if those shouted, what is that to him? Because he accepted the acclamation, because he accounted himself to be worthy of the adoration. Through him those most receive a lesson, who so thoughtlessly flattered him (al. οἱ κολακεύοντες). Observe again, while both parties deserve punishment, this man is punished. For this is not the time of judgment, but He punishes him that had most to answer for, leaving the others to profit by this man's fate. And the word of God, it says, grew, i.e. in consequence of this, and multiplied.

Notice how the writer does not conceal this. Why does he mention this story? Tell me, what does it have to do with the gospel that Herod is incensed with the Tyrians and Sidonians?… But it is of no small importance how immediately justice overtook him, even though it was not on account of Peter but because of his own haughtiness. And yet, one may ask, if it was those people who shouted, what does it have to do with him? But he accepted the acclamation, he deemed himself worthy of the adoration. Through him a lesson is taught, especially to those who flattered him without cause. Do you see how both parties deserved punishment, but only he was chastised? For this is not the time of judgment. He punishes the one who had most to answer for and leaves the rest to benefit by this man’s example. “But the word of God,” it says, “grew and multiplied” after this had happened.
