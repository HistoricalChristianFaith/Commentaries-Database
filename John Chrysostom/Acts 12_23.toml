Notice how the writer does not conceal this. Why does he mention this story? Tell me, what does it have to do with the gospel that Herod is incensed with the Tyrians and Sidonians?… But it is of no small importance how immediately justice overtook him, even though it was not on account of Peter but because of his own haughtiness. And yet, one may ask, if it was those people who shouted, what does it have to do with him? But he accepted the acclamation, he deemed himself worthy of the adoration. Through him a lesson is taught, especially to those who flattered him without cause. Do you see how both parties deserved punishment, but only he was chastised? For this is not the time of judgment. He punishes the one who had most to answer for and leaves the rest to benefit by this man’s example. “But the word of God,” it says, “grew and multiplied” after this had happened.
