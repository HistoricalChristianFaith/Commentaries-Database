"And he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized. And having taken food, he recovered strength." He was faint, therefore, both from his journey and from his fear; both from hunger, and from dejection of mind. Wishing therefore to deepen his dejection, He made the man blind until the coming of Ananias: and, that he might not imagine the blindness to be only fancy, this is the reason of the scales. He needed no other teaching: that which had befallen was made teaching to him.

And why saith it, "Having taken food, he was strengthened?" Because they that are in such case become relaxed: he had no heart to partake of food before, until he obtained the mighty gifts. It seems to me, that both Paul and Cornelius, at the very instant when the words were spoken, received the Spirit. And yet in this case the giver was no great one. So true is it, that there was naught of man's in the things done, nor aught was done by man, but God was present, the Doer of these things. And at the same time the Lord both teaches him to think modestly of himself, in that He does not bring him to the Apostles who were so admired, and shows that there is nothing of man here. He was not filled, however, with the Spirit which works signs: that in this way also his faith might be shown; for he wrought no miracles.
