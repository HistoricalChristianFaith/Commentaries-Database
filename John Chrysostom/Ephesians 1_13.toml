By this seal God shows great forethought for humanity. He not only sets apart a people and gives them an inheritance but secures it as well. It is just as if someone might stamp his heirs plainly in advance; so God set us apart to believe and sealed us for the inheritance of future glory.

What does “in the Spirit of promise” mean? That we have now received him according to his promise. There are two promises, first through the prophets and finally through the Son.
