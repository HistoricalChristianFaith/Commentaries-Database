With great fervor before Jesus’ knees, the leper pleaded with him with sincere faith. He discerned who Jesus was. He did not state conditionally, “If you request it of God” or “If you pray for me.” Rather, he said simply, “If you will, you can make me clean.” He did not pray, “Lord, cleanse me.” Rather, he leaves everything to the Lord and makes his own recovery depend entirely on him. Thus he testified that all authority belongs to him.One might ask, “What if the leper had been mistaken in this assumption?” If he had been mistaken, wouldn’t it have been fitting for the Lord to reprove him and set him straight? But did he do this? No. Quite to the contrary, Jesus established and confirmed exactly what he had said.
