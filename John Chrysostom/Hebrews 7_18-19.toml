Was the law then of no use? It was indeed of use and of great use, but to make humans perfect it was of no use. For in this respect he says, “the law made nothing perfect.” All were figures, all shadows: circumcision, sacrifice, sabbath. Therefore they could not reach through the soul, and thus they pass away and gradually withdraw. But “a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.”
