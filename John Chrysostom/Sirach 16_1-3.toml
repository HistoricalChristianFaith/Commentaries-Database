Is it not true that not only do we fail to take to heart the care of our children but insidiously target and oppose those who would do so and end by being more cruel toward our children than barbarians? The cruelty of barbarians amounts only to reducing their enemies to slavery, the destruction and subjugation of their country and the outrage of bodily torture. You, however, reduce their very souls to slavery, fastening them with fetters like slaves, giving them over as prey to wicked and ferocious demons and to their passions. Indeed, by the fact that you give them no spiritual counsel nor permit others who are disposed to carry out this duty to do so, your conduct is in no way different. And no one should say to me that many who have ignored their children, even more than did Eli, have not suffered anything of the kind. On the contrary, many, in quite a few cases and for similar faults, have had to undergo even worse punishments. Indeed, what was the origin of early death? What caused the damage, the calamities, the misfortunes, the innumerable evils? Is it not perhaps that we neglect the duty of correcting our children when they err? And that this conclusion is not mere conjecture is sufficiently demonstrated by the disgrace of the elderly Eli. And I also refer you to the words that one of our wise men wrote on this theme. Speaking precisely of children, he says, “Do not delight in your children if they are godless. If they do not fear God, do not expect a long life for them.”

“O that my head were water, and my eyes a fountain of tears!” It is seasonable for me to utter these words now, yes, much more than for the prophet in his time. For although I am not about to mourn over many cities or whole nations, yet shall I mourn over a soul that is of equal value with many such nations, yes, even more precious. For if one person who does the will of God is better than ten thousand transgressors, then you were formerly better than ten thousand Jews. This is why no one would now blame me if I were to compose more lamentations than those that are contained in the prophet and to utter complaints yet more vehement. For it is not the overthrow of a city that I mourn, or the captivity of wicked people, but the desolation of a sacred soul, the destruction and effacement of a Christ-bearing temple.
