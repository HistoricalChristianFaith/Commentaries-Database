Here most of all Christ shows his dignity, for to foretell things to come is especially the property of God. Now if he also learned this from others, he will have nothing more than the prophets. But here Christ declares a knowledge brought into exact agreement with God so that it is impossible that he should speak anything else. But “shall receive of mine” means “shall receive, either of the grace that came into my flesh or of the knowledge that I also have, not as needing it or as learning it from another, but because it is one and the same.” And why did he speak this way and not otherwise? Because they do not yet understand the word concerning the Spirit, which is why he provides for one thing only, that the Spirit should be believed and received by them and that they should not be offended. For since he had said, “One is your Teacher, even Christ”—so that they might not think that they disobeyed him in obeying the Spirit—he says, “his teaching and mine are one. Whatever I would have taught is what he also will speak. Do not suppose his words are other than mine, for those words are mine and confirm my opinion. For the will of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is one.” He also wants this for us, which is why he says, “that they may be one, as you and I are one.”

In this way, then, he raised their spirits. For there is nothing for which people so long as the knowledge of the future.… He relieves them from all anxiety by showing them that dangers would not fall on them unawares.
