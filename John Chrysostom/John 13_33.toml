“Where I go, you cannot come.” He shows that his death is a removal and a change for the better to a place that does not admit corruptible bodies. This he says both to excite their love toward him and to make it more fervent. You know that when we see any of our dearest friends departing from us, our affection is warmest, and the more so when we see them going to a place to which it is not even possible for us to go. He said these things then, terrifying the Jews but kindling longing in the disciples. This is such a place that not only they, but not even you, my most beloved, can come there. In this statement he also makes clear his own dignity [since he can go there].
