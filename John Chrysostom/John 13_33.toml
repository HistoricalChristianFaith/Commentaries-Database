And therefore He said, little children; for He did not mean to speak to them, as Hehad to the Jews. you cannot follow Me now, He says, in order to rouse the love of His disciples. For the departure of loved friends kindles all our affection, and especially if they are going to a place where we cannot follow them. He purposely too speaks of His death, as akind of translation, a happy removal to a place, where here mortal bodies do not enter.
Or, as I have loved you: forMy love has not been the payment of something owing to you, but had its beginning on Myside. And you ought in like manner to do one another good, though you may not owe it.
Passing over the miracles, which they were to perform, He makes love: the distinguishing mark of His followers; By this stall all men know that you are My disciplesâ€™ if you have love one to another. This it is that evidences the saint or the disciple, as He calls him.
