And how said He before, The gate is narrow and the way strait? Matthew 7:13 Whilst you are careless, while you are supine; whereas, if you duly perform His words, the burden will be light; wherefore also He has now called it so.

But how are they duly performed? If you have become lowly, and meek, and gentle. For this virtue is the mother of all strictness of life. Wherefore also, when beginning those divine laws, with this He began. Matthew 5:3 And here again He does the very same, and exceeding great is the reward He appoints. For not to another only do you become serviceable; but yourself also above all you refresh, says He. For you shall find rest unto your souls.
