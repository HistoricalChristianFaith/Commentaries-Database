Further, the restoration of this [unwritten natural law] by a written law, after it had been corrupted, was the work of grace. Moreover, the logical consequence was that they who transgressed the precept, once it had been given, be punished and dishonored; this, however, was not what took place. Rather, reinstatement once more and pardon: not due, of course, but given out of mercy and grace. In proof that it was given out of mercy and grace, listen to what David says: “The Lord works deeds of mercy and judgment for all that suffer wrong. He has made known his ways to Moses, his deeds to the children of Israel.” And again: “The Lord is good and righteous; he will give a law to sinners in the way.”
