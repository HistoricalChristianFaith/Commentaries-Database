At the same time requiting the Jews, and making a defense for Christ. For since they had given Him up as worthless, and attempted to confirm this sentence by making Him share the punishment of the robbers, in order that for the future it might be in no man's power to prefer evil charges against him, or to accuse him as a worthless and wicked person, to close moreover their mouths and the mouths of all who might desire to accuse Him, and to show that they had risen up against their own King, Pilate thus placed, as on a trophy, those letters, which utter a clear voice, and show forth His Victory, and proclaim His Kingdom, though not in its completeness. And this he made manifest not in a single tongue, but in three languages; for since it was likely that there would be a mixed multitude among the Jews on account of the Feast, in order that none might be ignorant of the defense, he publicly recorded  the madness of the Jews, in all the languages. For they bore malice against Him even when crucified.  Yet what did this harm you?  Nothing. For if He was a mortal and weak, and was about to become extinct, why did you fear the letters asserting that He is the King of the Jews? And what do they ask? Say that 'he said.' For now it is an assertion, and a general sentence, but if 'he said' be added, the charge is shown to be one arising from his own rashness and arrogance. Still Pilate was not turned aside, but stood to his first decision. And it is no little thing that is dispensed even from this circumstance, but the whole matter. For since the wood of the cross was buried, because no one was careful to take it up, inasmuch as fear was pressing, and the believers were hurrying to other urgent matters; and since it was in after times to be sought for, and it was likely that the three crosses would lie together, in order that the Lord's might not be unknown, it was made manifest to all, first by its lying in the middle, and then by the title. For those of the thieves had no titles.

2. The soldiers parted the garments, but not the coat.  See the -->prophecies--> in every instance fulfilled by their wickednesses; for this also had been predicted of old; yet there were three crucified, but the matters of the -->prophecies-->  were fulfilled in Him. For why did they not this in the case of the others, but in His case only? Consider too, I pray you, the exactness of the prophecy. For the Prophet says not only, that they parted, but that they did not part. The rest therefore they divided, the coat they divided not, but committed the matter to a decision by lot. And the, Woven from the top John 19:23 is not put without a purpose; but some say that a figurative assertion is declared by it, that the Crucified was not simply man, but had also the Divinity from above.  Others say that the Evangelist describes the very form  of the coat.  For since in Palestine they put together two strips of cloth and so weave their garments, John, to show that the coat was of this kind, says, Woven from the top; and to me he seems to say this, alluding to the poorness of the garments, and that as in all other things, so in dress also, He followed a simple  fashion.

Pilate wrote a title that both requited the Jews and made a defense for Christ. They had given him up as worthless and attempted to confirm his sentence by making him share the punishment of the robbers. He does this in order that, in the future, it might be in no one’s power to bring evil charges against Jesus or accuse him of being a worthless and wicked person. He closes their mouths and the mouths of all who might desire to accuse him and shows that they had risen up against their own king. Pilate, however, places those letters almost as if he were placing them on a trophy—letters that proclaim in a clear voice Jesus’ victory and kingdom.
