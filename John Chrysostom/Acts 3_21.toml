"Who was purposely designed," says he: in Whom there is nothing novel. Here he also alarms them, by the thought that much remains to be fulfilled. But if so, how says he, "Hath fulfilled?" The things which it was necessary "that Christ should suffer," are fulfilled: the things which must come to pass, not yet.
