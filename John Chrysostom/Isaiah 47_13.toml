[God the] Father devoted a large portion of his discourse to prophecy when he took a stand against the cult images. “Let them tell the things that shall come to you”; and again, “I have declared and have saved; and there was no strange one among you,” and throughout the entire prophecy he stressed this point. Prophecy is indeed especially the work of God, which the demons would not be able to imitate, even if they should strive very hard.
