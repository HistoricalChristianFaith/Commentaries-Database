The son of this David, Solomon by name, was caught by the same snare as his father, and out of complacence to women fell away from the God of his fathers. You see how great an evil it is not to master pleasure, not to upset the ruling principle in nature and for a man to be slave of women. This same Solomon, then, who was formerly righteous and wise but who ran a risk of being deprived of all the kingdom on account of his sin, God permitted to keep the sixth part of the government on account of the renown of his father.
