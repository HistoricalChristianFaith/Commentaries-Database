Do you see, how all that he has said, tends to turn them to this one thing, advancement in virtue? "Only let your manner of life be worthy of the Gospel of Christ." What means this word "only," but that this, and nought else, is the only thing we should seek? If we have this, nothing grievous will befall us. "That whether I come and see you, or be absent, I may hear of your state." This he says not as if he had changed his purpose, and no longer meant to visit them. But if this come to pass, he says, even though absent, I am able to rejoice. "If," that is, "I hear that you stand fast in one spirit, with one soul." This is what above all things unites believers, and maintains love unbroken, "that they may be one." [John 17:11] For a "kingdom divided against itself shall not stand." [Mark 3:24] For this cause he everywhere counsels his disciples much to be of one mind. And Christ says, "By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you love one another." [John 13:35] That is, do not look with expectation toward me, and therefore slumber, as waiting for my coming, and then, when you see me not coming faint. For even from report I can receive pleasure likewise.

What means, "In one spirit"? By the same gift of grace, viz. that of concord, and zeal; for the Spirit  is one, and he shows it; for then are we able to stand in "one soul," also, when we all have "one Spirit." See how the word "one" is used for concord. See how their souls being many are called one. Thus was it of old. "For they were all," it is written, "of one heart and of one soul. Striving together for the faith of the Gospel." [Acts 4:32] Does he say, striving together for each other,  as though the faith did strive? For did they wrestle against each other? But help each other, he says, in your striving for the faith of the Gospel.

All that he has said is for this single purpose, to exhort them to live a life worthy of the gospel.â€¦ What does only mean? This is the one thing looked for, and nothing else. Where this is, no hurt can befall us.

He does not imply by saying this that he is changing his mind or that he is not going to come. Rather he is saying whether he comes or not, regardless of what comes to pass, they may stand firm even in his absence.
