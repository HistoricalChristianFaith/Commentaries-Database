And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house, and so immediately gave proof of their kindness towards him. And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway. He washed them, and was himself baptized, he and his house. And they spake the word to him, and to all that were in his house. And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed their stripes: washed them and was washed: those he washed from their stripes, himself was washed from his sins: he fed and was fed.
