Him of whose divinity they had received such certain proofs, they call only a man.
They say this to alarm the people; as if they were incurring the suspicion of setting up an usurper. If, say they, the Romans in crowds follow Him, they will suspect us of setting up a tyranny, and will destroy our state. But this was as wholly a fiction of their own. For what was the fact? Did He take armed men about with Him, did He go with horsemen in His train? Did He not rather choose desert places to goto? However, that they might not be suspected of consulting only their own interests, they declare the whole state is in danger.
When they hesitated, and asked, What do we? One of them gave most cruel and shameless advice, viz. Caiaphas, who was High Priest that same year.
See the great virtue of the Holy Spirit, in drawing forth a prophecy from a wicked man. And see too the virtue of the pontifical office, which made him, though an unworthy High Priest, unconsciously prophesy. Divine grace only used his mouth; it touched not his corrupt heart.
They sought before to kill Him; now their resolution was confirmed.

They still call Him man, these who had received such proof of His divinity. What do we? They ought to have believed, and served, and bowed down to Him, and no longer to have deemed Him a man.
