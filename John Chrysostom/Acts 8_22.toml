Even this he did only formally, as words of course, when he ought to have wept and mourned as a penitent. If perchance it may be forgiven you. Not as though it would not have been pardoned, had he wept, but this is the manner of the Prophet also, to denounce absolutely, (ἀ παγορεύειν) and not to say, Howbeit, if you do this, your sin shall be forgiven, but that in any wise the punishment shall take effect.

For had it been done with simplicity, he would have even welcomed his willing mind. Do you see that to have mean conceptions of great things is to sin doubly? Accordingly, two things he bids him: Repent and pray, if haply the thought of your heart may be forgiven you. Acts 8:22 Do you see it was a wicked thought he had entertained? Therefore he says, If haply it may be forgiven you: because he knew him to be incorrigible.
