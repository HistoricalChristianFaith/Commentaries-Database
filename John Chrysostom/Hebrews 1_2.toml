And the expressions “of old” and “in these last days” foreshadow some other meaning; when a long time had intervened, when we were on the edge of punishment, when the gifts had failed, when there was no expectation of deliverance, when we were expecting to have less than all—it was then that we were given more.

He said, “in these last days,” for by this he both stirs up and encourages those despairing of the future. For as he says also in another place, “The Lord is at hand; have no anxiety about anything,” and again, “For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.” So also here. What then does he say? That whoever is spent in the conflict, hearing of the end of it, recovers his breath a little, knowing that it is the end indeed of his labors and the beginning of his rest.
