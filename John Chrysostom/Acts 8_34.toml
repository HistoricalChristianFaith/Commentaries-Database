But meanwhile, as I was saying, let us be ashamed of ourselves in comparison to the eunuch on account of his baptism and his reading. He lived in wealth and power, but look, he allowed himself no rest even on the road. What must he have been like at home, in his leisure hours, this man who could not bear to be idle even on his travels? What must he have been like at night? Those of you who are in stations of dignity, pay attention! Imitate his modesty and piety! Although he was about to return home, he did not say to himself, “I am going back to my own country; there I shall receive baptism.” Such were the cold words spoken by many. But he did not need signs; he did not need miracles. From the prophet alone he believed.… But why is it that he sees him not before he goes to Jerusalem but after? It was necessary that he should not see the apostles under persecution, because he was still weak. He was not easily satisfied, for no prophet instructed him. Since even now, if someone should wish to devote himself to the study of the prophets, he does not need miracles. And, if you please, let us take up the prophecy itself.… He probably heard that he was crucified, that “his life is taken away from the earth” and everything else about him, “who had done no wrong,” that he prevailed to save others as well, and who he is, whose generation is unutterable. He probably saw the riven rocks there and heard how the veil was rent, and how there was darkness, and so on. And all these things Philip said to him, simply taking his text from the prophet. It is a great thing, this reading of the Scriptures! What Moses said was fulfilled, “Sitting, lying down, rising up and walking, remember the Lord your God.”
