Since he said, “You have not visited these yet,” truly Bildad answers, “There is no respite for robbers.” Therefore, he says the opposite of what happens, because there is respite. But in order to play a trick on Job, he speaks in this way. “How then can a mortal be righteous before God?” Indeed, he is necessarily punished. Since Job, in fact, said, I wanted to be judged, and, even though I have not sinned, I am chastised. Bildad replied there is none that is righteous among humankind. How is it possible, he says, that any righteous person will ever exist? Therefore you desire in vain to be judged and examined.
