He brings forward as witnesses the high priest and the elders. On the one hand, [Paul] makes himself their equal when he says, “I being a zealot just as you,” but then he shows through his deeds that he was a greater zealot than they. “I wasn’t waiting around,” he says, “to arrest them, but I was even stirring up the priests and being sent abroad. And I wasn’t after just men, as you are, but I sought out women too, put them in chains and even threw them into prison.” This is irrefutable testimony. His Jewish credentials could not be disputed. Count the witnesses he brings forward: the body of elders, the high priest, those in the city. Note how his defense is not fearful but instructive rather and educational. Had his audience not been stone, they would have given heed to his words.

Then he brings forward proofs also, saying, "and I persecuted this way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women. As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders." "How does this appear?" As witnesses he brings forward the high-priest himself and the elders. He says indeed, "Being a zealot, as ye:" but he shows by his actions, that he went beyond them. "For I did not wait for an opportunity of seizing them: I both stirred up the priests, and undertook journeys: I did not confine my attacks, as ye did, to men, I extended them to women also: both binding, and casting into prisons both men and women."

This testimony is incontrovertible; the unbelief of the Jews is left without excuse. See how many witnesses he brings forward, the elders, the high-priest, and those in the city. Observe his defence, how it is not of cowardly fear for himself, that he pleads, no, but for teaching and indoctrination. For had not the hearers been stones, they would have felt the force of what he was saying. For up to this point he had themselves as witnesses.
