So then the disciples were afraid of him, and the Apostles did not trust him; by this therefore he relieves them of their fear. With the Hellenists: he means those who used the Greek tongue: and this he did, very wisely; for those others, those profound Hebrews had no mind even to see him. But they, it says, went about to slay him: a token, this, of his energy, and triumphant victory, and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Thereupon, fearing lest the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Cæsarea. For it says, When the brethren were aware of this, they brought him down to Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus

“But they,” it says, “went about to slay him.” This is a sign of his energy and triumphant victory and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Fearing that the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, “When the brothers were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus,” at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by grace [particular acts of providence]. Note how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way, so to cut off the excuse of idle people, for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.
