“But they,” it says, “went about to slay him.” This is a sign of his energy and triumphant victory and of their exceeding annoyance at what had happened. Fearing that the issue should be the same as in the case of Stephen, they sent him to Caesarea. For it says, “When the brothers were aware of this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him forth to Tarsus,” at the same time to preach, and likely to be more in safety, as being in his own country. But observe, I pray you, how far it is from being the case that everything is done by grace [particular acts of providence]. Note how, on the contrary, God does in many things leave them to manage for themselves by their own wisdom and in a human way, so to cut off the excuse of idle people, for if it was so in the case of Paul, much more in theirs.
