Do these things then still require any interpreting? Are they not plain even to those ever so senseless? And before our words, the very issue of facts has anticipated us in bearing witness to what was said. For at what time have they ever been so open to attacks? At what time such an easy prey? At what time has He so "bowed down their backs?" At what time have they been set under such bondage? And what is more, there is not to be any unloosing from these terrors. And this the prophet has also hinted. For he does not say only, "bow Thou down their back," but, "forever bow Thou down." But if you are disposed to dispute, O Jew, about the issue, from what has gone before learn also the present case. Thou went down to Egypt; and two hundred years passed, and God freed you speedily from that bondage, and that though thou were irreligious, and went whoring with the most baneful whoredom. You were freed from Egypt, and you worshipped the calf, you sacrificed your sons to Baalpeor, you defiled the temple, you went after every sort of vice, you grew not to know nature itself. The mountains, the groves, the hills, the springs, the rivers, the gardens did you fill with accursed sacrifices, you slew the prophets, overthrew the altars, exhibited every excess of wickedness and irreligion. Still, after giving you up for seventy years to the Babylonians, He brought you back again to your former freedom, and gave you back the temple, and your country, and your old form of polity  and there were prophets again, and the gift of the Spirit. Or rather, even in the season of your captivity you were not deserted, but even there were Daniel, and Ezekiel, and in Egypt Jeremiah, and in the desert Moses. After this you reverted to your former vice again, and wast a reveller ἐ ξεβακχεύθης] [2 Maccabees 14:33], therein, and changed your manner of life πολιτείαν to the Grecian in the time of Antiochus the impious Daniel 8:14; [1 Maccabees 4:54]. But even then for a three years and a little over only were ye given up to Antiochus, and then by the Maccabees ye raised those bright trophies again. But now there is nothing of the sort, for the reverse has happened throughout. And this is ground for the greatest surprise, as the vices have ceased, and the punishment has been increased, and is without any hope of a change. For it is not seventy years only that have passed away, nor a hundred, nor yet twice as many but three hundred, and a good deal over, and there is no finding even a shadow of a hope of the kind. And this though ye neither are idolaters, nor do the other audacious acts ye did before. What then is the cause? The reality has succeeded to the type, and grace has shut out the Law. And this the prophet foretelling from of old said, "And ever bow Thou down their back." See the minuteness of prophecy, how it foretells their unbelief, and also points out their disputatiousness, and shows the judgment which should follow, and sets forth the endlessness of the punishment. For as many of the duller sort, through unbelief in what was to come to pass, wished to see things to come by the light of things present, from this point of time God gave proof of His power on either part, by lifting those of the Gentiles who believed, above the heaven, but bringing down such of the Jews as believed not to the lowest estate of desolation, and giving them up to evils not to be ended. Having then urged them severely both about their not believing, and about what they had suffered and were yet to suffer, he again allays what he had said by writing as follows:

Do these words need any interpretation? Are they not plain to everyone?
