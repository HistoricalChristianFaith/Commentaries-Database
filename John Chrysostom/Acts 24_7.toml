Then comes the accusation against Lysias. “It was not right for him,” he says, “to drag him away with great violence.” … “He tried,” he says, “to profane the temple,” but [Tertullus] does not say how. He also magnified what concerned Paul, but see how he diminished what concerned him. “We seized him,” he says, “and would have judged him according to our law.” He claims that it was unpleasant to them to come to foreign courts and that they would have not given trouble to [Felix], if he had not forced them, and that it was not right for Lysias to take Paul away. “These,” he says, “were in fact offenses against us, because the trial ought to have taken place among us.” See now the rest as a confirmation that things were so, “with great violence,” he says. That, indeed, was violence. “From him,” he says, “you will be able to learn.” … He puts Paul in the position to become his own accuser. “From him,” he says, “you will be able to know by judging.” And the very witnesses of the things that were said, they are the accusers—they are the witnesses and the accusers.
