And see what a vindication! So writes Festus, and the ruthlessness of the Jews is openly made a show of: for when it is the governor that says these things, he is a witness above all suspicion: so that the Jews are condemned by him also. For, when all had pronounced sentence against them, then, and not sooner, God brings upon them the punishment. But observe: Lysias gave it against them, Felix against them, Festus against them - although he wished to gratify them - Agrippa against them. What further? The Pharisees - even they gave it against themselves. No evil, says Festus, "of such things as I supposed: no accusation did they bring against him." And yet they did bring it: true, but they did not prove it: for their evil design and daring plot against him gave cause to surmise this, but the examination brought out nothing of the kind.
