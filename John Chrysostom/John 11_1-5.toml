(Greg. Hom. lxii. 1) First we are to observe that this was not the harlot mentioned in Luke, but an honest woman, who treated our Lord with marked reverence.

(Hom. lxii. 1) They hope to excite Christ's pity by these words, Whom as yet they thought to be a man only. Like the centurion and nobleman, they sent, not went, to Christ; partly from their great faith in Him, for they knew Him intimately, partly because their sorrow kept them at home.

(Hom. lxii. 1) That here signifies not the cause, but the event. The sickness sprang from natural causes, but He turned it to the glory of God.
