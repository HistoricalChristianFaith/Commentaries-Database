O the folly of the men! They feared, says he, the multitude. Why, how had the multitude helped the Apostles? When they ought to have feared that God Who was continually delivering them like winged creatures out of their power, instead of that, they feared the multitude! And the high-priest, shameless, reckless, senseless, asked them, saying, Did not we strictly command you that you should not teach in this name? And, behold you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend to bring this man's blood upon us. (v. 27, 28.) What then (say the Apostles)? Again with mildness they address them; and yet they might have said, Who are you, that you countermand God? But what do they say? Again in the way of exhortation and advice, and with much mildness, they make answer.
