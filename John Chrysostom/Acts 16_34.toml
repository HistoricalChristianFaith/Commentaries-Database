And when he had brought them into his house, he set meat before them, and rejoiced, believing in God with all his house. And rejoiced, it says: although there was nothing but words only and good hopes: having believed in God with all his house: this was the token of his having believed - that he was released of all. What worse than a jailer, what more ruthless, more savage? He entertained them with great honor. Not, because he was safe, he made merry, but, having believed God.
