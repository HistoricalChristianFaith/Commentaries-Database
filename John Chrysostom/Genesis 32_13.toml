See the good man’s godliness and proper sense of values in requesting nothing from the Lord other than fulfillment of his promises. After giving thanks for his former benefits by confessing that while naked and destitute he had been brought to such affluence, Jacob entreats God to snatch him from danger. Recall that Jacob says, “You told me, ‘I will make your descendants to be like the sand of the sea, which in number will defy counting.’ ” Having made this appeal to the Lord, however, and having offered this supplication to the Lord, Jacob also made every effort on his own part. Selecting gifts from what he brought with him, the text says, Jacob sent them to his brother, spacing out what was sent and giving instructions with the aim of appeasing Esau by word and alerting him to his own arrival. Recall that the text says, “ ‘Behold, your servant is right behind us,’ so as first to appease him, and then we can meet face to face.” “After this,” remember Jacob says, “I will meet him face to face; perhaps he will be pleased to see me.” The gifts went ahead of him.
