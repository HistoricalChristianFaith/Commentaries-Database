"For Christ is not entered into the Holy Places made with hands" (he says) "which are the figures of the True." (These then are true; and those are figures, for the temple too has been so arranged, as the Heaven of Heavens.)

What sayest thou? He who is everywhere present, and who filleth all things, doth not He "appear" unless He enter into Heaven? Thou seest that all these things pertain to the flesh.

"To appear," he says, "in the presence of God for us." What is "for us"? He went up (he means) with a sacrifice which had power to propitiate the Father. Wherefore (tell me)? Was He an enemy? The angels were enemies, He was not an enemy. For that the Angels were enemies, hear what he says, "He made peace as to things on earth and things in Heaven." (Col. i. 20.) So that He also "entered into Heaven, now to appear in the presence of God for us." He "now appeareth," but "for us."

The Jews greatly prided themselves on the temple and the tabernacle. Wherefore they said, "The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord." (Jer. vii.4.) For nowhere else in the earth was such a temple constructed as this, either for costliness, or beauty, or anything else. For God who ordained it, commanded that it should be made with great magnificence, because they also were more attracted and urged on by material things.

But the second temple was a more glorious building, both on account of its beauty, and in all other respects. Nor was it reverenced for this reason only, but also from its being One. For they were wont to resort thither from the uttermost parts of the earth, whether from Babylon or from Ethiopia.

What then does Paul do? What he did in regard to the sacrifices, that also he does here. For as there he set against them the death of Christ, so here also he sets the whole heaven against the temple.

And not by this alone did he point out the difference, but also by adding that The Priest is nearer to God: for he says, "to appear in the presence of God." So that he made the matter august, not only by the consideration of heaven, but also by that of Christ's entering in there. For not merely through symbols as here, but He sees God Himself there.

Seest thou that condescension through the lowly things have been said throughout? Why dost thou then any longer wonder that He intercedes there, where He places Himself as a High Priest?
