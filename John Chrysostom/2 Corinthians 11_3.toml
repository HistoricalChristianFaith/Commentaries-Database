"But I fear lest by any means, as the serpent beguiled Eve through his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ." "For although the destruction be yours [alone], yet is the sorrow mine as well." And consider his wisdom. For he does not assert, although they were corrupted; and so he showed when he said, "When your obedience is fulfilled," and "I shall bewail many which have sinned already;" but still he does not leave them to get shameless. And therefore he says, "lest at any time." For this neither condemns nor is silent; for neither course were safe, whether to speak out plainly or to conceal perpetually. Therefore he employs this middle form, saying, "lest at any time." For this is the language neither of one that entirely distrusts, nor entirely relies on them, but of one who stands between these two. In this way then he palliated, but by his mention of that history threw them into an indescribable terror, and cuts them off from all forgiveness. For even although the serpent was malignant, and she senseless, yet did none of these things snatch the woman from punishment. "Beware then," he says, "lest such be your fate, and there be naught to screen you. For he too promising greater things, so deceived." Whence it is plain that these too, by boasting and puffing themselves up, deceived.

And he does not say, "Lest by any means as Adam was deceived:" but shows that those men are but women who are thus abused, for it is the part of woman to be deceived. And he did not say, "so ye also should be deceived:" but keeping up the metaphor, he says, "so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity that is toward Christ." "From the simplicity, I say, not from wickedness; neither out of wickedness [is it], nor out of your not believing, but out of simplicity." But, nevertheless, not even under such circumstances are the deceived entitled to forgiveness, as Eve showed. But if this does not entitle to forgiveness, much more will it not do so, when through vain-glory any is so.
