From faith alone, he says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson to those (objectors); this is able to teach even them that faith only is needed, not works nor circumcision. For indeed they do not say all this only by way of apology for the Gentiles, but to teach (the Jewish believers) also to abandon the Law. However, at present this is not said. Now therefore why do you tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples?

Why then, hearts are what one must everywhere look to. And it is very appositely said, God that knows the hearts bare them witness: as in the former instance, You, Lord, that know the hearts of all men. Acts 1:24 For to show that this is the meaning, observe what he adds, Put no difference between us and them. When he has mentioned the testimony borne to them, then he utters that great word, the same which Paul speaks, Neither circumcision avails anything, nor uncircumcision. 1 Corinthians 7:19 That he may make the two one in Himself. Ephesians 2:5 Of all these the seeds lie in Peter's discourse. And he does not say (between) them of the circumcision, but Between us, that is the Apostles, and them. Then, that the expression, no difference may not seem an outrage, After faith, he says— Having purified their hearts by faith

“And God who knows the heart bore witness to them.” He refers them to the spiritual testimony, “giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.” Everywhere he places the Gentiles on an equal footing. “And he made no distinction between us and them but cleansed their hearts by faith.” From faith alone, he says, they obtained the same gifts. This is also meant as a lesson to those [objectors]; this is able to teach even them that faith alone is necessary, and not works or circumcision. For indeed they do not say all this only as an apology for the Gentiles, but also to teach [the Jewish believers] to abandon the law. For the moment, however, this is not said. “Now therefore why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.” What does “make trial of God” mean? As if he were not strong enough, he means, to save by faith, that is, “why do you disbelieve God?” Thus it is from a want of faith that the law is brought in.… “But we believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will.” How powerful are these words! Likewise Paul says in the epistle to the Romans, “For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to glory in, but not before God.” Do you see that all this is more a lesson for them than an apology for the Gentiles?
