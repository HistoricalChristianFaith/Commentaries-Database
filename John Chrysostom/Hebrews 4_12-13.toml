Do not then, when hearing the Word, think of it lightly. For “he is sharper,” he says, “than any sword.” Observe God’s condescension, and hence consider why the prophets also needed to speak of saber and bow and sword. “If a person does not repent,” it is said, “God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow.” For if even now, after so long a time and after their being perfected, he cannot smite down by the name of the Word alone, but needs these expressions in order to show the superiority arising from the comparison of the gospel with the law, much more was this true of old.…He judges the inner heart, for there he passes through, both punishing and searching out. “And why do I speak of men?” he says. For even if you speak of angels, of archangels, of the cherubim, of the seraphim, even of any “creature” whatsoever, all things are laid open to God’s eye. All things are clear and manifest. There is nothing able to escape it. “All are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.” But what is meant by “open”? The metaphor comes from the skins which are drawn off from the prey.… When one has killed them and drawn aside the skin from the flesh, he lays open all the inward parts and makes them manifest to our eyes; so also do all things lie open before God. And observe, I ask you, how he constantly needs bodily images, which arise from the weakness of the hearers. For that they were weak he made plain when he said that they were “dull” and “had need of milk, not solid food.”
