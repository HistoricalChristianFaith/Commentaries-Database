After such a great miracle, the crowd does not ask Jesus how he had crossed over or how he had arrived there. In fact, they do not seem to be concerned about it at all. They ask him, “Rabbi, when did you get here?” but what they are really asking is “How did you get here?” And see how shallow they are. After noting that he was “that prophet” and trying to take him by force to make him king, they do nothing of the sort when they finally do find him.
