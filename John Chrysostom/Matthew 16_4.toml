But see their hardened heart, how on being told, that no sign should be given them but the sign of the prophet Jonas, they do not ask. And yet, knowing both the prophet, and all that befell him, and having been told this a second time, they ought to have inquired and learned what the saying could mean; but, as I said, there is no desire of information in these their doings. For this cause He also left them, and departed.

As then in the sky there is one sign of fair weather, and another of rain, soought ye to think concerning me; now, in this My first coming, there is need of these signs which are done in the earth; but those which are done in heaven are reserved for the time of the second coming. Now I come as a physician, then as a judge; now I come in secret, then with much pomp, when the powers of the heavens shall be shaken. But now is not the time of these signs, now have Icome to die, and to suffer humiliations; as it follows, “An evil and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign, and there shall no sign he given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet.”.
And when the Pharisees heard this, they ought to have asked Him, What it was Hemeant? But they had not asked at first with any desire of learning, and therefore the Lord leaves them, as it follows, “And he left them, and went his way.”
