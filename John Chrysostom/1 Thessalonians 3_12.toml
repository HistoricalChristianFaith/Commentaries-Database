This is a proof of superabundant love, that he not only prays for them by himself but even inserts his prayer in his epistles. Paul’s prayers demonstrate a fervent soul unable to restrain his love. The mention of his prayers also proves that Paul and Silvanus’s failure to visit them was not voluntary nor the result of indolence. It is as though Paul said: May God himself shorten the trials that constantly distract us, so that we may come directly to you. “And the Lord make you to increase and abound.” Do you see the unrestrained madness of love that is shown by these words?
