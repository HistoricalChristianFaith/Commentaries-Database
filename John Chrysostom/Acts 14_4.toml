No small matter this dividing. And this was what the Lord said, I am not come to bring peace, but a sword. Matthew 10:34 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use them despitefully, and to stone them, they were aware of it, and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lies round about: and there they preached the Gospel.
