Observe in this, I ask you, a mystery and a prediction of what is to come. You see, after the midwife bound the scarlet thread around his hand to make Zerah recognizable, then “he drew his hand back, and his brother came out.” He yielded precedence to his brother, it is saying, and the one thought last came out first, and the one thought first emerged after him. “The midwife said, ‘What a breach you have made for yourself!’ He was called Perez.” The name, in fact, means “breach” or “division,” as you might say. “After him came his brother with the mark on his right hand; he was given the name Zerah,” which means “sunrise.”It was not idly or to no purpose that these things happened; rather, it was a type of things to come, revealing the events themselves. You see, what happened was not according to natural processes. I mean, how would it have been possible, after his hand was bound with crimson, for him to draw back again and give way to the one after him, unless there were some divine power arranging this in advance? It was also prefiguring, as if in a kind of shadow, the fact that right from the outset Zerah, which means sunrise (he is, after all, a type of the church), began to peer ahead; as he moved gradually forward and then retired, the legal observance denoted by Perez made its entrance. After that had held precedence for a long time, the former one—I mean Zerah, who had retired—came forward, and the whole Judaic way of life in turn yielded place to the church.
