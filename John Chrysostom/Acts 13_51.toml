“But they shook off the dust from their feet against them,” he says, “and went to Iconium.” Here they used that terrible sign, which Christ enjoined, “If any do not receive you, shake off the dust from your feet.” But these did not do it lightly but because they were driven away by them. In no way did this hurt the disciples; on the contrary, all the more did they continue in the word, “And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.” For the suffering of the teacher does not check his boldness but makes the disciple more courageous.
