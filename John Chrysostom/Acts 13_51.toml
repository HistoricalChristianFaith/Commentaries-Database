"But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium." Here now they used that terrible sign which Christ enjoined, "If any receive you not, shake off the dust from your feet"; but these did it upon no light ground, but because they were driven away by them. This was no hurt to the disciples; on the contrary, they the more continued in the word.

Then, what is more terrible, "they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium. But the disciples, it says, were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost." The teachers were suffering persecution, and the disciples rejoiced.
