As if they were acting deceitfully, and plotting on behalf of  Christ. O you accursed, utterly accursed! What father would choose to invent such falsehoods against his child? For they almost say, Whom you have made out blind, and not only so, but have spread abroad the report everywhere.

How then does he now see?

2. O folly! Yours, says one, is the trick  and the contrivance. For by these two things do they attempt to lead the parents to a denial; by using the words, Whom ye say, and, How then does he now see? Now when there were three questions asked, whether he was their son, whether he had been blind, and how he received his sight, the parents only acknowledged two of them, but do not add the third. And this came to pass for the sake of the truth, in order that none other save the man that was healed, who was also worthy  of credit, should acknowledge this matter. &nbsp;And how would the parents have favored (Christ), when even of what they knew some part they spoke not through fear of the Jews? What say they?

Having brought the parents into the middle of the assembly in order to intimidate them, they angrily begin a fierce interrogation: “Is this your son?” Notice, they do not say, “who was born blind” but “who you say was born blind.” … What kind of a father would say such things about his son if they were not true? Why not say at once, “Whom you made blind”?… They try two ways of making them deny the miracle by saying, “who you say was born blind” and then by adding, “How then does he now see?”
