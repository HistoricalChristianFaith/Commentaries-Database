And having first set down, “Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled,” he shows that he rightly added what follows. For if marriage has been conceded, justly is the fornicator punished, justly does the adulterer suffer recompense.…He did not say again, “Let no one be a fornicator”; but, having said it once for all, he then went on as with a general exhortation, and not as directing himself against them. “Be content with what you have,” he says. He did not say, “Possess nothing,” but “be content with what you have”; that is, let it show forth the philosophical character of your mind. And it will show it, if we do not seek superfluities, if we keep only to what is necessary. For he says above also, “you joyfully accepted the plundering of your goods.” He gives these exhortations that they might not be covetous.
