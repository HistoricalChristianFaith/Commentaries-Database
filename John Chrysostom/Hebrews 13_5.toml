Let your conversation be without covetousness, he says. He did not say, Possess nothing, but, Let your conversation be without covetousness: that is, let it show forth the philosophical character of your mind. [And it will show it, if we do not seek superfluities, if we keep only to what is necessary.] For he says above also, And ye took joyfully the spoiling of your goods. Hebrews 10:34 He gives these exhortations, that they might not be covetous.
