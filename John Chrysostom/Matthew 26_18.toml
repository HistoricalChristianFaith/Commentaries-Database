And for what possible reason does He send them to an unknown person? To show by this also that He might have avoided suffering. For He who prevailed over this man's mind, so that he received them, and that by words; what would He not have done with them that crucified Him, if it had been His will not to suffer? And what He did about the ass, this He did here also. For there too He says, If any man say anything unto you, you shall say, that the Lord has need of them; Matthew 21:3 and so likewise here, The Master says, I will keep the passover at your house. But I marvel not at this only, that he received Him, being unknown, but that expecting to bring upon himself such enmity and implacable hostility, he despised the enmity of the multitude.

After this, because they knew him not, He gave them a sign, like as the prophet touching Saul, saying, You shall find one going up and carrying a bottle; 1 Samuel 10:3 and here, carrying a pitcher. And see again the display of his power. For He did not only say, I will keep the passover, but He adds another thing also, My time is at hand. And this He did, at once continually reminding His disciples of the passion, so that exercised by the frequency of the prediction, they should be prepared for what was to take place; and at the same time to show to themselves, and to him that was receiving Him, and to all the Jews, which I have often mentioned, that not involuntarily does He come to His passion. And He adds, with my disciples, in order that both the preparation should be sufficient, and that the man should not suppose that He was concealing Himself.
