If Paul had disdained their relief, they would inevitably have become more lax. To prevent this, see how he treats the matter. What he has said may have distressed them, but what he is yet to say will give them a new zeal for life.… How had they shared his trouble? By … “suffering for Christ.” … He does not refer simply to their giving but to their being partakers in Christ. This shows that the blessings are theirs insofar as they become partakers in Christ. He does not refer to his troubles being lightened but to his troubles being shared. This is much more personal.
