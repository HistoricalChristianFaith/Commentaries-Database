“For three weeks,” it says, “he argued with them from the Scriptures.” That is, when they were not at work. For this is what Christ, too, did; he often made his argument from the Scriptures and not by miracles. For his listeners were hostile and accused him of being a deceiving sorcerer. For it is natural for him who tries to persuade people by miracles alone to be suspected, but one who persuades by the Scriptures does not arouse this suspicion. Indeed, we often see Paul persuading people by his teaching. In Antioch, for example, “the whole city gathered together” to hear his teaching. This is something so great: it is not a small but an exceedingly great miracle.
