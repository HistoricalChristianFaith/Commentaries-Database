"Three sabbath-days," it says, being the time when they had leisure from work, "he reasoned with them, opening out of the Scriptures": for so used Christ also to do: as on many occasions we find Him reasoning from the Scriptures, and not on all occasions urging men by miracles. Because to the working of miracles indeed they stood in a posture of hostility, calling them deceivers and jugglers; but he that persuades men by reasons from the Scriptures, is not liable to this imputation. And on many occasions we find Paul to have convinced men simply by force of teaching: and in Antioch "the whole city was gathered together" (ch. xiii. 44): so great a thing is this also, for indeed this itself is no small miracle, nay, it is even a very great one.
