So that he that hears not these sayings not only does not love Me, but neither does he love the Father. For if this is the sure proof of love, the hearing the commandments, and these are of the Father, he that hears them loves not the Son only, but the Father also. And how is the word 'yours' and 'not yours'? This means, I speak not without the Father, nor say anything of Myself contrary to what seems good to Him.
