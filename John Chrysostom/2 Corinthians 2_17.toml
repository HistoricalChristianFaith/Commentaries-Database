'For even if we use great sounding words, yet we declared nothing to be our own that we achieved, but all Christ's. For we will not imitate the false apostles; the men who say that most is of themselves.' For this is to corrupt, when one adulterates the wine; when one sells for money what he ought to give freely. For he seems to me to be here both taunting them in respect to money, and again hinting at the very thing I have said, as that they mingle their own things with God's; which is the charge Isaiah brings when he said, Your vintners mingle wine with water: Isaiah 1:22, Septuagint for even if this was said of wine, yet one would not err in expounding it of doctrine too. 'But we,' says he, 'do not so: but such as we have been entrusted with, such do we offer you, pouring out the word undiluted.' Whence he added, But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ.

'We do not,' says he 'beguile you and so preach, as conferring a gift on you, or as bringing in and mingling somewhat from ourselves, but as of God; that is, we do not say that we confer any thing of our own, but that God has given all.' For of God means this; To glory in nothing as if we had it of our own, but to refer every thing to Him. Speak we in Christ.

Not by our own wisdom, but instructed by the power that comes from Him. Those who glory speak not in this way, but as bringing in something from themselves. Whence he elsewhere also turns them into ridicule , saying, For what have you that thou did not receive? But if you received it, why do you glory as if you had not received it. 1 Corinthians 4:7 This is the highest virtue, to refer every thing to God, to consider nothing to be our own, to do nothing out of regard to men's opinion, but to what God wills. For He it is that requires the account. Now however this order is reversed: and of Him that shall sit upon the tribunal and require the account, we have no exceeding fear, yet tremble at those who stand and are judged with us.

4. Whence then is this disease? Whence has it broken out in our souls? From not meditating continually on the things of that world, but being rivetted to present things. Hence we both easily fall into wicked doings, and even if we do any good thing we do it for display, so that thence also loss comes to us. For instance, one has looked on a person often with unbridled eyes, unseen of her or of those who walk with her , yet of the Eye that never sleeps was not unseen. For even before the commission of the sin, It saw the unbridled soul, and that madness within, and the thoughts that were whirled about in storm and surge; for no need has He of witnesses and proofs Who knows all things. Look not then to your fellow-servants: for though man praise, it avails not if God accept not; and though man condemn, it harms not if God do not condemn. Oh! provoke not so your Judge; of your fellow-servants making great account, yet when Himself is angry, not in fear and trembling at Him. Let us then despise the praise that comes of men. How long shall we be low-minded and grovelling? How long, when God lifts us to heaven, take we pains to be trailed along the ground? The brethren of Joseph, had they had the fear of God before their eyes, as men ought to have, would not have taken their brother in a lonely place and killed him. Genesis 37 Cain again, had he feared that sentence as he should have feared, would not have said, Come, and let us go into the field: Genesis 4:8, Septuagint for to what end, O miserable and wretched! Do you take him apart from him that begot him, and leadest him out into a lonely place? For does not God see the daring deed even in the field? Have you not been taught by what befell your father that He knows all things, and is present at all things that are done? And why, when he denied, said not God this unto him: 'Hidest thou from Me Who am present every where, and know the things that are secret?' Because as yet he knew not aright to comprehend these high truths. But what says he? The voice of your brother's blood cries unto Me. Not as though blood had a voice; but like as we say when things are plain and clear, the matter speaks for itself. 

Wherefore surely it behooves to have before our eyes the sentence of God, and all terrors are extinguished. So too in prayers we can keep awake, if we bear in mind with whom we are conversing, if we reflect that we are offering sacrifice and have in our hands a knife and fire and wood; if in thought we throw wide the gates of heaven, if we transport ourselves there and taking the sword of the Spirit infix it in the throat of the victim: make watchfulness the sacrifice and tears the libation to Him. For such is the blood of this victim. Such the slaughter that crimsons that altar. Suffer not then anything of worldly thoughts to occupy your soul then.  Bethink you that Abraham also, when offering sacrifice, suffered nor wife nor servant nor any other to be present. Neither then do thou suffer any of the slavish and ignoble passions to be present unto you, but go up alone into the mountain where he went up, where no second person is permitted to go up. And should any such thoughts attempt to go up with you, command them with authority, and say, Sit there, and I and the lad will worship and return to you; Genesis 22:5. Septuagint and leaving the ass and the servants below, and whatever is void of reason and sense, go up, taking with you whatever is reasonable, as he took Isaac. And build your altar so as he, as having nothing human, but having outstepped nature. For he too, had he not outstepped nature, would not have slain his child. And let nothing disturb you then, but be lift up above the very heavens. Groan bitterly, sacrifice confession, for, says he, Declare first your transgressions that you may be justified, Isaiah 43:26, Septuagint, sacrifice contrition of heart. These victims turn not to ashes nor dissolve into smoke nor melt into air; neither need they wood and fire, but only a deep-pricked heart. This is wood, this is fire to burn, yet not consume them. For he that prays with warmth is burnt, yet not consumed; but like gold that is tried by fire becomes brighter.

5. And withal observe heedfully one thing more, in praying to say none of those things that provoke your Master; neither draw near [to pray] against enemies. For if to have enemies be a reproach, consider how great the evil to pray against them. For need is that thou defend yourself and show why you have enemies: but thou even accusest them. And what forgiveness shall you obtain, when thou both revilest, and at such a time when yourself needest much mercy. For you drew near to supplicate for your own sins: make not mention then of those of others, lest you recall the memory of your own. For if you say, 'Smite mine enemy,' you have stopped your mouth, you have cut off boldness from your tongue; first, indeed, because you have angered the Judge at once in beginning; next, because thou asks things at variance with the character of your prayer. For if you come near for forgiveness of sins, how do you discourse of punishment? The contrary surely was there need to do, and to pray for them in order that we may with boldness beseech this for ourselves also. But now you have forestalled the Judge's sentence by your own, demanding that He punish them that sin: for this deprives of all pardon. But if you pray for them, even if you say nothing in your own sins' behalf, you have achieved all. Consider how many sacrifices there are in the law; a sacrifice of praise, a sacrifice of acknowledgment, a sacrifice of peace , a sacrifice of purifications, and numberless others, and not one of them against enemies, but all in behalf of either one's own sins or one's own successes. For do you come to another God? To him you come that said, Pray for your enemies. Luke 6:27-35; Romans 12:14 How then do you cry against them? How do you beseech God to break his own law? This is not the guise of a suppliant. None supplicates the destruction of another, but the safety of himself. Why then do you wear the guise of a suppliant, but hast the words of an accuser? Yet when we pray for ourselves, we scratch ourselves and yawn, and fall into ten thousand thoughts; but when against our enemies, we do so wakefully. For since the devil knows that we are thrusting the sword against ourselves, he does not distract nor call us off then, that he may work us the greater harm. But, says one, 'I have been wronged and am afflicted.' Why not then pray against the devil, who injures us most of all. This you have also been commanded to say, Deliver us from the evil one. He is your irreconcileable foe, but man, do whatsoever he will, is a friend and brother. With him then let us all be angry; against him let us beseech God, saying, Bruise Satan under our feet; Romans 16:20 for he it is that breeds also the enemies [we have]. But if you pray against enemies, you pray so as he would have you pray, just as if for your enemies, then against him. Why then letting him go who is your enemy indeed, do you tear your own members, more cruel in this than wild beasts. 'But,' says one, 'he insulted me and robbed me of money;' and which has need to grieve, he that suffered injury, or he that inflicted injury? Plainly he that inflicted injury, since while he gained money he cast himself out of the favor of God, and lost more than he gained: so that he is the injured party. Surely then need is not that one pray against, but for him, that God would be merciful to him. See how many things the three children suffered, though they had done no harm. They lost country, liberty, were taken captive and made slaves; and when carried away into a foreign and barbarous land, were even on the point of being slain on account of the dream, without cause or object. Daniel 2:13 What then? When they had entered in with Daniel, what prayed they? What said they? Dash down Nabuchodonosor, pull down his diadem, hurl him from the throne? Nothing of this sort; but they desired mercies of God. Daniel 2:18. Septuagint And when they were in the furnace, likewise. But not so ye: but when you suffer far less than they, and oftentimes justly, you cease not to vent ten thousand imprecations. And one says, 'Strike down my enemy as You overwhelmed the chariot of Pharaoh;' another, 'Blast his flesh;' another again, 'Requite it on his children.' Recognize ye not these words? Whence then is this your laughter? Do you see how laughable this is, when it is uttered without passion. And so all sin then discovers how vile it is, when you strip it of the state of mind of the perpetrator. Should thou remind one who has been angered of the words which he said in his passion, he will sink for shame and scorn himself and wish he had suffered a thousand punishments rather than those words to be his. And should you, when the embrace is over, bring the unchaste to the woman he sinned with, he too will turn away from her as disgusting. And so do ye, because you are not under the influence of the passion, laugh now. For worthy to be laughed at are they, and the words of drunken old gossips; and springing from a womanish littleness of soul. And yet Joseph, though he had been sold and made a slave, and had tenanted a prison, uttered not even then a bitter word against the authors of his sorrows. But what says he? Indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews; Genesis 40:15 and adds not by whom. For he feels more ashamed for the wickedness of his brethren, than they who wrought them. Such too ought to be our disposition, to grieve for them who wrong us more than they themselves do. For the hurt passes on to them. As then they who kick against nails, yet are proud of it, are fit objects of pity and lamentation on account of this madness; so they who wrong those that do them no evil, inasmuch as they wound their own souls, are fit objects for many moans and lamentations, not for curses. For nothing is more polluted than a soul that curses, or more impure than a tongue that offers such sacrifices. You are a man; vomit not forth the poison of asps. You are a man; become not a wild beast. For this was your mouth made, not that you should bite but that you should heal the wounds of others. 'Remember the charge I have given you,' says God, 'to pardon and forgive. But you beseech Me also to be a party to the overthrow of my own commandments, and devourest your brother, and reddenest your tongue, as madmen do their teeth on their own members.' How, do you think, the devil is pleased and laughs, when he hears such a prayer? And how, God is provoked, and turns from and abhors you, when you beseech things like these? Than which, what can be more dangerous? For if none should approach the mysteries that has enemies: how must not he, that not only has, but also prays against them, be excluded even from the outer courts themselves? Thinking then on these things, and considering the Subject of the Sacrifice, that He was sacrificed for enemies; let us not have an enemy: and if we have, let us pray for him; that we too having obtained forgiveness of the sins we have committed, may stand with boldness at the tribunal of Christ; to whom be glory for ever. Amen.

Paul will not imitate the false apostles, who claim rewards for themselves. For corruption occurs when one sells for money what one ought to give freely. Paul speaks in Christ, not by his own wisdom but by the power which comes from him.
