"For we are not as the rest, which corrupt the word of God."

'For even if we use great sounding words, yet we declared nothing to be our own that we achieved, but all Christ's. For we will not imitate the false apostles; the men who say that most is of themselves.' For this is "to corrupt," when one adulterates the wine; when one sells for money what he ought to give freely. For he seems to me to be here both taunting them in respect to money, and again hinting at the very thing I have said, as that they mingle their own things with God's; which is the charge Isaiah brings when he said, "Thy vintners mingle wine with water:" for even if this was said of wine, yet one would not err in expounding it of doctrine too. 'But we,' saith he, 'do not so: but such as we have been entrusted with, such do we offer you, pouring out the word undiluted.'

Whence he added, "But as of sincerity, but as of God, in the sight of God speak we in Christ."

'We do not,' saith he 'beguile you and so preach, as conferring a gift on you, or as bringing in and mingling somewhat from ourselves, "but as of God;" that is, we do not say that we confer any thing of our own, but that God hath given all.' For "of God" means this; To glory in nothing as if we had it of our own, but to refer every thing to Him. "Speak we in Christ." Not by our own wisdom, but instructed by the power that cometh from Him. Those who glory speak not in this way, but as bringing in something from themselves.

Whence he elsewhere also turns them into ridicule, saying, "For what hast thou that thou didst not receive? but if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received it." This is the highest virtue, to refer every thing to God, to consider nothing to be our own, to do nothing out of regard to men's opinion, but to what God willeth. For He it is that requireth the account. Now however this order is reversed: and of Him that shall sit upon the tribunal and require the account, we have no exceeding fear, yet tremble at those who stand and are judged with us.
