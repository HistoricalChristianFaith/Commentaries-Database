"But there was a certain man, called Simon, which before time in the same city used sorcery, and bewitched the people of Samaria." Observe another trial, this affair of Simon. "Giving out," it says, "that he was himself some great one. To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries." "Of a long time" was the malady, but this man (Philip) brought them deliverance.

"And to him they all gave heed, saying, This man is the Power of God." And that was fulfilled which was spoken by Christ, "There shall come false Christs and false Prophets in My name." "And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had bewitched them with sorceries." And yet there ought to have been not one demoniac there, seeing that of a long time he had been bewitching them with sorceries: but if there were many demoniacs, many palsied, these pretences were not truth.
