Observe Peter from the first standing aloof (κεχωρισμένον) from the affair, and even to this time judaizing. And yet (says he) ye know. ch. 10:45; 11:2 Perhaps those were present who of old found fault with him in the matter of Cornelius, and went in with him (on that occasion): for this reason he brings them forward as witnesses. From old days, he says, did choose among you. What means, Among you? Either, in Palestine, or, you being present. By my mouth. Observe how he shows that it was God speaking by him, and no human utterance. And God, that knows the hearts, gave testimony unto them: he refers them to the spiritual testimony: by giving them the Holy Ghost even as unto us.

See how Peter was, from the beginning, removed from the debate and how he was following the ways of the Jews even still. “You know,” he says. Perhaps some of those who had once accused him with regard to Cornelius were present and had entered with him, so that he brings them as witnesses. “From the ancient days God chose among you.” What does “among you” mean? It means either “in Palestine” or the “you” is those who were present. “Through my mouth.” See how [Peter] shows that God spoke through him and there was nothing human. “And God, who knows human hearts, testified to them”—he refers them to the testimony of the Spirit—“by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us.”
