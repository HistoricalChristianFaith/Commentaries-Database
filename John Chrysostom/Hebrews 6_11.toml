We desire, he says, and we do not therefore merely labor for, or even so far as words go, wish this. But what? We desire that you should hold fast to virtue, not as condemning your former conduct (he means), but fearing for the future. And he did not say, 'not as condemning your former conduct, but your present; for you have fainted, you have become too indolent'; but see how gently he indicated it, and did not wound them.

For what does he say? But we desire that every one of you do show the same diligence unto the end. For this is the admirable part of Paul's wisdom, that he does not expressly show that they had given in, that they had become negligent. For when he says, We desire that every one of youâ€” it is as if one should say, I wish you to be always in earnest; and such as you were before, such to be now also, and for the time to come. For this made his reproof more gentle and easy to be received.

And he did not say, I will, which would have been expressive of the authority of a teacher, but what is expressive of the affection of a father, and what is more than willing, we desire. All but saying, Pardon us, even if we say what is distasteful.

We desire that every one of you do show the same diligence to the full assurance of your hope unto the end. Hope (he means) carries us through: it recovers us again. Be not wearied out, do not despair, lest your hope be in vain. For he that works good hopes also good, and never despairs of himself.
