For when the disciples had done, as Jesus had appointed them, "when the even was come, He sat down with the twelve. And as they did eat, He said," we are told, "Verily, I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me." And before the supper, He had even washed his feet. And see how He spares the traitor. For He said not, such a one shall betray me; but, "one of you," so as again to give him power of repentance by concealment. And He chooseth to alarm all, for the sake of saving this man. Of you, the twelve, saith He, that are everywhere present with me, whose feet I washed, to whom I promised so many things.
