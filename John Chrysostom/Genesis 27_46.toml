Notice how she found a plausible excuse. You see, whenever help from on high comes to support us, problems become simple and difficulties easy. So, since she too had the Lord of all seconding her intention, he put into her mind everything capable of bringing to realization the plan in process for her son’s survival. “I am disgusted with life on account of the daughters of the Hittites. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of this land, what meaning would life have for me?” Here there seems to be a reference to the immorality of Esau’s wives and the fact that they proved a source of great disgust to Isaac and Rebekah. Sacred Scripture narrated to us previously, you remember, that Esau took wives from the Hittites and Hivites: “They were at odds with Isaac and Rebekah.” So, wishing to remind him of this, she more or less says to him, “You know how Esau’s wives made life unpleasant for me, and how, on account of their hostility, I am now alienated from all the daughters of the Hittites and hate the lot of them on their account. So if it happens that Jacob takes a wife from among them, what hope of survival would then be left for me? What meaning would life have for me?” I mean, “if we can’t put up with them, if even Jacob goes so far as to marry one of the daughters of this land, life is over for us.”
