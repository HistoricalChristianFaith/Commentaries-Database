Lo! He was deemed worthy of the Voice also. I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. (v. 32, 33.) Lo! how He shows that He is none other than the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob— He, the Angel of the Great Counsel. (Isaiah 9:6. LXX. Wonderful, Counsellor, E.V.) Here he shows what great loving-kindness God herein exhibits. Then Moses trembled, and dared not behold. Then said the Lord to him, Put off your shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy ground. Not a word of Temple, and the place is holy through the appearance and operation of Christ. Far more wonderful this than the place which is in the Holy of Holies: for there God is nowhere said to have appeared in this manner, nor Moses to have thus trembled. And then the greatness of His tender care.

And now come, I will send you into Egypt.
