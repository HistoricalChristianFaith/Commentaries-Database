You be the first to show respect. Do not wait to be saluted by others. But this is not a mere salutation; it is also a blessing. For “if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it.” But if they treat you with insolence, their first reproach will be to not receive the benefit of your peace, and the last will be that they will suffer the doom of Sodom. You are to seek out the houses of those who are worthy. If you shake the dust off your feet, you are showing either that you have not been received and heard or that you are attesting to them the long journey you have traveled for their sake.
