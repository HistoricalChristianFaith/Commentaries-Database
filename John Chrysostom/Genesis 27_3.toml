Notice in this, dearly beloved, God’s ineffable wisdom: Whereas the father gave evidence of natural affection by giving these directions to Esau, the wise and resourceful Lord caused his own prediction to be brought to pass by means of Rebekah, thus teaching us the power of virtue and mildness of manner. I mean, one son considered himself to hold pride of place by birthright and by his father’s preference for him, and yet he was suddenly found to be bereft of all this. The other son, on the contrary, being endowed with homely virtues and enjoying the help of favor from above, won his father’s blessing against his will. Nothing is more powerful than the person helped by that mighty right hand.In any case, look carefully at all this so as to learn the extraordinary nature of God’s designs: One man enjoyed favor from that source and was accorded great cooperation in everything so that the father’s blessing was transferred to him. The other lost everything, forfeiting what was his because of the evil of his ways.
