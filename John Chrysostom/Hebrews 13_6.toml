"So that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me." Again consolation in their trials.

This then also let us say in all temptations; let us laugh at human things, so long as we have God favorable to us. For as, when He is our enemy, it is no gain, though all men should be our friends, so when He is our friend, though all men together war against us, there is no harm. "I will not fear what man shall do unto me."
