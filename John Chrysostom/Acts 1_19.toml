Now the Jews gave it this name, not on this account, but because of Judas; here, however, Peter makes it to have this reference, and when he brings forward the adversaries as witnesses, both by the fact that they named it, and by saying, in their proper tongue, this is what he means. God compelled them to call the field in Hebrew Aceldama.
