3. Fearful were those things, but these are far more admirable and glorious. For here there is not darkness, nor blackness, nor tempest. It seems to me that by these words he hints at the obscurity of the Old [Testament], and the overshadowed and veiled character of the Law. And besides the Giver of the Law appears in fire terrible, and apt to punish those who transgress.

Wonderful indeed were the things in the Temple, the Holy of Holies; and again awful were those things also that were done at Mount Sina, the fire, the darkness, the blackness, the tempest. cf. Deuteronomy 33:2 For, it says, God appeared in Sina, and long ago were these things celebrated. The New Covenant, however, was not given with any of these things, but has been given in simple discourse by God.

See then how he makes the comparison in these points also. And with good reason has he put them afterwards. For when he had persuaded them by innumerable [arguments], when he had also shown the difference between each covenant, then afterwards, the one having been already condemned, he easily enters on these points also.
