"And, behold - this too was part of his defence - three men stood at the house in which I was, sent to me from Caesarea. And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting." Do you mark that it is to the Spirit the enacting of laws belongs! "And these also accompanied me" - nothing can be more lowly, when he alleges the brethren for witnesses! - "these six men, and we entered into the man's house."
