The point is not that they differed in their opinions but that they accommodated themselves to each other. Thus a greater good resulted from their parting, for which this provided an excuse. What then? Did they withdraw in enmity? God forbid! Recall how after this Barnabas received much praise from Paul in his epistles. “There arose,” it says, “a sharp contention,” not hatred or rivalry. The contention grew so great that it parted them. For what each supposed was advantageous, this he did not admit after this because of his association with the other. I think that the parting took place advisedly and that they said to each other, “Since I wish to, but you do not, let us distribute the places so that we should not fight.” Therefore it was because they yielded to each other that they parted. For Barnabas wanted Paul to prevail and so withdrew. Likewise Paul wanted Barnabas to prevail and he, too, withdrew. Would that we should part such partings to go forth for preaching. “Paul,” it says, “chose Silas and departed, being commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.” A wonderful man is he, and very great!
