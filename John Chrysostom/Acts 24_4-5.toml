Notwithstanding, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words. For we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world. As a revolutionary and seditious person he wishes to deliver him up. And yet, it might be answered, it is ye that have done this. And see how he would put up the judge to a desire of punishing, seeing he had here an opportunity to coerce the man that turned the world upside down! As if they had achieved a meritorious action, they make much of it: Having found this fellow, a mover of sedition, say they, among all the Jews throughout the world. Had he been such, they would have proclaimed him as a benefactor and saviour of the nation! And a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. They thought this likely to tell as a reproach - of the Nazarenes: and by this also they seek to damage him - for Nazareth was a mean place. And, we have found him, say they: see how maliciously they calumniate him: found him, as if he had been always giving them the slip, and with difficulty they had succeeded in getting him: though he had been seven days in the Temple!
