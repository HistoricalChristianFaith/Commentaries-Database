Who was this “one” who cut off the ear? John says it was Peter. For this was an act of fervor. Another point deserves inquiry: Why were the disciples bearing swords? That they indeed bore swords is evident from the text both here and in the other accounts. But why did Christ even permit them to have swords? For Luke affirms also that “one of them struck the servant of the high priest, cutting off his right ear,” remembering that in Luke Jesus had said to them, “When I sent you without purse, traveling bag and shoes, did you lack anything?” And when they said, “Nothing,” he said to them, “But now, he that has a purse, let him take it, and a bag, and he that has no sword, let him sell his garment, and buy one.” And when they said, “Here are two swords,” he said to them, “It is enough.” So why did they have swords? Because he had said to them, “Let him buy a sword.” Yet this was not meant that they should arm themselves, far from it, but to indicate that he was to be betrayed. The swords had prophetic rather than military purpose. They indicated his being forcefully seized and betrayed.

Peter is rebuked for using his sword and for his severe threat. He was resisting the servant who came indeed with hostility. He was not defending himself but doing this on behalf of his Master.Christ however did not permit any harm to ensue. For he healed [the servant] and manifested a great miracle, enough to indicate at once both his forbearance and his power and the affection and meekness of his disciple. Peter had acted from affection. Now he acts from duty. For when he heard, “Put your sword back into its place,” he obeyed immediately.

One of his followers, in another account, asked, “Lord should we strike with our swords?” But it is clear in all accounts that he rejected it and healed the man and rebuked his disciple in such a way that he might move him to acquiescence. “For all who take the sword will perish by the sword.” Then he adds, “Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?” By these words he quenched their anger, appealing to holy Scripture. He prayed that the disciples might accept meekly whatever befell him when they had learned that this also is occurring according to God’s will. His response is twofold: He is able to appeal to his Father, and he is able to resist the angry passions of his supposed defenders with these words: “All who take the sword will perish by the sword.”
