Ver. 3. "The aged women likewise, that they be in behavior as becomes holiness."

That is, that in their very dress and carriage they exhibit modesty.

"Not false accusers, not given to much wine."

For this was particularly the vice of women and of old age. For from their natural coldness at that period of life arises the desire of wine, therefore he directs his exhortation to that point, to cut off all occasion of drunkenness, wishing them to be far removed from that vice, and to escape the ridicule that attends it. For the fumes mount more easily from beneath, and the membranes (of the brain) receive the mischief from their being impaired by age, and this especially causes intoxication. Yet wine is necessary at this age, because of its weakness, but much is not required. Nor do young women require much, though for a different reason, because it kindles the flame of lust.

"Teachers of good things."

And yet you forbid a woman to teach; how do you command it here, when elsewhere you say, "I suffer not a woman to teach"? [1 Timothy 2:12] But mark what he has added, "Nor to usurp authority over the man." For at the beginning it was permitted to men to teach both men and women. But to women it is allowed to instruct by discourse at home. But they are nowhere permitted to preside, nor to extend their speech to great length, wherefore he adds, "Nor to usurp authority over the man."
