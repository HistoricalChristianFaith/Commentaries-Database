But is it worthwhile to inquire concerning that point also where he said, “After three days I rise again”? His detractors clearly understood this saying. Even if they did not grasp the metaphor of Jonah, they remembered this. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

But note carefully the disciples’ love of truth. They do not conceal from their reader what was said by their enemies. They call Jesus an impostor.

The Gospel of Matthew, Homily
