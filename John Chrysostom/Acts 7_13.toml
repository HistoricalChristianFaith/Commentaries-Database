It shows, that they were not masters even to the extent of a burying-place. But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose, which knew not Joseph (v. 17, 18). Observe, that it is not during the four hundred years that He multiplies them, but (only) when the end was about to draw near. And yet already four hundred years were passed, nay more, in Egypt. But this is the wonder of it.

They came down to buy, and had to depend upon him for everything. What then did he? [He made himself known to his brethren:] not to this point only did he carry his friendliness; he also made them known to Pharaoh, and brought them down into the land.

[He made himself known to his brethren:] not to this point only did he carry his friendliness; he also made them known to Pharaoh, and brought them down into the land. And Joseph's kindred was made known unto Pharaoh. Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to him, and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls. So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem. But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose, which knew not Joseph.
