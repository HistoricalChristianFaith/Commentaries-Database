Do you see the good man’s great meekness, on the one hand, and their ingratitude, on the other, and how they could not bear to hold their envy in check but even affected their father’s attitude? See now God’s ineffable care and the degree of considerateness he employs when he sees us doing our best. I mean, when he saw the good man the object of their envy, he said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your father and to your birthplace, and I will be with you.” You have had enough of living in a foreign land, he is saying. What I promised you previously in the words “I will return you to your country,” this I now intend to bring to pass. So go back without fear; after all, “I will be with you.” You see, to prevent the good man becoming lethargic in departing instead of taking to the road with confidence, he says, “I will be with you.” The One who has managed your affairs until now and caused your descendants to increase, “I will be with you” in future as well.
