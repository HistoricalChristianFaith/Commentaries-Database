he did not say, I will not, lest he should make the judge more vehement, but (here) again is his great boldness: They cast me out once for all, themselves, and by this they think to condemn me, by their showing that I have offended against Cæsar: at his bar I choose to be judged, at the bar of the injured person himself. To the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well know. Here now he reproved him, that he too wished to sacrifice him to the Jews: then, on the other hand, he relaxes (the sternness of) his speech: if then I be an offender, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die. I utter sentence against myself. For along with boldness of speech there must be also justness of cause, so as to abash (the hearer). But if there be nothing in the things whereof these accuse me, no man— however he may wish it— no man may sacrifice me to please them. He said, not, I am not worthy of death, nor, I am worthy to be acquitted, but, I am ready to take my trial before Cæsar. At the same time too, remembering the dream, he was the more confident to appeal. Acts 23:11 And he said not, Thou (may not), but, neither any other man may sacrifice me, that it might be no affront to him. Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council— do you observe how he seeks to gratify them? For this is favor— having conferred, it says, with the council, he said, Have you appealed unto Cæsar? Unto Cæsar shall you go.
