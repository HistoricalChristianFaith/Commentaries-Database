(Yes,) this is why it was: that they should have God for Witness: this was all. According to the fashion, it says, that was shown you on the mount: so that on the mount was the Original. And this Tabernacle, moreover, in the wilderness, was carried about, and not locally fixed. And he calls it, Tabernacle of witness: i.e. (for witness) of the miracles, of the statutes. This is the reason why both it and those (the fathers) had no Temple. As He had appointed, that spoke unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen. Again, it was none other than He (Christ) that gave the fashion itself.

Even when there was a Tabernacle, yet there were no sacrifices. Did ye offer unto Me slain beasts and sacrifices? Amos 5:25 There was the tabernacle of witness, and yet it profited them nothing, but they were consumed. But neither before, nor afterwards, did the miracles profit them anything. Which also, our fathers that came after brought in. Do you see, how the holy place is there wherever God may be? For to this end also he says, in the wilderness, to compare place with place. Then the benefit (conferred upon them): And our fathers that came after brought it in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. (v. 45, 46.) David desired to find favor: and he built not, he, the wonderful, the great; but the castaway, Solomon.
