Even when there was a Tabernacle, yet there were no sacrifices. Did ye offer unto Me slain beasts and sacrifices? Amos 5:25 There was the tabernacle of witness, and yet it profited them nothing, but they were consumed. But neither before, nor afterwards, did the miracles profit them anything. Which also, our fathers that came after brought in. Do you see, how the holy place is there wherever God may be? For to this end also he says, in the wilderness, to compare place with place. Then the benefit (conferred upon them): And our fathers that came after brought it in with Jesus into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David; who found favor before God, and desired to find a tabernacle for the God of Jacob. (v. 45, 46.) David desired to find favor: and he built not, he, the wonderful, the great; but the castaway, Solomon.

But “there was,” he says, “a tent of witness.” Yes, it was there so that they might have God as witness. This was all. “According to the pattern,” he says, “that was shown to you on the mount.” Thus on the mount was the original. And this, while in the wilderness, was carried about and not fixed in place. He calls it a tent of witness, that is, a witness of the wonders and of the statutes. That is why both it and they had no temple. Again it was he himself, the angel, who gave the type.
