This is meant to show them that he is not perishing, and to teach them. And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge.

This is the reason why his face was also glorified. For God who is merciful wished to make their plots the means of recalling them to himself. And look how many signs there came to be. “Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him,” again outside the city, as in the case of Christ. And in death itself, confession and preaching. “And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. And as they were stoning Stephen, he prayed, ‘Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.’ ” He did this to show them that he is not perishing and also to teach them.
