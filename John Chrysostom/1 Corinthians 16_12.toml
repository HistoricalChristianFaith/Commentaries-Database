Apollos was probably older than Timothy, and some at Corinth may have wondered why Paul did not send him instead. Therefore, Paul reassures them by calling Apollos his brother and by saying that he did try to encourage him to go, but he did not want to at that particular point. Paul did not mean to criticize Apollos when he said this. He merely meant that the time was not right for him to come.
