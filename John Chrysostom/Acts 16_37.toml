But Paul said unto them, they have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out. Even upon the declaration of the magistrates Paul does not go out, but for the sake both of Lydia and the rest he puts them in fear: that they may not be supposed to have come out upon their own request, that they may set the rest in a posture of boldness. The impeachment was twofold: that being Romans, and uncondemned, they had openly cast them into prison. You see that in many things they took their measures as men.

But Paul said unto them: that he may not seem to be receiving his liberty as one condemned, and as one that has done wrong: therefore it is that he says, Having openly beaten us uncondemned - that it may not be matter of grace on their part. And besides, they wish the jailer himself to be out of danger, that he may not be called to account for this afterwards. And they do not say, Having beaten us, who have wrought miracles: for they the magistrates did not even heed these: but, that which was most effectual to shake their minds, uncondemned, and being Romans.
