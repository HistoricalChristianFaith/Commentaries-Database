I mean this: He had said, Get you out of your country, and from your kindred, and I will give you this land. Genesis 12:1-7 He gave him none inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his foot on. Acts 7:5 Do you see how what was done was opposed to the promise? Again He said, In Isaac shall your seed be called Genesis 21:12, and he believed: and again He says, Sacrifice to Me this one, who was to fill all the world from his seed. You see the opposition between the commands and the promise? He enjoined things that were in contradiction to the promises, and yet not even so did the righteous man stagger, nor say he had been deceived.

For you indeed, he means, could not say this, that He promised ease and gave tribulation. For in our case, the things which He promised, these also He performs. How so? In the world (He says), you shall have tribulation. John 16:33 He that takes not his cross and follows Me, is not worthy of Me. Matthew 10:38 He that hates not his life shall not find it. John 12:25 And, He that forsakes not all that he has, and follows after Me, is not worthy of Me. Luke 14:27-33 And again, You shall be brought before rulers and kings for My sake. Matthew 10:18 And again, A man's foes shall be they of his own household. Matthew 10:36 But the things which pertain to rest are yonder.

But with regard to Abraham, it was different. He was enjoined to do what was opposed to the promises; and yet not even so was he troubled, nor did he stagger, nor think he had been deceived. But you endure nothing except what was promised, yet you are troubled.
