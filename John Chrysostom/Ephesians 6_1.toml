Paul has spoken first about the husband, second about the wife; now he moves along this path to children. The husband is responsible for the wife. Both the husband and the wife are responsible for the children.… He speaks to children in an infant voice. He is well aware that if husband and wife are well disposed according to the commands he has laid down, there will be little difficulty in eliciting the cooperation of children.… But what if the parents command foolish things? Generally parents do not command foolish things. But if they should, the apostle has a remedy when he says that parents are to be obeyed “in the Lord.” They are to be obeyed in whatever way they are not offending against God.
