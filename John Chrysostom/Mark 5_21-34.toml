(Hom. in Mat. 31) This woman, who was celebrated and known to all, did not dare to approach the Saviour openly, nor to come to Him, because, according to the law, she was unclean; for this reason she touched Him behind, and not in front, for that she durst not do, but only ventured to touch the hem of His garment. It was not however the hem of the garment, but her frame of mind that made her whole. There follows, For she said, If I may but touch his clothes, I shall be whole.

(Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Macr. v. Chrys. Hom. in Mat. 31.) He calls her daughter because she was saved by her faith; for faith in Christ makes us His children.
