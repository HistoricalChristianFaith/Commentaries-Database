The first man is of the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.

Having said that "the natural was first," and "the spiritual afterward," he again states another difference, speaking of "the earthy" and "the heavenly." For the first difference was between the present life and that which is to come: but this between that before grace and that after grace. And he stated it with a view to the most excellent way of life, saying —(for to hinder men, as I said, from such confidence in the resurrection as would make them neglectful of their practice and of perfection, from this topic also again he renders them anxious and exhorts to virtue, saying,)— "The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven:" calling the whole by the name of "man ," and naming the one from the better, and the other from the worst part.
