This was the Bishop of Jerusalem; and to him Paul is sent on an earlier occasion. This James was brother of the Lord; a great and admirable man. To him, it says, "Paul entered in with us." Mark the Bishop's unassuming behavior: "and the elders" were present. Again Paul relates to them the things relating to the Gentiles, not indulging in vainglory, God forbid, but wishing to show forth the mercy of God, and to fill them with great joy.
