Because it should come to pass that His disciples among their other persecutions should suffer loss of character, which to many is the most grievous of all calamities, He consoles them from His own example, and those things that were spoken of Him; a comfort to which no other can be compared.

Understand, so long as he is a disciple or servant, he is not above his master or lord by the nature of honour. And do not here object to me such cases as rarely happen, but receive this according to the common course of things.

He said not here 'slaves,' but those of his household, to show how dear they were to Him; as elsewhere He said, I will not call you slaves, but my friends. (John 15:15.)

And He says not only, If they have reviled the master of the house, but expresses the very words of railing, for they had called Him Beelzebub.

"The disciple," saith He, "is not above his Master, nor the servant above his Lord. It is enough for the disciple that he be as his Master, and the servant as his Lord. If they have called the Master of the house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of His household? Fear them not therefore."

See how He discovers Himself to be the Lord and God and Creator of all things. What then? Is there not any disciple above his Master, or servant above his Lord? So long as he is a disciple, and a servant, he is not, by the nature of that honor. For tell me not here of the rare instances, but take the principle from the majority. And He saith not, "How much more His servants," but "them of His household," to show how very near He felt them to be to Him. And elsewhere too He said, "Henceforth I call you not servants; ye are my friends." And He said not, If they have insulted the Master of the house and calumniated Him; but states also the very form of the insult, that they "called Him Beelzebub."
