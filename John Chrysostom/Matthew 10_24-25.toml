Because it should come to pass that His disciples among their other persecutions should suffer loss of character, which to many is the most grievous of all calamities, He consoles them from His own example, and those things that were spoken of Him; a comfort to which no other can be compared.

Understand, so long as he is a disciple or servant, he is not above his master or lord by the nature of honour. And do not here object to me such cases as rarely happen, but receive this according to the common course of things.

He said not here 'slaves,' but those of his household, to show how dear they were to Him; as elsewhere He said, I will not call you slaves, but my friends. (John 15:15.)

And He says not only, If they have reviled the master of the house, but expresses the very words of railing, for they had called Him Beelzebub.
