How is it "for them?" How is it "their glory?" It is because God so loved them, as to give even the Son for them, and to afflict His servants for them: for it was in order that they might attain so many blessings, that Paul was in prison. Surely this was from God's exceeding love towards them: it is what God also says concerning the Prophets, "I have slain them by the words of my mouth." [Hosea 6:5] But how was it that they fainted, when another was afflicted? He means, they were troubled, were distressed. This also he says when writing to the Thessalonians, "that no man be moved by these afflictions." [1 Thessalonians 3:3] For not only ought we not to grieve, but we ought even to rejoice. If you find consolation in the forewarning, we tell you beforehand that here we have tribulation. And why pray? Because thus has the Lord ordered.
