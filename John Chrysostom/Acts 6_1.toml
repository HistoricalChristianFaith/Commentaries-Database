Not absolutely in those immediate days; for it is the custom of Scripture to speak of things next about to happen, as taking place in immediate succession. But by Hellenists I suppose he means those who spoke Greek [against the Hebrews]: for they did not use the Greek language. Behold another trial! Observe how from within and from without there are warrings, from the very first!

And this comes of the multitude: for it is impossible to have strict order in a multitude. There arose a murmuring, etc. to—And a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.— There arose murmuring against the Hebrews— for that description of people seemed to be more honorable— because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.

So then there was a daily ministration for the widows. And observe how he calls it a ministration (διακονία), and not directly alms: extolling by this at once the doers, and those to whom it was done. Were neglected. This did not arise from malice, but perhaps from the carelessness of the multitude. And therefore he brought it forward openly, for this was no small evil. Observe, how even in the beginning the evils came not only from without, but also from within. For you must not look to this only, that it was set to rights, but observe that it was a great evil that it existed.

“And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.” It was not absolutely in those immediate days, for it is the custom of Scripture to speak of things that are about to happen as taking place in immediate succession. But by “Hellenists” I suppose he means those who spoke Greek, for these, being Hebrew, spoke Greek. Behold another trial! Observe how from within and from without there are warrings, from the very first! “Then,” it says, “the twelve called the multitude of the disciples to them, and said, It is reasonable that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.” Well said: for the needful must give precedence to the more needful. But see, how they take thought directly for these inferior matters and yet do not neglect the preaching.
