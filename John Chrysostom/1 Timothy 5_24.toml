Ver. 24. "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some they follow after."

In speaking of ordination, he had said, "Be not partaker of other men's sins." But what, he might say, if I be ignorant of them? Why, "some men's sins are open beforehand, going before them to judgment, and some they follow after." Some men's, he means, are manifest, because they, go before, while others' are unknown, because they follow after.

Even as legislators have overlooked punishments for the guilty though they be established by law, so too our Lord Jesus Christ by punishing one or two sinners sets down like an inscription on a bronze stele their punishment and uses their experiences as a warning to all. It says that even if those who dare the same sins do not suffer a similar penalty now, they will suffer a more rigorous one in the future.
