Christ himself mentions this as the cause of wickedness, saying: “Because wickedness is multiplied, most men’s love will grow cold.” Paul says here that they were … traitors to nature. For most of us have a kind of family feeling to one another, which even the beasts share among themselves.… But these men became even more ferocious than the beasts. The disorder which resulted in the world by evil teachings he proves to us by these witnesses and clearly shows that in each case the malady came from the negligence of those who were disordered.
