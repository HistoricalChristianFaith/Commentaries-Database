And Luke indeed says, that He declared what these men should suffer; and they said, God forbid; and He added the testimony [of Scripture]. For He beheld them, and said, What is it then that is written? The stone which the builders rejected, the same has become the head of the corner; and every one that falls upon it shall be broken. Luke 20:17-18 But Matthew, that they themselves delivered the sentence. But this is not a contradiction. For indeed both things were done, both themselves passed the sentence against themselves; and again, when they perceived what they had said, they added, God forbid; and He set up the prophet against them, persuading them that certainly this would be.

Nevertheless, not even so did He plainly reveal the Gentiles, that He might afford them no handle, but signified it darkly by saying, He will give the vineyard to others. For this purpose then did He speak by a parable, that themselves might pass the sentence, which was done in the case of David also, when He passed judgment on the parable of Nathan. But do thou mark, I pray you, even hereby how just is the sentence, when the very persons that are to be punished condemn themselves.
