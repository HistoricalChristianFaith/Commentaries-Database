And this he always does. For when he was upon the subject of alms, he brought Him forward and said, "You know the grace of the Lord, that though He was rich, yet for our sakes he became poor." [2 Corinthians 8:9] And when he was exhorting to charity, it was from Him that he exhorted in the words "As Christ also loved us." [Ephesians 5:25] And when he was giving advice about bearing shame and dangers, he took refuge in Him and said, "Who for the joy that was set before Him endured the Cross, despising the shame." [Hebrews 12:2]. So in this passage too he shows how He also did this, and how the prophet proclaimed it from of old. Wherefore also he proceeds:

"The reproaches of them that reproached You fell upon Me." [Psalm 69:9] But what is the import of, "He pleased not Himself?" He had power not to have been reproached, power not to have suffered what He did suffer, had He been minded to look to His own things. But yet He was not so minded. But through looking to our good He neglected His own. And why did he not say, "He emptied Himself?" [Philippians 2:7] It is because this was not the only thing he wished to point out, that He became man, but that He was also ill-treated, and obtained a bad reputation with many, being looked upon as weak. For it says, "If Thou be the Son of God, come down from the Cross." [Matthew 27:40]. And, "He saved others, Himself He cannot save." [Matthew 27:42]. Hence he mentions a circumstance which was available for his present subject, and proves much more than he undertook to do; for he shows that it was not Christ alone that was reproached, but the Father also. "For the reproaches of them that reproached You fell," he says, "upon Me." But what he says is nearly this, What has happened is no new or strange thing. For they in the Old Testament who came to have a habit of reproaching Him, they also raved against His Son. But these things were written that we should not imitate them. And then he supplies (Gr. anoints) them for a patient endurance of temptations.

Paul always points to Christ’s self-sacrifice when he asks us to make sacrifices.
