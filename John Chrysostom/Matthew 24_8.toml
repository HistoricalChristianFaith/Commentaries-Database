By “wars and rumors of wars” he refers to the troubles that are coming upon them. They supposed after that war the end would come. But see how he warns them: “But the end is not yet. For nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.” He speaks of the preludes to the troubles of the Jews. “All this is but the beginning of the birth pangs,” that is, of the troubles that will befall them. “Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death.” This was the season for being candid about what was to come, in order that they might strengthen one another in facing their common miseries.

Here He speaks of the battles which should be fought at Jerusalem; when He says, “Ye shall hear wars, and rumours of wars.”.
And because this might alarm the disciples, He continues, “See that ye be not troubled.” And because they supposed that the end of the world would follow immediately after the war in which Jerusalem should be destroyed, He corrects their suspicions concerning this, “These things must come to pass, but the endis not yet.”.
And to show that He also should fight against the Jews, He tells them not only of wars, but of calamities inflicted by Providence, “And there shall be pestilences, and famines, and earthquakes in divers places.”.
And these things shall not happen according to the order of nature before established among men, but shall come of wrath from heaven, and therefore He said not that they should come only, or come suddenly, but adds significantly, "These all are the beginnings of troubles,” that is, of the Jewish troubles.
