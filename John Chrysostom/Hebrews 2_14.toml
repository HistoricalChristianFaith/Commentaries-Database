6. Next he sets down also the cause of the economy.  "That through death," he says, "He might destroy him that had the power of death, that is, the devil."

Here he points out the wonder, that by what the devil prevailed, by that was he overcome, and the very thing which was his strong weapon against the world, [namely], Death, by this Christ smote him. In this he exhibits the greatness of the conqueror's power. Do you see how great good death has wrought?

“Since therefore the children,” he says, “share in flesh and blood,” do you see where he says the likeness is? It is in reference to the flesh that “he himself likewise partook of the same.” Let all the heretics be ashamed, let those hide their faces who say that he came in appearance and not in reality. For he did not say, “he took part of these” only and then say no more, although, had he said thus, it would have been sufficient. Rather he asserted something more, adding “likewise”—not in appearance, he means, or by an image, but in reality, showing his brotherhood with us.

Next he sets down also the cause of the economy of salvation, “that through death,” he says, “he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil.” Here [Paul] points out the wonder that, by that through which the devil prevailed, [the devil] was himself overcome. By the very thing that was [the devil’s] strong weapon against the world—death—Christ struck him. In this Christ exhibits the greatness of the conqueror’s power. Do you see what great goodness death has wrought?
