"But to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal."

"And what," says one, "is a working?" and what "a gift?" and what "a ministration?" They are mere differences of names, since the things are the same. For what "a gift" is, that is "a ministration," that he calls "an operation" also. Thus fulfil your ministry; [2 Timothy 4:5. ministry] and, "I magnify my ministration:" [Romans 11:13. office] and writing to Timothy, he says, Therefore I put you in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of God, which is in you. [2 Timothy 1:6] And again, writing to the Galatians, he said, for he that wrought in Peter to the Apostleship, the same was mighty in me toward the Gentiles. [Galatians 2:8] Do you see that he implies that there is no difference in the gifts of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost? Not confounding  the Persons, God forbid! But declaring the equal honor of the Essence. For that which the Spirit bestows, this he says that God also works; this, that the Son likewise ordains and grants. Yet surely if the one were inferior to the other, or the other to it, he would not have thus set it down nor would this have been his way of consoling the person who was vexed.

5. Now after this, he comforts him also in another kind of way; by the consideration that the measure vouchsafed is profitable to him, even though it be not so large. For having said, that it is "the same Spirit," and "the same Lord," and "the same God," and having thereby recovered him, he brings in again another consolation, thus saying, "but to each one is given the manifestation of the Spirit to profit withal." For lest one should say, "what if there be the same Lord, the same Spirit, the same God? Yet I have received less:" he says, that thus it was profitable.

But he calls miracles a "manifestation of the Spirit," with evident reason. For to me who am a believer, he that has the Spirit is manifest from his having been baptized: but to the unbeliever this will in no way be manifest, except from the miracles: so that hence also again there is no small consolation. For though there be a difference of gifts, yet the evidence is one: since whether you have much or little, you are equally manifest. So that if you desire to show this, that you have the Spirit, you have a sufficient demonstration.

Wherefore, now that both the Giver is one and the thing given a pure favor, and the manifestation takes place thereby, and this is more profitable for you; grieve not as if despised. For not to dishonor you has God done it, nor to declare you inferior to another, but to spare you and with a view to your welfare. To receive more than one has ability to bear, this rather is unprofitable, and injurious, and a fit cause of dejection.

Whatever measure of the Spirit has been given to you, it is for your benefit, so there is no reason to complain of what seems like a small gift.
