No one has done more so that we might be good, great and thankful in everything than God who created us. Thus he often lavishes blessings on us beyond our will, blessings that we are for the most part unaware of. If this surprises you, let me point out that this happened, not just to anyone, but to blessed Paul. That blessed one, in fact, being in many dangers and trials, often begged God that temptations would depart from him. God nevertheless did not respond to his request, except to the extent that it was advantageous for him, and to show this he said, “My grace is enough for you. Indeed, my power is fully manifested in weakness.” Thus, before telling him the reason why, he pours out blessings without Paul wanting or knowing about it. What is so unusual, then, if he commands us to be grateful in return for such tender care? So let us obey him, having this attitude always. In fact, nothing ruined the Jews more than their ingratitude, and this behavior alone brought on all those misfortunes, one after the other. Indeed, even prior to those misfortunes, it ruined and corrupted their souls. “The hope of the ingrate is like winter frost,” it says. It dulls the soul and makes it die, just like the body. This is born of arrogance and from believing oneself to be deserving of something. The contrite person, however, will give thanks to God not only for blessings but also for what seems to be against him, and, when he suffers, he will not think himself to have suffered unjustly. We too, then, the more we embrace virtue, the more we will humble ourselves, because virtue consists above all in this.
