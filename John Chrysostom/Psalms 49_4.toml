The term “parable” or “proverb” has many meanings. A parable is a saying, an example, a reproach, as when he says, “You have made us a parable among the nations, a shaking of the head among the peoples.” A parable is also a riddle, which many call a question, suggesting something not immediately clear from the words but containing a meaning hidden within.… A parable also means a comparison: “He proposed another parable to them, saying, ‘The kingdom of heaven is like a man sowing good seed.’ ” A parable also means a figure of speech: “Son of man, tell them this proverb: The great eagle, the one with big wings,” meaning by eagle the king. A parable also means a type, or likeness, as Paul also shows in the words “By faith he sacrificed Isaac … whence also in figure he received him back,” that is, in type and in likeness. What then, does the “parable” mean to him here? It seems to me to refer to the narration.… The parable, you see, sorts out the worthy listener from the unworthy: whereas the worthy takes steps to find the meaning, the unworthy bypasses it.… Do you see the introduction he fashioned? He summoned the world, he abrogated inequality in lifestyle, called their attention to their nature, repressed their arrogance, promised to say something great and noble, denied he was saying anything of his own but what he had heard from him, hinted there was deep obscurity in the message, thus making them more attentive. He promised to teach us spiritual wisdom, on which he had meditated unceasingly. So let us pay attention and not pass it by. If in fact the message is wise, a parable, a riddle, there is need of a mind on the alert.
