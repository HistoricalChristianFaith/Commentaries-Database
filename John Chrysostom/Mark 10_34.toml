Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. sed v. Chrys.Hom. 65: And He enumerates each thing that was to happen to Him; lest if He should pass any thing over, they should be troubled afterwards at suddenly seeing it.Wherefore He adds, “Behold, we go up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man.”.
Hom. in Matt., 65: But that when they were saddened on account of His Passion and death, they should then also look for His Resurrection, He adds, “And the third day He shall rise again"; for since He had not hid from them the sorrows and insults which happened, it was fitting that they should believe Him on other points.
