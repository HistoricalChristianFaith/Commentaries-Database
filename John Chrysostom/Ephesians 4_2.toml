How is it possible to “walk worthily” with “all lowliness”? Meekness is the foundation of all virtue. If you are humble and are aware of your limits and remember how you were saved, you will take this recollection as the motive for every excellent moral behavior. You will not be excessively impressed with either chains or privileges. You will remember that all is of grace and so walk humbly.… “With all lowliness,” he says, not in words only or even in deeds but more so in the very manner and tone of your voice. And not meek toward one person and rude toward another but humble toward everyone, whether enemy or friend, great or small.

With all lowliness, says he; not that which is in words, nor that which is in actions only, but even in one's very bearing and tone of voice: not lowly towards one, and rude towards another; be lowly towards all men, be he friend or foe, be he great or small. This is lowliness. Even in your good deeds be lowly; for hear what Christ says, Blessed are the poor in spirit; Matthew 5:3 and He places this first in order. Wherefore also the Apostle himself says, With all lowliness, and meekness, and long-suffering. For it is possible for a man to be lowly, and yet quick and irritable, and thus all is to no purpose; for oftentimes he will be possessed by his anger, and ruin all.

Forbearing, he proceeds, one another in love.
How is it possible to forbear, if a man be passionate or censorious? He has told us therefore the manner: in love, says he. If you, he would say, are not forbearing to your neighbor, how shall God be forbearing to you? If you bear not with your fellow-servant, how shall the Master bear with you? Wherever there is love, all things are to be borne.
