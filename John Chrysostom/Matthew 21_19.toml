Another evangelist says, The time of figs was not yet; but if it was not time, how does the other evangelist say, He came, if haply He might find fruit thereon.

It was not his will to exhibit his anger upon men. Rather upon the plant he furnished the proof of his might in taking vengeance. But when such things are done, whether to places, or to plants, or to brutes, do not be overly curious about the divine will. Do not say, “Was it just that the fig tree withered?” especially if it was not yet the time of figs. This sort of question is the utmost trifling. Just behold the miracle and admire and glorify the worker of it.
