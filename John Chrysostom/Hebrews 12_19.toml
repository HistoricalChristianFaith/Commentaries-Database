But what are the sounds of the trumpet? Probably it is as though some King were coming. This at all events will also be at the second coming. At the last trump 1 Corinthians 15:52 all must be raised. But it is the trumpet of His voice which effects this. At that time then all things were objects of sense, and sights, and sounds; now all are objects of understanding, and invisible.

And, it says, there was much smoke. See Exodus 19:18 For since God is said to be fire, and appeared thus in the bush, He indicates the fire even by the smoke. And what is the blackness and the darkness? He again expresses its fearfulness. Thus Isaiah also says; And the house was filled with smoke. Isaiah 6:4 And what is the object of the tempest? The human race was careless. It was therefore needful that they should be aroused by these things. For no one was so dull as not to have had his thoughts raised up, when these things were done, and the Law ordained.
Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice Exodus 19:19: for it was necessary that the voice of God should be uttered. Inasmuch as He was about to promulgate His Law through Moses, therefore He makes him worthy of confidence. They saw him not, because of the thick darkness: they heard him not, because of the weakness of his voice. What then? God answered by a voice, addressing the multitude: yea and his name shall be called.
