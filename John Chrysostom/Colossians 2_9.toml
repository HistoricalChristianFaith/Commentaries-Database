“For in him dwells,” that is, for God dwells in him. But that you may not think him enclosed, as in a body, Paul writes, “All the fullness of the Godhead bodily: and you are made full in him.” Others say that Paul means the church filled by his Godhead, as he elsewhere says, “of him that fills all in all,” and that he employs the term bodily here, as the body in the head.
