Observe how in his accusing of the one he thrusts through the other, by first giving the solution, and then the objection. For such a solution is not suspected, and the hearer accepts it the rather, that the speaker is not making it his aim. For in that case indeed he would make a point of not coming off worsted, but in this, not so. For in Him dwells, that is, for God dwells in Him. But that you may not think Him enclosed, as in a body, he says, All the fullness of the Godhead bodily: and you are made full in Him. Others say that he intends the Church filled by His Godhead, as he elsewhere says, of Him that fills all in all Ephesians 1:23, and that the term bodily is here, as the body in the head. How is it then that he did not add, which is the Church? Some again say it is with reference to The Father, that he says that the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him, but wrongly. First, because to dwell, cannot strictly be said of God: next, because the fullness is not that which receives, for the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof Psalm 24:1; and again the Apostle, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in. Romans 11:25 By fullness is meant the whole. Then the word bodily, what did it intend? As in a head. But why does he say the same thing over again? And you are made full in Him. What then does it mean? That you have nothing less than He. As it dwelt in Him, so also in you. For Paul is ever straining to bring us near to Christ; as when he says, Hath raised us up with Him, and made us to sit with Him Ephesians 2:6: and, If we endure, we shall also reign with Him 2 Timothy 2:12: and, How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things Romans 8:32: and calling us fellow-heirs. Then as for His dignity. And He is the head of all principality and power. Ephesians 3:6 He that is above all, The Cause, is He not Consubstantial? Then he has added the benefit in a marvelous way; and far more marvelous than in the Epistle to the Romans. For there indeed he says, circumcision of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter Romans 2:29, but here, in Christ.

“For in him dwells,” that is, for God dwells in him. But that you may not think him enclosed, as in a body, Paul writes, “All the fullness of the Godhead bodily: and you are made full in him.” Others say that Paul means the church filled by his Godhead, as he elsewhere says, “of him that fills all in all,” and that he employs the term bodily here, as the body in the head. But if this interpretation is true, why did he not add “which is the church”? Homilies on Colossians
