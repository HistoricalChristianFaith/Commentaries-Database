What Paul means is this. God has made him free and put him beyond harmâ€™s reach, but the Gentile does not understand his rule of life. He cannot see the nature of Christian freedom and will say to himself that Christianity is a lie, because although Christians shun demons, they are prepared to eat things which have been offered to them, so great is their gluttony. Such a judgment may be unfair, but it is better not to give the Gentile any room for judging at all.
