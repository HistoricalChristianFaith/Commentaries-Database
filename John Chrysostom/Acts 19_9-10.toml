"But when divers were hardened, speaking evil of the way." They might well call it "the way"; this was indeed the way, that led into the kingdom of heaven. "He departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus. And this was done for the space of two years, so that all that were in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks." Do you mark how much was effected by his persisting? "Both Jews and Greeks heard: all that dwelt in Asia": it was for this also that the Lord suffered him not to go into Asia on a former occasion; waiting, as it seems to me, for this same conjuncture. Here now he does not even apologize, seeing that the Gentiles everywhere have believed. "In the school of one Tyrannus": it was not that he sought the place, but without more ado where there was a school there he discoursed.
