See how He provides for their conduct, and that no less than for their miracles, implying that the miracles without this are nothing. Thus He both quells their pride by saying, Freely you have received, freely give; and takes order for their being clear of covetousness. Moreover, lest it should be thought their own work, and they be lifted up by the signs that were wrought, He says, freely you have received. You bestow no favor on them that receive you, for not for a price did ye receive these things, nor after toil: for the grace is mine. In like manner therefore give ye to them also, for there is no finding a price worthy of them.

Observe the propriety of the time in which they are sent. After they had seenthe dead raised, the sea rebuked, and other like wonders, and had both in word and deed sufficient proof of His excellent power, then He sends them.
Also they were sent to the Jews first, in order that being trained in Judaea, as in a palaestra, they might enter on the arena of the world to contend; thus He taught them like weak nestlings to fly.
Also that they should not suppose that they were hated of Christ because they had reviled Him, and branded Him as daemoniac, He sought first their cure, and withholding His disciples from all other nations, He sent this people physicians and teachers; and not only forbid them to preach to any others before the Jews, but would not that they should so much as approach the way that led to the Gentiles; “Go not into the way of the Gentiles.” And because the Samaritans, though more readily disposed to be converted to the faith, were yet at enmity with the Jews, He would not suffer the Samaritans to be preached to before the Jews.
From these then He diverts his disciples, and sends them to the children of Israel, whom He calls “perishing” sheep, not straying; in every way contriving an apology for them, and drawing them to Himself.
Behold the greatness of their ministry, behold the dignity of the Apostles. They are not to preach of any thing that can be an object of sense, as Moses and the Prophets did; but things new and unlooked for; those preached earthly goods, but these the kingdom of heaven and all the goods that are there.
But afterwards they ceased when a reverence for the faith was universally established. Or, if they were continued at all, they were few and seldom; forit is usual with God to do such things when evil is increased, then He shewsforth His power.
Observe how He is as careful that they should be upright in moral virtue, as that they should have the miraculous powers, shewing that miracles without these are nought. “Freely ye have received,” seems a check upon their pride; "freely give,” a command to keep themselves pure from filthy lucre. Or, that what they should do might not be thought to be their own benevolence, He says, "Freely ye have received;” as much as to say; Ye bestow nothing of your own on these ye relieve; for ye have not received these things for money, nor forwages of labour; as ye have received them, so give to others; for indeed it isnot possible to receive a price equal to their value.
