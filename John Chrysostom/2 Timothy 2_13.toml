Therefore, “He can do nothing of himself” means nothing else than that he can do nothing in opposition to his Father, nothing different, nothing foreign. This is an attribute especially belonging to one who is giving proof of his equality with the Father and of complete agreement as well. But why does he not say, “He does nothing in opposition” instead of “He cannot”? It was in order that he might show from this once more that his equality is undeviating and complete. This statement does not imply any weakness in him but testifies to his great power. Besides, Paul says elsewhere of the Father, “That by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to deceive”; and again, “If we disown him, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.” Now this word “cannot” is not, of course, indicative of weakness but of strength; indeed, ineffable strength.
