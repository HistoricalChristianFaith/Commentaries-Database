Besides, we injure ourselves; Him we cannot injure. And to show this, he has added, If we believe not, He abides faithful: He cannot deny Himself: that is, if we believe not that He rose again, He is not injured by it. He is faithful and unshaken, whether we say so or not. If then He is not at all injured by our denying Him, it is for nothing else than for our benefit that He desires our confession. For He abides the same, whether we deny Him or not. He cannot deny Himself, that is, His own Being. We may say that He is not; though such is not the fact. It is not in His nature, it is not possible for Him not to be, that is, to go into nonentity. His subsistence always abides, always is.

Therefore, “He can do nothing of himself” means nothing else than that he can do nothing in opposition to his Father, nothing different, nothing foreign. This is an attribute especially belonging to one who is giving proof of his equality with the Father and of complete agreement as well. But why does he not say, “He does nothing in opposition” instead of “He cannot”? It was in order that he might show from this once more that his equality is undeviating and complete. This statement does not imply any weakness in him but testifies to his great power. Besides, Paul says elsewhere of the Father, “That by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to deceive”; and again, “If we disown him, he remains faithful, for he cannot disown himself.” Now this word “cannot” is not, of course, indicative of weakness but of strength; indeed, ineffable strength.
