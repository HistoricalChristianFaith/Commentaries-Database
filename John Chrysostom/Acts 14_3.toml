"Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of His grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands." This caused their boldness; or rather, of their boldness indeed their own hearty good-will was the cause - therefore it is that for a long while they work no signs - while the conversion of the hearers was the effect of the signs, though their boldness also contributed somewhat.

And see how on all occasions he refers all to God. "Long time," he says, "abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, which gave testimony unto the word of His grace." Think not this expression, "Gave testimony," hath aught derogatory to the Lord's Divine Majesty: "Who witnessed," it is said, "before Pontius Pilate." Then the boldness - "and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands." Here he speaks it as concerning their own nation.
