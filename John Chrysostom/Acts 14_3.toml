Think not this (expression, Gave testimony,) has anything derogatory (to the Lord's Divine Majesty): Who witnessed, it is said, before Pontius Pilate. 1 Timothy 6:13 Then the boldness— and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. Here he speaks it as concerning their own nation. And the multitude of the city, etc.

This caused their boldness; or rather, of their boldness indeed their own hearty good-will was the cause— therefore it is that for a long while they work no signs— while the conversion of the hearers was (the effect) of the signs, though their boldness also contributed somewhat. But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the Apostles.
