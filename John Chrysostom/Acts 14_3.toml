Think not this (expression, Gave testimony,) has anything derogatory (to the Lord's Divine Majesty): Who witnessed, it is said, before Pontius Pilate. 1 Timothy 6:13 Then the boldness— and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands. Here he speaks it as concerning their own nation. And the multitude of the city, etc.

This caused their boldness; or rather, of their boldness indeed their own hearty good-will was the cause— therefore it is that for a long while they work no signs— while the conversion of the hearers was (the effect) of the signs, though their boldness also contributed somewhat. But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the Apostles.

Why didn’t the apostles go forth from there? Because they were not driven away, only attacked. “So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.” This caused their boldness; or rather, what caused their boldness was their own good will. It is for this reason that for a long time they worked no miracles. The conversion of the hearers was [the effect] of the signs, though their boldness also contributed somewhat.
