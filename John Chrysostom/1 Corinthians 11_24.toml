Paul reminds us that the Master gave up everything, including himself, for us, whereas we are reluctant even to share a little food with our fellow believers. But if you come for a sacrifice of thanksgiving, do not do anything unworthy of that sacrifice. Do not dishonor your brothers or neglect them in their hunger, do not get drunk, and do not insult the church. When you come, give thanks for what you have enjoyed, and do not cut yourselves off from your neighbors.
