O the excessive folly! O the excessive malignity! Why it was not even the season for that; for it was Pentecost. For this was what made it worse: that when those were confessing— men that were Jews, that were Romans, that were proselytes, yea perhaps that had crucified Him— yet these, after so great signs, say, These men are full of new wine!
