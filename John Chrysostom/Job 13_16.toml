“And he shall turn to me for salvation; for fraud shall gain no entrance before him.” This means, my consolation is that “fraud shall gain no entrance before him.” “You see, I do not speak like you, with hidden thoughts. I know that there is no dissimulation in him.” - "Commentary on Job 13.15b–16"
