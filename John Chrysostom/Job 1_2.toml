Notice how the author first of all speaks about Job’s virtue and then of the goods Job has received from God. Observe the opportunity Job received to have children, and the proportion of children who are boys, desired as a source of greater benefit. Scripture says immediately why the man must receive our praise. It is because of the greatness of Job’s virtue and the fruitfulness of his soul. And indeed we derive all such goods from virtue. That is why I speak about beautiful and plentiful progeny. “There shall not be,” Scripture says, “male or female barren among you.” But Abraham was childless, so that you might learn that Abraham’s goods were not the reward of virtue but of other goods. Therefore God has promised those goods in order to be generous to you. - "Commentary on Job 1.2"
