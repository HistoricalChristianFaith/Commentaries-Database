Do you see the humility of the words? For he who has received a commandment is not his own master. Yet he says, “As the Father raises up the dead and enlivens them, even so the Son enlivens whom he will.” Does he have power then to enliven whomever he wants, and does he not have the power to say what he wants? What he intends then by the words is this: It is not possible that he [the Father] should speak one set of words and I should utter another. “And I know that his commandment is life everlasting.” He said this to those who called him a deceiver and who asserted that he had come to do harm. However, when he says “I judge not,” he shows that he is not the cause of their destruction. By this he all but plainly testifies (when he is about to remove himself from them and leave) that “I converse with you, speaking nothing on my own but everything as from the Father.”
