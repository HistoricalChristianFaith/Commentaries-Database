Those who visit a doctor do not complete their journey simply by arriving there. They must also learn the remedy and apply the medicines. We too, having reached this point, need to do the same, by learning the great humility of Paul.… Paul demonstrates humility when he calls himself a blasphemer and a persecutor. He describes himself as a dreadful offender on account of his former sins, which had now been canceled, … hence as “the least of all the saints.” He did not say “of the apostles” but of the saints who come after the apostles.
