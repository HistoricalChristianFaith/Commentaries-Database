They who go to the physician's have not merely to go there and nothing further; they have to learn how to treat themselves, and to apply remedies. And so with us then who come here, we must not do this and nothing else, we must learn our lesson, the surpassing lowliness of Paul. What? When he was about to speak of the vastness of the grace of God, hear what he says, Unto me, who am less than the least of all saints, was this grace given. Lowliness indeed it was even to bewail his former sins, although blotted out, and to make mention of them, and to hold himself within his true measure as where he calls himself a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and injurious; 1 Timothy 1:13 yet nothing was equal to this: for formerly, says he, such was I; and again he calls himself, one born out of due time. 1 Corinthians 15:8 But that after so many great and good deeds and at that time he should thus humble himself, and call himself less than the least of all, this is indeed great and surpassing moderation. To one who am less than the least of all saints; he says not, than the Apostles. So that that expression is less strong than this before us. There his words are, I am not meet to be called an Apostle. 1 Corinthians 15:9 Here he says that he is even less than the least of all saints; to me, says he, who am less than the least of all saints was this grace given. What grace? To preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ, and to make all men see what is the dispensation of the mystery, which from all ages has been hid in God, who created all things, to the intent that now unto the principalities and the powers in the heavenly places, might be made known through the Church the manifold wisdom of God. True, to man it was not revealed; and are you enlightening Angels and Archangels and Principalities and Powers? I am, says he. For it was hid in God, even in God who created all things. And do you venture to utter this? I do, says he. But whence has this been made manifest to the Angels? By the Church. Again he says, not merely the manifold (ποικίλος) but the much-manifold (πολυποίκιλος) wisdom, that is, the multiplied and varied. What then is this? Did not Angels know it? No, nothing of it; for if Principalities knew it not, much less could Angels ever have known it. What then? Did not even Archangels know it? No, nor even they. But whence were they going to know it? Who was to reveal it? When we were taught it, then were they also by us. For hear what the Angel says to Joseph; You shall call His Name Jesus, for it is He that shall save His people from their sins. Matthew 1:21

Paul himself was sent to the Gentiles, the other Apostles to the Circumcision. So that the more marvellous and astonishing commission was given, says he, to me, who am less than the least. And this too was of grace, that he that was least should have the greatest things entrusted to him; that he should be made the herald of these tidings. For he that is made a herald of the greater tidings, is in this way great.

* To preach unto the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ.
If His riches are unsearchable, and that too after his appearing, much more is His essence. If it is still a mystery, much more was it before it was made known; for a mystery he calls it on this account, because neither did the Angels know it, nor was it manifest to any one else.

Those who visit a doctor do not complete their journey simply by arriving there. They must also learn the remedy and apply the medicines. We too, having reached this point, need to do the same, by learning the great humility of Paul.… Paul demonstrates humility when he calls himself a blasphemer and a persecutor. He describes himself as a dreadful offender on account of his former sins, which had now been canceled, … hence as “the least of all the saints.” He did not say “of the apostles” but of the saints who come after the apostles.
