(Hom. 57. in Matt.) But that this man was much weakened in faith, the writings of the Gospel show us in several places. In that place where he says, Help thou my unbelief; (Mark 9:21, 23.) and, If thou canst. And in that where Christ said, All things are possible to him that believeth, &c.

(ubi sup.) Hence it seems to me more correct to account the father of the demoniac unbelieving, because he also casts reproach upon the holy Apostles, saying that they could not subdue the evil spirits. But it were better to have sought favour from God by honouring Him, for He has respect to them that fear Him. But he who says that those are weak with respect to their power over evil spirits, who have obtained that power from Christ, calumniates rather the grace than those who are adorned with that grace in whom Christ works. Christ is therefore offended with the accusation of the saints, to whom was entrusted the word of holy preaching. Wherefore the Lord rebukes him and those like-minded with him, saying, O faithless and perverse generation. As if He said, Because of your unbelief the grace has not received its accomplishment.

(Hom. 57. in Matt.) Now He does not direct His words to him alone, but to all the Jews, lest He should cause him to doubt. For it must have been that many were offended.

(ubi sup.) Hereby also He shows that His departure was desired by Him, not because the suffering of the cross was grievous, but rather their conversation.

(ubi sup.) The Lord however does this not for display, but for the father's sake, that upon seeing the devil disturbed at the mere summons, he might thus at least be led to the belief of the future miracles; of which it follows, And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again unto his father.
