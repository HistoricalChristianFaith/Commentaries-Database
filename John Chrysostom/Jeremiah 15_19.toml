Consider to what a dignity one exalts himself who esteems others’ salvation to be of great importance. Such a person is imitating God as far as lies within the power of humankind. Hear what God says speaking through his prophet: “He who separates the worthy from the vile shall be as my mouth.” What God says is that one who is eager to save a brother who has fallen into careless ways, one who hastens to snatch his brother from the jaws of the devil, that person imitates me as far as lies within human power. What could equal that? This is greater than all good deeds. This is the peak of all virtue.

Let us catch them, then, by our mode of life; and by these souls let us build up the church, and of these let us amass our wealth. There is nothing to weigh against a soul, not even the whole world. Thus, although one may give countless treasure to the poor, in so doing he will not do such work as one who converts one soul. “For he who takes forth the precious from the vile shall be as my mouth,” so God speaks. A great good it is, I grant, to have pity on the poor, but it is nothing equal to removing them from error.

Words full of gentleness and meekness, even as Jesus also used to speak, saying to those who were insulting him, “I have not a devil,” and again, “If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong.” If you also speak in this way, if you speak for your neighbor’s betterment, you will obtain a tongue like that tongue. And these things God says: “For he that brings out the precious from the vile shall be like my mouth”; such are his words.
