Someone might say, “What do you have to do with Moses when you broke the very sabbath that he ordained we should keep? How then does Moses accuse us? And why should we believe on someone else who comes in his own name? All these assertions you make have no evidence to back them up.” Now in truth all these points are proved above. “For,” [Christ would reply] “since it is acknowledged that I came from God by my works, by the voice of John and the testimony of the Father, it is certain that Moses too would condemn you.” For Moses had said that if any one shall come doing miracles, leading people to God and foretelling the future with certainty, you must obey him. Now Christ had done all this.
