For since His discourse concerning the Resurrection, and together with this, the hearing that I came out from God, and there I go, gave them no common comfort, He continually handles these things. He gave a pledge, in the first place, that they were right in believing on Him; in the second, that they should be in safety. When therefore He said, A little while, and you shall not see Me; and again a little while, and you shall see Me John 16:17, they with reason did not understand Him. But now it is no longer so. What then is, You shall not ask Me? You shall not say, 'Show us the Father,' and, 'Where are You going?' for you shall know all knowledge, and the Father shall be disposed towards you even as I am.

When we ask God for something, there is no need for intermediaries. And he is no more disposed to help us because he is asked by others than if we ourselves ask. For he wants us to seek things from him often. This pleases him very much. For it is in this alone that he becomes our debtor: Every time we pray to him, he is pleased and freely gives us what we have not loaned him. And should he see someone who is in need fervently praying to him, he will himself pay down for us what he has not received from us. But if we pray in an indifferent manner, he will be indifferent to our request—not because he does not want to give but because our prayer is acceptable only when we pray to him with all our hearts.Nor does God put off the granting of our prayers because he detests them or because he is against us. But he does clearly wish, by delaying his giving, to keep us close to himself; just as fathers who love their children tenderly will withhold a gift from children who are lazy and indifferent in order to teach them to persevere. And have your prayers been heard? Then give thanks because your prayers have been heard. And have your prayers not been heard? Keep praying so that they may be heard.… For, though you may be helpless and without a protector, if you cry out to God himself you shall most certainly be heard.
