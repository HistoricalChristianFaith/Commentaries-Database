Hence to allay their ill feeling and hostility to one another, Joseph said, “Don’t squabble on the way,” but rather remember that I hold no grudge against you for what was done to me, and be kindly disposed to one another. Who could adequately admire the virtue of this good man who fulfilled in generous measure the moral values of the New Testament? What Christ recommends to the apostles in these words, “Love your enemies; pray for those who abuse you,” this man even surpassed. I mean, not only did he give evidence of such wonderful love for those who did away with him as far as they could, but he did everything to convince them that they had not sinned against him. O what extraordinary good sense! O what marvelous degree of sound values and generosity of love for God! “Surely it was not you who did this against me,” he is saying, you see. “It was God’s care for me that permitted this to happen so as to guarantee the realization of my dreams and so that I might prove an adequate occasion of survival for you.”
