While they say “great,” they do not go so far as to say how great; no one knows that, after all, so he added as well, “and highly to be praised.” There is no limit, you see, to his greatness. What it means, however, is something like this: It is necessary to praise him and sing to him alone, and this to an extraordinary degree; but the need is to sing his praises both for this infinite and incomprehensible greatness of his being and for the excess of his beneficence to us.
