Since Job was overwhelmed by his dejection, God encourages him with his words, so that he may pay attention to what is said now, and he introduces his speech in the form of questions, which is the best means to convince. Above all, he shows that he does everything with wisdom and intelligence, and therefore it would have been inconsistent with God, who did so many things with wisdom and intelligence, to neglect the human beings for whom he has created everything, even when they are wretched, as in this case. “What do you say?” God asks.
