Moral choice rather than human nature is the determining factor and rather constitutes “the human condition” than the natural determinants. For human nature itself does not cast one into hell, nor does it lead one into the kingdom, but this happens by men themselves. We neither love nor hate anyone so far as he is man, but so far as he is such or such a man. If then our real essence as human beings is the body, which in any case cannot be accountable, how can one say that the body is evil? But what does Paul say? “With his doings.” He means freedom of choice, with its accompanying acts.
