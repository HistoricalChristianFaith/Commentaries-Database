What was the reason, he asked, that you wanted to embroil me in such a terrible sin? What on earth did you have in mind in doing it? See how Abimelech shows by his own words the threat delivered against him by God. You see, since God had said to him, “If you do not restore her, death will come upon you and all that is yours,” Abimelech interprets this very thing in saying, “What offense did I give you to cause you to bring such a great sin on me and my kingdom?” I mean, surely the extent of the punishment did not stop at me? My whole kingdom was set to be utterly destroyed through the deception you contrived. “So what did you have in mind in doing it?” Homilies on Genesis
