As to live after the flesh is to live badly, so to judge after the flesh is to judge unjustly. But I judge no man.

Just as living after the flesh means to live badly, so judging after the flesh is to judge badly.… And so he is saying that they judge unjustly. “But if we judge unjustly,” someone might say, then why do you not rebuke us? Why do you not punish us? Why do you not condemn us?” “Because,” Jesus says, “This is not what I came for.” This is the meaning of “I judge no one.”
