Can you hear the intense displeasure in his voice? For nowhere else does he appear to have rebuked them so strongly. Why now? In order to cast out their prejudices aboutclean foods. … For not everywhere is permissiveness a good thing. As he earlier had allowed them to speak freely, now he reproves them…. He even reminds them of the specific numbers of loaves and of persons fed, both to bring them to recall the past, and to make them more attentive to the future. Gospel of St. Matthew, Homily
