Can you hear the intense displeasure in his voice? For nowhere else does he appear to have rebuked them so strongly. Why now? In order to cast out their prejudices aboutclean foods. … For not everywhere is permissiveness a good thing. As he earlier had allowed them to speak freely, now he reproves them…. He even reminds them of the specific numbers of loaves and of persons fed, both to bring them to recall the past, and to make them more attentive to the future. Gospel of St. Matthew, Homily

Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. Matthew says, “of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees;” Luke, however, of the Pharisees only. All three, therefore, name the Pharisees, as being the most important of them, but Matthew and Mark have each mentioned one of the secondary sects; and fitly has Mark added “of Herod,” as a supplement to Matthew's narrative, in which they were left out. But in saying this, He by degrees brings the disciples to understanding and faith.
