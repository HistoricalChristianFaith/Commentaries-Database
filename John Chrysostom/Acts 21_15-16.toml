"And after these days," it says, "having taken up our baggage" - i.e. having received the supplies necessary for the journey - "we went up to Jerusalem. And there went with us also certain of the disciples from Caesarea, bringing us to one with whom we should lodge, one Mnason, an ancient disciple of Cyprus." "Bringing us," it says, "to him with whom we should lodge" - not to the church: for on the former occasion, when they went up concerning the decrees, they lodged with the Church, but now with a certain "ancient disciple." The expression shows that the preaching had been going on a long time: whence it seems to me that this writer in the Acts epitomizes the events of many years, relating only the matters of chief importance. So unwilling were they to burthen the Church, when there was another to lodge them; and so little did they stand upon their dignity.
