Not one of the Twelve, but perhaps one of the seventy—for now, deeming that the anger of the Jews was quenched by the cross—approached without fear and took charge of his funeral. Joseph therefore came and asked the favor from Pilate, which he granted. And why should he not? Nicodemus also assists him and furnishes a costly burial. For they were still disposed to think of him as a mere man. And they brought those spices whose special nature is to preserve the body for a long time and not allow it quickly to yield to corruption, which was an act of people imagining nothing great respecting him. Nonetheless, they exhibited very loving affection. But how is it that not one of the Twelve came, neither John, nor Peter nor any other of the more distinguished disciples? Nor does the writer conceal this point. If anyone says that it was from fear of the Jews, these men also were occupied by the same fear. For Joseph too was, it says, “A secret [disciple] for fear of the Jews.” And no one can say that Joseph acted this way because he now had no fear of their power. Rather, he came despite his fear. But John, who was present and had seen him expire, did nothing of the kind. It seems to me that Joseph was a man of high rank (as is clear from the funeral) and known to Pilate, which is why he obtained the favor. And then he buried him, not as a criminal, but magnificently after the Jewish fashion, as some great and admirable person.
