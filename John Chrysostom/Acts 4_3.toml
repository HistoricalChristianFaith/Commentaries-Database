Consider how in the case of Christ they sought out a traitor, but now arrest the apostles with their own hands, having grown more audacious and more impudent since the crucifixion. For sin, while it is yet struggling to the birth, is attended with some sense of shame, but once fully formed, it makes those who practice it more shameless.
