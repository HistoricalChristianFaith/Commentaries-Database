He no more says fly, but go. Do you see again after the temptation refreshment? Then after the refreshment danger again? In that he was freed indeed from his banishment, and came back again to his own country; and beheld the murderer of the children brought to the slaughter; but when he has set foot on his own country, he finds again a remnant of the former perils, the son of the tyrant living, and being king.

But how did Archelaus reign over Judæa, when Pontius Pilate was governor? Herod's death had recently taken place, and the kingdom had not yet been divided into many parts; but as he had only just ended his life, the son for a while kept possession of the kingdom in the room of his father Herod; his brother also bearing this name, which is the reason why the evangelist added, in the room of his father Herod.

It may be said, however, if he was afraid to settle in Judæa on account of Archelaus, he had cause to fear Galilee also on account of Herod. I answer, By his changing the place, the whole matter was thenceforward thrown into shade; for the whole assault was upon Bethlehem and the coasts thereof. Therefore now that the slaughter had taken place, the youth Archelaus had no other thought, but that the whole had come to an end, and that among the many, He that was sought had been destroyed. And besides, his father having come to such an end of his life before his eyes, he became for the future more cautious about farther proceedings, and about urging on that course of iniquity.
