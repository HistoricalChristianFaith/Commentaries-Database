Wherefore says he this? By way of preparing them to be always ready to meet dangers, whether seen or unseen, and in all things to obey the Spirit. He shows that it is for great objects that he is led away from them. Save that the Holy Ghost, he says, in every city witnesses to me saying— to show that he departs willingly; that (see Hom. xlv. p. 273) you may not imagine it any bond or necessity, when he says, bound in the Spirit— that in every city bonds and afflictions await me. Then also he adds this, I count not my life dear, until I shall have fulfilled my course and the ministry, which I received of the Lord Jesus. Until I shall have finished my course, says he, with joy. Do you mark how (clearly) these were the words not of one lamenting, but of one who forbore to make the most (of his troubles) (μετριάζοντος), of one who would instruct those (whom he addressed), and sympathize with them in the things which were befalling He says not, I grieve indeed, but one must needs bear it: but, says he, of none of those things do I make account, neither do I have, i.e. account my life dear to me. Why this again? Not to extol himself, but to teach them, as by the former words, humility, so by these, fortitude and boldness: I have it not precious, i.e. I love it not before this: I account it more precious to finish my course, to testify. And he says not, to preach, to teach— but what says he? to testify (διαμαρτύρασθαι)— the Gospel of the grace of God. He is about to say something more uncomfortable (φορτικώτερον), namely, I am pure from the blood of all men (because on my part) there is nothing lacking: he is about to lay upon them the whole weight and burden: so he first mollifies their feelings by saying, And now behold I know that you shall see my face no more. The consolation is twofold: both that my face you shall see no more, for in heart I am with you: and that it was not they alone (who should see him no more): for, you shall see my face no more, you all, among whom I have gone about preaching the Kingdom. So that he may well (say), "Wherefore I take you to record (read διὸ μαρτ . for διαμαρτ.)—seeing I shall be with you no more— that I am pure from the blood of all men.

for do not suppose that I say these things as lamenting them: for I hold not my own life dear. It is to raise up their minds that he says all this, and to persuade them not only not to flee, but also to bear nobly. Therefore it is that he calls it a course and a ministry, on the one hand, showing it to be glorious from its being a race, on the other, showing what was due from it, as being a ministry. I am a minister: nothing more. Having comforted them, that they might not grieve that he was so evil entreated, and having told them that he endured those things with joy, and having shown the fruits of them, then (and not before) he brings in that which would give them pain, that he may not overwhelm their minds. And now behold, etc. Wherefore I take you to record, that I am pure from the blood of all men, because I have not shrunk from declaring unto you the whole counsel of God
