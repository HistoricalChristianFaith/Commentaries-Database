Do not think that I am lamenting as I say this. “I do not consider my life so precious.” He says this to elevate their mind and to persuade them not only not to flee but to bear it nobly. For this reason he calls it “course” and “ministry”: “course,” or “race,” because of the glory; “ministry,” because of the obligation. I am a minister, he says; I have nothing more.
