"And gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, Gave him favor," in the eyes of a barbarian, to him, the slave, the captive: his brethren sold him, this barbarian honored him.

"And gave him favor and wisdom," etc. This was not only by way of honor, but that he should have confidence in his own power. "And he made him governor over Egypt and all his house."
