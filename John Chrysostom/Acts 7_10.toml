He shows that unknowingly they helped to fulfil the prophecy, and that they were themselves the cause, and that the evils recoiled on their own selves. And gave him favor and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, Gave him favor, in the eyes of a barbarian, to him, the slave, the captive: his brethren sold him, this (barbarian) honored him.

This was not only by way of honor, but that he should have confidence in his own power.

This was not only by way of honor, but that he should have confidence in his own power. And he made him governor over Egypt and all his house. Now there came a dearth, etc. On account of famine— such preparations is he making— with threescore and fifteen souls, he says, Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he and our fathers, and were carried over into Sychem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money from the sons of Emmor the father of Sychem.

Now there came a dearth over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance. But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first. And at the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren.

See how it demonstrates what Gamaliel said, “If it comes from God, you will not be able to destroy it.” See how the victims of plots became the authors of salvation to those plotting against them; how the word, plotting against itself and itself plotted against by others, was saved for all this. The famine did not destroy them. And not only that, but they were saved through him who was expected to perish. The royal edict did not destroy them. Their number at that time rather increased, because he died, the one who knew them. Their savior they wished to kill, but for all that, they had not the power to do it. Do you see how by the very means the devil tries to break the promise of God, the promise is increased?

Thus even the one who was sold as slave, he makes him reign as a king in the place where he was considered a slave. Just as Christ also in death shows his power, so he reigns there, where they sold him.
