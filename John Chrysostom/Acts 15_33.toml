No more strife. On that occasion it seems to me that they received the right hand, as [Paul] himself says, “They gave to me and Barnabas right hands of fellowship.” There he says, “They added nothing to me.” For they confirmed his view; they praised and admired it. It shows that even with human reason—that is, not only by the Holy Spirit—it is possible to see that they have committed a sin not easily rectified. For such things do not require the Spirit. It shows that the rest4 are not necessary but superfluous. These things, however, are necessary. “If you keep yourselves from these,” it says, “you will do well.” It shows that they lack nothing, that this is sufficient. For it would have been possible even without the letter, but they sent the epistle so that there may be a law in writing, that they may obey the law and speak to them. And they did this, in peace no less.
