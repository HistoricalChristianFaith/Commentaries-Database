"Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin."

And he does not say this "forgiveness" then comes upon the circumcision; but what saith he? "Cometh this blessedness then" (which is the greater thing) "upon the circumcision or upon the uncircumcision?" For now the subject of enquiry is, With whom is this good and great thing to be found; is it with the circumcision or with the uncircumcision? And notice its superiority! For he shows that it is so far from shunning the uncircumcision, that it even dwelt gladly with it before the circumcision.
