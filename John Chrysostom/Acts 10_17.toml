At the right time, the men come who resolve his confusion. When Christ allowed Joseph to be thrown into confusion, then too, he sent an archangel to him. Here Peter’s soul, having been confused, calmly accepts the resolution … when they inquire whether he is staying there.

And for all this, he knew not what it meant. "Now while Peter doubted in himself what this vision which he had seen should mean, behold, the men which were sent from Cornelius had made enquiry for Simon's house, and stood before the gate, and called, and asked whether Simon, which was surnamed Peter, were lodged there." But while Peter, it says, "doubted in himself," the men come at the right moment to solve his doubt: just as the Lord suffered Joseph first to be perturbed in mind, and then sends the Angel: for the soul with ease accepts the solution, when it has first been in perplexity.
