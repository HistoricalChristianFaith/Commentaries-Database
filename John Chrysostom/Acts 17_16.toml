Observe how he meets with greater trials among the Jews than among the Gentiles. Thus in Athens he undergoes nothing of this kind; the thing goes as far as ridicule, and there an end: and yet he did make some converts: whereas among the Jews he underwent many perils; so much greater was their hostility against him. "His spirit," it says, "was roused within him when he saw the city all full of idols." Nowhere else were so many objects of worship to be seen.

"And while Paul waited," etc. It is providentially ordered that against his will he stays there, while waiting for those others. "His spirit," it says, "within him was roused." It does not mean there anger or exasperation: just as elsewhere it says, "There was sharp contention between them." Then what does "was roused" mean? Was roused: for the gift is far removed from anger and exasperation. He could not bear it, but pined away.
