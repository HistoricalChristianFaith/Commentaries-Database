The wonder of the disciples wasthe consequence of imperfect faith, for this was no great thing for God to do; since then they did not clearly know His power, their ignorance made them breakout into wonder.
Or else, as He did not dry up the fig tree for its own sake, but for a sign that Jerusalem should come to destruction, in order to show His power, in the same way we must also understand the promise concerning the mountain, though a removal of this sortis not impossible with God.
