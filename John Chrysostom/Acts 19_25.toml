Notice how in every case idolatry arises from money. With those people it was because of money, and likewise here. They did not fear that their religion was in danger but that their skills might no longer have a market. And look at the man’s evil. He was well-off and to him this would have been no great loss. But to them it would have been a great loss, since they were poor and subsisted on their daily earnings. Nevertheless, it was not these men who said anything, but he.
