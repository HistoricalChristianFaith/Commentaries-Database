Observe the maliciousness of the man. He was wealthy himself, and to him indeed it was no such great loss; but to them the loss was great, since they were poor, and subsisted on their daily earnings. Nevertheless, these men say nothing, but only he. And observe: "Whom having collected, and the workmen of like occupation," having themselves common cause with him, "he said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth" then he brought the danger home to them, that we are in danger of falling from this our craft into starvation.

"From this work we have our wealth. Hath persuaded." How did he persuade - he, a man of mean consideration? How prevail over so great a force of habit? by doing what - by saying what? It is not for a Paul to effect this, it is not for a man. Even this is enough, that he said, "They are no gods." Now if the impiety of the heathen religions was so easy to detect, it ought to have been condemned long ago: if it was strong, it ought not to have been overthrown so quickly.
