Paul, wishing to show the great kindness of God toward humans and the love which God had for the human race, after saying, “Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same,” follows up the subject in this passage. For do not regard lightly what is spoken, or think it a trifle, that he takes on our flesh.… “For truly he does not take hold of angels, but rather of the seed of Abraham.” What is it that he says? He took on not an angel’s nature, but humanity’s. But what is “he takes hold of”?… Why did he not say, “he took on him,” but “he takes hold of”? It is derived from the image of persons pursuing those who turn away from them, doing everything to overtake them as they flee and to take hold of them as they are bounding away. For when human nature was fleeing from him (and fleeing far away, for we “were far off,”) he pursued after and overtook us. He showed that he has done this only out of kindness and love and tender care. When he says, “Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to serve for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation,” he shows his extreme interest in behalf of human nature and that God makes great account of it. So also in this place he sets it forth much more by a comparison, for he says, “he does not take hold of angels.” For indeed it is a great and a wonderful thing and full of amazement that our flesh should sit on high and be adored by angels and archangels, by the cherubim and the seraphim. For having oftentimes thought upon this myself, I am amazed at it and imagine to myself great things concerning the human race.
