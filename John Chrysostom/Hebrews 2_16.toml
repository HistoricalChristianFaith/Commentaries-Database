Paul wishing to show the great kindness of God towards man, and the Love which He had for the human race, after saying: Forasmuch then as the children were partakers of blood and flesh, He also Himself likewise took part of the same Hebrews 2:14— follows up the subject in this passage. For do not regard lightly what is spoken, nor think this merely a slight [matter], His taking on Him our flesh. He granted not this to Angels; For verily He takes not hold of Angels, but of the seed of Abraham. What is it that he says? He took not on Him an Angel's nature, but man's. But what is He takes hold of? He did not (he means) grasp that nature, which belongs to Angels, but ours. But why did he not say, He took on Him, but used this expression, He takes hold of? It is derived from the figure of persons pursuing those who turn away from them, and doing everything to overtake them as they flee, and to take hold of them as they are bounding away. For when human nature was fleeing from Him, and fleeing far away for we were far off— Ephesians 2:13, He pursued after and overtook us. He showed that He has done this only out of kindness, and love, and tender care. As then when he says, Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation Hebrews 1:14— he shows His extreme interest in behalf of human nature, and that God makes great account of it, so also in this place he sets it forth much more by a comparison, for he says, He takes not hold of angels. For in very deed it is a great and a wonderful thing, and full of amazement that our flesh should sit on high, and be adored by Angels and Archangels, by the Cherubim and the Seraphim. For myself having oftentimes thought upon this, I am amazed at it, and imagine to myself great things concerning the human race. For I see that the introductions are great and splendid, and that God has great zeal on behalf of our nature.

Moreover he said not of men (simply) He takes hold, but wishing to exalt them [the Hebrews] and to show that their race is great and honorable, he says, but of the seed of Abraham He takes hold.
