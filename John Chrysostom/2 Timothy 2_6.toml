"The husbandman that laboreth must be first partaker of the fruits." He had first spoken from his own example as a teacher. He now speaks from those that are more common, as wrestlers and soldiers, and in their case he sets before him the rewards.

For why does he not say the husbandman simply, but him "that laboreth"? not only that worketh, but that is worn with toil?

When therefore he has set before him the examples of soldiers, of wrestlers, and husbandmen, and all figuratively, "No one," he says, "is crowned except he strive lawfully."
