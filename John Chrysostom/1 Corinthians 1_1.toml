From the very beginning Paul casts down the Corinthians’ pride, in that he speaks of himself as “called.” “For what I have learned,” says Paul, “I did not discover myself, but it was while I was persecuting the church that I was called. It was God who willed that you too should be saved in this way.” We have done nothing good by ourselves, but by God’s will we have been saved. We were called because it seemed good to him, not because we were worthy.
