Now these things were enough to recommend men to receive them, their appointed healers. Yea, who would choose but receive with all readiness them that were so noble, such true heroes, and as lions running about the earth, and despising all that pertained to themselves, so that others might be saved? Yet nevertheless He proffers also another reward, indicating that He is caring here for the entertainers more than for the guests.

And the first honor He confers is by saying, He that receives you, receives me, and he that receives me, receives Him that sent me. Matthew 10:40

With this, what may compare? That one should receive the Father and the Son!
