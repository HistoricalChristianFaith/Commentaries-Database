Vast indeed are the mysteries and secrets of which He has made us partakers. And these it is not possible for us to understand otherwise than by being partakers of the Holy Ghost, and by receiving abundant grace. And it is for this reason that Paul prays. The Father of glory, that is, He that has given us vast blessings, for he constantly addresses Him according to the subject he is upon, as, for instance, when he says, The Father of mercies and God of all comfort. 2 Corinthians 1:3 And, again, the Prophet says, The Lord is my strength and my might. Psalm 18:1

* Far above all rule, he says.
Need then indeed is there of the Spirit, of an understanding wise in the knowledge of Him. Need then is there indeed of revelation. Reflect, how vast is the distance between the nature of man and of God. Yet from this vile estate has He exalted Him to that high dignity. Nor does He mount by degrees, first one step, then another, then a third. Amazing! He does not simply say, above, but, far above; for God is above those powers which are above. And there then has He raised Him, Him that is one of us, brought Him from the lowest point to the supremest sovereignty, to that beyond which there is no other honor. Above all principality, he says, not, i.e., over one and not over another, but over all,

* Rule and authority and power, and dominion, and every name that is named.
Whatever there be in Heaven, He has become above all. And this is said of Him that was raised from the dead which is worthy of our admiration; for of God the Word, it cannot possibly be, because what insects are in comparison of man, this the whole creation is in comparison of God. If all mankind are to be counted as spittle and were counted as the turn of a balance, consider the invisible powers as insects. But of Him that was one of us, this is great and surprising indeed. For He raised Him up from the very lowest parts of the earth. If all the nations are as a drop, how small a portion then of that drop is a single man! Yet Him has He made higher than all things, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. Therefore powers there are whose names are to us unintelligible, and unknown.

He says not merely “above” but “far above.” For God is higher than the powers on high. So he led him up there, the very one who shared our lowly humanity. He led him from the lowest depth to the highest sovereignty, beyond which there is no higher honor. “Above every sovereignty,” he says: not merely compared with this or that.… What gnats are compared with humans, so is the whole creation compared with God.
