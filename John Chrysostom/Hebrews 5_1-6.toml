The blessed Paul wishes to show that this covenant is far better than the old. He does this by first laying down remote considerations … just as in the epistle to the Romans, having argued that faith effects that which the labor of the law or the sweat of the daily life could not, an argument of which they were not easily persuaded … so now here also he opens out the other path of the priesthood, showing its superiority from the things which happened before. And as, in the matter of punishment, he brings before them not hell alone, but also what happened to their ancestors, so now here also, he first establishes this position from things present. For it were right indeed that earthly things should be proved from heavenly, but when the hearers are weak, the opposite course is taken.
