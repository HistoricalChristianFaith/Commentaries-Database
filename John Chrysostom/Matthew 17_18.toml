See herein also his folly, in that before the multitude he appeals to Jesus against His disciples. But He clears them from shame, imputing their failure to the  patient himself; for many things show that he was weak in faith. But Headdresses His reproof not to the man singly, that He may not trouble him, butto the Jews in general.
