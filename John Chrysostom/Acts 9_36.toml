Observe everywhere the signs taking place. But let us so believe them, as if we were now beholding them. It is not simply said, that Tabitha died, but that she died, having been in a state of weakness. And (yet) they did not call Peter until she died; then they sent and told him not to delay to come unto them. Observe, they send and call him by others. And he comes: he did not think it a piece of disrespect, to be summoned by two men: for, it says, they sent two men unto him.â€” Affliction, my beloved, is a great thing, and rivets our souls together. Not a word of wailing there, nor of mourning. See how thoroughly matters are cleansed! Having washed her, it says, they laid her in an upper chamber: that is, they did all (that was right) for the dead body. Then Peter having come, knelt down, and prayed; and turning him to the body, said, Tabitha, arise.
