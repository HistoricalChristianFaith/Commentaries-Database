It was not without purpose that the writer informed us of the woman’s name, but to show that her character matched her name—she was active and wakeful as a gazelle. For many names are bestowed by providence, as we have often said to you. “She was full,” it says, “of good works.” Not only of alms but also “of good works,” both in general and of this good work in particular, “which Dorcas made while she was with them.” What humility! Unlike us, all of them were together, and she worked and made clothes.

If you want to be remembered and are anxious for true repute, imitate her, and build edifices like that, not going to expense on lifeless matter but displaying great generosity in regard to your fellow human beings. This is the remembrance that is worth admiring and brings great benefit.
