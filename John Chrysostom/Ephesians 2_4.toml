* But God, being rich in mercy.

Not merely merciful, but rich in mercy; as it is said also in another place; In the multitude of your mercies. Psalm 69:17 And again, Have mercy upon me, according to the multitude of your tender mercies. Psalm 51:1

* For His great love, wherewith He loved us.

Why did He love us? For these things are not deserving of love, but of the sorest wrath, and punishment. And thus it was of great mercy.
