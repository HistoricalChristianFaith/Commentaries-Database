To say “who raised him from the dead” is to encapsulate the essence of God’s beneficence toward us, which coincides in no small part with his present purpose. For the majority are much less apt to listen to words that establish the majesty of God than to those which demonstrate his good will to humanity.

How then does he himself say, "Not from men, nor by man?" Because it was not man that called or brought him over: this is why he says, "Not from men. Neither by man," that is, that he was not sent by this man, but by the Spirit.
