As the word of God has power to do all things, so also has he who has the spiritual gift. For the word of God, says he, is living, and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. Hebrews 4:12 Now mark the wisdom of this blessed Apostle. He has armed them with all security. What then is necessary after that? To call upon the King, that He may stretch forth His hand. With all prayer, and supplication, praying at all seasons in the Spirit; for it is possible to pray not in the Spirit, when one uses vain repetitions Matthew 6:7; and watching thereunto, he adds, that is, keeping sober; for such ought the armed warrior, he that stands at the King's side, to be; wakeful and temperate:â€” in all perseverance and supplication for all the saints; and on my behalf that utterance may be given unto me in opening my mouth. What do you say, blessed Paul? Have you, then, need of your disciples? And well does he say, in opening my mouth. He did not then study what he used to say, but according to what Christ said, When they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what you shall speak: for it shall be given you in that hour what you shall speak Matthew 10:19: so truly did he do everything by faith, everything by grace. With boldness, he proceeds, to make known the mystery of the Gospel; that is, that I may answer for myself in its defense, as I ought. And are you bound in your chain, and still needest the aid of others? Yea, says he, for so was Peter also bound in his chain, and yet nevertheless was prayer made earnestly for him. Acts 12:5 For which I am an ambassador in chains, that in it I may speak boldly, as I ought to speak; that is, that I may answer with confidence, with courage, with great prudence.

See how clever this blessed author is. He has armed them with the utmost protection. So now what remains? Only to call on the king and urge him to extend his hand.
