He shows their affection also by saying, Upon his neck, as taking a last and yet a last embrace, such was the love they conceived from his discourse, such the spell of love that bound them. For if we groan when simply parting from each other, although we know that we shall receive one another back again, what a tearing away of themselves it must have been to them! Methinks Paul also wept. Having torn ourselves away, he says: he shows the violence of it by saying, having torn ourselves away from them. And with reason: otherwise they could never have got to sea. What means, We came with a straight course unto Coos? Instead of saying, we did not go round nor make stay in other places.
