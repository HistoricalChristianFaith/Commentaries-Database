For since he said, our tribulation; he both explains of what sort it was, and magnifies it by his words, in order to show that the consolation and joys received from them was great, seeing it had repelled so great a sorrow. But we were afflicted on every side.

How on every side? For without were fightings, from the unbelievers; within were fears; because of the weak among the believers, lest they should be drawn aside. For not among the Corinthians only did these things happen, but elsewhere also.
