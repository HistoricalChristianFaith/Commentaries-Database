Paul had to contend with the opposition of unbelievers without and of weak-kneed believers within.

[[commentary]]

"For even when we had come into Macedonia, our flesh had no relief."

For since he said, "our tribulation;" he both explains of what sort it was, and magnifies it by his words, in order to show that the consolation and joys received from them  was great, seeing it had repelled so great a sorrow. "But we were afflicted on every side."

How on every side? For "without were fightings," from the unbelievers; "within were fears;" because of the weak among the believers, lest they should be drawn aside. For not among the Corinthians only did these things happen, but elsewhere also.
