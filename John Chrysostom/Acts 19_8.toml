See him in every place forcing his way into the synagogue, and in this manner departing thence. For in every place, he wished to have the occasion given him by them. He wished to separate the disciples thence, and to have the beginning for ceasing to assemble with them, given by the Jews themselves. He was henceforth "provoking them to jealousy." For both the Gentiles readily received him, and the Jews, upon the Gentiles receiving him, repented. This is why he continually made a stir among them, "for three months arguing and persuading concerning the kingdom of God": for you must not suppose because you hear of his "speaking boldly," that there was any harshness: it was of good things that he discoursed, of a kingdom: who would not have heard him?
