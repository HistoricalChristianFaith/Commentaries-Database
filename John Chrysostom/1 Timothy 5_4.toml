Ver. 4. "But if any widow have children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show piety at home, and to requite their parents."

Observe the discretion of Paul; how often he urges men from human considerations. For he does not here lay down any great and lofty motive, but one that is easy to be understood: "to requite their parents." How? For bringing them up and educating them. As if he should say, You have received from them great care. They are departed. You can not requite them. For thou did not bring them forth, nor nourish them. Requite them  in their descendants, repay the debt through the children. "Let them learn first to show piety at home." Here he more simply exhorts them to acts of kindness; then to excite them the more, he adds,

"For that is good and acceptable before God." And as he had spoken of those "who are widows indeed," he declares who is indeed a widow.
