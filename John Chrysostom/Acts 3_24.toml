Then [Peter] takes refuge in what is trustworthy, saying, “The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet from your brothers as he raised me up. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.” And then the severity of the punishment, “And it shall be that every soul that does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people. And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came afterwards, also proclaimed these days.” … It is remarkable that the two stand together, obedience and disobedience, and the punishment. “As I am,” he says (why are you alarmed at this?), “You are the sons of the prophets.” It was to you that they spoke, and it was for your sake that all these things have come to pass. They were of the belief that they had alienated themselves through their outrage—for it was illogical that the same one was now crucified and now cherished them as his own. So he proves to them that both the one and the other are in accordance with prophecy.
