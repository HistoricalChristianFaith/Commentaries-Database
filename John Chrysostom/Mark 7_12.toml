Christ says, “Care for the poor”; Mammon says, “Take away even those things the poor possess.” Christ says, “Empty yourself of what you have”;19 Mammon says, “Take also what they possess.” Do you see the opposition, the strife between them? See how it is that one cannot obey both, but must reject one?… Christ says, “None of you can become my disciple if you do not give up all your possessions”; Mammon says, “Take the bread from the hungry.” Christ says, “Cover the naked”;21 the other says, “Strip the naked.” Christ says, “You shall not turn away from your own family, and those of your own house”;23 Mammon says, “You shall not show mercy to those of your own family. Though you see your mother or your father in want, despise them.”
