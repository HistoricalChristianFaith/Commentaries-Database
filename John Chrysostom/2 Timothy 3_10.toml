Ver. 10. "But you have fully known  my doctrine." Wherefore be strong; for thou were not merely present, but followed closely. Here he seems to imply that the period had been long, in that he says, "You have followed up my doctrine"; this refers to his discourse. "Manner of life"; this to his conduct. "Purpose"; this to his zeal, and the firmness of his soul. I did not say these things, he says, and not do them; nor was I a philosopher in words only. "Faith, longsuffering." He means, how none of these things troubled me. "Charity," which those men had not; "patience," nor yet this. Towards the heretics, he means, I show much longsuffering; "patience," that under persecution.
