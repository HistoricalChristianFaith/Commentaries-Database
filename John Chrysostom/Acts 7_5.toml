Herein is shown the greatness both of God's goodness and of Abraham's faith. For the expression, when as yet he had no child, does show his obedience and faith. Promised to give it to him and to his seed. And yet the events showed the contrary: namely, after he came, he had not so much as to set his foot on, had not a child; which very things were contrary to his faith.

These things having seen, let us likewise, whatever God shall promise, receive the same, however contrary may be the events. And yet in our case, they are not contrary, but very suitable. For where the promises are, there, when the contraries turn out, they are really contrary; but in our case it is just the reverse: for He has told us that we should have tribulation here, but our rest there. Why do we confound the times? Why do we turn things upside down? Say, are you afflicted, and livest in poverty, and in dejection? Be not troubled: for it were worth being troubled at, were thou destined to be afflicted in that world: as for this present affliction, it is the cause of rest. This sickness, says He, is not unto death. John 11:4 That affliction is punishment: this, schooling and correction. It is a contest, this life present: if so, to fight is our business now: it is war and battle. In war one does not seek to have rest, in war one does not seek to have dainty living, one is not anxious about riches, one's care is not about a wife then: one thing only he looks at, how he may overcome his foes. Be this our care likewise: if we overcome, and return with the victory, God will give us all things. Be this alone our study, how we may overcome the devil: though after all it is not our own study that does it, but God's grace does the whole business. Be it our one study, how we may attract His grace, how we may draw to ourselves that assistance. If God be for us, who can be against us? Romans 8:31 Let us make one thing our study; that He be not our enemy, that He turn not away from us.

Not the being afflicted is an evil; the evil is, to sin. This is the sore affliction, however we may pass our days in luxury:— not to speak of the life to come, it is so even in this life present. Think how our conscience is stung with remorse, and whether this is not worse than any kind of torture! I should like to put the question searchingly to those who live in evil ways (ἐ ν κακοἵς), whether they never come to reflect upon their own sins, whether they do not tremble, and are in fear and anguish, whether they do not think those blessed who live in abstinence, them of the mountains, them of the strict rule? (τοὺς ἐν πολλῇ φιλοσοφί& 139Apostles rejoiced when scourged. Paul gives this exhortation, saying, Rejoice in the Lord. Philippians 4:4 And how can there be rejoicing, where there are bonds, where there are tortures; where there are courts of justice? There, most of all, is rejoicing. But say, how can there be rejoicing, where these are not? For he who is conscious of no evil, will have a sort of exceeding delight, insomuch that in what degree you speak of tribulation, in the same you tell of his delight. The soldier who has received numberless wounds and has come home again, will he not return with exceeding delight, with his wounds as his title for speaking up boldly, and as evidence of his glory and renown? And thou, if you be able to exclaim as Paul does, I bear the marks of Jesus Galatians 6:17, will be able to become great and glorious and renowned. But there is no persecution. Make your stand against glory: and should any one speak anything against you, fear not to be evil-spoken of for Christ's sake: make your stand against the tyranny of pride, against the fighting of anger, against the torment of concupiscence. These also are marks, these also are torments. For, I ask, what is the worst in tortures? Is it not, that the soul is pained, and is on fire? For in the other case, the body too has its share: but in this, the whole belongs to the soul. On the soul alone comes all the smart, when one is angry, when one is envious, whatever else of this kind one does, or rather suffers. For, in fact, it is not action, but passion, not a doing, but a suffering— to be angered, to feel envy: therefore indeed they are called passions (or sufferings) (πάθη, perturbationes) of the soul, yea wounds, and bruises. For it is indeed a suffering, and worse than suffering. Bethink you, you that are angry, that you do such things in passion, in a state of suffering. Therefore he who is not angry suffers not. Do you mark that not he who is abused is the sufferer, but he that abuses, as I said above? For that he is a sufferer, is plain in the first place from the very fact, that such a thing is called by this name of passion: and it is also plain from the (effects on the) body: for these are the affections (πάθη) for sufferings, as we call them] engendered by anger, viz. dimness of vision, insanity, and numberless others. But he insulted my boy, say you; but [he called him] clown. Deem it not weakness your not doing the same thing yourself. For, I ask you, was it well done? You will not say that: then leave that undone which being done were not well done. I know what passions are engendered in such cases. But, say you, how if he despise me, how if he say it again? Show him that he is in the wrong: rebuke him, entreat him: by meekness anger is put down: go and expostulate with him. For though in cases of wrong done to ourselves it is right not to do even this, yet it is quite necessary to do it in behalf of others. Do not look on it as an insult to yourself that your boy has been insulted: annoyed you may be for his sake, yet not as if you were insulted: for it does not follow because your boy has been ill-treated, that you are disgraced, but he is disgraced that did the ill. Quench (your anger) that sharp sword: let it lie in its scabbard. If we have it unsheathed, we shall be apt to use it even when the time is not proper, being drawn on by it: but if it be hidden, though a necessity should arise, yet, while we seek it in order to draw it, the anger will be quenched. Christ would not have us be angry on his account: (hear what He says to Peter: Put up again your sword into the sheath:) Matthew 26:52 and are you angry on account of a boy? Teach your boy also to be philosophical: tell him your own sufferings: imitate (herein) your Teacher. Matthew 26:52 When they too (His disciples) were about to be treated with dishonor, He said not, I will avenge you: but, to Me also, says He, they have done the same: bear it nobly, for you are not better than I. These words too do thou speak to your son and your boy: You are not better than your master. But these words of philosophy are counted as the talk of a widow woman. Alas! That it is not in the power of words to bring it home to people in the way that it is possible to be taught it by actual experience! And that you may learn this; stand between two combatants, take part with the wronged, not with the wrong-doers [that you may learn] whether you shall not see the victory on your side, whether you shall not get splendid crowns.— See, how God is insulted, and how He answers; how gently, Where, says He, is Abel your brother? and what says the other: Am I my brother's keeper? Genesis 6:9 What could be more contumacious than this? Would any one have heard it (patiently) even from a son? And if from a brother, would he not have thought such conduct an insult? What then? See how again God gently answers, The voice of your brother's blood, says He cries unto Me. But God, it will be said, is superior to wrath. Yes, but for this reason the Son of God came down, that He might make you a God as far as human power can go. But I cannot, says one, seeing I am man. Well then, let us give you men for instances. And do not suppose I speak of Paul or of Peter: no, but of some of inferior sort, yea, very much lower down. Eli's menial insulted Hannah, saying, Put away your wine from you. 1 Samuel 1:14 What could be more insulting than this? What then said she? I am a woman of a hard lot. Indeed, there is nothing equal to affliction: she is the mother of true philosophy. But this same woman, though she has her rival, insulted her not: but what does she? She takes refuge with God, and in her prayer does not even make mention of her, nor say, Avenge me, for such an one reproaches me: so magnanimous was that woman (let us men be ashamed):— and yet ye know, that there is nothing like jealousy. The publican, when insulted by the Pharisee, insulted not in return, though, had he wished it, he might have done so: but he bore it like a philosopher, saying, Be merciful to me a sinner. Luke 18:13 Mephibosheth, having been accused and calumniated by his servant, neither said, nor did, any evil to him, not even in the presence of the king himself. 2 Samuel 19:26 Shall I tell you even of a harlot, what philosophic magnanimity she showed? Hear Christ saying, as she was wiping His feet with her hair, The publicans and harlots go into the kingdom before you. Matthew 21:31 Do you see her standing, and taking courage, and washing away her own sins? Observe, how she was not angry even with the Pharisee, when reproached by him: for had He known, says he, that this woman is a sinner, He would not have suffered her Luke 7:39: and how she said not to him, What then? Say, are you pure from sins? but felt more, wept more, and let fall hotter tears. But if women and publicans and harlots play the philosopher, and that before grace (i.e. of Baptism), what pardon can they deserve, who, after so great grace, fight, and worry, and kick one another, worse than beasts? Nothing is more base than passion, nothing more disgraceful, nothing more frightful, nothing more odious, nothing more hurtful. These things I say, not only in order that towards men we may be gentle, but also if a wife be a talker, that you may bear it: let your wife be to you a school for training and exercise (παλαίστρα καὶ γυμνάσιον). For how can it but be absurd, to submit to exercises which yield no profit, where we afflict the body, but not to practise exercises at home, which, even before the contest, present to us a crown? Does your wife abuse you? Do not thou become a woman: to be abusive is womanly: it is a disease of the soul, an inferiority. Think not that it is unworthy of you, when your wife abuses you. Unworthy it is, when you are abusive, but she bears patiently (φιλοσοφῇ): then do you act unseemly, then are you disgraced: but if, having been abused, thou bear it, great is the proof of your strength. I do not say this, to induce wives to be abusive: God forbid: but only in case it should so happen at the instance of Satan. It is the part of men that are strong, to bear the weak. And if your servant contradict you, bear it philosophically: not what he deserves to have said to him, do thou say or do, but that which it behooves you both to do and to say. Never insult a girl by uttering some foul word against her: never call your servant, scoundrel (μιαρὸν): not he is disgraced, but thou. It is not possible to be master of one's self, being in a passion. Like a sea rolling mountains high, it is all hurly-burly: or even as a pure fountain, when mire is cast into it, becomes muddied, and all is in turmoil. You may beat him, you may rend his coat to rags, but it is you that sustain the greater damage: for to him the blow is on the body and the garment, but to you on the soul. It is your own soul that you have cut open; it is there that you have inflicted a wound: you have flung your own charioteer from his horses, you have got him dragging along the ground upon his back. And it is all one, as if one driver being in a passion with another, should choose to be thus dragged along. You may rebuke, you may chide, you may do whatever if be, only let it be without wrath and passion. For if he who rebukes is physician to him who offends, how can he heal another, when he has first hurt himself, when he does not heal himself? Say, if a physician should go to heal another person, does he first wound his own hand, first blind his own eyes, and so set about healing that other? God forbid. So also, however thou rebuke, however thou chide, let your eyes see clearly. Do not make your mind muddy, else how shall the cure be wrought? It is not possible to be in the same tranquillity, being in a passion, and being free from passion. Why do you first overturn your master from his seat, and then discourse with him as he lies sprawling on the ground? Do you see not the judges, how, when about to hold the assize, they seat themselves upon the bench, in their becoming attire? Thus do thou likewise dress your soul with the judicial robe (which is gentleness). But he will not be afraid of me, say you. He will be the more afraid. In the other case, though you speak justly, your servant will impute it to passion: but if you do it with gentleness, he will condemn himself: and, what is of the first importance, God will accept you, and thus you will be able to attain unto the eternal blessings, through the grace and loving-kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father together with the Holy Spirit be glory, dominion, and honor, now and ever, and world without end. Amen.
