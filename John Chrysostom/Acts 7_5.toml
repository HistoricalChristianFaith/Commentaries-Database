Do you see how what occurred contradicted the promise? Again he said, “In Isaac will your seed be named,” and Abraham believed. Then he says, “Offer to me as sacrifice this,” while this was the one who was to fill all the world from his seed. Did you notice the contradiction between the commands and the promise? He commanded what was in opposition to the promises. Yet not even so did the just man lose his head or say that he had been deceived.
