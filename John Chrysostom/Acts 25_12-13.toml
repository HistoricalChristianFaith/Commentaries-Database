"Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council" - do you observe how he seeks to gratify them? for this is favor - "having conferred," it says, "with the council, he said, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shall thou go." See how his trial is again lengthened out, and how the plot against him becomes an occasion for the preaching: so that with ease and in safe custody he should be taken away to Rome, with none to plot evil against him: for it was not the same thing his simply coming there, and his coming on such a cause. For, in fact this was what made the Jews come together there. Then again, some time passes while he tarries at Jerusalem, that you may learn, that, though some time passed, the evil design against him prevails nothing, God not permitting it.

But this king Agrippa, who was also a Herod, was a different Agrippa, after him of James' time, so that this is the fourth Herod. See how his enemies cooperate with him against their will. To make the audience large, Agrippa falls into a desire of hearing: and he does not simply hear, but with much parade.
