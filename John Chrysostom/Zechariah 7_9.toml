[You] should have fasted then, when drunkenness was doing those terrible things to you, when your gluttony was giving birth to your ungodliness—not now. Now your fasting is untimely and an abomination. Who said so? Isaiah himself when he called out in a loud voice: “ ‘I did not choose this fast,’ says the Lord.” Why? “You quarrel and squabble when you fast and strike those subject to you with your fists.” But if your fasting was an abomination when you were striking your fellow slaves, does it become acceptable now that you have slain your master? How could that be right?
