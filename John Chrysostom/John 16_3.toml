It is sufficient for your comfort that you endure these things for My sake, and the Father's. Here He reminds them of the blessedness of which He spoke at the beginning, Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for My sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven. Matthew 5:11-12

He says to them, in effect: It is sufficient comfort that you endure these things for my sake and the Father’s. Here he reminds them of the blessedness of which he spoke at the beginning, “Blessed are you when people shall revile you, and persecute you and shall say all kinds of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad. For great is your reward in heaven.”
