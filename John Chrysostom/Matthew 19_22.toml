Hom., lxiii: But I for my part, though I deny not that he was a lover of money, because Christ convicts him as such, cannot consider him to have been ahypocrite, because it is unsafe to decide in uncertain cases, and especially in making charges against any. Moreover Mark removes all suspicion of this kind, for he says that he came to Him, and knelt before Him; and that Jesus when He looked on him, loved him. And if he had come to tempt Him, the Evangelist would have signified as much, as he has done in other places. Or if he had said nothing thereof, Christ would not have suffered him to be hid, but would either have convicted him openly, or have covertly suggested it.But He does not this; for it follows, “Hesaith unto him, Why askest thou me concerning good?”.
Wherein then was the profit that He answered thus? He leads him by degrees, and teaches him to lay aside false flattery, and rising above the things which are upon earth to cleave to God, to seek things to come, and to know Him that is truly good, the root and source of every good.
This he said not to tempt Him, but because he supposed that they were other than the commandments of the Law, which should be the means of life to him.
But because all the commandments that the Lord had recounted were contained in the Law, The young man saith unto him, “All these have I kept from my youth up.” And did not even rest there, but asked further, “What lack I yet? which alone is a mark of his intense desire.
And because He spake of riches warning us to strip ourselves of them, He promises to repay things greater, by how much heaven is greater than earth, and therefore He says, “And thou shalt have treasure in heaven.” By the word treasure He denotes the abundance and endurance of the reward.
For they that have little, and they that abound, are not in like measure encumbered. For the acquisition of riches raises a greater flame, and desire ismore violently kindled.

After this the evangelist, as it were to show that he has not felt anything it was unlikely he should feel, says, For he had great possessions. For they that have little are not equally held in subjection, as they that are overflowed with great affluence, for then the love of it becomes more tyrannical. Which thing I cease not always saying, that the increase of acquisitions kindles the flame more, and renders the getters poorer, inasmuch as it puts them in greater desire, and makes them have more feeling of their want.

See, for example, even here what strength did this passion exhibit. Him that had come to Him with joy and forwardness, when Christ commanded him to cast away his riches, it so overwhelmed and weighed down, as not to suffer him so much as to answer touching these things, but silenced and become dejected and sullen to go away.
