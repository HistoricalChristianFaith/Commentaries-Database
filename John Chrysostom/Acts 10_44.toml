Observe God’s providential management. He does not suffer the speech to be finished or the baptism to take place upon a command of Peter, but, when he has made it evident how admirable their state of mind is, and a beginning is made of the work of teaching and they have believed that assuredly baptism is the remission of sins, then the Spirit immediately comes upon them. Now this is done by God’s so disposing it as to provide for Peter a mighty ground of justification. And it is not simply that the Spirit came upon them, but “they spoke with tongues,” which was the thing that astonished those who had come together. They altogether disliked the matter, wherefore it is that the whole is of God; and as for Peter, it may almost be said, that he is present only to be taught (with them) the lesson, that they must take the Gentiles in hand and that they themselves are the persons by whom this must be done.
