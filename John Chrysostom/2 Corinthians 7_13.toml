And in your comfort, we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.

See again how he exalts their praises, and shows their love. For having said, 'I was pleased that my Epistle wrought so much and that you gained so much,' for I rejoice, he says, not that you were made sorry, but that you were made sorry unto repentance; and having shown his own love, for he says, Though I wrote unto you, I wrote not for his cause that did the wrong, nor for his cause that suffered the wrong, but that our care for you might be made manifest to you: again he mentions another sign of their good will, which brings them great praise and shows the genuineness of their affection. For, in your comfort , he says, we joyed the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus. And yet this is no sign of one that loves them exceedingly; rejoicing rather for Titus than for them. 'Yes,' he replies, 'it is, for I joyed not so much for his cause as for yours.' Therefore also he subjoins the reason, saying, because his bowels were refreshed by you all. He said not, 'he,' but his bowels; that is, 'his love for you.' And how were they refreshed? By all. For this too is a very great praise.
