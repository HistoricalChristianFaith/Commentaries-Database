That is, He did not wait to learn this from their coming, but spoke and acted without confusion, as knowing all these things. But why come they with weapons, when about to seize Him? They feared His followers, and for this reason they came upon Him late at night. And He went forth, and said unto them, Whom do you seek?

Do you see his invincible power, how being in the midst of them he disabled their eyes? For that the darkness was not the cause of their not knowing him, the Evangelist has shown by saying that they also had torches. And even had there been no torches, they ought at least to have known him by his voice. Or if they did not know it, how could Judas be ignorant, who had been so continually with him? For he too stood with them and knew him no more than they, but with them he fell backward. Now Jesus did this to show that not only could they not seize him but that they could not even see him when he was in their midst, unless he himself permitted.
