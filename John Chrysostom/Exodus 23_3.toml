“You shall not favor a poor man in his lawsuit,” Scripture says. What therefore is the meaning of these words? “Do not be overcome by pity or unduly influenced if the wrongdoer happens to be a poor man,” it means. And if we must not show favor to the poor man, much more must we not do so for the rich. Moreover, I address these words not only to judges but also to all men, so that justice may nowhere be corrupted but everywhere kept inviolate.
