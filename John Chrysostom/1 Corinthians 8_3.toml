"But if any man love God, the same," he does not say, "knows Him," but, "is known of Him." For we have not known Him, but He has known us. And therefore did Christ say, "You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you." And Paul elsewhere, "Then shall I know fully,  even as also I have been known."

Observe now, I pray, by what means he brings down their high-mindedness. First, he points out that not they alone knew the things which they knew; for "we all," he says, have knowledge. Next, that the thing itself was hurtful so long as it was without love; for "knowledge," says he, "puffs up." Thirdly, that even joined with love it is not complete nor perfect. "For if any man thinks that he knows anything, he knows nothing as yet as he ought to know," so he speaks. In addition to this, that they have not even this from themselves, but by gift from God. For he said not, "has known God," but, "is known of Him." Again, that this very thing comes of love which they have not as they ought. For, "if any man," says he, "love God, the same is known of Him." Having then so much at large allayed their irritation, he begins to speak doctrinally, saying thus.

We do not know God, but he knows us. This is why Christ said: “You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you” (Jn 15:16). This is the fruit of love and the death of pride.
