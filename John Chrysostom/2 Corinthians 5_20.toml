Seest thou how he has extolled the thing by introducing Christ thus in the form of a suppliant; yea rather not Christ only, but even the Father? For what he says is this: The Father sent the Son to beseech, and to be His Ambassador unto mankind. When then He was slain and gone, we succeeded to the embassy; and in His stead and the Father's we beseech you. So greatly doth He prize mankind that He gave up even the Son, and that knowing He would be slain, and made us Apostles for your sakes; so that he said with reason, "All things are for your sakes." "We are therefore ambassadors on behalf of Christ," that is, instead of Christ; for we have succeeded to His functions. But if this appears to thee a great thing, hear also what follows wherein he shows that they do this not in His stead only, but also in stead of the Father. For therefore he also added, "As though God were entreating by us." For not by the Son Himself only doth He beseech, but also by us who have succeeded to the office of the Son. Think not therefore, he says, that by us you are entreated; Christ Himself, the Father Himself of Christ, beseeches you by us. What can come up to this excess of goodness? He was outraged who had conferred innumerable benefits; having been outraged, He not only exacted not justice, but even gave His son that we might be reconciled. They that received Him were not reconciled, but even slew Him. Again, He sent other ambassadors to beseech, and though these are sent, it is Himself that entreats. And what doth He entreat? "Be ye reconciled unto God." And he said not, Reconcile God to yourselves; for it is not He that beareth enmity, but ye; for God never beareth enmity.
