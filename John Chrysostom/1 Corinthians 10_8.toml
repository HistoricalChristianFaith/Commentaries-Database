Why does Paul mention fornication again, when he has said so much about it already? It is always Paulâ€™s custom, when he admonishes people of many sins, to put them down in order before proceeding to deal with them individually, and then to refer to earlier topics as he goes down the list. God himself does this in the Old Testament when, in mentioning each particular transgression he keeps going back to the golden calf, reminding the Jews of that sin. Paul is doing this here, reminding them of the sin of fornication and pointing out that the cause of that evil was sloth and gluttony.
