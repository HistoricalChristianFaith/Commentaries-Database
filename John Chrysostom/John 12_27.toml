But surely this is not  the expression of one urging them to go even to death. Nay, it is that of one greatly so urging them. For lest they should say, that He being exempt from mortal pains easily philosophizes on death, and exhorts us being himself in no danger, He shows, that although feeling its agony,  on account of its profitableness He declines it not. But these things belong to the Dispensation, not the Godhead. Wherefore He says, Now is My soul troubled; since if this be not the case, What connection has that which was spoken, and His saying, Father, save Me from this hour? And so troubled, that He even sought deliverance from death, if at least it were possible to escape. These were the infirmities of His human nature.

2. But, He says, I have not what to say, when asking for deliverance.

For for this cause came I unto this hour.

As though He had said, Though we be confounded, though we be troubled, let us not fly from death, since even now I though troubled do not speak of flying; for it behooves to bear what is coming on. I say not, Deliver Me from this hour, but what?

Surely this is not the expression of one urging them to go even to death. No, but it is that of one who is greatly urging them on. For they might try to say that he was exempt from mortal pain and so it was easy for him to ruminate about death, and this is how he can exhort us because he himself is in no danger. This is why he shows here that, although he dreaded death, he does not refuse it, because it is efficacious for our salvation. But this is a manifestation of his humanity not of his divinity, which is why he says, “Now my soul is troubled,” since if this is not the case, what connection does what was spoken here have with his saying, “Father, save me from this hour”? And he is so troubled that he even looked for deliverance from death if it were possible to escape. These were the infirmities of his human nature.

Although my trouble urges me to say, “Save me,” yet I say the opposite, “Glorify your name,” that is, “From now on, lead me to your cross.” Here he definitely shows his humanity and a nature unwilling to die that is clinging to this present life. It proves that he was not exempt from human feelings. To have a desire for this present life is not necessarily wrong, though, any more than it is to be hungry or to want to sleep. Christ indeed had a body free from sin, and yet it was not free from the natural wants of the body; otherwise it would not have been a body.
