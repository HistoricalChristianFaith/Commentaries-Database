Do you see that he does not remain with them continually, nor is his presence with them the same as before? He appeared, for instance, in the evening, and then disappeared. Then after eight days he appeared once again, and again he disappeared. Then he appeared later again by the sea, and then another time, causing great awe. But what does John mean when he says Jesus “showed” himself? It is clear from this that he was not seen unless he condescended to be seen because his body was from this time forward incorruptible and of unmixed purity. But why has the writer mentioned the place? To show that he had now taken away the greater part of their fear so that they now ventured out from their home and went about everywhere. For they were no longer shut up at home but had gone into Galilee to avoid danger from the Jews. Simon, therefore, comes to fish. For since neither [Christ] was with them continually, nor was the Spirit yet given, nor were they at that time yet entrusted with anything and so had nothing to do, they returned to their trade.

Having then nothing to do, they went fishing, and they did this at night because they were terribly frightened. Luke also mentions this, but this is not the same occasion. And the other disciples followed because from that time on they were bound to one another, and at the same time desired to see the fishing and use their leisure time well. While they were working and tired, Jesus presents himself before them and does not reveal himself all at once so that they enter into conversation with him.
