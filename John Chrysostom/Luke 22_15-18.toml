Again, in another place Christ said, “I have greatly desired to eat this Pasch with you.” Why then did he say “this Pasch” even though at other times he had observed this feast with them? Why then? Because the cross would follow this Pasch. And again he said, “Father, glorify your Son so that your Son may glorify you.” To be sure, in many places we find him foretelling the Passion, desiring that it come to pass and saying that this was the reason he had come into the world.
