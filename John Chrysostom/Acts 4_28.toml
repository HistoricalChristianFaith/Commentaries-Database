Scripture is accustomed to speak of one as of many. That is, they did not have power to do this, but you did it all, you who gave permission, who called them to account, who brought it to fruition, you the all-skillful and wise, who used your enemies for your own purpose. Here they speak of his exceeding skill and wisdom and of his power. They gathered together as your enemies with murderous intent and in opposition, but in fact they were doing what you wanted them to do, for we read, “to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.” What is “your hand”? I think here it means the same as power and purpose, that is, for you it is enough simply to will.
