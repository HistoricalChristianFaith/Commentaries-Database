And as Isaiah said before, “Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we would have been as Sodom and would have been made like to Gomorrah.” Here again he shows another thing, that not even those few were saved by their own resources. They too would have perished and met with Sodom’s fate, that is, they would have had to undergo utter destruction. They (of Sodom) were destroyed root and branch and left not even the slightest remnant of themselves. They too, he means, would have been like these, unless God had used much kindness to them and had saved them by faith. This happened also in the case of the visible captivity, the majority having been taken away captive and perished and some few only being saved.
