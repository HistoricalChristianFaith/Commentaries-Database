“And as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment.” He next says why he died once only: because he became a ransom by one death. “It is appointed,” he says “for men to die once.” This then is the meaning of “he died once,” for all. What then? Do we no longer die that death? We do indeed die, but we do not continue in it, which is not to die at all. For the tyranny of death, and death indeed, is when he who dies is never more allowed to return to life. But when after dying there is life, indeed a better life, this is not death, but sleep. Since, then, death was to have possession of all, he therefore died that he might deliver us.
