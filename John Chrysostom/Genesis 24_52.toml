Do you see how much care they took in ancient times to obtain wives for their sons? How they looked for nobility ahead of money? None of the agreements, none of the contracts or the other ridiculous things that happen these days, nor those terms committed to writing: If someone dies childless, one says, if this or that happens. Instead, among people of those times things were not like this. Rather, the maid’s behavior alone was the most secure contract—no pomp and circumstance. You will realize this when you see the maid led to her nuptials. “Hearing this from the father and the brother … the servant prostrated himself in worship to God.” Note how in everything that happened he gave thanks to the Lord of all. You see, it was God who prepared everything in advance and in response to the patriarch’s prayer sent his angel ahead of him—he it was who conducted the whole business for him.
