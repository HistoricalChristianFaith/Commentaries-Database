That you might learn that it was for the disciples’ sakes that this was done, that he might train them in confidence, listen to what he said afterward: “You also shall do greater things, if you are willing to believe and to be confident in prayer.” All this was done for their sakes, that they might not be afraid and tremble at plots against them. He repeated this to enable them to cleave to prayer and faith. For you shall not only do this, but you shall also remove mountains; and many more things you shall do, being confident in faith and prayer.
