He praises and approves the man, because he had said, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? and yet he ought to have been blamed. Surely not; for the words are not those of an unbeliever, nor deserving blame, but praise. How so, and in what way? Because Nathanael had considered the writings of the Prophets more than Philip. For he had heard from the Scriptures, that Christ must come from Bethlehem, and from the village in which David was. This belief at least prevailed among the Jews, and the Prophet had proclaimed it of old, saying, And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah, for out of you shall come a Governor, that shall feed  My people Israel. Matthew 2:6; Micah 5:2 And so when he heard that He was from Nazareth, he was confounded, and doubted, not finding the announcement of Philip to agree with the prediction of the Prophet.

But observe his wisdom and candor even in his doubting. He did not at once say, Philip, you deceive me, and speakest falsely, I believe you not, I will not come; I have learned from the prophets that Christ must come from Bethlehem, you say, 'from Nazareth'; therefore this is not that Christ. He said nothing like this; but what does he? He goes to Him himself; showing, by not admitting that Christ was of Nazareth, his accuracy respecting the Scriptures, and a character not easily deceived; and by not rejecting him who brought the tidings, the great desire which he felt for the coming of Christ. For he thought within himself that Philip was probably mistaken about the place.

2. And observe, I pray you, his manner of declining, how gentle he has made it, and in the form of a question. For he said not, Galilee produces no good; but how said he? Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip also was very prudent; for he is not as one perplexed, angry, and annoyed, but perseveres, wishing to bring over the  man, and manifesting  to us from the first of his preaching  the firmness  which becomes an Apostle. Wherefore also Christ says, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile. So that there is such a person as a false Israelite; but this is not such an one; for his judgment, Christ says, is impartial, he speaks nothing from favor, or from ill-feeling. Yet the Jews, when they were asked where Christ should be born, replied, In Bethlehem Matthew 2:5, and produced the evidence, saying, And thou, Bethlehem, art by no means the least among the princes of Judah. Micah 5:2 Before they had seen Him they bore this witness, but when they saw Him in their malice they concealed the testimony, saying, But as for this fellow, we know not whence He is. John 9:29 Nathanael did not so, but continued to retain the opinion which he had from the beginning, that He was not of Nazareth.

How then do the prophets call Him a Nazarene? From His being brought up and abiding there. And He omits to say, I am not 'of Nazareth,' as Philip has told you, but of Bethlehem, that He may not at once make the account seem questionable; and besides this, because, even if He had gained belief, He would not have given sufficient proof that He was the Christ. For what hindered Him without being Christ, from being of Bethlehem, like the others who were born there? This then He omits; but He does that which has most power to bring him over, for He shows that He was present when they were conversing. For when Nathanael had said,
