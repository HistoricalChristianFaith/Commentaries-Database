Observe the lowly-mindedness of Paul, observe his wisdom, how he gave a deep cut in the former part, and then when he had succeeded in what he wished, how he uses much kindliness next. For even without what he has said, this very confession of his having been bold were enough to unstring their vehemency. And this he does in writing to the Hebrews also, speaking as follows, "But, beloved, I am persuaded better things of you, and things which belong unto salvation, though we thus speak." [Hebrews 6:9] And to the Corinthians again, "Now I praise you, brethren, that you remember me in all things, and keep the ordinances, as I delivered them to you." [1 Corinthians 11:2] And in writing to the Galatians he says, "I have confidence in you, that you will be none otherwise minded." [Galatians 5:10] And in all parts of his Epistles one may find this to be frequently observed. But here even in a greater degree. For they were in a higher rank, and there was need to bring down their fastidious spirit, not by astringents only, but by laxatives also. For he does this in different ways. Wherefore he says in this place too, "I have written the more boldly unto you," and with this even he is not satisfied, but has added, "in some sort," that is, gently; and even here he does not pause, but what does he say? "As putting you in mind."  And he does not say as teaching, nor simply putting in mind, (ἀ ναμιμνήσκων) but he uses a word (ἐ παναμιμνήσκων) which means putting you in mind in a quiet way. Observe the end falling in with the introduction. For as in that passage he said, "that your faith is made known in all the world." [Romans 1:8] So in the end of the Epistle also, "For your obedience has reached unto all." [Romans 16:19] And as in the beginning he wrote, "For I long to see you, that I may impart unto you some spiritual gift, to the end that you may be established; that is, that I may be comforted together with you" (ib. 1:11, 12); so here also he said, "As putting you in mind." And having come down from the seat of the master, both there and here, he speaks to them as brethren and friends of equal rank. And this is quite a Teacher's duty, to give his address that variety which is profitable to the hearers. See then how after saying, "I have written the more boldly," and, "in some sort," and, "as putting you in mind," he was not satisfied even with these, but making his language still more lowly, he proceeds:

"Because of the grace that is given me of God." As he said at the beginning, "I am a debtor." [Romans 1:14] As if he had said, I have not snatched at the honor for myself, neither was I first to leap forward to it, but God commanded this, and this too according unto grace, not as if He had separated me for this office because I deserved it. Do not ye then be exasperated, since it is not I that raise myself up, but it is God that enjoins it. And as he there says, "whom I serve in the Gospel of His Son" [Romans 1:9], so also here, after saying, "because of the grace given unto me by God," he adds,

Note how humble and how wise Paul is. He cut deep in the first part of his discourse, and after obtaining what he wished, now he turns to kindliness. Even without the rest of what he said, his confession of boldness would be enough to calm their anger.… He often does this in his epistles, but here even more than usual. For the Romans were of a higher rank than the others, and Paul had to bring them down to size.
