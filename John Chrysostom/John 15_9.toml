Here at length He speaks in a more human manner, for this, as spoken to men,  has its peculiar force. Since what a measure of love did He manifest, who chose to die, who counted worthy of such honor those who were His slaves, His haters, His open enemies, and led them up to the heavens! If then I love you, be bold; if it be the glory of My Father that you bear fruit, imagine nothing ill. Then that He may not make them supine, observe how He braces them again,

Continue ye in My love.

For this you have the power to do. And how shall this be?
