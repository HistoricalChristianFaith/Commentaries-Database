But when Timothy came even now unto us, and brought us glad tidings of your faith and love. Brought us glad tidings, he says. Do you see the excessive joy of Paul? He does not say, brought us word, but brought us glad tidings. So great a good did he think their steadfastness and love. For it was necessary, the one remaining firm, that the other also must be steadfast. And he rejoiced in their love, because it was a sign of their faith. And that you have, he says, good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, even as we also to see you. That is, with praises. Not when we were present, nor when we were working miracles, but even now, when we are far off, and are scourged, and are suffering numberless evils, you have good remembrance of us. Hear how disciples are admired, who have good remembrance of their teachers, how they are called blessed. Let us imitate these. For we benefit ourselves, not those who are loved by us. Longing to see us, he says, as we also to see you. And this too cheered them; for to him who loves, to perceive that the beloved person knows that he is beloved, is a great comfort and consolation.
