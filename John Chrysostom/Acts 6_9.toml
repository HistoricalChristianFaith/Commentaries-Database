The synagogues were diverse: to wit, "Of the Libertines": "of the Cyrenians, i.e. those in the parts beyond Alexandria, of the Alexandrians," etc. There also they seem to have had synagogues according to their different nations; for many stayed behind there, that they might not be obliged to be continually travelling. The Libertines perhaps were freedmen of the Romans. As there were many foreigners dwelling there, so they had their synagogues, where the Law was to be read.
