He did not say that it was the Holy Spirit, nor did he mention the words of the prophet, but he brought in the prophecy by itself to fight its own battle. He also said nothing about Judas, although it was clear to everyone what sort of penalty he paid and the punishment he underwent. For nothing was more forceful than to argue with them from prophecy, which was even more forceful than facts. For when Christ performed miracles, they often contradicted him. But when Christ adduced the prophet, saying, “The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,” they were silent, and “no one was able to give him an answer.”
