Then also [there are] other [points]: He is made [Priest] (he says) by Another and does not of Himself intrude into [the office]. This too is common [Hebrews 5:4], "And no man takes this honor to himself, but he that is called of God as was Aaron."

Here again he conciliates  them in another point, because He was sent from God: which Christ was wont to say throughout to the Jews. "He that sent Me is greater than I," and, "I came not of Myself." [John 12:49; 14:28; 8:42]

He appears to me in these words also to hint at the priests of the Jews, as being no longer priests, [but] intruders and corrupters of the law of the priesthood; [Hebrews 5:5] "So Christ also glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest."

How then was He appointed (one says)? For Aaron was many times appointed as by the Rod, and when the fire came down and destroyed those who wished to intrude into the priesthood. But in this instance, on the contrary, they [the Jewish Priests] not only suffered nothing, but even are in high esteem. Whence then [His appointment]? He shows it from the prophecy. He has nothing [to allege] perceptible by sense, nothing visible. For this cause he affirms it from prophecy, from things future; "But He that said to Him You are My Son, today have I begotten You." What has this to do with the Son? Yea (he says) it is a preparation for His being appointed by God.
