And yet in Christ's time there came up (Greeks) to worship John 12:20: true, but here it speaks of Greeks who had no mind to worship. And they seized Paul, etc.

Mark their habitual conduct, how turbulent we everywhere find it, how men who with or without reason make a clamor in the midst. For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus an Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple. And all the city was moved, and the people ran together: and they took Paul, and drew him out of the temple and immediately the doors were shut. (v. 29, 30.) Men of Israel, it says, help: this is the man that (teaches) against the people, and the law, and this place.â€” the things which most trouble them, the Temple and the Law. And Paul does not tax the Apostles with being the cause of these things to him. And they drew him, it says, out of the Temple: and the doors were shut. For they wished to kill him; and therefore were dragging him out, to do this with greater security. And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the tribune of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar. Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them: and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they left beating of Paul. Then the tribune came near, and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done. And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude.
