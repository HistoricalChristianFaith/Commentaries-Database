For to have said to the parents, Deny that he is your son, and that he was born  blind, would have seemed very ridiculous. And again, to have said this to himself would have been manifest shamelessness. Wherefore they say not so, but manage the matter in another way, saying, Give God the glory, that is, confess that this man has wrought nothing.

We know that this man is a sinner.

Why then did ye not convict Him when He said, 'Which of you convinces Me of sin?' John 8:46 Whence know ye that He is a sinner? After that they had said, Give God the glory, and the man had made no reply, Christ meeting praised him, and did not rebuke him, nor say, Wherefore have you not given glory to God? But what said He? Do you believe in the Son of God?  John 9:35, that you may learn that this is to give glory to God. Now had He not been equal in honor to the Father, this would not have been giving glory; but since he that honors the Son honors the Father also, the blind is with good reason not rebuked. Now while they expected that the parents would contradict and deny the miracle, the Pharisees said nothing to the man himself, but when they saw that they profited nothing by this, they again return to him, saying, This man is a sinner.

The parents referred the Pharisees to the healed man himself, and so they summon him a second time. They do not openly say now, “Deny that Christ has healed you.” Instead they conceal their objective under the pretense of religion.… They say, “Give God the glory,” that is, confess that this man Jesus has had nothing to do with the work.
