The parents referred the Pharisees to the healed man himself, and so they summon him a second time. They do not openly say now, “Deny that Christ has healed you.” Instead they conceal their objective under the pretense of religion.… They say, “Give God the glory,” that is, confess that this man Jesus has had nothing to do with the work.
