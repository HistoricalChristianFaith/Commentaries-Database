He wants to show that he suffered for a long time and waited to speak and that he contained himself and could burst. Therefore, he needed a large amount of patience. To be able to control one’s words is the greatest proof of wisdom, and [Elihu’s] ardor for God has enabled him to bear such an interior fire. - "Commentary on Job 31.18–19"
