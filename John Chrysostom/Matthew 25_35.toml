And when He had commended them that had done right, He shows how great was originally His bond of love towards them. For, Come, says He, you blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. To how many good things is this same equivalent, to be blessed, and blessed of the Father? And wherefore were they counted worthy of such great honors? What is the cause? I was an hungered, and you gave me meat; I was thirsty, and you gave me drink; and what follows.
