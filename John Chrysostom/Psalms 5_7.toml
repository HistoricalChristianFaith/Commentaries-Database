Since, you see, the church has been gathered together out of such people—pagans, soothsayers, murderers, sorcerers, liars, cheats—it said, “you hate and abhor,” indicating that it was not due to its righteousness and good deeds but to God’s lovingkindness that it had been rescued from them and led into the precincts. So [the church] added, “I, on the contrary, in the abundance of your mercy, shall enter your house.” I mean, in case someone should say, “So how is it that you, who are guilty of this and that, are saved?” it mentioned the manner of salvation: it was due to God’s wonderful lovingkindness, to his ineffable goodness.
