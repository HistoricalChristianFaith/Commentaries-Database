And you yourselves continue to do these things in this spirit. Though you may speak to the contrary, you still do them. You say, “If we had lived in the days of our fathers we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.” Yet your own disposition is evident. Even as you are unfolding your intention, you are already expressing it, however disguised. So Jesus adds, “Thus you witness against yourselves, that you are the sons of those who murdered the prophets.” If you are the son of a murderer but do not partake of the mind of your father, you yourself are not to blame. But if you do so partake, you have an affinity with his wickedness.
