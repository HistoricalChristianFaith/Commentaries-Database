For I seek those tears which are shed not for display but in compunction; those which trickle down secretly and in closets and in sight of no person, softly and noiselessly; those which arise from a certain depth of mind, those shed in anguish and in sorrow, those which are for God alone. Such were Hannah’s, for “her lips moved,” it is said, “but her voice was not heard.” Her tears alone uttered a cry more clear than any trumpet. And because of this, God also opened her womb and made the hard rock a fruitful field.

At home her rival mocked her. She went into the temple, and the priest’s boy abused her and the priest upbraided her. She fled the storm at home, entered port and still ran into turbulence. She went to get a remedy, and not only did not get it but received an additional burden of taunts, and the wound instead was opened up again. You are aware, of course, how distressed souls are susceptible to abuse and insult: just as bad wounds cannot stand the slightest contact with the hand but become worse, so too the soul that is disturbed and upset has problems with everything and is stung by a chance remark. The woman, on the contrary, was not like that, even in this case with the boy abusing her. Had the priest been intoxicated, the insults would not have been so surprising; his high rank and heavy responsibility convinced her against her will to keep her composure. But in fact she was not even upset with the priest’s boy, and hence she won God’s favor even further. Should we too be abused and suffer countless misadventures, let us put up nobly with those who insult us, and we shall thus win greater favor from God.

But observe even after this her deep reverence. “Only her lips moved, but her voice,” it says, “was not heard.” And in this way does the one who would gain his request draw near to God; not consulting his ease, nor gaping, nor lounging, nor scratching his head, nor with utter listlessness. So was not God able to grant, even without any prayer at all? So did he not know the woman’s desire even before she asked? And yet had he granted it before she asked, then the woman’s earnestness would not have been shown, her virtue would not have been made manifest, she would not have gained so great a reward. So that the delay is not the result of envy or of witchcraft but of providential kindness. When therefore you hear the Scripture saying that “the Lord had shut up her womb” and that “her rival deeply provoked her,” consider that it is his intention to prove the woman’s seriousness. For observe that she had a husband devoted to her, for he said, “Am I not better to you than ten sons?” “And her rival,” it says, “deeply provoked her,” that is, reproached her, insulted her. And yet she never once retaliated, nor uttered imprecation against her, nor said, “Avenge me, for my rival reviles me.” The other had children, but this woman had her husband’s love to make amends. With this at least he even consoled her, saying, “Am I not better to you than ten sons?”But let us look again at the deep wisdom of this woman. “And Eli,” it says, “thought she was drunk.” Yet observe what she says to him also, “No, do not count your handmaid for a daughter of Belial, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken up till now.” Here is truly the proof of a contrite heart, when we are not angry with those that revile us, when we are not indignant against them, when we reply only in self-defense. Nothing renders the heart so wise as affliction; nothing is there so sweet as “godly mourning.”
