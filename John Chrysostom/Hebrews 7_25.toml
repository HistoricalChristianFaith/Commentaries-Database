6. [Hebrews 7:25] "Wherefore He is able also to save them to the uttermost, that come unto God by Him, seeing He ever lives to make intercession for them." You see that he says this in respect of that which is according to the flesh. For when He [appears] as Priest, then He also intercedes. Wherefore also when Paul says, "who also makes intercession for us" [Romans 8:34], he hints the same thing; the High Priest makes intercession. For He "that raises the dead as He will, and quickens them," [John 5:21], and that "even as the Father" [does], how [is it that] when there is need to save, He "makes intercession"? [John 5:22] He that has "all judgment," how [is it that] He "makes intercession"? He that "sends His angels" [Matthew 13:41-42], that they may "cast" some into "the furnace," and save others, how [is it that] He "makes intercession"? Wherefore (he says) "He is able also to save." For this cause then He saves, because He dies not. Inasmuch as "He ever lives," He has (he means) no successor: And if He have no successor, He is able to aid all men. For there [under the Law] indeed, the High Priest although he were worthy of admiration during the time in which he was [High Priest] (as Samuel for instance, and any other such), but, after this, no longer; for they were dead. But here it is not so, but "He" saves "to the uttermost."

What is "to the uttermost"? He hints at some mystery. Not here  only (he says) but there  also He saves them that "come unto God by Him." How does He save? "In that He ever lives" (he says) "to make intercession for them." You see the humiliation? You see the manhood? For he says not, that He obtained this, by making intercession once for all, but continually, and whenever it may be needful to intercede for them.

"To the uttermost." What is it? Not for a time only, but there also in the future life. 'Does He then always need to pray? Yet how can [this] be reasonable? Even righteous men have oftentimes accomplished all by one entreaty, and is He always praying? Why then is He throned with [the Father]?' You see that it is a condescension. The meaning is: Be not afraid, nor say, Yea, He loves us indeed, and He has confidence towards the Father, but He cannot live always. For He does live always.

You see that he says this in respect of that which is according to the flesh. For when he appears as priest, then he also intercedes. Wherefore also, when Paul says, “who indeed intercedes for us,” he hints the same thing; the high priest makes intercession. For he that “raises the dead and gives them life” and does so “as the Father,” how is it that, when there is need to save, he “makes intercession”? He that has “all judgment,” how is it that he “makes intercession”? He that “sends his angels” that they may “throw” some into “the furnace” and save others, how is it that he “makes intercession”? Wherefore, he says, “he is able to save.” For this cause then he saves, because he dies not. Inasmuch as “he always lives,” he has, he means, no successor; and if he has no successor, he is able to aid all people. For there under the law indeed, the high priest, although he were worthy of admiration during the time in which he was high priest as Samuel, for instance, and any other such, but, after this, no longer; for they were dead. But here it is not so, but “he” saves “to the uttermost.” What is “to the uttermost”? He hints at some mystery. Not here only, he says, but there also he saves them that “draw near to God through him.” How does he save? “Since he always lives,” he says, “to make intercession for them.” Do you see the humiliation? Do you see the manhood? For he says not that he obtained this by making intercession once for all, but continually and whenever it may be needful to intercede for them. “To the uttermost.” What is it? Not for a time only, but there also in the future life.
