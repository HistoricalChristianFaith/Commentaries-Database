(Hom. Ixxxvi.) Pilate asked Christ that which His enemies were continually casting in His teeth, for because they knew that Pilate cared not for matters of their Law, they had recourse to a public charge.

He acknowledges Himself to be a King, but a heavenly one, as it is more expressly said in another Gospel, My kingdom is not of this world, (John 18:36.) so that neither the Jews nor Pilate were excusable for insisting on this accusation.

He said this out of a wish to release Him, if He should justify Himself in His answer. But the Jews, though they had so many practical proofs of His power, His meekness and humbleness, were yet enraged against Him, and urged on by a perverted judgment. Wherefore He answers nothing, or if He makes any answer He says little, that total silence might not be construed into obstinacy.
