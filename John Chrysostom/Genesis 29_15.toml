Notice, I ask you, how when someone is helped by the hand from on high, everything goes favorably for him. “You shall not serve me for nothing,” Laban says. “Tell me what your wages should be.” In fact, this blessed man was acting out of love and was content simply to receive board and lodging and return him sincere thanks for it. But, since Jacob demonstrated great humility, Laban took the initiative in promising to pay him whatever wage he named.
