Ver. 17. "Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me."

Though deserted by man, God does not permit him to suffer any harm. He strengthened me, he says, that is, He gave me boldness in speaking. He suffered me not to sink.

"That by me the preaching might be fully known."

That is, might be fulfilled. Observe his great humility. He does not say He strengthened me as deserving of His gift, but that "the preaching," with which I was entrusted, "might be fully known." As if any one should wear a purple robe and a diadem, and to that circumstance should owe his safety.

"And that all the Gentiles might hear."

What is this? That the luster of the Gospel, and the care of His Providence for me, might be known to all.

"And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion."

He had fallen into the very jaws of the lion. For he calls Nero a lion from his ferocity and the violent and daring character of his government.
