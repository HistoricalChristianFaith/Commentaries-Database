"And not knowing, for my part, what to make of the enquiry concerning these things" - of course, it went beyond a judge's hearing, the examining into these matters. If thou art at a loss, why dost thou drag him to Jerusalem? But the other would not deign this: no, "To Caesar" says he; as in fact it was touching Caesar that they accused him. Do you hear the appeal? hear the plotting of the Jews? hear their factious spirit? All these things provoked him to a desire of hearing him: and he gives them the gratification and Paul becomes more renowned. For such as I said, are the ill designs of enemies. Had not these things been so, none of these rulers would have deigned to hear him, none would have heard with such quietness and silence. And he seems indeed to be teaching, he seems to be making a defence; but he rather makes a public harangue with much orderliness.
