"For there the ship was to unlade her burden. And finding disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem." They too prophesy of the afflictions. It is so ordered that they should be spoken by them also, that none might imagine that Paul said those things without cause, and only by way of boasting. "We landed at Tyre." Then they tarry with the brethren seven days. Now that they were come near to Jerusalem, they no longer run. "Who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not go up to Jerusalem." Observe how, when the Spirit does not forbid, he complies. "By the Spirit," that is, they knowing "by the Spirit" what would be the consequences, said to him: for of course it does not mean that the exhortation they made was by the Spirit. For they did not simply foretell to him the dangers through the Spirit, but added of themselves that it behooved him not to go up - sparing him.
