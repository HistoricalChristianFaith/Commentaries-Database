What madness! Why don’t you mention his evil deeds instead of concealing them? Why don’t you prove the evil? See how they always avoid direct accusations that would amount to nothing anyway. Annas questioned him about his doctrine, and having heard him, sent him to Caiaphas. After Caiaphas questioned him and discovered nothing, he sent him to Pilate. Pilate asks, “What accusation do you bring against this man?” Here too they have nothing to say but again employ conjectures.
