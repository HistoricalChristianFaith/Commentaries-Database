Wherefore then, when writing to the Ephesians, and having Timothy with him, did he not include him with himself (in his salutation), known as he was to them and admired, for he says, You know the proof of him, that as a child serves the father, so he served with me in the Gospel Philippians 2:22; and again, I have no man like-minded who will care truly for your state Philippians 2:20; but here he does associate him with himself? It seems to me, that he was about to send him immediately, and it was superfluous for him to write, who would overtake the letter. For he says, Him therefore I hope to send immediately. Philippians 2:23 But here it was not so; but he had just returned to him, so that he naturally joined in the letter. For he says, Now when Timothy came from you unto us. 1 Thessalonians 3:6 But why does he place Silvanus before him, though he testifies to his numberless good qualities, and prefers him above all? Perhaps Timothy wished and requested him to do so from his great humility; for when he saw his teacher so humble-minded, as to associate his disciple with himself, he would much the more have desired this, and eagerly sought it. For he says,

Paul, and Silvanus, and Timothy, unto the Church of the Thessalonians. Here he gives himself no title— not an Apostle, not a Servant; I suppose, because the men were newly instructed, and had not yet had any experience of him, he does not apply the title; and it was as yet the beginning of his preaching to them.

To the Church of the Thessalonians, he says. And well. For it is probable there were few, and they not yet formed into a body; on this account he consoles them with the name of the Church. For where much time had passed, and the congregation of the Church was large, he does not apply this term. But because the name of the Church is for the most part a name of multitude, and of a system now compacted, on this account he calls them by that name.

In God the Father, he says, and the Lord Jesus Christ. Unto the Church of the Thessalonians, he says, which is in God. Behold again the expression, in, applied both to the Father and to the Son. For there were many assemblies, both Jewish and Grecian; but he says, to the (Church) that is in God. It is a great dignity, and to which there is nothing equal, that it is in God. God grant therefore that this Church may be so addressed! But I fear that it is far from that appellation. For if any one were the servant of sin, he cannot be said to be in God. If any one walks not according to God, he cannot be said to be in God.

Here Paul gives himself no title. He refers to himself neither as “an apostle” nor as “a servant.” Paul avoids such titles, I suppose, because the Thessalonians were newly instructed and still didn’t know Paul well. His preaching ministry to this church was just beginning.
