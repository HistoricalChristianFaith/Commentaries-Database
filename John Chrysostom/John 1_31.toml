Here he renders his testimony free from suspicion, by showing that it was not from human friendship, but had been caused by divine revelation. I knew Him not, he says. How then couldest thou be a trustworthy witness? How shall you teach others, while you yourself art ignorant? He did not say I know Him not, but, I knew Him not; so that in this way he would be shown most trustworthy; for why should he have shown favor to one of whom he was ignorant?

But that He should be made manifest unto Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water.

He then did not need baptism, nor had that laver any other object than to prepare for all others a way to faith on Christ. For he did not say, that I might cleanse those who are baptized, or, that I might deliver them from their sins, but, that He should be made manifest unto lsrael. And why, tell me, could he not without baptism have preached and brought the multitudes to Him? But in this way it would not have been by any means easy. For they would not so all have run together, if the preaching had been without the baptism; they would not by the comparison have learned His superiority. For the multitude came together not to hear his words, but for what? To be baptized, confessing their sins. But when they came, they were taught the matters concerning Christ, and the difference of His baptism. Yet even this of John was of greater dignity than the Jewish, and therefore all ran to it; yet even so it was imperfect.

How then did you know Him? By the descent of the Spirit, he says. But again, lest any one should suppose that he was in need  of the Spirit as we are, hear how he removes the suspicion, by showing that the descent of the Spirit was only to declare Christ. For having said, And I knew Him not, he adds, But He that sent me to baptize with water the Same said unto me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Ghost. John 1:33

Do you see that this was the work of the Spirit, to point out Christ? The testimony of John was indeed not to be suspected, but wishing to make it yet more credible, he leads it up to God and the Holy Spirit. For when John had testified to a thing so great and wonderful, so fit to astonish all his hearers, that He alone took on Him the sins of all the world, and that the greatness of the gift sufficed for so great a ransom, afterwards he proves this assertion.  And the proof is that He is the Son of God, and that He needed not baptism, and that the object of the descent of the Spirit was only to make Him known. For it was not in the power of John to give the Spirit, as those who were baptized by him show when they say, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. Acts 19:2 In truth, Christ needed not baptism, neither his nor any other;  but rather baptism needed the power of Christ. For that which was wanting was the crowning blessing of all, that he who was baptized should be deemed worthy of the Spirit; this free gift  then of the Spirit He added when He came.
