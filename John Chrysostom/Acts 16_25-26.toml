Mark how Peter slept. Both there, it was wisely ordered that he should be asleep; for the Angel came to him, and it behooved that none should see what happened; and on the other hand it was well ordered here that Paul should be awake, in order that the keeper of the prison might be prevented from killing himself.

What could equal these souls? These men had been scourged, had received many stripes, they had been misused, were in peril of their lives, were thrust into the inner prison, and set fast in the stocks: and for all this they did not suffer themselves to sleep, but kept vigil all the night. And at midnight, it says, and the prisoners listened to them: it was so strange and surprising!

This let us also do, and we shall open for ourselves - not a prison, but - heaven. If we pray, we shall be able even to open heaven. Elias both shut and opened heaven by prayer. There is a prison in heaven also. Whatsoever, He saith, ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven. Let us pray by night, and we shall loose these bonds. For that prayers loose sins, let that widow convince us, let that friend convince us, who at that untimely hour of the night persists and knocks: let Cornelius convince us, for, thy prayers, it says, and thine alms are come up before God.
