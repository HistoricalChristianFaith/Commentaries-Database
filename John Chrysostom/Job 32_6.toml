Why is it not said, But then, why did you not fight from the start together with us in order to defend God? He answers, I withdrew into my age, while I expected, he says, to hear you pronounce a beautiful and wonderful speech. Notice how he did not look for honors, how he conceded them the first rank, how he showed that even now he would not have spoken if they had not compelled him to do so.
