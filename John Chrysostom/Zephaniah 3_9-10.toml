Since this text did not literally refer to wild beasts, let the Jews say when this actually happened. For a wolf has never pastured a lamb. If it were to happen that they would pasture together, how would this benefit the human race? The text referred not to wild beasts but to wild people. It referred to Scythians, to Thracians, to Mauretanians, to Indians, to Sarmatians, to Persians. Another prophet made it clear that all these nations would be brought under one yoke when he said, “And they shall serve him under one yoke, and each one shall adore him from his own place.” No longer, he said, will people worship him in Jerusalem but everywhere throughout the world. No longer are people bidden to go up to Jerusalem, but each one shall remain in his own home and offer this worship.

Another prophet again made clear the way God would be worshiped. “They shall each adore him in his own place and serve him under one yoke.” And again another prophet said, “The virgin of Israel had fallen. Never more shall she rise.” And Daniel explained clearly that everything would be destroyed—the sacrifice, the libation, the anointing, the judgment.
