This hope is honored among themselves also, because of this they pray, because of this they worship, that unto this they may attain: this same do I show forth. Why then, it is acting like madmen, to be doing all things for the sake of attaining to this, and yet to persecute him who believes in the same. I indeed thought with myself, that is, I determined, to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
