It may seem that it is easier to bear honor than dishonor, but honor too has its perils, because the one who enjoys it may be thrown back and break his neck. Paul therefore glories in both circumstances, because he showed brightly in each of them.

"By glory and dishonor, by evil report and good report."

What saying thou? That you enjoy honor, and setting down this as a great thing? 'Yes,' he says. Why, forsooth? For to bear dishonor indeed is a great thing, but to partake of honor requires not a vigorous  soul. Nay, it needs a vigorous and exceeding great soul, that he who enjoys it may not be thrown and break his neck.  Wherefore he glories in this as well as in that, for he shone equally in both. But how is it a weapon of righteousness? Because that the teachers are held in honor induces many unto godliness. And besides, this is a proof of good works, and this glorifies God. And this is, further, an instance of the wise contrivance of God, that by things which are opposite He brings in the Preaching. For consider. Was Paul bound? This too was on behalf of the Gospel. For, says he, "the things which happened unto me have fallen out unto the progress of the Gospel; so that most of the brethren, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word without fear." [Philippians 1:12-14] Again, did he enjoy honor? This too again rendered them more forward. "By evil report and good report." For not only did he bear those things nobly which happen to the body, the 'afflictions,' and whatever he enumerated, but those also which touch the soul; for neither are these wont to disturb slightly. Jeremiah at least having borne many temptations, gave in  upon these, and when he was reproached, said, "I will not prophesy, neither will I name the Name of the Lord." [Jeremiah 20:9] And David too many places complains of reproach. Isaiah also, after many things, exhorts concerning this, saying, "Fear ye not the reproach of men, neither be ye overcome by their reviling." [Isaiah 51:7. Septuagint] And again, Christ also to His disciples; "When they shall speak all manner of evil against you falsely, rejoice and be exceeding glad," [Matthew 5:11-12] He says, "for great is your reward in heaven." Elsewhere too He says, And leap for joy. [Luke 6:23] But He would not have made the reward so great, had not the contest been a great one. For in tortures the body also shares the anguish with the soul; for the pain is both of the body and of the soul; but here it is of the soul alone. Many at any rate have fallen by these alone, and have lost their own souls. And to Job also the reproaches of his friends appeared more grievous than the worms and the sores. For there is nothing, there is nothing more intolerable to those in affliction than a word capable of stinging the soul. Wherefore along with the perils and the toils he names these also, saying, "By glory and dishonor." At any rate, many of the Jews also on account of glory derived from the many would not believe. For they feared, not lest they should be punished, but lest they should be put out of the synagogue. Wherefore He says, "How can you believe which receive glory one of another?" [John 5:44] And we may see numbers who have indeed despised all dangers, but have been worsted by glory.

"As deceivers, and yet true."

This is, "by evil report and good report."
