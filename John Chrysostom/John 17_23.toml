How gave He the glory? By being in them, and having the Father with Him, so as to weld them  together. But in another place He speaks not so; He says not that the Father comes by Him, but, that He and the Father come, and take up their abode with him,  there removing the suspicion of Sabellius, here that of Arius. 

That they may be made perfect in one, and that the world may know that You have sent Me. John 14:23

He says these latter words immediately after the other, to show that peace has more power to attract men than a miracle; for as it is the nature of strife  to separate, so it is that of agreement to weld together.

And I have  loved them as You have loved Me.

Here again the as means, as far as it is possible for a man to be loved; and the sure proof of His love is His giving Himself for them. After having told them that they shall be in safety, that they shall not be overturned, that they shall be holy, that many shall believe through them, that they shall enjoy great glory, that not He alone loved them, but the Father also; He next tells them of what shall be after their sojourning here,  concerning the prizes and crowns laid up for them.
