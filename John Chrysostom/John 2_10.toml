That it was wine then, and the best of wine that had been made, not the servants only, but the bridegroom and the steward of the feast would testify. Those who drew the water would testify that it was made by Christ. Thus, although the miracle was not revealed right at that moment, yet in the end it could not be passed by in silence since so many and such convincing testimonies had been provided by Christ for the future. The servants were witnesses that Jesus had made the water wine. The steward of the feast and the bridegroom [could testify] that the wine that was made was good.
