Thus they had all things and had nothing: for “they said that none of the things which they possessed was their own”; therefore all things were theirs. For he that considers all things to be common will not only use his own but also the things of others as if they belonged to him. But whoever divides things up and sets himself as master over only his own things will not be master even of these. And this is plain from an example. He who possesses nothing at all, neither house nor table nor garment to spare, but for God’s sake is bereft of all, uses the things which are in common as his own; and he shall receive from all whatsoever he may desire, and thus he that has nothing possesses the things of all. But whoever has some things will not be master even of these. For first, no one will give to him who has possessions; and, second, his property shall belong to robbers and thieves and informers and changing events and be anybody’s rather than his.

And not this only, but also because love is increased by the gathering [of ourselves] together; and love being increased, of necessity the things of God must follow also. “And earnest prayer” (it is said) was “made by” the people. “As the manner of some is.” Here he not only exhorted but also blamed [them].“And let us consider one another,” he says, “to provoke to love and to good works.” He knew that this also arises from “gathering together.” For as “iron sharpens iron,” so also association increases love. For if a stone rubbed against a stone sends forth fire, how much more soul mingled with soul! But not to emulation (he says), but “to the sharpening of love.” What is “to the sharpening of love”? To the loving and being loved more. “And of good works,” that so they might acquire zeal. For if doing has greater force for instruction than speaking, you also have in your number many teachers who effect this by their deeds.
