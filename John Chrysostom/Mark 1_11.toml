Forasmuch as He was ordaining a new baptism, He came to the baptism of John, which, in respect of His own baptism, was incomplete, but different from the Jewish baptism, as being between both. He did this that He might show, by the nature of His baptism, that He was not baptized for the remission of sins, nor as wanting the reception of the Holy Spirit: for the baptism of John was destitute of both these. But He was baptized that He might be made known to all, that they might believe on Him and “fulfil all righteousness”, which is “keeping of the commandments:” for it has been commanded to men that they should submit to the Prophet’s baptism.
Or else, that from heaven sanctification might be given to men, and earthly things be joined to heavenly. But the Holy Spirit is said to have descended upon Him, not as if He then first came to Him, for He never had left Him; but that He might show forth the Christ, Who was preached by John, and point Him out to all, as it were by the finger of faith.
