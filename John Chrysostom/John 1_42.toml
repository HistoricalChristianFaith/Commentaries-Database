Why does he change their names? He does this to show that it was he who gave the old covenant, that it was he who altered names, who called Abram “Abraham,” and Sarai “Sarah” and Jacob “Israel.” To many he assigned names even from their birth, as with Isaac and Samson, and to those in Isaiah and Hosea. But to others, he gave them their names after they had been named by their parents, like those we have mentioned, as well as Joshua the son of Nun. It was also a custom of the ancients to give names from things, which in fact Leah did. By doing so, the parents have the appellation to remind them of the goodness of God, that a perpetual memory of the prophecy conveyed by the names may sound in the ears of those who receive it. And so too, he named John early, because those whose virtue was to shine forth from their early youth, from that time received their names, while to those who were to become great at a later period, the title also was given later.But then they each received a different name. Now we all have one name, that which is greater than any. We are called “Christians,” and “sons of God,” and “friends” and [his] “body.”
