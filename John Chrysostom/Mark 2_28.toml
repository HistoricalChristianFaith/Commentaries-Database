Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: The disciples of Christ, freed from the figure, and united to the  truth, do not keep the figurative feast of the sabbath.
see Hom. in Matt., 39: But being hungry, they ate simple food, not for pleasure, but on account of the necessity of nature. The Pharisees however, serving the figure and the shadow, accused the disciples of doing wrong. Wherefore there follows, “But the Pharisees said unto Him, Behold, why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful.”.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: But our Lord brings forward David, to whom it once happened toeat though it was forbidden by the law, when he touched the Priest’s food, that by his example, He might do away with their accusation of the disciples. For there follows, “Have ye never read.”.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: He calls himself properly, Lord of the sabbath, and Son of man, since being the Son of God, He deigned to be called Son of man, for the sake of men. Now the law has no authority over the Lawgiver and Lord, for moreis allowed the king, than is appointed by the law. The law is given to the weak indeed, but not to the perfect and to those who work above what the law enjoins.
