But mark, I pray you, on what ground He magnifies the elements; not from their own nature, but from God's relation to them, such as it had been in condescension declared. For because the tyranny of idolatry was great, that the elements might not be thought worthy of honor for their own sake, He has assigned this cause, which we have mentioned, which again would pass on to the glory of God. For He neither said, because Heaven is beautiful and great, nor, because earth is profitable; but because the one is God's throne, the other His footstool; on every side urging them on towards their Lord.
