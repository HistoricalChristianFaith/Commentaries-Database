"For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God." Now this is again a much greater honor than the first. And this is why he does not say merely, As many as live by the Spirit of God, but, "as many as are led by the Spirit of God," to show that he would have Him use such power over our life as a pilot doth over a ship, or a charioteer over a pair of horses. And it is not the body only, but the soul itself too, that he is for setting under reins of this sort. For he would not have even that independent, but place its authority also under the power of the Spirit. For lest through a confidence in the Gift of the Font they should turn negligent of their conversation after it, he would say, that even supposing you receive baptism, yet if you are not minded to be "led by the Spirit" afterwards, you lose the dignity bestowed upon you, and the pre-eminence of your adoption. This is why he does not say, As many as have received the Spirit, but, "as many as are led by the Spirit," that is, as many as live up to this all their life long, "they are the sons of God."

Then since this dignity was given to the Jews also, for it says, "I said ye are Gods, and all of you children of the Most High"; and again, "I have nourished and brought up children"; and so, "Israel is My first-born"; and Paul too says, "Whose is the adoption" - he next asserts the great difference between the latter and the former honor. For though the names are the same, he means, still, the things are not the same.
