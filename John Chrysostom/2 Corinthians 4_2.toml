Some were “walking in craftiness.” They had a reputation for taking nothing, but in fact they took it and kept it secret. They had the seeming character of saints and apostles but were full of innumerable secret wickednesses. Paul takes nothing and calls the Corinthians as his witnesses. Likewise he does nothing wicked and asks them to testify to the truth of what he is saying.

And that not in this [our] life only, but also in the Preaching itself. For this is, "nor handling the word of God deceitfully."

"But by the manifestation of the truth."

Not by the countenance and the outward show, but by the very proof of our actions.

"Commending ourselves to every man's conscience."

For not to believers only, but also to unbelievers, we are manifest; lying open unto all that they may test our actions, as they may choose; and by this we commend ourselves, not by acting a part and carrying about a specious mask. We say then, that we take nothing, and we call you for witnesses; we say that we are conscious of no wickedness, and of this again we derive the testimony from you, not as they (sc. false Apostles) who, veiling over their things, deceive many. But we both set forth our life before all men; and we lay bare  the Preaching, so that all comprehend it.

Then because the unbelievers knew not its power, he added, this is no fault of ours, but of their own insensibility. Wherefore also he says...
