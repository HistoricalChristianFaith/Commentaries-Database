See how even among the seven one was preeminent, and won the first prize. For though the ordination was common to him and them, yet he drew upon himself greater grace. And observe, how he wrought no signs and wonders before this time, but only when he became publicly known; to show that grace alone is not sufficient, but there must be ordination also; so that there was a further access of the Spirit. For if they were full of the Spirit, it was of that which is from the Laver of Baptism.

Whence, I pray you, did that grace bloom upon the countenance of Stephen? The writer gives him this report above, that he was "full of faith." For it is possible to have a grace that does not consist in works of healing: "For to one is given the grace of the Spirit in such and such wise." But here, it seems to me, it says that he was also gracious to look at. "Full of faith and of power": which is also the character given of Barnabas "he was a good man, full of faith and of the Holy Ghost." Whence we learn that the sincere and innocent are, above all others, the men to be saved, and that these same are also more gracious.
