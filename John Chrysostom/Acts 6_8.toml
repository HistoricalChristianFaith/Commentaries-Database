For it is possible to have a grace that does not consist in works of healing: For to one is given the grace of the Spirit 1 Corinthians 12:8-9 in such and such wise (τοιὣσδε). But here, it seems to me, it says that he was also gracious to look at: They saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

Whence, I pray you, did that grace bloom upon the countenance of Stephen? (Recapitulation.) The writer gives him this report above, that he was full of faith. Acts 6:8. For it is possible to have a grace that does not consist in works of healing: For to one is given the grace of the Spirit 1 Corinthians 12:8-9 in such and such wise (τοιὣσδε). But here, it seems to me, it says that he was also gracious to look at: They saw his face as it had been the face of an angel.

See how even among the seven there was one who was preeminent and who won the first prize. For although the ordination was common to all seven, he drew upon himself greater grace. And notice how he worked no [signs and wonders] before this, but only when he became publicly known. This was to show that the gift of preaching alone is not sufficient and that there is also need of the ordination. Thus was the assistance of the Spirit gained. For if they were full of the Spirit, clearly it came from the bath of baptism.
