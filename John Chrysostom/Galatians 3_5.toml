Ver. 5. "He therefore that supplies to you the Spirit, and works miracles among you, does he it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?"

Have you been vouchsafed, he says, so great a gift, and achieved such wonders, because you observed the Law, or because you adhered to Faith? Plainly on account of Faith. Seeing that they played this argument to and fro, that apart from the Law, Faith had no force, he proves the contrary, viz., that if the Commandments be added, Faith no longer avails; for Faith then has efficacy when things from the Law are not added to it. "You who would be justified by the Law, you are fallen away from grace:" [Galatians 5:4] This he says later, when his language has grown bolder, employing the vantage-ground by that time gained; meanwhile while gaining it, he argues from their past experience. For it was when you obeyed Faith, he says, not the Law, that you received the Spirit and wrought miracles.

And here, as the Law was the subject of discussion, he moots another special point of controversy, and very opportunely and with much cogency introduces a notice of Abraham.

His opponents had turned this about and upside down by saying that faith is of no avail if the law is not added. He shows, on the contrary, that if the lawâ€™s precepts are added, faith will no longer be of any use.
