See how great was the power of the coming of the prophet! He stirred up the people. He called them to consider the meaning of their own sins. It was indeed worthy of wonder to behold his remarkable human form, his great freedom of speech, the strength of his reproof of all as if they were children and the abundant grace beaming out from his countenance. The appearance of a prophet after such a great interval of time increased their amazement. The prophetic gift that had been absent for a long time was now returning. The very tone of his prophetic speech was strange and unusual. For they had heard none of those things of which the prophets were accustomed to speak: of wars and battles and victories below, of famine and pestilence, of the Babylonians and Persians, and the taking of the city, and the other things with which they were familiar; of heaven and its kingdom, of punishment in hell.
