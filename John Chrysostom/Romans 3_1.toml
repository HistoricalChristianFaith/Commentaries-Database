Since he has set all aside, the hearing, the teaching, the name of the Jew, the circumcision, and all the other particulars by his saying that "he is not a Jew which is one outwardly, but he which is one inwardly;" he next sees an objection which starts up, and against this makes his stand. Now what is this objection? If, he means, these things are no use, what reason was there for that nation being called, and the circumcision too being given? What does he then and how does he solve it? By the same means as he did before: for as there, he told, not of their praises, but the benefits of God; nor their well doings (for to be called a Jew and to know His Will and to approve the things which are more excellent, was no well doing of their own, but came of the grace of God: and this the Prophet also says, upbraiding them; "He has not done so to any nation, neither has he showed His judgments unto them;" [Psalm 147:20] and Moses again; "Ask now whether there has been any such thing as this?" he says, "did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, and live?") [Deuteronomy 4:32-33], this then he does here also. For as, when speaking of circumcision, he did not say, Circumcision is valueless without a good life, but, Circumcision is of value with a good life, pointing out the same thing but in a more subdued tone. And again he does not say, If you be a breaker of the Law, thou who art circumcised art no whit profited, but "your circumcision is made uncircumcision:" and after this again, "the uncircumcision," says he, shall "judge," not the circumcision, but "you that dost transgress the Law," so sparing the things of the Law, and smiting the persons. So he does here also. For after setting before himself this objection, and saying, "what advantage then has the Jew?" he says not, None, but he concurs with the statement, and confutes it again by the sequel, and shows that they were even punished owing to this preÃ«minence. And how he does so, I will tell you when I have stated the objection. "What advantage then," he says, "has the Jew," or "what profit is there of circumcision?"

If Paul means that there is no use in being a Jew or in circumcision, why was that nation called, and why was circumcision given? How does Paul solve this problem? By the same means as he did before: he speaks not of their praises but of the benefits of God.
