It is obvious from the very words of Isaiah that he saw God because of God’s condescension. He said, “I saw the Lord sitting on a high and lofty throne.” But God is not sitting down. Beings with bodies sit. Isaiah also said, “on a throne.” But God is not encompassed by a throne, because divinity cannot be contained within boundaries. That said, the seraphim could not endure the condescension of God although they were nearby.… He said, “And the seraphim stood around him,” because he wanted to make it clear that although the seraphim are closer to the essence of God than human beings are, they cannot look upon his essence simply because they are closer to it. He is not referring to place in a localized sense. When he speaks of nearness, he is demonstrating that the seraphim are closer to God than we human beings are.

Why does God appear to be sitting on a throne with seraphim, when God does not sit? He is accommodating himself to the ways of human beings.
