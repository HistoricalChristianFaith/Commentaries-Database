Do you see the equality of honor? For lest on hearing, You have given them Me, you should deem that they were alienated from the authority of the Father, or before this from that of the Son, He removed both difficulties by speaking as He did. It was as though He said, Do not when you hear that 'You have given them to Me,' deem that they are alienated from the Father, for what is Mine is His; nor when you hear, 'Yours they were,' think that they were aliens from Me, for what is His is Mine. So that the, You have given, is said only for condescension; for what the Father has is the Son's, and what the Son has is the Father's. But this cannot even be said of a son after the manner of man, but because They  are upon a greater Equality of honor.  For that what belongs to the less, belongs to the greater also, is clear to every one, but the reverse not so; but here He converts  these terms, and the conversion declares  Equality. And in another place, declaring this, He said, All things that the Father has are Mine, speaking of knowledge. And the hast given Me, and the like expressions, are to show that He did not come as an alien and draw them to Him, but received them as His own. Then He puts the cause and the proof, saying, And I am glorified in them, that is, either that I have power over them, or, that they shall glorify Me, believing in You and Me, and shall glorify Us alike. But if He is not glorified equally in them, what is the Father's is no longer His. For no one is glorified in those over whom he has no authority. Yet how is He glorified equally? All die for Him equally as for the Father; they preach Him as they do the Father; and as they say that all things are done in His Name, so also in the Name of the Son.

“And I am glorified in them,” that is, either that “I have power over them” or that “they shall glorify me, believing in you and me. And they shall glorify us alike.” But if he is not glorified equally in them, what the Father has is no longer his. For no one is glorified in those over whom he has no authority. Yet how is the Son glorified equally? All die for him equally as they do for the Father. They preach him as they do the Father. And as they say that all things are done in his name, so also are they done in the name of the Son.
