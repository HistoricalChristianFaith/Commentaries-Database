“And I am glorified in them,” that is, either that “I have power over them” or that “they shall glorify me, believing in you and me. And they shall glorify us alike.” But if he is not glorified equally in them, what the Father has is no longer his. For no one is glorified in those over whom he has no authority. Yet how is the Son glorified equally? All die for him equally as they do for the Father. They preach him as they do the Father. And as they say that all things are done in his name, so also are they done in the name of the Son.
