"Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, and some worshipped, and some when they saw Him doubted."

This seems to me to be the last appearance in Galilee, when He sent them forth to baptize. And if "some doubted," herein again admire their truthfulness, how they conceal not even their shortcomings up to the last day. Nevertheless, even these are assured by their sight.
