1. A great matter, beloved, a great matter it is to preside over a Church: a matter needing wisdom and courage as great as that of which Christ speaks, that a man should lay down his life for the sheep, and never leave them deserted or naked; that he should stand against the wolf nobly. For in this the shepherd differs from the hireling; the one always looks to his own safety, caring not for the sheep; the other always seeks that of the sheep, neglecting his own. Having therefore mentioned the marks of a shepherd, Christ has put two kinds of spoilers; one, the thief who kills and steals; the other, one who does not these things, but who when they are done does not give heed nor hinder them. By the first, pointing to Theudas and those like him; by the second, exposing the teachers of the Jews, who neither cared for nor thought about the sheep entrusted to them. On which account Ezekiel of old rebuked them, and said, Woe,  ye shepherds of Israel! Do the shepherds feed themselves? Do not the shepherds feed the sheep? Ezekiel 34:2, Septuagint But they did the contrary, which is the worst kind of wickedness, and the cause of all the rest. Wherefore It says, They have not turned back the strayed, nor sought the lost, nor bound up the broken, nor healed the sick, because they fed themselves and not the sheep. Ezekiel 34:4 As Paul also has declared in another passage, saying, For all seek their own, not the things which are Jesus Christ's Philippians 2:21; and again, Let no man seek his own, but every man his neighbor's. 1 Corinthians 10:24  From both Christ distinguishes Himself; from those who came to spoil, by saying, I have come that they might have life, and that they might have more abundantly John 10:10; and from those who cared not for the sheep being carried away by wolves, by never deserting them, but even laying down His life for them, that the sheep might not perish. For when they desired to kill Him, He neither altered His teaching, nor betrayed those who believed on Him, but stood firm, and chose to die. Wherefore He continually said, I am the good Shepherd. Then because His words appeared to be unsupported by testimony, (for though the, I lay down My life, was not long after proved, yet the, that they might have life, and that they might have more abundantly, was to come to pass after their departure hence in the life to come,) what does He? He proves one from the other; by giving His mortal life  (He proves) that He gives life immortal.  As Paul also says, If when we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of His Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved. Romans 5:10 And again in another place, He that spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things? Romans 8:32

But wherefore do they not now bring against Him the charge which they did before, when they said, You bear witness of yourself, your witness is not true? John 8:13 Because He had often stopped their mouths, and because His boldness towards them had been increased by His miracles. Then because He said above And the sheep hear his voice, and follow him, lest any should say, What then is this to those who believe not? hear what He adds, And I know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As Paul declared when he said, God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew Romans 11:2; and Moses, The Lord knew those that were His 2 Timothy 2:19; comp. Numbers 16:5; those, He says, I mean, whom He  foreknew. Then that you may not deem the measure of knowledge to be equal, hear how He sets the matter right by adding, I know My sheep, and am known of Mine. But the knowledge is not equal. Where is it equal? In the case of the Father and Me, for there, As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father. Had He not wished to prove this, why should He have added that expression? Because He often ranked Himself among the many, therefore, lest any one should deem that He knew as a man knows, He added, As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father. I know Him as exactly as He knows Me. Wherefore He said, No man knows the Son  save the Father, nor the Father save the Son Luke 10:22, speaking of a distinct kind of knowledge, and such as no other can possess.

2. I lay down My life. This He says continually, to show that He is no deceiver. So also the Apostle, when he desired to show that he was a genuine teacher, and was arguing against the false apostles, established his authority by his dangers and deaths, saying, In stripes above measure, in deaths oft. 2 Corinthians 11:23 For to say, I am light, and I am life, seemed to the foolish to be a matter of pride; but to say, I am willing to die, admitted not any malice or envy. Wherefore they do not say to Him, You bear witness of yourself, your witness is not true, for the speech manifested very tender care for them, if indeed He was willing to give Himself for those who would have stoned Him. On this account also He seasonably introduces mention of the Gentiles;

Two evil persons have been mentioned, one that kills, and robs the sheep, another that does not hinder: the one standing for those movers of seditions; the other for the rulers of the Jews, who did not take care of the sheep committed to them. Christ distinguishes Himself from both; from the one who came to do hurt by saying, I am come that they might have life; from those who overlook the rapine of the wolves, by saying that He gives His life for the sheep. Wherefore He said again, as He said before, I am the good Shepherd. And as He had said above that the sheep heard the voice of the Shepherd and followed Him, that no one might have occasion to ask, What say you then of those that believe not; He adds, And I know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As Paul too said, God has not cast away His people, whom He foreknew.
Then that you may not attribute to the Shepherd and the sheep the same measure of knowledge, He adds, As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father: i.e. I know Him as certainly as He knows Me. This then is a case of like knowledge, the other is not; as He said, No man knows who the Son is, but the Father.
He gives it too as a proof of His authority. In the same way the Apostle maintains his own commission in opposition to the false Apostles, by enumerating his dangers and sufferings.
What wonder that these should hear My voice, and follow Me, when others are waiting to do the same. Both these flocks are dispersed, and without shepherds; for it follows, And they shall hear My voice. And then He foretells their future union: And there shall be one fold and one Shepherd.
The word must here (I must bring) does not signify necessity, but only that the thing would take place. Therefore does My Father love Me, because I lay down My life, that I might take it again. They had called Him an alien from His Father.
Or He says, in condescension to our weakness, Though there were nothing else which made Me love you, this would, that you are so loved by My Father, that, by dying for you, I shall win His love. Not that He was not loved by the Father before, or that we are the cause of such love. For the same purpose He shows that He does not come toHis Passion unwillingly: No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself:.
As they had often plotted to kill Him, He tells them their efforts will be useless, unless He is willing. I have such power over My own life, that no one can take it from Me, against My will. This is not true of men. We have not the power of laying down our own lives, except we put ourselves to death. Our Lord alone has this power. And this being true, itis true also that He can take it again when He pleases: And I have power to take it again: which words declare beyond a doubt a resurrection. That they might not think His death asign that God had forsaken Him, He adds, This commandment have I received from My Father; i.e. to lay down My life, and take it again. By which we must not understand that He first waited to hear this commandment, and had to learn His work; He only shows s that that work which He voluntarily undertook, was not against the Father’s will.
Because He spoke as one greater than man, they said He had a devil. But that He had not a devil, others proved from His works: Others said, These are not the words of Him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? As if to say, Not even the words themselves are those of one that has a devil; but if the words do not convince you, be persuaded by the works. Our Lord having already given proof who He was by His works, was silent. They were unworthy of an answer. Indeed, as they disagreed amongst themselves, an answer was unnecessary. Their opposition only brought out, for our imitation, our Lord’s gentleness, and longsuffering.
