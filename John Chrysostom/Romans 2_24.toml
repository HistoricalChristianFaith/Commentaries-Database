[Isaiah 52:5; Ezekiel 36:20-23] See again another double accusation. For they not only commit insolence themselves, but even induce others to do so. What then is the use of your teaching when you teach not your own selves? Above, however, he merely said this, but here he has even turned it round to the contrary. For not only yourselves, but even others, do ye not teach what should be done. And what is far worse — ye not only teach not the things of the Law, but you even teach the opposite, viz. to blaspheme God, which is opposite to the Law. But the circumcision, one will say, is a great thing. Yea, I also confess it, but when? When (So all manuscripts S. "then, when") it has the inward circumcision. And observe his judgment, in bringing in what he says about it so opportunely. For he did not begin straightway with it, since the conceit men had of it was great. But after he had shown them to have offended in that which was greater  and to be responsible for the blasphemy against God, then having henceforth possession of the reader's judgment against them, and having stripped them of their pre-eminence, he introduces the discussion about circumcision, feeling sure that no one will any more advocate it, and says [Romans 2:25]

Here Paul makes another double accusation. The Jews not only commit insolence themselves; they even persuade others to do the same. What then is the use of their teaching, if they cannot teach themselves? … But it is much worse than this, for not only do the Jews not teach the law, they actually teach others to blaspheme God, which is the very opposite of the law.
