"Be it known unto you therefore, men and brethren, that through this Man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins: and by Him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses."

Observe how Paul here is more vehement in his discourse: we nowhere find Peter saying this. "Through this man," nay more, by Him, "is remission of sins." And besides, he wished to bring them to a longing desire of this great thing. Well then, His death was not dereliction, but fulfilling of Prophecy. For the rest, he puts them in mind of historical facts, wherein they through ignorance suffered evils without number.

And observe, he does not say, From which ye would not, but, "from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses." "Every one," he says: be who he may. For those ordinances are of no use, unless there be some benefit accruing therefrom. This is why he brings in forgiveness later: and shows it to be greater, when, the thing being otherwise impossible, yet this is effected.
