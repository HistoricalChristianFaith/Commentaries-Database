Not then from the Scriptures did they know this, but the Scribes used to explain themselves, and this saying was reported abroad among the ignorant people; as about Christ also.

Wherefore the Samaritan woman also said, Messiah comes; when He has come, He will tell us all things: John 4:25 and they themselves asked John, Are you Elias, or the Prophet? John 1:21 For the saying, as I said, prevailed, both that concerning the Christ and that concerning Elias, not however rightly interpreted by them.

For the Scriptures speak of two advents of Christ, both this that is past, and that which is to come; and declaring these Paul said, The grace of God, that brings salvation, has appeared, teaching us, that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, and righteously, and godly. Behold the one, hear how he declares the other also; for having said these things, he added, Looking for the blessed hope and appearing of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ. Titus 2:13 And the prophets too mention both; of the one, however, that is, of the second, they say Elias will be the forerunner. For of the first, John was forerunner; whom Christ called also Elias, not because he was Elias, but because he was fulfilling the ministry of that prophet. For as the one shall be forerunner of the second advent, so was the other too of the first. But the Scribes, confusing these things and perverting the people, made mention of that other only to the people, the second advent, and said, If this man is the Christ, Elias ought to have come beforehand. Therefore the disciples too speak as follows, How then say the Scribes, Elias must first come?

Therefore also the Pharisees sent unto John, and asked him, Are you Elias? John 1:21 making no mention anywhere of the former advent.

What then is the solution, which Christ alleged? Elias indeed comes then, before my second advent; and now too is Elias come; so calling John.

In this sense Elias has come: but if you would seek the Tishbite, he is coming. Wherefore also He said, Elias truly comes, and shall restore all things. All what things? Such as the Prophet Malachi spoke of; for I will send you, says He, Elias the Tishbite, who shall restore the heart of father to son, lest I come and utterly smite the earth.

Do you see the accuracy of prophetical language? How, because Christ called John, Elias, by reasoning of their community of office, lest you should suppose this to be the meaning of the prophet too in this place, He added His country also, saying, the Tishbite; whereas John was not a Tishbite. And herewith He sets down another sign also, saying, Lest I come and utterly smite the earth, signifying His second and dreadful advent. For in the first He came not to smite the earth. For, I came not, says He, to judge the world, but to save the world. John 12:47
