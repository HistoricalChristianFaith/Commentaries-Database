2. "Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord." What he also said above, "Not forsaking the assembling of yourselves together" [Hebrews 10:25], he hints at in this place also. For nothing so especially makes persons easily vanquished and subdued in temptations, as isolation. For, tell me, scatter a phalanx in war, and the enemy will need no trouble, but will take them prisoners, coming on them separately, and thereby the more helpless.

"Follow peace with all men, and holiness"   (he says). Therefore with the evil-doers as well? "If it be possible," he says, "as much as lies in you, live peaceably with all men." [Romans 12:18] For your part (he means) "live peaceably," doing no harm to religion: but in whatever you are ill-treated, bear it nobly. For the bearing with evil is a great weapon in trials. Thus Christ also made His disciples strong by saying, "Behold I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves," [Matthew 10:16] What dost Thou say? Are we "among wolves," and dost Thou bid us to be "as sheep," and "as doves"? Yea, He says. For nothing so shames him that is doing us evil, as bearing nobly the things which are brought upon us: and not avenging ourselves either by word or by deed. This both makes us more philosophical ourselves and procures a greater reward, and also benefits them. But has such an one been insolent? Do thou bless [him]. See how much you will gain from this: you have quenched the evil, you have procured to yourself a reward, you have made him ashamed, and you have suffered nothing serious.

3. "Follow peace with all men, and holiness." What does he mean by "holiness" ? Chaste, and orderly living in marriage. If any person is unmarried (he says) let him remain pure, let him marry: or if he be married, let him not commit fornication, but let him live with his own wife: for this also is "holiness." How? Marriage is not "holiness," but marriage preserves the holiness which [proceeds] from Faith, not permitting union with a harlot. For "marriage is honorable" [Hebrews 13:4], not holy. Marriage is pure: it does not however also give holiness, except by forbidding the defilement of that [holiness] which has been given by our Faith.

"Without which" (he says) "no man shall see the Lord." Which he also says in the [Epistle] to the Corinthians. "Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor adulterers, nor idolaters, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind, nor covetous persons, nor thieves, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God." [1 Corinthians 6:9-10] For how shall he who has become the body of a harlot, how shall he be able to be the body of Christ?

Earlier he had spoken of “not neglecting to meet together,” and here he hints at it again. For nothing so especially makes persons easily vanquished and subdued in temptations as isolation. For scatter a phalanx in war, and the enemy will have no trouble but will take them prisoners, coming on them separately and thus the more helpless.

There are many things characteristic of Christianity, but more than all and better than all, love towards one another, and peace. Therefore Christ says, “My peace I give to you,” and again, “By this all men will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.” Therefore Paul too says, “Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness,” that is, purity, “without which no one will see the Lord.”
