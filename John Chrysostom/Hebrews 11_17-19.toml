Great indeed was the faith of Abraham. For while in the case of Abel, and of Noah, and of Enoch, there was an opposition of reasonings only, and it was necessary to go beyond human reasonings; in this case it was necessary not only to go beyond human reasonings, but to manifest also something more. For what was of God seemed to be opposed to what was of God; and faith opposed faith, and command promise.

I mean this: He had said, "Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and I will give thee this land." "He gave him none inheritance in it, no not so much as to set his foot on." Seest thou how what was done was opposed to the promise? Again He said, "In Isaac shall thy seed be called," and he believed: and again He says, Sacrifice to Me this one, who was to fill all the world from his seed. Thou seest the opposition between the commands and the promise? He enjoined things that were in contradiction to the promises, and yet not even so did the righteous man stagger, nor say he had been deceived.

He heard the opposite of the promises from Him who had made them; and yet he was not disturbed, but did them as if they had been in harmony therewith. For they were in harmony; being opposed indeed according to human calculations, but in harmony when viewed by Faith.
