The false apostles obviously had the gift of eloquence which Paul lacked. But that means nothing as far as the substance of the preaching is concerned and may even cast a shadow over the glory of the cross, which is anything but superficially attractive.

"But though I be rude in speech, yet am I not in knowledge."

For since those that corrupted the Corinthians had the advantage in this, that they were not rude; he mentions this also, showing that he was not ashamed of, but even prided himself upon it. And he said not, "But though I be rude in speech," yet so also are they , for this would have seemed to be accusing them as well as himself, and exalting these: but he overthrows the thing itself, the wisdom from without. And indeed in his former Epistle he contends even vehemently about this thing, saying that it not only contributes nothing to the Preaching, but it even throws a shadow on the glory of the Cross; [1 Corinthians 2:1] for he says, I came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom unto you, lest the cross of Christ should be made void; [1 Corinthians 1:17] and many other things of the same kind; because "in knowledge" they were "rude," which is also the extremest form of rudeness. When therefore it was necessary to institute a comparison in those things which were great, he compares himself with the Apostles: but when to show that which appeared to be a deficiency, he no longer does this, but grapples with the thing itself and shows that it was a superiority. And when indeed no necessity urged him, he says that he is "the least of the Apostles," and not worthy even of the title; but here again when occasion called, he says that he is "not a whit behind the very chiefest Apostles." For he knew that this would most advantage the disciples. Wherefore also he adds,

"Nay, in every thing we have made it manifest among all men to youward." For here again he accuses the false Apostles as "walking in craftiness." [2 Corinthians 4:2] And he said this of himself before also, that he did not live after the outward appearance, nor preach handling the word deceitfully [2 Corinthians 4:2] and corrupting it. But those men were one thing and appeared another. But not so he. Wherefore also he every where assumes a high tone, as doing nothing with a view to men's opinion nor concealing anything about himself. As he also said before, "by the manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience," [2 Corinthians 4:2] so now again he says "in every thing we have made it manifest to you." But what does this mean? 'We are rude,' he said, 'and do not conceal it: we receive from some persons and we do not keep it secret. We receive then from you, and we pretend not that we do not receive, as they do when they receive, but we make every thing that we do manifest unto you;' which was the conduct of one that both had exceeding confidence in them, and told them every thing truly. Wherefore he also calls them witnesses, saying now, "among all men to youward," and also before, "For we write none other things unto you, than what you read or even acknowledge." [2 Corinthians 1:13]

Then after he had defended his own conduct he goes on next to say with severity...
