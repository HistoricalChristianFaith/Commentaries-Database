But that they were worthy is manifest, both from what they cried out, and from the fact that, when they had received, they did not hasten away, as many do, being ungrateful after the benefits. Nay, they were not like this, but were both persevering before the gift, and after the gift grateful, for they followed Him.

How much soever you humble yourself, you cannot descend so far as did your Lord.
As the proof of the husbandman’s industry lies in the abundance of his crop, so the fulness of the Church is the evidence of an industrious teacher; so it is here said, “And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed him. "No one was deterred by the toilsomeness of the journey, for spiritual love feels no fatigue; no one was kept away by the thought of sufferings, for they were going into possession of the kingdom of heaven. For he who has in very deed tasted the reality of heavenly good, has nothing to attach him to earth. In good season these blind men come before Christ, that having their eyes opened, they may goup with Him to Jerusalem as witnesses to His power. They heard the sound of the passers by, but saw not their persons, and having nothing free about them but their voice, because they could not follow Him with their feet, they pursued Him with their voice; “When they heard that Jesus passed by, they cried out, saying, Have mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David. ”And the multitude rebuked them that they should hold their peace.”.
For they saw how mean their clothes, and considered not how pure their consciences. See the foolish wisdom of men! They think great men are hurt when they receive the homage of the poor. What poor man dare salute a rich man in public?.
They were rather encouraged than repelled by this rebuke. For so faith is quickened by being prohibited; and hence is secure in dangers, and in securityis endangered; whence it follows, But they cried out the more, saying, “Have mercy upon us, Son of David.” They cried out at the first because they were blind, now they rather cried out because they were forbidden to come to the Light.
Hom., lxvi: Christ suffered them to be forbidden, that their desire might bethe more evidenced. Hence learn that though we be repulsed, yet if we come to God with earnestness, of ourselves, we shall obtain that we ask. It follows, “And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye that I should do unto you?”.
Or; He asks them on account of their faith, that whereas they who were blind confess Christ to be the Son of God, those who had their sight might be put to shame for their esteeming Him only man. They had indeed called Christ, “Lord, "and they had spoken true; but by calling Him the “Son of David,” they obliterated this their good confession. For indeed by a misuse of words men arecalled Lords, but none is truly Lord, but God only. When therefore they say, “OLord, thou Son of David,” they thus misapply the term to Christ, as esteeming Him man; had they only called Him Lord, they would have confessed His Godhead. When then He asks them, “What would ye?” they no longer style Him Son of David, but only Lord; “They say unto Him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.” For the Son of David cannot open the eyes of the blind, but the Son of God can. So longthen as they cried, “O Lord, thou Son of David,” their cure was delayed; assoon as they said, “Lord,” only, healing was shed upon them; for it follows, "And Jesus had compassion upon them, and touched their eyes, and straightway they saw.” He touched them carnally as man, He healed them as God.
But as before this bounty they had been persevering, so after the receiving it they were not ungrateful.
On being healed they rendered a high service to Christ; for it follows, “And they followed him.” For this the Lord requires of thee, according to the Prophet, that “thou be careful to walk with the Lord thy God.” .
Some interpret that the two blind men are the Gentiles; one sprung from Cham, the other from Japhet; they sat by the wayside, that is, they walked hard bythe truth, but they could not find it out; or they were placed in reason, not having yet received knowledge of the Word.
Accordingly Jesus touched the eyes of the Gentile mind, giving them the grace of the Holy Spirit, and when enlightened they followed Him with good works.
