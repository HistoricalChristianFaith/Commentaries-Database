To convince you that these laws contribute not to any virtue but were given to them as a sort of curb, providing them with an occasion of perpetual labor, hear what the prophet says concerning them: “I gave them statutes that were not good.” What does “not good” mean? Statutes that did not contribute greatly toward virtue. Therefore he adds also, “and ordinances whereby they shall not live.”
