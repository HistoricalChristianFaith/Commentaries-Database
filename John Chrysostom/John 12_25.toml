1. Sweet is the present life, and full of much pleasure, yet not to all, but to those who are riveted to it. Since, if any one look to heaven and see the beauteous things there, he will soon despise this life, and make no account of it. Just as the beauty of an object is admired while none more beautiful is seen, but when a better appears, the former is despised. If then we would choose to look to that beauty, and observe the splendor of the kingdom there, we should soon free ourselves from our present chains; for a kind of chain it is, this sympathy with present things. And hear what Christ says to bring us in to this, He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal; if any man serve Me let him follow Me; and, Where I am, there is  My servant also. The words seem like a riddle, yet they are not so, but are full of much wisdom. But how shall he that loves his life, lose it? When he does its unseemly desires, when he gratifies it where he ought not. Wherefore one exhorts us, saying, Walk not in the desires of your soul Sirach 18:30; for so will you destroy it since it leads away from the path leading to virtue; just as, on the contrary, he that hates it in this world, shall save it. But what means, He that hates it? He who yields not to it when it commands what is pernicious. And He said not,  he that yields not to it, but, He that hates it; for as we cannot endure even to hear the voice of those we hate, nor to look upon them with pleasure, so from the soul also we must turn away with vehemence, when it commands things contrary to what is pleasing to God. For since He was now about to say much to them concerning death, His own death, and saw that they were dejected  and desponding, He spoke very strongly, saying, What say I? If you bear not valiantly My death? Nay, if you die not yourselves, you will gain nothing. Observe also how He softens the discourse. It was a very grievous and sad thing to be told, that the man who loves life should die. And why speak I of old times, when even now we shall find many gladly enduring to suffer anything. in order to enjoy the present life, and this too when they are persuaded concerning things to come; who when they behold buildings, and works of art, and contrivances, weep, uttering the reflection, How many things man invents, and yet becomes dust! So great is the longing after this present life. To undo these bonds then, Christ says, He that hates his soul in this world, shall keep it unto life eternal. For that you may know that He spoke as exhorting them, and dissipating their fear, hear what comes next.

If any man serve Me, let him follow Me.

Speaking of death, and requiring the following which is by works. For certainly he that serves must follow him who is served. And observe at what time He said these things to them; not when they were persecuted, but when they were confident; when they thought they were in safety on account of the honor and attention of the many, when they might rouse themselves and hear, Let him take up his cross, and follow Me Matthew 16:24; that is, Be ever,  He says, prepared against dangers, against death, against your departure hence. Then after He had spoken what was hard to bear, He puts also the prize. And of what kind was this? The following Him, and being where He is; showing that Resurrection shall succeed death. For, says He,

Where I am, there is  My servant also.

But where is Christ? In heaven. Let us therefore even before the Resurrection remove there in soul and mind.

If any man serve Me, the Father shall love  him.

Why said He not, I? Because they did not as yet hold a right opinion concerning Him, but held a higher opinion of the Father. For how could they imagine anything great concerning Him, who did not even know that He was to rise again? Wherefore He said to the sons of Zebedee, It is not mine to give, but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared by my Father Mark 10:40, yet He it is that judges. But in this passage He also establishes His genuine sonship.  For as the servants of His own Son, so will the Father receive them.

The present life is sweet and full of much pleasure—not for everyone, although it is for those riveted to it. The moment anyone looks to heaven, however, and sees the beauty that is there, he will soon despise this life as if it counted for nothing. The beauty of an object is admired, in other words, as long as there is nothing more beautiful to be seen. But when something better comes along, the earlier object loses its luster.… The one who loves his life in this world loses it by indulging its inordinate desires.… The one who hates it resists them. Notice, it does not say “who does not yield to” but “who hates.” For as we cannot bear to hear the voice or see the face of those whom we hate, so when the soul invites us to things contrary to God, we should turn it away from them with all our might.
