But in the case of the prophets, all allow that the gift was that of the Holy Spirit. But this [prophetic] grace was limited and departed and failed from off the earth from the day in which it was said, “Your house is left to you desolate.” Even before that day, its dearth had begun, for there was no longer any prophet among them, nor did grace visit their holy things. Since then, the Holy Spirit had been withheld. It was, instead, to be shed forth abundantly for the future. The beginning of this imparting was after the crucifixion, not only as to its abundance but also as to the increased greatness of the gifts. (For the gift was more marvelous … and the people of old possessed the Spirit themselves but did not impart it to others, while the apostles filled tens of thousands with it.) Since then, I say, they were to receive this Gift, but it was not yet given. For this reason he adds, “The Holy Spirit was not yet.” But because then the Lord spoke of this grace, the Evangelist says, “For the Holy Spirit was not yet,” that is, “was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.”
