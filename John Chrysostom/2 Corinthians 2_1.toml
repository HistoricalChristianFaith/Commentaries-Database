"But I determined for myself that I would not come again to you with sorrow."

The expression "again" proves that he had already been made sorry from thence, and whilst he seems to be speaking in his own defence he covertly rebukes them. Now if they had both already made him sorry and were about again to make him sorry, consider how great the displeasure was likely to be. But he saith not thus, "Ye made me sorry," but turns the expression differently yet implying the very same thing thus, "For this cause I came not that I might not make you sorry:" which has the same force as what I said, but is more palatable.
