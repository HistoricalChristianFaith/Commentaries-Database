He said not, Should die, but, Should glorify God, that you may learn, that to suffer for Christ, is glory and honor to the sufferer.

And when He had spoken this, He says,  Follow Me.

Here again He alludes to his tender carefulness, and to his being very closely attached to Himself. And if any should say, How then did James receive the chair at Jerusalem? I would make this reply, that He appointed Peter  teacher, not of the chair, but of the world.

Christ told Peter not that he would die, but that he would “glorify God.” In this way, we learn that suffering for Christ is both an honor and glory for the sufferer. “And when he had spoken this, he said, “Follow Me.” Here again Jesus alludes to his tender carefulness, and to Peter’s being very closely attached to himself. If anyone should ask, “How then did James assume the see at Jerusalem?” I reply that Christ appointed Peter, not as Bishop of this see, but as Doctor of the whole world.
