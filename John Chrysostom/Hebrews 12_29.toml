Whereby we serve God acceptably, that is to say, 'for thus is it possible to serve God acceptably,' by giving him thanks in all things. Do all things (he says) without murmurings and disputings. Philippians 2:14 For whatever work a man does with murmuring, he cuts away and loses his reward; as the Israelitesâ€” how great a penalty they paid for their murmurings. Wherefore he says, Neither murmur ye. 1 Corinthians 10:10 It is not therefore possible to serve Him acceptably without a sense of gratitude to Him for all things, both for our trials, and the alleviations of them. That is, let us utter nothing hasty, nothing disrespectful, but let us humble ourselves that we may be reverential. For this is with reverence and godly fear.
