See how he is continually obviating the suspicion of appearing to praise himself. For nothing is so offensive to the hearers as for any one to say great and marvellous things about himself. Since then he was compelled in what he said to fall upon that subject, he uses a corrective, saying, we do this for your sakes, not for ours, that ye may have somewhat to glory of, not that we may. And not even this absolutely, but because of the false Apostles. Wherefore also he added, "To answer them that glory in appearance, and not in heart." Seest thou how he hath detached them from them, and drawn them to himself; having shown that even the Corinthians themselves are longing to get hold of some occasion, whereby they may have it in their power to speak on their behalf and to defend them unto their accusers. For, says he, we say these things not that we may boast, but that ye may have wherein to speak freely on our behalf; which is the language of one testifying to their great love: and not that ye may boast merely: but that ye may not be drawn aside. But this he does not say explicitly, but manages his words otherwise and in a gentler form, and without dealing them a blow.

But what is "in appearance?" In what is seen, in what is for display. For of such sort were they, doing every thing out of a love of honor, whilst they were both empty inwardly and wore indeed an appearance of piety and of venerable seeming, but of good works were destitute.
