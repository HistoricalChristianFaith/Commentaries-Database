Paul is concerned to avoid giving the impression that he is praising himself. Nothing would be more offensive to his hearers than that. Since he was forced to defend himself, he insists that he is doing it for their sakes, not for his own glory. His main purpose was to stop those who were abusing their position and thereby harming the church.
