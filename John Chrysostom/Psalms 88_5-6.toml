Next, David made it clear that Christ would be buried when he said, “They have put me in the lowest pit in the dark places and in the shadow of death.” Nor was David silent about the spices used on his shroud. Since the women brought myrrh, spice and cassia, hear what the prophet said: “Your robes are all fragrant with myrrh, spice and cassia, and with them the daughters of kings gladdened you in your honor.” See how he also predicted that Christ would rise again. “You will not leave my soul in hell, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption.” Isaiah expressed the same thing in a different way. For he said, “The Lord wishes to cleanse him from his wounds, to show him light, to justify the righteous one who has served many well.”
