Ver. 25. "For he that does wrong," he says, "shall receive again for the wrong that he has done."

Here he confirms his former statements. For that his words may not appear to be those of flattery, "he shall receive," he says, "the wrong he has done," that is, he shall suffer punishment also, "for there is no respect of persons."  For what if you are a servant? It is no shame to you. And truly he might have said this to the masters, as he did in the Epistle to the Ephesians. [Ephesians 6:9] But here he seems to me to be alluding to the Grecian masters. For, what if he is a Greek and thou a Christian? Not the persons but the actions are examined, so that even in this case you ought to serve with good will, and heartily.
