"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him, they took Him down from the tree, and laid Him in a sepulchre. But God raised Him from the dead. And He was seen many days of them which came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are His witnesses unto the people" - that He rose again.

And how so? "By condemning Him, they fulfilled the voices of the prophets." Then again from the Scriptures. And observe also, as one moved by the Spirit Himself, he continually preaches the Passion, the Burial. "Having taken Him down from the tree." Observe, what a great point they make of this. He speaks of the manner of His death. Moreover they bring Pilate conspicuously forward, that the fact of the Passion may be proved by the mention of the tribunal by which he was condemned, but at the same time, for the greater impeachment of those His crucifiers, seeing they delivered Him up to an alien. And he does not say, They made a complaint against Him, but, "They desired, though having found no cause of death in Him, that He should be slain."

"Who appeared," he says, "for many days to them that came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem." Instead of which he says, "Who are His witnesses unto the people," to wit, "The men which came up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem." Then he produces David and Isaiah bearing witness.

"And when they had fulfilled all that was written of Him." Observe what a point he makes of showing that the whole thing was a Divine Dispensation. See, by saying what did they persuade men? By telling them that He was crucified? Why, what could be less persuasive than this? That He was buried - by them to whom it was promised that He should be salvation? that He who was buried forgives sins, yea, more than the Law has power to do?

"Who are His witnesses," he says, "unto the people" - the people that slew Him. Who would never have been so, were they not strengthened by a Divine Power: for they would never have borne such witness to blood-thirsty men, to the very persons that killed Him.
