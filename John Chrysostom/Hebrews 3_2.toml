As also Moses in all His house, that is, either among the people, or in the temple. But here he uses the expression in His house, just as one might say, concerning those in the household; even as some guardian and steward of a household, so was Moses to the people. For that by house he means the people, he added, whose house we are Hebrews 3:6; that is, we are in His creation. Then [comes] the superiority.
