"And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John's baptism. Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people, that they should believe on Him who should come after him, that is, on Christ Jesus." And he did not say, The baptism of John is nothing, but, It is incomplete. Nor does he add this in so many words, but he taught them, and many received the Holy Ghost. From the baptism itself John prophesies: and Paul leads them to see that this is the meaning of John's baptism. "That they should believe on Him that was to come:" on what kind of Person? "I indeed baptize you with water, but He that cometh after me, shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost."
