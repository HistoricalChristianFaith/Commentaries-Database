Do you see that He gives them proof that these things were not said without a meaning? And He used these words, because He knew in Himself that their souls now desired to learn this. For Peter said what he said, not in order to learn, but that he might follow. But when Peter had been rebuked, and Christ had declared  that to be possible which for the time seemed impossible,  and when the apparent impossibility led him to desire to know the matter exactly, therefore He says to the others, And the way ye know. For as when He has said, You shall deny Me, before any one spoke a word, searching into their hearts, He said, Be  not troubled, so here also by saying You know, He disclosed the desire which was in their heart, and Himself gives them an excuse for questioning. Now the, Where are You going? Peter used from a very loving affection, Thomas from cowardice.
