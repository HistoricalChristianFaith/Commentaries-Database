He knew that they had not, but wishes themselves to say it, that having learned what they lack, they may ask. John verily baptized, etc.

And [Paul] does not ask them, “Do you believe in Jesus?” but “Did you receive the Holy Spirit?” For he knew that they had not. And he wished them to acknowledge this, so that they might learn what they lacked and ask for it. “And when Paul had laid his hands upon them,” it says, “the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.” The baptism itself led to their giving prophecies. John’s baptism did not have this effect and was therefore incomplete. Rather, it prepared them beforehand so that they would be deemed worthy of such things. So this was the intent of John’s baptism, that they should believe in the one who was to come after him. Here is shown an important doctrine, that the baptized are completely cleansed of their sins. For if they were not cleansed, they could not have received the Spirit and be immediately deemed worthy of such gifts. And look, the gift was twofold: tongues and the ability to prophesy. Paul spoke well when he said John’s baptism was of repentance and not of forgiveness. He led them forward, persuading them that John’s baptism lacked the latter. For forgiveness was the work of the one who was given afterwards. And how is it that they who received the Spirit did not teach, but Apollos did when he had not yet received the Spirit? Because they were not so fervent or even so instructed. He, on the other hand, was instructed and very fervent. It seems to me that great was the man’s boldness. But even if he taught the things concerning Jesus accurately, [Apollos] still needed more accurate teaching. So, though he did not know everything, by his enthusiasm he drew to himself the Holy Spirit, as did Cornelius and his companions.

Christ, then, did not need baptism—not John’s or any other’s; rather, baptism was needful of the power of Christ. In fact, that which was lacking was the chief of all blessings, namely, for the baptized to be deemed worthy of the Spirit. Therefore, [Paul] added this valuable gift of the Spirit when he came.
