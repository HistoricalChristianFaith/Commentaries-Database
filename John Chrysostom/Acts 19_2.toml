Christ, then, did not need baptism—not John’s or any other’s; rather, baptism was needful of the power of Christ. In fact, that which was lacking was the chief of all blessings, namely, for the baptized to be deemed worthy of the Spirit. Therefore, [Paul] added this valuable gift of the Spirit when he came.

"Have ye received the Holy Ghost since ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there be any Holy Ghost." He does not say to them, Do ye believe in Jesus? but what? "Have ye received the Holy Ghost?" He knew that they had not, but wishes themselves to say it, that having learnt what they lack, they may ask.
