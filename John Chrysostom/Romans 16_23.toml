See what a crown he has framed for him by bearing witness to such great hospitality in him, and brought in the entire Church into this man's house! For by the word ξένον], used here, he means a host, not a . But when you hear that he was Paul's host, do not admire him for his munificence only, but also for his strictness of life. For except he were worthy of Paul's excellency, he would never have lodged there, since he, who took pains to go beyond  many of Christ's commands, would never have trespassed against that law, which bids us be very particular about who receive us, and about lodging with "worthy" persons. [Matthew 10:11] "Erastus, the chamberlain of the city, salutes you, and Quartus a brother." There is a purpose in his adding "the chamberlain of the city," for as he wrote to the Philippians, "They of Cæsar's household salute you" [Philippians 4:22], that he might show that the Gospel had taken a hold upon great folk, so here too he mentions the title with a view to the same object, and to show that, to the man who gives heed, neither riches are a hindrance, nor the cares of government, nor anything else of the kind.

When you hear that Gaius was Paul’s host, admire him not only for his generosity but also for his strictness of life. For if he were not worthy of Paul’s standards, the apostle would never have lodged there.Paul mentions Erastus’s title with the purpose of showing that the gospel had taken hold among the great as well as among the rest of the population.… To a man who hears the Word, riches are not a hindrance, nor the cares of government, nor anything else of that kind.
