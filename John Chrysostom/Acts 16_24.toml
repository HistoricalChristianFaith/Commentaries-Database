Do you see how his power was perfected in weakness? If Paul had been freed and had shaken that building, the event would not have been so wonderful. “Therefore,” he says, “remain in chains! Let the walls be shaken from every side, and let the prisoners be freed!—so that my power may appear all the greater, when through you, the one confined and in fetters, all who are in chains are freed.” This is what amazed the jailer, that Paul, held in such constraints, was able, through prayer alone, to shake the foundations, open the doors of the prison and free all who were in chains.
