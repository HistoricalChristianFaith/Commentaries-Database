When therefore they had heard these things, the Pharisees, it is said, were offended, Matthew 15:12 not the multitudes. For His disciples, so it is said, came and said unto Him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended, when they heard the saying? Yet surely nothing had been said unto them.

The disciples were saying these things not only because they felt pain on behalf of the Pharisees but also because they themselves were a little confused. But since they did not dare to say this out of concern for their own confusion, they hoped to learn further by listening to Jesus’ own elaboration of this issue. To show that this is so, listen to what is said after these things by Peter, who was hotheaded and everywhere arriving before the rest. He says, “Explain this parable to us.” By this he reveals the confusion in his soul. He does not dare to say openly, “I take offense at this,” but he expects that he will be released from his confusion by the interpretation of the parable. So he too was rebuked.
