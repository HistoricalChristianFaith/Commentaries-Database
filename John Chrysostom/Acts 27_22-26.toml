And he foretells two things; both that they must be cast upon an island, and that though the ship would be lost, those who were in it should be saved - which thing he spoke not of conjecture, but of prophecy - and that he "must be brought before Caesar." But this that he says, "God hath given thee all," is not spoken boastfully, but in the wish to win those who were sailing in the ship: for he spoke thus, not that they might feel themselves bound to him, but that they might believe what he was saying. "God hath given thee;" as much as to say, They are worthy indeed of death, since they would not listen to thee: however, this is done out of favor to thee.
