From this time on, bid everything farewell for these five days and begin to observe the feast. Away with the business of the law courts! Away with the business of the city council! Away with daily affairs together with their contracts and business deals! I wish to save my soul. “What does it profit a person if he gains the whole world but suffers the loss of his soul?” The Magi went forth from Persia. You go forth from the affairs of daily life. Make your journey to Jesus. It is not far to travel if we are willing to make the trip. We need not cross the sea or climb the mountain crests. If you prove your piety and full compunction, you can see him without leaving home, you can tear down the whole wall, remove every obstacle and shorten the length of the journey. As the prophet said, “I am a God near at hand and not a God afar off,” and, “The Lord is close to all who call on him in truth.”

If God were distant from us in place, you might well doubt, but he is present everywhere. To him who strives with purposeful intent, God is near. For this reason also the psalmist said, “I will fear no evil, for you are with me,” and God again, “I am a God near at hand and not a God afar off.” Then, just as our sins separate us from him, so do our righteous deeds draw us near to him. “For while you are yet speaking,” it is said, “I will say, ‘Here I am.’ ”
