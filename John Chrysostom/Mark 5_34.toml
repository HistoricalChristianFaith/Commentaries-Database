Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. He has recorded the name on account of the Jews of that time, that it might mark the miracle. It goes on, “And when he saw Him, he fellat His feet, and besought Him greatly "Matthew indeed relates that the chief of the synagogue reported that his daughter was dead, but Mark says that she was very sick, and that afterwards it was told to the ruler of the synagogue, when our Lord was about to go with him, that she was dead. The fact then, which Matthew implies, is the same, namely, that He raised her from the dead; and itis for the sake of brevity, that he says that she was dead, which was evident from her being raised.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now the virtues of Christ are by His own will imparted to those men, who touch Him by faith. Wherefore there follows, “And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that virtue had gone out of Him, turned Him about in the press, and said, Who touched My clothes?” The virtues indeed of the Saviour do not go out of Him locally or corporally, nor in any respect pass away from Him. For being incorporeal, they go forth to others and are given toothers; they are not however separated from Him, from whom they are said to go forth, in the same way as sciences are given by the teacher to his pupils. Therefore it says, “Jesus, knowing in Himself the virtue which had gone out of Him,” to show that with His knowledge, and not without His being aware of it, the woman was healed. But He asked, “Who touched me?” although He knew her who touched Him, that He might bring to light the woman, by her coming forward, and proclaim her faith, and lest the virtue of His miraculous work should be consigned to oblivion. It goes on, “And His disciples said unto Him, Thou seest the multitude thronging thee, and sayest thou, Who touched Me? "But the Lord asked, “Who touched Me,” that is in thought and faith, for the crowds who throng Me cannot be said to touch Me, for they do not come near to Me in thought and in faith. There follows, “And He looked round about to see her that had done this thing.”.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc., see Chrys.,Hom. in Matt., 31: He calls her “daughter” because she was saved by her faith; for faith in Christ makes us His children.
Or else He says, “Go in peace,” sending her away into that which is the final good, for God dwells in peace, that thou mayest know, that she was not only healed in body, but also from the causes of bodily pain, that is, from her sins.
