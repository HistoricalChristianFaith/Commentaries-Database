If therefore you desire spectators of your good deeds, behold you have not merely Angels and Archangels, but the God of the universe.

He calls them hypocrites, because feigning that they are praying to God, they are looking round to men; and, He adds, they love to pray in the synagogues.

It is a good thing to be drawn away from the thought of empty glory, but especially in prayer. For our thoughts are apt to stray of themselves; if then we address ourselves to prayer with this disease upon us, how shall we understand those things that are said by us?

He says, have received, because God was ready to give them that reward which comes from Himself, but they prefer rather that which comes from men. He then goes on to teach how we should pray.

He said not 'shall freely give thee,' but, shall reward thee; thus He constitutes Himself your debtor.
