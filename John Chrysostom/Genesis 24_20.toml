The loving God, you see, granted the patriarch’s prayers, sent his angel on ahead and saw to the outcome of all these events; everything turned out as the servant requested. Then when he saw the power of the patriarch’s prayers in the event and chanced upon the maiden as he desired, he also saw her surpassing hospitality. “She hastened” the text goes on, remember, “to empty the water jar into the trough, and ran to draw more at the well, and watered all the camels.” See her heightened enthusiasm. The verse “She hastened to empty the water jar into the trough and ran to the well” shows the maiden’s indescribable enthusiasm in neither snubbing him as a stranger nor declining his request on the pretext of prudence but rather saying with great restraint, “Drink, sir.” I ask you to consider how very proper, despite her tender years, was her modesty, her surpassing humility and the extremity of her hospitality. What riches, at any rate, do these qualities not far surpass? Are there treasures you would value more highly than these qualities? This is the greatest gift; this constitutes countless blessings, a treasure never expended.
