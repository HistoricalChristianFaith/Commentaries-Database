Prophecy is both free from reproach among the unbelievers and has very great credit and usefulness. For none will say in regard to prophesying, “they are mad,” nor will anyone deride them that prophesy, but, on the contrary, they will be astonished at and admire them.… So also, Nebuchadnezzar worshiped God.… Observe the might of prophecy, how it changed that savage one and allowed him to be instructed and introduced him to faith.

The king here does not say, “What must I do to be saved?” but the teaching is more obvious in his case than any language whatever. He immediately becomes a proclaimer; he does not need to be instructed like the jailor. The king proclaims God and confesses God’s power.… And what then followed? Not one single jailor but many are taught by way of the king’s writings, by way of the mere observance of the facts.… How great the force of praises that are sung in the midst of tribulation.
