This is that: "let your light shine before men" [Matthew 5:16], not that we are to live for vanity, but that we are not to give those who have a mind for it a handle against us. Whence he says also in another place, "Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God." [1 Corinthians 10:32] And in what follows he limits his meaning well, by saying, "If it be possible." For there are cases in which it is not possible, as, for instance, when we have to argue about religion, or to contend for those who are wronged. And why be surprised if this be not universally possible in the case of other persons, when even in the case of man and wife he broke through the rule? "But if the unbelieving depart, let him depart." [1 Corinthians 7:15] And his meaning is nearly as follows: Do your own part, and to none give occasion of war or fighting, neither to Jew nor Gentile. But if you see the cause of religion suffering anywhere, do not prize concord above truth, but make a noble stand even to death. And even then be not at war in soul, be not averse in temper, but fight with the things only. For this is the import of "as much as in you lies, be at peace with all men." But if the other will not be at peace, do not thou fill your soul with tempest, but in mind be friendly (φίλος, several manuscripts φιλόσοφος) as I said before, without giving up the truth on any occasion.
