Paul does not write these things because he is tired or demoralized. How could one chosen by God to bear and do all things for his disciples give up now?… Why does he say this now? To give direction to lazy Christians by helping them see how serious their situation is, to reinforce the teachings he has given and to refuse to let them abandon it.
