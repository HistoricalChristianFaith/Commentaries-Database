As Paul also says, Having put in us the word of reconciliation. 2 Corinthians 5:19 For the same end for which Christ came, for the same did these take possession of the world. In this place again the as is not put to signify resemblance in the case of Himself and the Apostles; for how was it possible for men to be sent otherwise? But it was His custom to speak of the future as having come to pass.

“Make them holy by the gift of the Spirit and right doctrines.” As when he says, “You are clean through the word that I spoke to you,” so now he says the same thing, “Instruct them, teach them the truth.” “And yet he says that the Spirit does this. Why then does he now ask it from the Father?” He asks so that you may again learn their equality of honor. For right doctrines concerning God sanctify the soul. And if he says that they are sanctified by the word, do not be amazed. And to show that he speaks of doctrines, he adds, “Your word is truth,” that is, “there is no falsehood in it, and all that is said in it must happen.” Again, it signifies nothing purely figurative or material. Paul says something similar concerning the church that he has sanctified by the Word. For the Word of God is also used to cleanse. Moreover, “sanctify them” seems to me to signify something else, namely, “set them apart for the Word and for preaching.” And this is made plain from what follows. For, he says, “as you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.”
