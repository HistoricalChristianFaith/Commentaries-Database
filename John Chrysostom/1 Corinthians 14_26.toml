4. "What is it then, brethren? When ye come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done unto edifying."

Do you see the foundation and the rule of Christianity? How, as it is the artificer's work to build, so it is the Christian's to help his neighbors in all things.

But since he had vehemently run down the gift; lest it might seem to be superfluous, for with a view to pull down their pride and no more, he did this:â€” again he reckons it with the other gifts, saying, "has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue." For of old they used also to make psalms by a gift and to teach by a gift. Nevertheless, "let all these look to one thing," says he, the correction of their neighbor: let nothing be done at random. For if you come not to edify your brother, why do you come here at all? In fact, I do not make much account of the difference of the gifts. One thing concerns me, one thing is my desire, to do all things "unto edifying." Thus also he that has the lesser gift will outrun him that has the greater, if this be not wanting. Yea, therefore are the gifts bestowed, that each might be edified; since unless this take place, the gift will rather turn to the condemnation of the receiver. For what, tell me, is the use of prophesying? What is the use of raising the dead, when there is none who profits by it? But if this be the end of the gifts, and if it be possible to effect it in another way without gifts, boast not yourself on the score of the signs, nor do thou bewail yourself to whom the gifts are denied.
