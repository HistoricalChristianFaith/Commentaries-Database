Do you see how great is the virtue of these women, according to his testimony? As great as that which Christ told his apostles … “your names are written in the book of life.” … Did they toil with him? Yes, he says. They contributed in no small part. Even though there were many fellow workers, yet in many affairs they also took a hand. Great therefore was the cohesion of the church at that time when the most respected, whether men or women, enjoyed such honor from the rest. There were many good consequences.
