Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings. In which they found me purified in the temple, not with multitude, neither with tumult. Why then camest thou up? What brought thee hither? To worship, says he; to do alms. This was not the act of a factious person. And for the cause of his going up, I came, he says, to bring alms to my nation and offerings. How then should I have troubled those, for the bringing offerings to whom I had come so long a journey? Neither with multitude, nor with tumult. Everywhere he does away the charge of sedition.
