When, because of hunger, one is constrained to beg and because of his begging he is compelled to act shamefully, and then because of acting shamefully he endures reproachâ€”then the weight of despondency becomes rather complex and is accompanied by a darkness that settles on the soul. The one who takes care of such people should do so in a way that is long-suffering, rather than in a way that will only increase their despondency with further irritations. But he should also mitigate the majority of his already despondent nature with encouragement. For just as the one who has been insulted, even though he may be enjoying great abundance does not feel the advantage of his wealth because of the blow that he has received from the insult, in the same way, one who has been addressed with kind words and for whom the gift has been accompanied with encouragement, exults and rejoices all the more. That which he has been given is doubled in value because of the way in which it was offered.
