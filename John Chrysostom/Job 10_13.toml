Do you see that “the possibility to know God is manifest in creatures,” that our creation was already sufficient to show me the nature of God and his power, without any help from heaven? Indeed the fact that we are so created from a germ, are supported, are not left in perils, is sufficient to show the strength of God and his power, as well as the fact that a sinner is preserved and not punished, whereas a righteous person is punished and chastised.
