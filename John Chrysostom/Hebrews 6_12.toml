That ye may not become dull. Still become; and yet he said above, seeing you have become dull of hearing. Hebrews 5:11 Ob serve however how he limited the dullness to the hearing. And here he hints the very same thing; instead of 'that you may not continue in it,' he says [this]. But again he leads on to that future time for which they were not yet responsible; saying in effect that you may not become too slothful: since for that which is not yet come we could not be responsible. For he who in regard to the present time is exhorted to be in earnest, as being remiss, will perhaps become even more slothful, but he who is exhorted with reference to the future, not so.

We desire (he says) that every one of you. Great is his affection for them: he cares equally for great and small; moreover he knows all, and overlooks no one, but shows the same tender care for each, and equal value for all: from which cause also he the rather persuaded them to receive what was distasteful in his words.

That ye be not slothful, he says. For as inactivity hurts the body, so also inactivity as to what is good renders the soul more supine and feeble.

But followers (he says) of them, who through faith and patience inherit the promises. And who they are, he tells afterwards. He said before, Imitate your own former well-doings. Then, lest they should say, What? He leads them back to the Patriarch: bringing before them examples of well-doing indeed from their own history, but of the thought of being forsaken, from the Patriarch; that they might not suppose that they were disregarded and forsaken as worthy of no account, but might know that it is [the portion] of the very noblest men to make the journey of life through trials; and that God has thus dealt with great and admirable men.

Now we ought (he says) to bear all things with patience: for this also is believing: whereas if He say that He gives and thou immediately receive, how have you also believed? Since in that case this is no longer of your faith, but of Me, the Giver. But if I say that I give, and give after an hundred years, and you have not despaired; then have you accounted Me worthy to be believed, then you have the right opinion concerning Me. You see that oftentimes unbelief arises not from want of hope only, but also from faintheartedness, and want of patience, not from condemning him who made the promise.

For God (he says) is not unrighteous to forget your love and the zeal which you have showed toward His Name, in that you have ministered unto the saints, and do minister. He testifies great things of them, not deeds only; but deeds done with alacrity, which he says also in another place, and not only so, but they gave themselves also to the Lord and to us. 2 Corinthians 8:5

Which (he says) you have showed toward His Name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister. See how again he soothes them, by adding and do minister. Still even at this time (he says) you are ministering, and he raises them up by showing that they had done [what they did] not to them [the saints], but to God. Which you have showed (he says); and he said not unto the saints, but towards God, for this is toward His Name. It is for His Name's sake (he means) that you have done all. He therefore who has the enjoyment from you of so great zeal and love, will never despise you nor forget you.

Hearing these things, let us, I beseech you, minister to the saints. For every believer is a saint in that he is a believer. Though he be a person living in the world, he is a saint. For (he says) the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife by the husband. 1 Corinthians 7:14 See how the faith makes the saintship. If then we see even a secular person in misfortune, let us stretch out a hand [to him]. Let us not be zealous for those only who dwell in the mountains; they are indeed saints both in manner of life and in faith; these others however are saints by their faith, and many of them also in manner of life. Let us not, if we see a monk [cast] into prison, in that case go in; but if it be a secular person, refuse to go in. He also is a saint and a brother.

What then (you say) if he be unclean and polluted? Listen to Christ saying, Judge not that you be not judged. Matthew 7:1 Do thou act for God's sake. Nay, what am I saying? Even if we see a heathen in misfortune, we ought to show kindness to him, and to every man without exception who is in misfortunes, and much more to a believer who is in the world. Listen to Paul, saying, Do good unto all men, but especially to those who are of the household of faith. Galatians 6:10

But I know not whence this [notion] has been introduced, or whence this custom has prevailed. For he that only seeks after the solitaries, and is willing to do good to them alone, and with regard to others on the contrary is over-curious in his enquiries, and says, 'unless he be worthy, unless he be righteous, unless he work miracles, I stretch out no hand'; [such an one] has taken away the greater part of charity, yea and in time he will in turn destroy the very thing itself. And yet that is charity, [which is shown] towards sinners, towards the guilty. For this is charity, not the pitying those who have done well, but those who have done wrong.

And that you may understand this, listen to the Parable: A certain man (it is said) went down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among thieves Luke 10:30, etc.; and when they had beaten him, they left him by the way-side, having badly bruised him. A certain Levite came, and when he saw him, he passed by; A priest came, and when he saw him, he hastened past; a certain Samaritan came, and bestowed great care upon him. For he bound up his wounds Luke 10:34, dropped oil on them, set him upon his ass, brought him to the inn, said to the host, Take care of him Luke 10:35; and (observe his great liberality), and I, he says, will give you whatsoever you shall expend. Who then is his neighbor? He, it is said, that showed mercy on him. Go then also, He says, and do likewise. Luke 10:37 And see what a parable He spoke. He said not that a Jew did [so and so] to a Samaritan, but that a Samaritan showed all that liberality. Having then heard these things, let us not care only for those that are of the household of faith Galatians 6:10, and neglect others. So then also thou, if you see any one in affliction, be not curious to enquire further. His being in affliction involves a just claim on your aid. For if when you see an ass choking you raise him up, and dost not curiously enquire whose he is, much more about a man one ought not to be over-curious in enquiring whose he is. He is God's, be he heathen or be he Jew; since even if he is an unbeliever, still he needs help. For if indeed it had been committed to you to enquire and to judge, you would have well said thus, but, as it is, his misfortune does not suffer you to search out these things. For if even about men in good health it is not right to be over-curious, nor to be a busybody in other men's matters, much less about those that are in affliction.

But on another view what [shall we say]? Did you see him in prosperity, in high esteem, that you should say that he is wicked and worthless? But if you see him in affliction, do not say that he is wicked. For when a man is in high credit, we fairly say these things; but when he is in calamity, and needs help, it is not right to say that he is wicked. For this is cruelty, inhumanity, and arrogance. Tell me what was ever more iniquitous than the Jews. But nevertheless while God punished them, and that justly, yea, very justly, yet He approved of those who had compassion on them, and those who rejoiced over them He punished. Amos 6:6 For they were not grieved, it is said, at the affliction of Joseph.

And again it is said Redeem [Ransom] those who are ready to be slain: spare not. Proverbs 24:11 (He said not, enquire curiously, and learn who he is; and yet, for the most part, they who are led away to execution are wicked,) for this especially is charity. For he that does good to a friend, does it not altogether for God's sake: but he that [does good] to one unknown, this man acts purely for God's sake. Do not spare your money, even if it be necessary to spend all, yet give.

But we, when we see persons in extreme distress, bewailing themselves, suffering things more grievous than ten thousand deaths, and oftentimes unjustly, we [I say] are sparing of our money, and unsparing of our brethren; we are careful of lifeless things, but neglect the living soul. And yet Paul says, in meekness instruct those that oppose themselves, if perhaps God should give them repentance to the acknowledging of the truth, and they may recover themselves out of the snare of the devil who are taken captive by him, at His will. 2 Timothy 2:25-26 If perhaps, he says; you see of how great long-suffering the word is full.

Let us also imitate Him, and despair of no one. For the fishermen too, when they have cast many times [suppose it], have not succeeded; but afterwards having cast again, have gained all. So we also expect that you will all at once show to us ripe fruit. For the husbandman too, after he has sown, waits one day or two days, and is a long while in expectation: and all at once he sees the fruits springing up on every side. This we expect will take place in your case also by the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, with whom to the Father and also to the Holy Ghost be glory, might, honor, now and for ever and world without end. Amen.
