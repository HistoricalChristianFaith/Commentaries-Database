Do you see how with faith she takes on her lips the word of the Lawgiver? “And I realize that your God is up in heaven and down on the earth, and that apart from him there is no God.” Rahab is a prefigurement of the church, which was at one time mixed up in the prostitution of the demons and which now accepts the spies of Christ, not the ones sent by Joshua the son of Nun, but the apostles who were sent by Jesus the true Savior. “I learned,” she says, “that your God is up in heaven and down on the earth, and that apart from him there is no God.” The Jews received these things and did not safeguard them; the church heard these things and preserved them. Therefore, Rahab, the prefigurement of the church, is worthy of all praise.
