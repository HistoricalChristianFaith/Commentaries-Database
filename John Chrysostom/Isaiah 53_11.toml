[David] predicted that Christ would rise again. “You will not leave my soul in hell, nor will you allow your holy one to see corruption.” Isaiah expressed the same thing in a different way. For he said, “The Lord wishes to cleanse him from his wounds, to show him light, to justify the righteous one who served many well.”Isaiah established that the slaying of Christ was a ransom for humanity’s sins when he said, “He has borne the sins of many.” And he will free humankind from demons, for as Isaiah said, “He will divide the spoils of the strong.” And the same prophet spoke out clearly that Christ did this through his death when he said, “Because his soul was delivered up to death.” That Christ would be put in charge over the whole world he revealed by these words of his, “He shall inherit many.”
