In that night He delivered him. And a light shined in the prison, that he might not deem it fancy: and none saw the light, but he only. For if, notwithstanding this was done, he thought it a fancy, because of its unexpectedness; if this had not been, much more would he have thought this: so prepared was he for death. For his having waited there many days and not being saved caused this. Why then, say you, did He not suffer him to fall into the hands of Herod, and then deliver him? Because that would have brought people into astonishment, whereas this was credible: and they would not even have been thought human beings. But in the case of Stephen, what did He not do? Did He not show them his face as it had been the face of an angel? But what in short did He leave undone here also? And the angel said to him, Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals.

The guards were asleep with him, and therefore perceived nothing of what was happening. And a light shined. What was the light for? In order that Peter might see as well as hear, and not imagine it to be all fancy. And the command, Arise quickly, that he may not be remiss. He also smote him; so deeply did he sleep. (a) Rise, says he, quickly: this is not to hurry him (θορυβοὕντος) but to persuade him not to delay. (c) And immediately his chains fell off from his hands. (b) How? Answer me: where are the heretics?— let them answer. And the Angel said unto him, etc.
