Jesus is not talking about literal left and right hands. Rather, he speaks spiritually with intentional exaggeration. “If it is possible,” he says, “for you to remain unaware, let this be your goal. The result, if it be possible, is that your giving be concealed from the very hands that serve.” It is not, as some say, that we should hide it from wrong-headed people, for he has commanded here that it should be concealed from all.
