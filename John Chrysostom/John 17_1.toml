Christ not only speaks about the endurance of evil but puts himself forward as an example. After his admonition that “in the world you will have tribulation,” he himself turns to prayer in order to teach us that in our testing we are to leave everything behind and flee to God. He had shaken their souls in his admonition but raised them up again by this prayer.

Again he shows us that he willingly comes to the cross. For how could someone who prayed that this might happen be unwilling, calling what would happen “glory” not only for himself the crucified but also for the Father? This was indeed the case, since not only the Son but also the Father too was glorified. For before the crucifixion, not even the Jews knew him. “Israel,” it says, “has not known me.” But after the crucifixion, the whole world flocked to him. Then he also speaks of how the glory would take place and how [the Father] will glorify him.
