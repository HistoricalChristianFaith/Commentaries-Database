And He not suddenly, but a long time before. For, Tell, He says, them that are bidden; and again, Call them that were bidden; which circumstance makes the charge against them heavier. And when were they bidden? By all the prophets; by John again; for unto Christ he would pass all on, saying, He must increase, I must decrease; John 3:30 by the Son Himself again, Come unto me, all you that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you; and again, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. John 7:37

But not by words only, but also by actions did He bid them, after His ascension by Peter, and those with him. For He that wrought effectually in Peter, it is said, to the apostleship of the circumcision, was mighty also in me towards the Gentiles.

For since on seeing the Son, they were angry and slew Him, He bids them again by His servants. And unto what does He bid them? Unto labors, and toils, and sweat? Nay but unto pleasure. For, My oxen, He says, and my fatlings are killed. See how complete His banquet, how great His munificence.
