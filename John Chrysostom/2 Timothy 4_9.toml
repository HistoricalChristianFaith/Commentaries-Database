It is worthwhile to raise the question of why Paul calls Timothy to come to him, when it is Paul who has the responsibility of caring for the church, indeed for a whole people. Paul does not do this out of arrogance. Paul was in fact ready to come to Timothy, as he says, “If I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God.” But necessity constrained him. He was no longer the master of his own movements. He was in prison and had been confined by Nero and was all but on the point of death. That he might not die before he saw his disciple, he therefore sends for him, desiring to see him before he dies and perhaps to turn over heavy responsibilities to him.
