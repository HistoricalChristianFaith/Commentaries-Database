It is worth while to enquire why he calls Timothy to him, inasmuch as he was entrusted with a Church, and a whole nation. It was not from arrogance. For Paul was ready to come to him; for we find him saying, But if I tarry long, that you may know how you ought to behave yourself in the house of God. 1 Timothy 3:15 But he was withholden by a strong necessity. He was no longer master of his own movements. He was in prison, and had been confined by Nero, and was all but on the point of death. That this might not happen before he saw his disciple, he therefore sends for him, desiring to see him before he dies, and perhaps to deliver much in charge to him. Wherefore he says, Hasten to come to me before the winter.

It is worthwhile to raise the question of why Paul calls Timothy to come to him, when it is Paul who has the responsibility of caring for the church, indeed for a whole people. Paul does not do this out of arrogance. Paul was in fact ready to come to Timothy, as he says, “If I am delayed, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God.” But necessity constrained him. He was no longer the master of his own movements. He was in prison and had been confined by Nero and was all but on the point of death. That he might not die before he saw his disciple, he therefore sends for him, desiring to see him before he dies and perhaps to turn over heavy responsibilities to him.
