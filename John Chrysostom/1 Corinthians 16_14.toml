If love had been present, the Corinthians would not have been puffed up, they would not have divided into factions, they would not have gone to law before heathens, or indeed at all. If there had been love in the church, that notorious person would not have taken his fatherâ€™s wife, they would not have looked down on their weaker brethren, and they would not have boasted about their spiritual gifts.
