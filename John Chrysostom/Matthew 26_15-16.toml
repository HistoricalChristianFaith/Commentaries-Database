The Romans had set the Jews over the people in order that they should provide for their good order. But by this time the Jews were becoming insurgent. Their government was now undergoing a change according to prophecy. To these priests Judas went “and said, ‘What will you give me if I deliver him to you?’ And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him.” Judas was by now afraid of the multitude and desired to seize him alone. O madness! The covetousness of Judas altogether blinds him! He had often seen Jesus when he went through the midst and did not betray him. Jesus had afforded many demonstrations of his Godhead and power, and no one had laid hold on him. Even at the supper Judas did not cease to talk with him and receive his care. This could have put an end to his evil thought. But all this profited nothing.
