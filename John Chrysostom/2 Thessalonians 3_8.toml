See how in the former Epistle indeed he discourses somewhat more mildly concerning these things; as when he says, We beseech you, brethren,— that you would abound more and more— and that you study 1 Thessalonians 4:1-11— and nowhere does he say, we command, nor in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ, which was fearful and implied danger, but that ye abound, he says, and study, which are the words of one exhorting to virtue; that you may walk honestly (becomingly), he says. 1 Thessalonians 4:12 But here is nothing of this kind, but if any one will not work, says he, neither let him eat. For if Paul, not being under a necessity, and having a right to be idle, and having undertaken so great a work, did nevertheless work, and not merely work, but night and day, so that he was able even to assist others—much more ought others to do this.
