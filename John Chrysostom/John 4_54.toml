1. As in gold mines one skillful in what relates to them would not endure to overlook even the smallest vein as producing much wealth, so in the holy Scriptures it is impossible without loss to pass by one jot or one tittle, we must search into all. For they all are uttered by the Holy Spirit, and nothing useless  is written in them.

Consider, for instance, what the Evangelist in this place says, This is again the second miracle that Jesus did, when He had come out of Jud&aelig;a into Galilee. Even the word second he has added not without cause, but to exalt yet more the praise  of the Samaritans, by showing that even when a second miracle had been wrought, they who beheld it had not yet reached as high as those who had not seen one.

After this there was a feast of the Jews. What feast? Methinks that of Pentecost. And Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Continually at the feasts He frequents the City, partly that He might appear to feast with them, partly that He might attract the multitude that was free from guile; for during these days  especially, the more simply disposed ran together more than at other times.
