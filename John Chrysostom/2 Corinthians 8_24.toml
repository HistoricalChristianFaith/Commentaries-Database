"Wherefore show ye unto them, to the person of the churches, the proof of your love, and of our glorying on your behalf." 'Now show,' he saith, 'how ye love us; and how we do not lightly nor vainly boast in you: and this ye will show, if ye show forth love towards them.' Then he also makes his words more solemn, by saying, "unto the person of the churches." He means, to the glory, the honor, of the churches. 'For if ye honor them, ye have honored the churches that sent them. For the honor passeth not to them alone, but also to those that sent them forth, who ordained them, and more than these, unto the glory of God.' For when we honor those that minister to Him, the kind reception passeth unto Him, unto the common body of the churches. Now this too is no light thing, for great is the potency of that assembly.
