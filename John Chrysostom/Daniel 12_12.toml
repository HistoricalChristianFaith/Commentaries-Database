The conflict lasted a month and a half, and in that time the victory became complete, as did also the deliverance of the Jews from the evils that weighed heavy on them. And when he said, “Blessed is the one who stands firm 1, days,” he revealed their deliverance. He did not simply say, “the one who attains,” but “the one who stands firm and attains.” The reason for this is that many of the unholy ones saw the change, but he does not call them happy; he calls blessed only those who gave witness during the time of troubles, who did not desert their religion and who then found abatement of their ills.
