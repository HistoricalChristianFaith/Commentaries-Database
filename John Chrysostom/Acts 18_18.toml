And Paul after this tarried there yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shorn his head in Cenchrea: for he had a vow.

See how the Law was breaking up; see how they were bound by conscience. This, namely, was a Jewish custom, to shear their heads agreeably with a vow. But then there ought to be also a sacrifice Acts 21:26, which was not the case here. — Having yet tarried: after the beating of Sosthenes. For it was necessary that he should yet tarry, and comfort them concerning these things. He sailed for Syria. Why does he desire again to come to Syria? It was there that the disciples were ordered to be called Christians Acts 11:26: there, that he had been commended to the grace of God Acts 14:26: there, that he had effected such things concerning the doctrine. And with him Priscilla— lo, a woman also — and Aquila. But these he left at Ephesus. With good reason, namely, that they should teach. For having been with him so long time, they were learning many things: and yet he did not at present withdraw them from their custom as Jews. And he came to Ephesus, and left them there: but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews. When they desired him to tarry longer time with them, he consented not; but bade them farewell, saying, I must by all means keep this feast that comes in Jerusalem. Therefore it was that he was hindered from coming into Asia, being impelled to what was of pressing moment. Thus observe him here, entreated (by them) to stay, but because he could not comply, being in haste to depart, he bade them farewell. However, he did not leave them without more ado, but with promise (to return): But I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
