See how the Law was breaking up; see how they were bound by conscience. This, namely, was a Jewish custom, to shear their heads agreeably with a vow. But then there ought to be also a sacrifice, which was not the case here. "Having yet tarried:" after the beating of Sosthenes. For it was necessary that he should yet tarry, and comfort them concerning these things. "He sailed for Syria." Why does he desire again to come to Syria? It was there that "the disciples were ordered to be called Christians": there, that he had been "commended to the grace of God": there, that he had effected such things concerning the doctrine.
