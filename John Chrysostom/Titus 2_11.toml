You hear that the prophets foretold and predicted that men will no longer be bound to come from all over the earth to offer sacrifice in one city or in one place but that each one will sit in his own home and pay service and honor to God. What time other than the present could you mention as fulfilling these prophecies? At any rate listen to how the Gospels and the apostle Paul agree with Zephaniah. The prophet said: “The Lord shall appear”; Paul said: “The grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all people.” Zephaniah said: “To all nations”; Paul said: “To all people.” Zephaniah said: “He will make their gods waste away”; Paul said: “training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions and to live sober, upright and godly lives in this world.”
