God said to him, “Don’t be afraid, Abram.” Notice the extraordinary degree of his care. Why did he say, “Don’t be afraid”? Since Abraham had scorned so much wealth by giving little importance to the offerings of the king, God said to him, Have no fear for despising gifts of such value. Do not be distressed on the score of your diminished prosperity. “Don’t be afraid.” Then to cheer his spirit further, he adds his name to the encouragement by saying, “Don’t be afraid, Abram.” It proves to be no little help in encouraging a person to invoke the name of the person we are addressing. Then he said, “I am your shield.” This phrase is also rich in meaning: I summoned you from the Chaldeans. I led you to this point. I rescued you from the perils of Egypt. I promised once and again to give this land to your descendants. It is I who will be your shield. After daily making you acclaimed by all, I will be your shield—that is, I will struggle in your place. I will be your shield. “Your reward will be exceedingly great.” You refused to accept reward for the troubles you suffered in exposing yourself to such risks. You scorned the king and what he offered you. I will provide you with a reward, not to the degree that you would have received but wonderfully, exceedingly great. “Your reward,” the text says, remember, “will be exceedingly great.”
