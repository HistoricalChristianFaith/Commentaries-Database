God clearly said to him, “Do you think that I have dealt with you in any other way than that you might appear to be righteous?” That was in order, he says, to make you speak as you are speaking now, and not in order to condemn you. This is a justification for all that happened before. Actually he has not been delivered yet from his trial when he speaks so, but he is still in the midst of his torments when he makes his retraction. I attach no importance to myself, he says; I am only going to present the justification of God with regard to what has happened before. I was not even worthy of that. It is when Job has condemned himself that God justifies him. And what does he say? He has said to his friends that they must expiate their guilt and constantly calls Job his servant.
