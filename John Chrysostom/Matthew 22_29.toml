What does Christ say? He replies to both, as taking his stand not against their words but their purpose. On every occasion he revealed the secrets of their hearts, at one time exposing them, at another time leaving the refutation of them that question him to their conscience. See, at any rate here, how he proves both points, as well that there will be a resurrection. And it will not be such a resurrection as they suspect.For what does he say? “You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.” For since they put forward Moses and the law as if they knew them, he shows that this question is that of men ignorant of the Scriptures. They tempted him because they did not know the Scriptures as they should and because they were also ignorant of the power of God.
“For what marvel then is it,” he says, “if you tempt me? I am as yet unknown to you. You do not even know the power of God, although you appear to have had much experience. Yet neither from common sense or from the Scriptures have you become acquainted with it.” Even common sense causes us to know this: that to God all things are possible.
