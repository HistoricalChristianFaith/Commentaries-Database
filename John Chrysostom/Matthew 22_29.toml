For what marvel then is it, He says, if you tempt me, who am as yet unknown to you, when at least ye know not so much as the power of God, of which you have had so much experience, and neither from common sense nor from the Scriptures have become acquainted with it; if indeed even common sense causes us to know this, that to God all things are possible. And in the first place He answers to the question asked. For since this was the cause for their not believing a resurrection, that they think the order of things is like this, He cures the cause, then the symptom also (for thence arose the disease too), and shows the manner of the resurrection. For in the resurrection, says He, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are as angels of God in Heaven. But Luke says, As Sons of God. Luke 20:36

If then they marry not, the question is vain. But not because they do not marry, therefore are they angels, but because they are as angels, therefore they do not marry. By this He removed many other difficulties also, all which things Paul intimated by one word, saying, For the fashion of this world passes away. 1 Corinthians 7:31

What then says Christ? He replies unto both, as taking His stand not against the words, but the purpose, and on every occasion revealing the secrets of their hearts; and at one time exposing them, at another time leaving the refutation of them that question Him to their conscience. See, at any rate here, how He proves both points, as well that there will be a resurrection, as that it will not be such a resurrection as they suspect.

For what says He? You do err, not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God. Matthew 22:29 For since, as if they knew them, they put forward Moses and the law, He shows that this question is that of men very ignorant of the Scriptures. For hence also arose their tempting Him, from their being ignorant of the Scriptures, and from their not knowing the power of God as they ought.

See, at any rate here, how he proves both points, as well that there will be a resurrection. And it will not be such a resurrection as they suspect.For what does he say? “You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God.” For since they put forward Moses and the law as if they knew them, he shows that this question is that of men ignorant of the Scriptures. They tempted him because they did not know the Scriptures as they should and because they were also ignorant of the power of God.
“For what marvel then is it,” he says, “if you tempt me? I am as yet unknown to you. You do not even know the power of God, although you appear to have had much experience. Yet neither from common sense or from the Scriptures have you become acquainted with it.” Even common sense causes us to know this: that to God all things are possible.
