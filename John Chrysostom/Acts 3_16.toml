And yet that it was, “In His name,” they knew not: but they did know that the man was lame, that he stands there whole. They that had wrought the deed themselves confessed, that it was not by their own power, but by that of Christ. And had this assertion been unfounded, had they not been truly persuaded themselves that Christ had risen again, they would not have sought to establish the honor of a dead man instead of their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them.

And yet they did not know it was in his name, but they knew this, that he was lame. Those who had made him stand like a healthy man—they themselves confessed that it was not by their own power but by that of Christ. If this were not so and if they did not truly believe that Christ had risen again, they would not have been willing to establish the honor of a dead man rather than their own, especially while the eyes of the multitude were upon them.
