There is none, there is no remedy better able to destroy sins than to continually recall them and to continually accuse oneself. In this way the publican could cancel his innumerable sins by saying, “God, have mercy on me, a sinner.” And thus also the Pharisee remained unjustified because, taking no care to think of his own sins, he condemned everyone else, saying, “I am not like other people, greedy and avaricious, or even like this publican.” Thus also Paul exhorted, “Let each one examine his own conduct, and then he will find reason to boast only in himself and not in others.” Did you know that even in the Old Testament the righteous accused themselves? Listen to them speak as with one voice. David said, “My iniquities have gone over my head. They oppress me like a heavy burden.” And Isaiah cried out, “Woe is me, wretched man, because I am a man of unclean lips!” The three young men, while they were in the furnace and offered their bodies to death for God, counted themselves among the greatest of sinners, saying, “We have sinned, we have done every kind of evil.” And yet what was more brilliant, more pure than they? And even if they had committed some sins, the nature of the flames would have cancelled all of them. They did not look at their virtues, however, but thought of their sins. - "On the Obscurity of Prophecies 2.9"
