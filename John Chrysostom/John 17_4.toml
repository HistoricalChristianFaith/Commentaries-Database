He says “on the earth,” because in heaven he had been already glorified in respect to his own natural glory and to his being worshiped by the angels. Christ then speaks not of that glory that is bound up with his essence—for he always possesses that glory in its fullness even if no one glorified him—but of that which comes from the worship given him by humankind. And so, “Glorify me” also has this meaning. And listen to what follows so that you may understand that he speaks of this kind of glory: “I have finished the work that you gave me to do.”
