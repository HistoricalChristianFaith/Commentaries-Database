Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (ἐ σκύλη) before this? So right-minded (φιλοσοφοὕντες) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (σκύλλειν) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. Not to delay to come unto them: for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he had come, they led him into the upper chamber.
