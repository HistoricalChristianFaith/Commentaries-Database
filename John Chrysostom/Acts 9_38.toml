Why did they wait until she was dead? Why was Peter not troubled before? They considered it unworthy, true believers as they were, to trouble the disciples about such matters and to take them away from their preaching. Indeed, this is why it mentions that the place was nearby. If what they were asking was of somewhat secondary importance, it was not then by way of going first. For she was a woman disciple.
