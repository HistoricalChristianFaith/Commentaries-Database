Why did they wait till she was dead? Why was not Peter solicited (ἐ σκύλη) before this? So right-minded (φιλοσοφοὕντες) were they, they did not think it proper to trouble (σκύλλειν) the Disciples about such matters, and to take them away from the preaching: as indeed this is why it mentions that the place was near, seeing they asked this as a thing beside his mark, and not now in the regular course. Not to delay to come unto them: for she was a disciple. And Peter arose, and went with them. And when he had come, they led him into the upper chamber.

Why did they wait until she was dead? Why was Peter not troubled before? They considered it unworthy, true believers as they were, to trouble the disciples about such matters and to take them away from their preaching. Indeed, this is why it mentions that the place was nearby. If what they were asking was of somewhat secondary importance, it was not then by way of going first. For she was a woman disciple.
