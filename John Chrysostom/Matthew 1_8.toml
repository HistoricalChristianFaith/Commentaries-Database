What the Holy Spirit testified through the Prophet, saying, that He would cutoff every male from the house of Ahab, and Jezebel, that Jehu the son of Nausifulfilled, and received the promise that his children to the fourth generation should sit on the throne of Israel. As great a blessing then as was given upon the house of Ahab, so great a curse was given on the house of Joram, because of the wicked daughter of Ahab and Jazebel, that his sons to the fourth generation should be cut out of the number of the Kings. Thus his sin descended on his posterity asit had been written, “I will visit the sins of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation.” Thus see how dangerous it isto marry with the seed of the ungodly.
But the order in the Book of Kings is different , thus namely; Josias begot Eliakim, afterwards called Joakim; Joakim begot Jechonias. But Joakim isnot reckoned among the Kings in the genealogy, because God’s people had not set him on the throne, but Pharoah by his might. For if it were just that only for their intermixture with the race of Ahab, three kings should be shut out of the number in the genealogy, was it not just that Joakim should be likewise shutout, whom Pharaoh had set up as king by hostile force? And thus Jechonias, whois the son of Joakim, and the grandson of Josiah, is reckoned among the kings as the son of Josiah, in place of his father who is omitted.
