"And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted," both because they received him back alive, and because a miracle had been wrought. The narrative requires the interpretation that this was a case of restoration to life, not merely of revival from suspended animation. This is established by the fact that Eutychus is said to have been taken up dead. Moreover "he was taken up dead" is opposed to "they brought him alive." He was dead; they brought him alive.
