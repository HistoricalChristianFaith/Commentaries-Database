As those, Job says, who devour themselves have a consolation, as those who bite their flesh feel a certain relief in their sufferings, so it is the same with me, when I express myself in these terms, “And I may put my life in my hands.” Consider, above all, this sentence, “I may put my life in my hand.” This means, I will destroy myself! Like those who destroy themselves, I also find a consolation; and that is my consolation, if God does not cause me to perish, my consolation is to give expression to my thoughts. - "Commentary on Job 13.13–14b"
