While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, “Behold, three men are looking for you. Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them.” And this again is a plea for Peter not to doubt in response to the visitors. He was instructed to doubt nothing. “For I,” he says, “have sent them.” Great is the authority of the Spirit! What God does is what the Spirit is said to do. Not so the angel, but having first said, “Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God,” to show that he is sent from God. Then the angel adds, “And now send men,” etc.; the Spirit, however, says, “For I have sent them.”
