The ship breaks up in the daytime in order that they should see the prophecy in action and not be paralyzed with fear. Do you see that in this as well [the prisoners] were given by grace to Paul? For because of him the centurion did not allow them to be killed. Those men seem to me so patently bad that they would choose to kill them. But some jumped into the sea, and others were borne on planks. All were thus saved, and the prophecy was fulfilled, even though time had not yet endowed it with solemnity.… And through their own deliverance they learned who Paul was.
