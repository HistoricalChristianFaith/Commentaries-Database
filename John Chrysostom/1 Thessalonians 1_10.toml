Here also he introduced an exhortation, which is the part of one who would make his discourse less offensive. And to wait, he says, for His Son from heaven, whom He raised from the dead, even Jesus, which delivers us from the wrath to come. And to wait, he says, for His Son from heaven; Him that was crucified, Him that was buried; to wait for Him from heaven. And how from heaven? Whom He raised from the dead. You see all things at the same time; both the Resurrection, and the Ascension, and the second Coming, the Judgment, the retribution of the just, the punishment of the wicked. Jesus, he says, which delivers us from the wrath to come. This is at once comfort, and exhortation, and encouragement. For if He raised Him from the dead, and He is in heaven, and thence will come, (and you believed in Him; for if you had not believed in Him, you would not have suffered so much), this of itself is sufficient comfort. These shall suffer punishment, which he says in his second epistle, and you will have no small consolation.

And to wait, he says, for His Son from heaven. The terrible things are in hand, but the good things are in the future, when Christ shall come from heaven. See how much hope is required, in that He who was crucified has been raised, that He has been taken up into heaven, that He will come to judge the quick and the dead.
