This is success for a teacher, to educate his disciples by his own accomplishments.… Notice, if you please, the character of the teaching here. He lays down love and bravery. “I kept back nothing,” he says, thereby showing both generosity and resoluteness. “Of what was profitable.” Well said! For there were things that they did not need to learn. For just as it is envy not to say some things, so it is folly to say everything. For this reason he adds, “of what was profitable,” that is, “I not only spoke but also taught.” He means he was not doing this merely for form’s sake. What follows shows that this is what [Paul] means, for he adds, “in public and from house to house.” This shows his long toil, great earnestness and endurance.
