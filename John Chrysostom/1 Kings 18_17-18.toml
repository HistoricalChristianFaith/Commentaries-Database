Were Elijah and John then lacking in boldness? Did not the one reprove Ahab, and the other Herod? The latter said, “It is not lawful for you to have your brother Philip’s wife.” And Elijah said to Ahab with boldness: “It is not I that trouble Israel, but you and your father’s house.” You see that this poverty especially produces boldness? For while the rich person is a slave, being subject and in the power of every one wishing to do him hurt, one who has nothing fears no confiscation or fine. So, if poverty had made people to lack in boldness, Christ would not have sent his disciples with poverty to a work requiring great boldness.
