Again, he fills them with lofty thoughts , that they may not hold themselves indebted to men, I mean to the false Apostles. For the whole is of God Who wills to bestow upon many, so that the grace may appear the greater. For your sakes, therefore, was the resurrection and all the other things. For He did not these things for the sake of one only, but of all.
