When he speaks to us of another commandment, not known to us by the dictate of conscience, he not only prohibits but also adds the reason. When, for instance, he gave the commandment respecting the sabbath, “On the seventh day you shall do no work,” he subjoined also the reason for this cessation. What was this? “Because on the seventh day God rested from all his works which he had begun to make.” And again, “Because you were a servant in the land of Egypt.” For what purpose then, I ask, did he add a reason respecting the sabbath but did no such thing in regard to murder? Because this commandment was not one of the leading ones. It was not one of those which were accurately defined in our conscience but a kind of partial and temporary one. And for this reason it was later experienced.
