The whole is of Him, the giving both of these things and those; for nowhere is any achievement of ours. "From the power of darkness," he says, that is, of error, the dominion of the devil. He said not "darkness," but "power"; for it had great power over us, and held us fast. For it is grievous indeed even to be under the devil at all, but to be so "with power," this is far more grievous. "And translated us," he says, "into the kingdom of the Son of His love." Not then so as to deliver man from darkness only, did He show His love toward him. A great thing indeed is it to have delivered from darkness even; but to have brought into a kingdom too, is a far greater. See then how manifold the gift, that he has delivered us who lay in the pit; in the second place, that He has not only delivered us, but also has translated us into a kingdom. "Who delivered us." He said not, has sent us forth, but "delivered": showing our great misery, and their  capture of us. Then to show also the ease with which the power of God works, he says, "And translated us," just as if one were to lead over a soldier from one position to another. And he said not, "has led over"; nor yet "has transposed," for so the whole would be of him who transposed, nothing of him who went over; but he said, "translated";  so that it is both of us and of Him. "Into the kingdom of the Son of His love." He said not simply, "the kingdom of heaven," but gave a grandeur to his discourse by saying, "The kingdom of the Son," for no praise can be greater than this, as he says elsewhere also: "If we endure, we shall also reign with Him." [2 Timothy 2:12] He has counted us worthy of the same things with the Son; and not only so, but what gives it greater force, with His Beloved Son.  Those that were enemies, those that were in darkness, as it were on a sudden he had translated to where the Son is, to the same honor with Him. Nor was he content with only this, in order to show the greatness of the gift; he was not content with saying, "kingdom," but he also added, "of the Son"; nor yet with this, but he added also "beloved"; nor yet with this, but he added yet, the dignity of His nature. For what says he? "Who is the Image of the invisible God." But he proceeded not to say this immediately, but meanwhile inserted the benefit which He bestowed upon us. For lest, when you hear that the whole is of the Father, you should suppose the Son excluded, he ascribes the whole to the Son, and the whole to the Father. For He indeed translated us, but the Son furnished the cause. For what says he? "Who delivered us out of the power of darkness." But the same is, "In whom we have the full redemption, even the forgiveness of sins." For had we not been forgiven our sins, we should not have been "translated." So here again the words, "In whom." And he said not "redemption," but "full redemption," so that we shall not fall any more, nor become liable to death.

It is a great thing indeed to have been delivered from darkness; but to have been brought into a kingdom too is far greater.
