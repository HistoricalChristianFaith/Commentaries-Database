"If after the manner of men I fought with beasts at Ephesus, what does it profit me?"

What is, "if after the manner of men?" "As far as pertains to men I fought with beasts: for what if God snatched me out of those dangers?  So that I am he who ought most to be in care about these things; I, who endure so great dangers and have not yet received any return. For if no time of recompense is at hand, but our reward is shut up in this present world, ours is the greater loss. For you have believed without jeopardy, but we are slaughtered every day."

But all these things he said, not because he had no advantage even in the very suffering, but on account of the weakness of the many, and to establish them in the doctrine of the resurrection: not because he himself was running for hire; for it was a sufficient recompense to him to do that which was pleasing to God.

[Isaiah 22:13-14, Septuagint] Now if then they were deprived of pardon who spoke thus, much more in the time of Grace.

Paul quotes Isaiah [22:13-14] in order to mock this suggestion. Isaiah after all was speaking about hard and reprobate people who were in the habit of talking like this. If they could find no forgiveness under the law, how much less will they be ready to be pardoned by the gospel of grace!
