2. What so many? So many as the Evangelist has omitted. And this  is clear also from what follows. For when He had retired, and given in, and had come to them again, He speaks with them in a lowly manner, saying, He that believes in Me, believes not on Me, but on Him that sent Me. John 12:44 Observe what He does. He begins with humble and modest expressions, and betakes Himself to the Father; then again He raises His language, and when He sees that they are exasperated, He retires; then He comes to them again, and again begins with words of humility. And where has He done this? Nay, where has He not done it? See, for instance, what He says at the beginning, As I hear, I judge. John 5:30 Then in a loftier tone, As the Father raises up the dead, and quickens them, so also the Son quickens whom He will John 5:21; again, I judge you not, there is another that judges. Then again He retires. Then coming to Galilee, Labor not, He says, for the meat that perishes John 6:27; and after having said great things of Himself, that He came down from Heaven, that He gives eternal life, He again withdraws Himself. And He comes in the Feast of Tabernacles also, and does the same. And one may see Him continually thus varying His teaching, by His presence, by His absence, by lowly, by high discourses. Which He also did here. Though He had done so many miracles, it says, they believed not on Him.
