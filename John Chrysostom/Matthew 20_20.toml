Yet none of these things that he had done caused them to be courageous, even when they were continually hearing about his resurrection. It troubled them deeply to hear not only about his death but about him being mocked and scourged and the like. For when they considered his miracles just done, the possessed persons whom he had delivered, the dead whom he had raised, all the other marvelous works which he was doing, and then heard about his death, they were amazed, if it should be the case that he who did these works would then be destined to suffer. Therefore they fell even deeper into bewilderment. They now believed, now disbelieved, and could not understand his sayings. So far at least were they from understanding clearly what he said that the sons of Zebedee simultaneously came to him and spoke to him of precedence. “Command that these two sons of mine may sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom.”

It seems that both the mother and the two sons of Zebedee together came to him, with the purpose of making their supplication stronger and in this way to prevail with Christ. Mark well how Christ responds to them, and you will see better through their motive, since the request was doubtless their own, but they put forward their mother to make it.
