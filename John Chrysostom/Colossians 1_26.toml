Having said what we have come to, and showed the lovingkindness of God and the honor, by the greatness of the things given, he introduces yet another consideration that heightens them, namely, that neither before us did any one know Him. As he does also in the Epistle to the Ephesians, saying, neither Angels, nor principalities, nor any other created power, but only the Son of God knew. Ephesians 3:5-10 And he said, not simply hid, but quite hid, and that even if it has but now come to pass, yet it is of old, and from the beginning God willed these things, and they were so planned out; but why, he says not yet. From the ages, from the beginning, as one might say. And with reason he calls that a mystery, which none knew, save God. And where hid? In Christ; as he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians Ephesians 3:9, or as when the Prophet says, From everlasting even to everlasting You are. Psalm 90:2 But now has been manifested, he says, to His saints. So that it is altogether of the dispensation of God. But now has been manifested, he says. He says not, has come to pass, but, has been manifested to His saints. So that it is even now still hid, since it has been manifested to His saints alone.

In Christ; as he says in the Epistle to the Ephesians. … But now it has been manifested, he says, “to his saints.” So we know that it is altogether of the dispensation of God. “But now has been manifested,” he says. He does not say “is come to pass” but “has been manifested to his saints.” So that it is even now still hid, since it has been manifested to his saints alone.
