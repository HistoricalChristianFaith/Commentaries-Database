The objectors did not say that the Gentiles must not be received upon believing but that it must be done in accordance with the law. On this subject Peter spoke forcefully. But when this aroused his listeners above all else, on this point too he soothed them. And notice how Peter brought forward what had to be enacted as a rule, that it is not necessary to keep the law. But what was ours and had been received of old, this is what James says, and he dwells on that concerning which nothing is written, so that he might sooth their minds by what is acknowledged and, at an opportune time, introduce this as well. “Therefore my judgment,” he says, “is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,” that is, not upset them. For, if God called them, and these observances upset them, we are fighting against God.
