And he did not say, “if Christ is God,” but his action makes this clear. He pronounces no judgment on whether it is “of men” or “of God” but entrusts the judgment to the future. “They were persuaded.” Then why did you whip them? Such was the incontrovertible justice of his speech that they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they satisfied their own anger, and again they expected to terrify them in this way. Because the apostles were not present at his speech, he gained a greater hearing, and the sweetness of his words and the justice of his speech persuaded them. In fact, this man all but preached the gospel.
