Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them? Such was the incontrovertible justness of his speech, they could not look it in the face; nevertheless, they sated their own animosity; and again they expected to terrify them in this way. By the fact also of his saying these things not in the presence of the Apostles, he gained a hearing more than he would otherwise have done; and then the suavity of his discourse and the justness of what was said, helped to persuade them. In fact, this man all but preached the Gospel. You were persuaded, one may say, that you had not strength to overthrow it. Wherefore did ye not believe? Such is the witness borne even by enemies. There it is four hundred, there, four thousand: and here the first movers were twelve. Let not the number which added itself affright you. ch. 2:41; 4:4 He might also have mentioned another instance, that of the Egyptian, but what he has spoken is fully sufficient. And he closes his speech with an alarming topic: Lest haply, etc. And he does not pronounce upon it, lest he should seem to be pleading their cause; but he reasons by way of syllogism from the issue of the matter. And he does not venture to pronounce that it is not of men, nor yet that it is of God; for had he said that it was of God, they would have gainsaid him: but had he said that it was of men, they would again have taken prompt measures. Therefore he bids them wait for the end, saying, Refrain. But they once more threaten knowing indeed that they avail nothing, but doing after their manner. Such is the nature of wickedness: it attempts even impossibilities.— And after this man rose up Judas, etc. These things Josephus relates in detail. (Ant. xx. 8; ib. v. 2; xviii. 1. B. J. ii. 8. 1.) But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons! And he does not say, But if you do not overthrow it, it is of God; but, If it be of God, it will not be overthrown. And to him they agreed. They reverenced the high character of the man. And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for the name of Christ.

He does not pronounce upon it, either that, it is of men, or that it is of God; but he leaves the proof to the future. They were persuaded [by him]. Acts 5:40 Then why, it may be asked, do ye scourge them?

Nowhere is the like of this recorded of the old saints: for Jeremiah indeed was scourged for the word of God, and they threatened Elijah, and the rest: but in this case, even by this very thing, and not only by their miracles, these showed forth the power of God. He does not say, that they were not pained, but that though pained they rejoiced. How does this appear? From their boldness afterwards: they were so instant still, even after their beatings, in preaching the word.

How were they persuaded? So as not to slay them, but merely to scourge. For, it says, And when they had called the Apostles, and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. See after what great works they are scourged! And again their teaching became more extended: for they taught at home and in the temple.
