Pilate, because of hearing just a few words, wanted to let Jesus go, but they pressed on, saying, “Crucify him.” And why did they push for killing him in this way? It was a shameful death. They were afraid that afterward someone might remember him, and so they wanted to bring him to a punishment that came with a curse. They did not know that truth is exalted by hindrances.

The devil has never been in as shameful a plight as he was that day. For while he expected to have Christ, he lost even those he had, because when that body was nailed to the cross, the dead arose. There death received his wound, being met with a death stroke from a dead body.… For the devil would have done everything to persuade people that Jesus did not die and that instead he [Satan] had the power. For one can see that the time following his resurrection was indeed proof positive [that he had risen from the dead]. But, concerning his death, no other time except when it actually happened could ever furnish proof. Therefore Jesus had to die publicly in the sight of everyone, but [the event] of his resurrection was not public, knowing that the time following it would bear witness to the truth. It is a marvel that, while the world was looking on, the serpent was slain on high on the cross. For look at what the devil did to try to have Christ die in secret. Hear Pilate saying, “Take him away and crucify him, for I find no fault in him,” and withstanding them in a thousand ways. And again the Jews said to him, “If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” Then further, when he had received a mortal wound and did not come down, he was buried. And yet, it was in his power to have risen immediately—but he did not so that the fact [of his death] might be believed. And yet in cases of private death, indeed, it is possible to say they only swooned, but here, it is not possible to say such a thing.

See in how many ways the judge makes his defense, continually acquitting Jesus of the charges.… For “You take him and crucify him” is the expression of one clearing himself of the guilt and thrusting them forward to an action not permitted to them. They had brought Jesus in order to have the matter decided by the governor. But the contrary happened, and Jesus was acquitted rather than condemned by the governor’s decision.
