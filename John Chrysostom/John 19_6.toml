The devil has never been in as shameful a plight as he was that day. For while he expected to have Christ, he lost even those he had, because when that body was nailed to the cross, the dead arose. There death received his wound, being met with a death stroke from a dead body.… For the devil would have done everything to persuade people that Jesus did not die and that instead he [Satan] had the power. For one can see that the time following his resurrection was indeed proof positive [that he had risen from the dead]. But, concerning his death, no other time except when it actually happened could ever furnish proof. Therefore Jesus had to die publicly in the sight of everyone, but [the event] of his resurrection was not public, knowing that the time following it would bear witness to the truth. It is a marvel that, while the world was looking on, the serpent was slain on high on the cross. For look at what the devil did to try to have Christ die in secret. Hear Pilate saying, “Take him away and crucify him, for I find no fault in him,” and withstanding them in a thousand ways. And again the Jews said to him, “If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross.” Then further, when he had received a mortal wound and did not come down, he was buried. And yet, it was in his power to have risen immediately—but he did not so that the fact [of his death] might be believed. And yet in cases of private death, indeed, it is possible to say they only swooned, but here, it is not possible to say such a thing.

But not even so was their rage quenched, but they cried out, "Crucify him, crucify him." Then Pilate, seeing that all was done in vain, said, "Take ye him, and crucify him." Whence it is clear that he had permitted what had been done before, because of their madness. "For I," he saith, "find no fault in him."
