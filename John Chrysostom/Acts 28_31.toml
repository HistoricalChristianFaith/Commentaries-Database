Do you see God’s providence?… “He spoke about the kingdom,” it says. Not about anything tangible, not about the present, but with hopes he feeds them.… “I am in haste to go to Spain, and I hope,” he says, “to see you in my journey.” This is in part directed toward you. Do you see how everything was foreseen by that sacred and divine head, the man who is higher than the heavens, whose soul is able to grasp all things at once, Paul, who holds the first place, whose very name, to those who know, is sufficient to awaken the soul to soberness, to shake off all sleep? Concerning this [Paul] says, “I will come and rest together with you in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel,” and again, “I am going to Jerusalem to minister.” This is also what he says here, “I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings.” He was nearer now to heaven. Rome received him in chains and saw him crowned and proclaimed. “I will rest together with you,” he says. It was the beginning of the course. He added trophies to trophies, invincible as he was. Corinth held him for two years, Asia three, and this city two. Then for a second time he enters this city, when he has reached perfection. Thus he escaped and having filled the whole world brought his life to a close. Why did you want to know what happened after this? There followed such things as before: chains, tortures, battles, imprisonments, treacherous plots, false accusations, deaths day by day. You saw a small part of it. Whatever you saw is what the rest is like.
