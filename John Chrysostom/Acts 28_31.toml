for it is possible to speak with boldness, yet hindered. His boldness nothing checked: but in fact he also spoke unhindered. (c) Discoursed, it says, the things concerning the kingdom of God: mark, nothing of the things of sense, nothing of the things present. (f) But of his affairs after the two years, what say we? (b) (The writer) leaves the hearer thirsty for more: the heathen authors do the same (in their writings), for to know everything makes the reader dull and jaded. Or else he does this, (e) not having it in his power to exhibit it from his own personal knowledge. (a) Mark the order of God's Providence, I have been much hindered from coming unto you...having a great desire these many years to come unto you. Romans 15:22-23 (d) But he fed them with hopes. (g) I am in haste to go to Spain, and I hope, says he, to see you in my journey, and to be brought thitherward on my journey by you, if first I be filled with your company in some measure. Romans 15:24 (i) Of this he says, I will come and rest together with you in the fullness of the blessing of the Gospel Romans 15:29: and again I am going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints Romans 15:25: this is the same that he has said here, To do alms to my nation I came. Acts 24:17 (h) Do you mark how he did not foresee everything— that sacred and divine head, the man higher than the heavens, that had a soul able to grasp all at once, the holder of the first place— Paul? The man whose very name, to them that know him, suffices for rousing of the soul, for vigilance, for shaking off all sleep! Rome received him bound, coming up from the sea, saved from a ship-wreck— and was saved from the shipwreck of error. Like an emperor that has fought a naval battle and overcome, he entered into that most imperial city. (k) He was nearer now to his crown. Rome received him bound, and saw him crowned and proclaimed conqueror. There he had said, I will rest together with you: but this was the beginning of a course once more, and he added trophies to trophies, a man not to be overcome. Corinth kept him two years, and Asia three, and this city two for this time; a second time he again entered it, when also he was consummated. Thus he escaped then, and having filled the whole world, he so brought his life to a close. Why did you wish to learn what happened after these two years? Those too are such as these: bonds, tortures, fightings, imprisonments, lyings in wait, false accusations, deaths, day by day. You have seen but a small part of it? How much soever you have seen, such is he for all the rest. As in the case of the sky, if you see one part of it, go where you will you shall see it such as this: as it is with the sun, though thou see its rays but in part, you may conjecture the rest: so is it with Paul. His Acts you have seen in part; such are they all throughout, teeming with dangers. He was a heaven having in it the Sun of Righteousness, not such a sun (as we see): so that that man was better than the very heaven. Think you that this is a small thing— when you say The Apostle, immediately every one thinks of him (as), when you say The Baptist, immediately they think of John? To what shall one compare his words? To the sea, or even to the ocean? But nothing is equal to them.

More copious than this (sea) are (his) streams; purer and deeper; so that one would not err in calling Paul's heart both a sea and a heaven, the one for purity, the other for depth. He is a sea, having for its voyagers not those who sail from city to city, but those from earth to heaven: if any man sail in this sea, he will have a prosperous voyage. On this sea, not winds, but instead of winds the Holy and Divine Spirit wafts the souls which sail thereon: no waves are here, no rock, no monsters: all is calm. It is a sea which is more calm and secure than a haven, having no bitter brine, but a pure fountain both sweeter than * *, and brighter and more transparent than the sun: a sea it is, not having precious stones, nor purple dye as ours, but treasures far better than those. He who wishes to descend into this sea, needs not various, needs not oil, but much loving-kindness (φιλανθρωπίας): he will find in it all the good things that are in the kingdom of Heaven. He will even be able to become a king, and to take the whole world into his possession, and to be in the greatest honor; he who sails on this sea will never undergo shipwreck, but will know all things well. But as those who are inexpert in this (our visible sea) are suffocated (in attempting to dive therein), so is it in that other sea: which is just the case with the heretics, when they attempt things above their strength. It behooves therefore to know the depth, or else not to venture. If we are to sail on this sea, let us come well-girded. I could not, he says, speak unto you as unto spiritual, but as unto carnal. 1 Corinthians 3:1 Let no one who is without endurance sail on this sea. Let us provide for ourselves ships, that is, zeal, earnestness, prayers, that we may pass over the sea in quiet. For indeed this is the living water. Like as if one should get a mouth of fire, such a mouth does that man get who knows Paul well: like as if one should have a sharp sword, so again does such an one become invincible. And for the understanding of Paul's words there is needed also a pure life. For therefore also he said: You have become such as have need of milk, seeing you are dull of hearing. Hebrews 5:11-12 For there is, there is an infirmity of hearing. For as a stomach which is infirm could not take in wholesome food (which it finds) hard of digestion, so a soul which has become tumid and heated, unstrung and relaxed, could not receive the word of the Spirit. Hear the disciples saying, This is a hard saying: who can hear it John 6:60? But if the soul be strong and healthy, all is most easy, all is light: it becomes more lofty and buoyant: it is more able to soar and lift itself on high. Knowing then these things, let us bring our soul into a healthy state: let us emulate Paul,and imitate that noble, that adamantine soul: that, advancing in the steps of his life, we may be enabled to sail through the sea of this present life, and to come unto the haven wherein are no waves, and attain unto the good things promised to them that love Him, through the grace and mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, with Whom to the Father and Holy Ghost together be glory, might, honor, now and ever, world without end. Amen.

It shows the freedom he had now: without hindrance in Rome, he who had been hindered in Judea; and he remained teaching there for two years. What of the (years) after these?

Do you see God’s providence?… “He spoke about the kingdom,” it says. Not about anything tangible, not about the present, but with hopes he feeds them.… “I am in haste to go to Spain, and I hope,” he says, “to see you in my journey.” This is in part directed toward you. Do you see how everything was foreseen by that sacred and divine head, the man who is higher than the heavens, whose soul is able to grasp all things at once, Paul, who holds the first place, whose very name, to those who know, is sufficient to awaken the soul to soberness, to shake off all sleep? Concerning this [Paul] says, “I will come and rest together with you in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel,” and again, “I am going to Jerusalem to minister.” This is also what he says here, “I came to bring to my nation alms and offerings.” He was nearer now to heaven. Rome received him in chains and saw him crowned and proclaimed. “I will rest together with you,” he says. It was the beginning of the course. He added trophies to trophies, invincible as he was. Corinth held him for two years, Asia three, and this city two. Then for a second time he enters this city, when he has reached perfection. Thus he escaped and having filled the whole world brought his life to a close. Why did you want to know what happened after this? There followed such things as before: chains, tortures, battles, imprisonments, treacherous plots, false accusations, deaths day by day. You saw a small part of it. Whatever you saw is what the rest is like.
