Revived is a word for fruits that have once flourished, then dried up, then flourished again. By this word he shows that they were at first in bloom, then withered and then flourished again, so that revived conveys both reproach and praise. It is no small thing for what is withered to revive.

The Philippians had sent him things over a long period of time, conveying them through Epaphroditus. Now, as he prepares to send Epaphroditus back carrying this letter, see how he praises them. He shows that this is happening not only for the benefit of the one who receives but also for the one who gives. He wants those who do well not to fall into thoughtlessness. He urges them to become more zealous in well-doing, since they are thereby doing good to themselves. Those who are on the receiving end of gifts must not go on receiving thoughtlessly, lest they incur judgment.
