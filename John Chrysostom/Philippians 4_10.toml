Revived is a word for fruits that have once flourished, then dried up, then flourished again. By this word he shows that they were at first in bloom, then withered and then flourished again, so that revived conveys both reproach and praise. It is no small thing for what is withered to revive.

I have ofttimes said, that almsgiving has been introduced not for the sake of the receivers, but of the givers, for the latter are they which make the greatest gain. And this Paul shows here also. In what way? The Philippians had sent him somewhat, after a long time, and had committed the same to Epaphroditus. See then, how when he is about to send Epaphroditus as the bearer of this Epistle, he praises them, and shows that this action was for the need, not of the receiver, but of the givers. This he does, both that they who benefited him may not be lifted up with arrogance, and that they may become more zealous in well-doing, since they rather benefit themselves; and that they who receive may not fearlessly rush forward to receive, lest they meet with condemnation. For it is more blessed, He says, to give than to receive. Acts 20:35 Why then does he say, I rejoice in the Lord greatly? Not with worldly rejoicing, says he, nor with the joy of this life, but in the Lord. Not because I had refreshment, but because ye advanced; for this is my refreshment. Wherefore he also says greatly; since this joy was not corporeal, nor on account of his own refreshment, but because of their advancement.

And see how, when he had gently rebuked them on account of the times that were passed, he quickly throwes a shadow over this, and teaches them constantly and always to remain in well doing. Because at length, says he. The words, at length, show long time to have elapsed. You have revived, as fruits which have shot forth, dried up, and afterwards shot forth. Here he shows, that being at first blooming, then having faded, they again budded forth. So that the word flourished again, has both rebuke and praise. For it is no small thing, that he who has withered should flourish again. He shows also, that it was from indolence all this had happened to them. But here he signifies, that even in former time they were wont to be zealous in these things. Wherefore he adds, your thought for me, wherein ye did indeed take thought. And lest you should think, that in other things too they had been more zealous, and had then withered, but in this thing alone, behold how he has added, your thought for me. I apply the words, now at length, only to this; for in other things it is not so.

Here some one may enquire, how when he had said, It is more blessed to give than to receive Acts 20:25-34; and, These hands ministered to my necessities, and to them that were with me; and again when writing to the Corinthians, For it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void 1 Corinthians 9:15; he suffers his glorying to be made void? And how? By receiving. For if his glorying was, that he received not, how does he now endure so to do? What is it then? Probably, he then did not receive on account of the false Apostles, that wherein they glory 2 Corinthians 11:12, says he, they may be found even as we. And he said not are, but glory; for they received but secretly. Wherefore he said, wherein they glory. Wherefore he also said, No man shall stop me of this glorying. 2 Corinthians 11:10 And he said not simply, shall not stop me, but what? in the regions of Achaia. And again, I robbed other Churches, taking wages of them that I might minister unto you. 2 Corinthians 11:8 Here he showed that he did receive. But Paul indeed received rightly, having so great a work; if in truth he did receive. But they who work not, how can they receive? Yet I pray, says one. But there is no work. For this may be done together with work. But I fast. Neither is this work. For see this blessed one, preaching in many places, and working too. But ye lacked opportunity. What means lacked opportunity? It came not; says he, of indolence, but of necessity. You had it not in your hands, nor were in abundance. This is the meaning of, You lacked opportunity. Thus most men speak, when the things of this life do not flow in to them abundantly, and are in short supply.

The Philippians had sent him things over a long period of time, conveying them through Epaphroditus. Now, as he prepares to send Epaphroditus back carrying this letter, see how he praises them. He shows that this is happening not only for the benefit of the one who receives but also for the one who gives. He wants those who do well not to fall into thoughtlessness. He urges them to become more zealous in well-doing, since they are thereby doing good to themselves. Those who are on the receiving end of gifts must not go on receiving thoughtlessly, lest they incur judgment.
