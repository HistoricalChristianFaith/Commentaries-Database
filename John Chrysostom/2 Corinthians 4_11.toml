"For we which live are also  delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in us in our mortal flesh."

For every where when he has said anything obscure, he interprets himself again. So he has done here also, giving a clear interpretation of this which I have cited. 'For therefore, "we are delivered,"' he says, 'in other words, we bear about His dying that the power of His life may be made manifest, who permits not mortal flesh, though undergoing so great sufferings, to be overcome by the snowstorm of these calamities.' And it may be taken too in another way. How? As he says in another place, "If we die with him, we shall also live with Him." [2 Timothy 2:11] 'For as we endure His dying now, and choose while living to die for His sake: so also will he choose, when we are dead, to beget us then unto life. For if we from life come into death, He also will from death lead us by the hand into life.'
