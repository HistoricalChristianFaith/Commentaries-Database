So then we also are new, or rather we were made new, but now have become old; therefore we are “near to vanishing away,” and to destruction. Let us scrape off this old age. It is indeed no longer possible to do it by washing, but by repentance it is possible here in this life. If there be in us anything old, let us cast it off; if any “wrinkle,” if any stain, if any “spot,” let us wash it away and become fair, that “the king may desire our beauty.”

A covenant might be said to be “new” when it is different and shows some advantage over the old. Surely one might say it is new also when part of it has been taken away and part not. For instance, when an old house is ready to fall down, if a person, leaving the whole, has patched up the foundation, we say he has made it new when he has taken some parts away and brought others into their place. For even the heaven also is thus called “new,” when it is no longer “of brass” but gives rain; and the earth likewise is new when it is not unfruitful, not when it has been changed; and the house is likewise new, when portions of it have been taken away and portions remain.… But, do you see how this interpretation breaks down? I maintain that this covenant must be called “new” in the proper sense of the word. … In calling it new, Paul says, “he treats the first as obsolete, and what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.” … Therefore it is done away with and is perishing and no longer exists.Paul here used a familiar form of speech, as if one should say, the house is not faultless; that is, it has some defect, it is decayed. The garment is not faultless, that is, it is coming to pieces. He does not, therefore, here speak of the old covenant as evil, but only as having some fault and deficiency.

How does it happen that wickedness is transcended in forgetfulness? From the remembrance of good things, from the remembrance of God. If we continually remember God, we cannot remember those things also. For, the psalmist says, “When I remembered you upon my bed, I thought upon you in the morning dawn.” We ought then to have God always in remembrance, but then especially, when thought is undisturbed and when by means of that remembrance one is able to condemn himself, when one can retain things in memory. For in the daytime, indeed, if we do remember, other cares and troubles, entering in, drive the thought out again; but in the night it is possible to remember continually, when the soul is calm and at rest; when it is in the harbor and under a serene sky. “The things which you say in your hearts are grieved for on your beds,” the psalmist says. For it were indeed right to retain this remembrance through the day also. But inasmuch as you are always full of cares and distracted amidst the things of this life, at least then remember God on your bed. At the morning dawn meditate upon God. If at the morning dawn we meditate on these things, we shall go forth to our business with much security. If we have first made God propitious by prayer and supplication, going forth thus we shall have no enemy. Or if you should, you will laugh him to scorn, having God propitious. There is war in the marketplace; the affairs of every day are a fight, they are a tempest and a storm. We therefore need arms, and prayer is a great weapon. We need favorable winds; we need to learn everything, so as to go through the length of the day without shipwrecks and without wounds. For every single day the rocks are many, and oftentimes the boat strikes and is sunk. Therefore have we especially need of prayer early and by night.
