Again he commends them, and prays, showing his concern for them. For when he is about to enter upon reproof, he previously smooths down their minds, by saying, I am confident that you will hear, and by requesting prayers from them, and by again invoking upon them infinite blessings.

But the Lord, he says, direct your hearts into the love of God. For there are many things that turn us aside from love, and there are many paths that draw us away from thence. In the first place the path of Mammon, laying, as it were, certain shameless hands upon our soul, and tenaciously holding it in its grasp, draws and drags us thence even against our will. Then vainglory and often afflictions and temptations, turn us aside. For this reason we need, as a certain wind, the assistance of God, that our sail may be impelled, as by some strong wind, to the love of God. For tell me not, I love Him, even more than myself. These are words. Show it to me by your works, if you love Him more than yourself. Love Him more than money, and then I shall believe that you love Him even more than yourself. But you who despisest not riches for the sake of God, how will you despise yourself? But why do I say riches? Thou who despisest not covetousness, which you ought to do even without the commandments of God, how will you despise yourself?

And into the patience of Christ, he says. What is into the patience? That we should endure even as He endured, or that we should do those things, or that with patience also we should wait for Him, that is, that we should be prepared. For since He has promised many things, and Himself is coming to judge the quick and the dead, let us wait for Him, and let us be patient. But wherever he speaks of patience, he of course implies affliction. For this is to love God; to endure, and not to be troubled.
