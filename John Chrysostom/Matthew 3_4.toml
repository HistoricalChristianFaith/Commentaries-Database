It was fitting that the forerunner of the One who was to put away all the ancient ills, the labor, the curse, the sorrow and the sweat display symbols of the situation prior to the fall of Adam. This is why he neither tilled the land nor ploughed furrows nor ate bread by the sweat of his brow. Rather, his table was hastily supplied, and his clothing more easily furnished than his table, and his lodging even less troublesome than his clothing. For he needed neither roof, nor bed, nor table nor any other earthly comfort. He lived a kind of angel’s life in this our flesh. For this reason John’s clothing was of hair, that by his very dress he might instruct persons to separate themselves from all things human, to have nothing in common with the earth but to hasten back to their undefiled nobility, the condition in which Adam lived before he required garments or robe. Thus John’s clothing itself was symbolic of nothing less than the coming kingdom and of repentance.
