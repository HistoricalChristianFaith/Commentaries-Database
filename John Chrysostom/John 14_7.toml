He does not contradict himself. They knew him indeed, but not as they should have. God they knew, but they did not yet know the Father. For afterward, when the Spirit came upon them, he formed in them all knowledge. It is as if he had said, “If you had known my essence and my dignity, you would have known that of the Father also. And from this time onward you shall know him, and you have seen him.” The [knowing] belongs to the future; the [seeing] belongs to the present. Both are brought about “by me.” By “sight,” he means knowledge by intellectual perception. For those who are seen we may see but not know. Those, however, who are known we cannot both know and not know.… These words are used so that you may learn that the one who has seen him knows him who begat him. But they beheld him not in his unveiled essence but clothed with flesh.
