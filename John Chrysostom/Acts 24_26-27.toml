"Go thy way," he says, "for this time: when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee." Observe his hardness of heart: hearing such things, "he hoped that he should receive money from him!" And not only so, but even after conversing with him - for it was towards the end of his government - he left him bound, "willing to show the Jews a pleasure": so that he not only coveted money, but also glory. How, O wretch, canst thou look for money from a man who preaches the contrary? But that he did not get it, is evident from his leaving him bound; he would have loosed him, had he received it. "Of temperance," it says, he reasoned; but the other was hankering to receive money from him who discoursed these things! And to ask indeed he did not dare: for such is wickedness: but he hoped it. "And when two years were completed," etc., so that it was but natural that he showed them a pleasure, as he had been so long governor there.
