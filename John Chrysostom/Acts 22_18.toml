Look how [Paul] thrusts himself into danger. Even after that vision, I came, he says, “to Jerusalem.” This is again without witnesses. But look, the result provides the witness. He said, “They will not accept your testimony.” They did not accept it. And yet, he says, if one had to make a reasonable guess, one would have guessed that they would certainly accept it. For I was the man who made war upon the Christians, and for this reason they ought to have accepted it. Here [Paul] constructs two arguments: one, they cannot defend their actions, for they persecute him against all likelihood and contrary to reason; and two, Christ was God, who gave prophecies contrary to expectation, not looking to things past but knowing beforehand things to come.
