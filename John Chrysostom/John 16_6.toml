Great is the tyranny of despondency. We need great courage in order to stand strong against it and, after gathering from it what is useful, to let go of what is superfluous. And so, it has a purpose at times. When we ourselves or others sin, that is a good time to grieve. But when we fall into human difficulties, then despondency is useless. And now when it has overthrown the disciples, who were not yet perfect, see how Christ raises them again by his rebuke. They who before this had asked him ten thousand questions …—these men, I say, now hearing, “they will put you out of the synagogues” and “will hate you” and “whoever kills you will think that he does God’s service”—were so cast down as to be struck dumb, so that they say nothing to him. And so he reproaches them and says, “These things I did not say to you at the beginning, because I was with you. But now I go to him that sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’ But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart.” Immoderate sorrow is a horrible thing, dreadful and even deadly, as Paul said, “Lest perhaps such a one should be swallowed up by too much sorrow.”
