Ver. 14. "But without your mind," he says, "would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be, as it were, of necessity, but willingly."

This particularly flatters the person asked, when the thing being profitable in itself, it is brought out with his concurrence. For two good effects are produced thence, the one person gains, and the other is rendered more secure. And he has not said, That it should not be of necessity, but "as it were of necessity." For I knew, he says, that not having learned  it, but coming to know it at once, you would not have been angry, but nevertheless out of an excess of consideration, that it should "not be as it were of necessity."

This is a strategy that is particularly flattering to the person asked. The idea is that since the act proposed is a thing profitable in itself, it is brought forward in such a way as to win Philemonâ€™s concurrence. For two good effects are thus produced: the intercessor gains his point, and the other person is rendered more secure.
