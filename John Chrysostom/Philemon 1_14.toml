Ver. 14. "But without your mind," he says, "would I do nothing; that your benefit should not be, as it were, of necessity, but willingly."

This particularly flatters the person asked, when the thing being profitable in itself, it is brought out with his concurrence. For two good effects are produced thence, the one person gains, and the other is rendered more secure. And he has not said, That it should not be of necessity, but "as it were of necessity." For I knew, he says, that not having learned  it, but coming to know it at once, you would not have been angry, but nevertheless out of an excess of consideration, that it should "not be as it were of necessity."
