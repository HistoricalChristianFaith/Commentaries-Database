"What is it therefore? the multitude must needs come together: for they will hear that thou art come. Do therefore this that we say to thee:" they say these things as advising, not as commanding. "We have four men which have a vow on them; them take, and purify thyself with them, and be at charges with them." Make thy defence in act, not in word - "that they may shave themselves," it says, "and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but that thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law:" they say not, "teachest," but, of superabundance, "that thou thyself also keepest the law." For of course not this was the matter of chief interest, whether he did not teach others, but, that he did himself observe the law.
