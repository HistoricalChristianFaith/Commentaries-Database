Ver. 12. "When I shall send Artemas unto you, or Tychicus; be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis." What do you say? After having appointed him to preside over Crete, do you again summon him to yourself? It was not to withdraw him from that occupation,  but to discipline him the more for it. For that he does not call him to attend upon him, as if he took him everywhere with him as his follower, appears from what he adds:

"For I have determined there to winter."

Now Nicopolis  is a city of Thrace.
