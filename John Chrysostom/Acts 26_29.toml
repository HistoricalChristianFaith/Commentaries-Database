Notice how his speech is devoid of flattery. “I pray,” [Paul] says, “that this day all might become such as I am—except for these chains.” This man, who glories in his bonds, who displays them as if they were a gold chain, deprecates them for these men. For they were still too weak, and he had spoken rather in condescension. For what is better than those chains, which often appear in his epistles, as in “Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ,” and, “On this account I am bound with this chain,” “but the word of God is not bound,” and, “Even to the point of being chained like a criminal.” Not only chains, but even “like a criminal.” The punishment is twofold. For if he were so chained for some good, the matter would carry some consolation. As it is, [Paul] is chained “like a criminal,” and for terrible purposes too. But he takes none of this into consideration.

It was not out of distress or fear that Paul acted thus but from an abundance of wisdom and spiritual understanding. He was addressing a Gentile, an unbeliever who knew nothing of us. Naturally he was unwilling to introduce him by way of disagreeable things. He acted in the present instance in accordance with his own words, “To those outside the law I became as one outside the law.” This is what he meant: “If the Gentile hears of chains and tribulations, he will immediately take flight. He does not know the power of chains. Let him first become a believer, let him taste of the word preached, and then he will, of his own accord even, run toward these chains.”

Indeed, up to this time they have heard false reports of our doctrine and are hostile to the cross. If I should then add chains as well, their hatred becomes greater. This is why I removed these, so as to make that more acceptable. For they consider it disgraceful to be chained, because they have not yet tasted the glory that is with us. We must therefore condescend. For once they learn of the true life, they will also know the beauty of this iron and the distinction that comes from these chains.… In the meantime, one must be content that the listeners are not ashamed of the cross. For this reason he proceeds methodically, like a guide who is introducing someone to a palace: he does not force him, before he has seen the vestibules and while he is still standing outside, to survey what is within; for unless he enters and observes everything closely, it will not appear marvelous to him.
