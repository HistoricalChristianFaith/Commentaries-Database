It was not out of distress or fear that Paul acted thus but from an abundance of wisdom and spiritual understanding. He was addressing a Gentile, an unbeliever who knew nothing of us. Naturally he was unwilling to introduce him by way of disagreeable things. He acted in the present instance in accordance with his own words, “To those outside the law I became as one outside the law.” This is what he meant: “If the Gentile hears of chains and tribulations, he will immediately take flight. He does not know the power of chains. Let him first become a believer, let him taste of the word preached, and then he will, of his own accord even, run toward these chains.”

Indeed, up to this time they have heard false reports of our doctrine and are hostile to the cross. If I should then add chains as well, their hatred becomes greater. This is why I removed these, so as to make that more acceptable. For they consider it disgraceful to be chained, because they have not yet tasted the glory that is with us. We must therefore condescend. For once they learn of the true life, they will also know the beauty of this iron and the distinction that comes from these chains.… In the meantime, one must be content that the listeners are not ashamed of the cross. For this reason he proceeds methodically, like a guide who is introducing someone to a palace: he does not force him, before he has seen the vestibules and while he is still standing outside, to survey what is within; for unless he enters and observes everything closely, it will not appear marvelous to him.

And he said not, I do not wish that, but, "I pray that not only thou, but also all that hear." Mark how free from flattery his speech is.-"I pray that this day they may be all such as I am, except these bonds." He, the man that glories in his bonds, that puts them forth as a golden chain, deprecates them for these men: for they were as yet too weak in their minds, and it was rather in condescension that he so spake. For what could be better than those bonds which always in his Epistles he prefers to all things else, saying, "Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ:" and again, "On this account I am bound with this chain, but the word of God is not bound;" and, "Even unto bonds, as an evil-doer." The punishment was twofold. For if indeed he had been so bound, as with a view to his good, the thing would have carried with it some consolation: but now he is bound both "as an evil-doer," and as with a view to very ill consequences; yet for none of these things cared he.
