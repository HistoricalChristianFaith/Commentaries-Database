When the resurrection will be, he has not said: “It will come in due order”; he has said: “And our assembling to meet him.” This point is quite important. Observe how Paul’s exhortation is accompanied by praise and encouragement, for he makes it clear that Jesus and all the saints will certainly appear at that time with us.

When the Resurrection will be, he has not said, but that it will not be now, he has said. And our gathering together unto Him. This also is no little matter. See how the exhortation also is again accompanied with commendation and encouragement, in that He and all the Saints will certainly appear with us. Here he is discoursing concerning the resurrection and our gathering together. For these things will happen at the same time. He raises up their minds. That ye be not quickly shaken, he says, nor yet be troubled, either by spirit, or by word, or by epistle as from us, as that the day of the Lord is now present.
