Through these words Eliphaz shows the excellence of God. Since it was natural for Job to examine his own situation on the ground of his personal reflections, observe what Eliphaz says: “Do not speak so.” God is great. He does many things that we don’t understand. Our lowliness is profound.… Whatever God might do, he does well.
