Wherefore has he mentioned the founder of the city? Because there was another besides, CÃ¦sarea Stratonis. But not in that, but in this does He ask them, leading them far away from the Jews, so that being freed from all alarm, they might speak with boldness all that was in their mind.

And wherefore did He not ask them at once their own opinion, but that of the people? In order that when they had told the people's opinion, and then were asked, But whom say ye that I am? by the manner of His inquiry they might be led up to a sublimer notion, and not fall into the same low view as the multitude. Accordingly He asks them not at all in the beginning of His preaching, but when He had done many miracles, and had discoursed with them of many and high doctrines, and had afforded so many clear proofs of His Godhead, and of His unanimity with the Father, then He puts this question to them.

And He said not, Whom say the Scribes and Pharisees that I am? often as these had come unto Him, and discoursed with Him; but, Whom do men say that I am? inquiring after the judgment of the people, as unbiassed. For though it was far meaner than it should be, yet was it free from malice, but the other was teeming with much wickedness.

And signifying how earnestly He desires His Economy to be confessed, He says, The Son of Man; thereby denoting His Godhead, which He does also in many other places. For He says, No man has ascended up to Heaven, but the Son of Man, which is in Heaven. John 3:13 And again, But when you shall see the Son of Man ascend up, where He was before. John 6:62

Why does he mention Philip, the founder of the city? Because there was another city, Caesarea Stratonis. He does not go there, but rather he leads them far away from Judea, so that being freed from all alarm, they might speak with boldness all that was in their mind.
