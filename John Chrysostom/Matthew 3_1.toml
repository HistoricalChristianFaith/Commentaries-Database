How “in those days”? What days? He does not mean the days when Jesus was a child at Nazareth but thirty years later, when John came, as Luke also testifies. Why then is it said “in those days”? It is common in Scripture to use this rhetorical device: In speaking of something that seems to come immediately after, it also refers to something that comes to pass many years later.
