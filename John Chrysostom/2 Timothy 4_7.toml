He is desirous to console the despondency of his disciple and therefore bids him be of good cheer, since he was going to his crown, having finished all his work and obtained a glorious end.… As a father whose son was sitting nearby, bewailing his orphan state, might console him, saying, Weep not, my son; we have lived a good life, we have arrived at old age, and now we leave you.… These things then he wrote to console Timothy. Indeed the whole epistle is full of consolation and is a sort of testament.
