When you commit sin, do not wait for another man to accuse you but, before you are accused and indicted, you yourself had best condemn what you have done. Then, if someone accuses you later on, it is no longer a matter of your doing the right thing in confessing but of your correcting the accusation which he makes. And so it is that someone else has said, “The just man begins his speech by accusing himself.” So it is not a question of accusing but of being the first to accuse yourself and not waiting for others to accuse you.Peter certainly sinned gravely in denying Christ. But he was quick to remind himself of his sin and, before anyone accused him, he told of his error and wept bitterly. He so effectively washed away his sin of denial that he became the chief of the apostles, and the whole world was entrusted to him.

You see, when Cain was asked by the Lord, “Where is your brother Abel?” that was the time for him to confess his fault, fall on his knees, pray and ask pardon. At that point, however, he rejected the healing, whereas now, after the sentence, after all was over, after the accusation was leveled at him in a loud voice by the blood that had been shed, he made his confession only to gain nothing from it. That is why the inspired author also said, “He who accuses himself at the beginning of the speech is in the right.” Accordingly, had Cain anticipated the Lord’s accusation, perhaps he would have been granted some mercy on account of the Lord’s unlimited goodness. I mean, there is no sin, no matter how grave, that can exceed his mercy provided we demonstrate our repentance at the proper time and beg pardon. “Cain said, ‘My guilt is too great for me to be forgiven”—an adequate confession, but too late.
