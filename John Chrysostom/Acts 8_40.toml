But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Caesarea. This Philip, therefore, was one of the seven; for there in fact he is afterwards found at Caesarea.

Great was the gain to Philip also: that which he heard concerning the Prophets, concerning Habakkuk, concerning Ezekiel, and the rest, he saw done in his own person. Thence it appears that he went a long distance, seeing he was found at Azotus. The Spirit set him there, where he was thenceforth to preach: And passing through, he preached in all the cities, until he came to Caesarea.
