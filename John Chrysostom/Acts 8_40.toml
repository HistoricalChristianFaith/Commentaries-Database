This (Philip, therefore) was one of the seven; for there in fact he is afterwards found at Cæsarea. It was well and expedient therefore that the Spirit caught Philip away; else the eunuch would have desired to go with him, and Philip would have grieved him by declining to comply with his request, the time being not yet come. (a) But at the same time here was an encouraging assurance for them that they shall also prevail over the heathen: for indeed the high character (τὸ ἀξιόπιστον) of the (first) believers was enough to move them. If however the eunuch had stayed there, what fault could have been found? [But he knew him not]: for this is why it says, he went on his way rejoicing: so that had he known him, he would not have been (so) delighted.

And the Angel of the Lord, etc.

Great was the gain to Philip also:— that which he heard concerning the Prophets, concerning Habakkuk, concerning Ezekiel, and the rest, he saw done in his own person. Daniel 14:36; Ezekiel 3:12 Thence it appears that he went a long distance, seeing he was found at Azotus. (The Spirit) set him there, where he was thenceforth to preach: And passing through, he preached in all the cities, until he came to Cæsarea.
