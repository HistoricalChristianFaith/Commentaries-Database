Great was the gain to Philip also:— that which he heard concerning the Prophets, concerning Habakkuk, concerning Ezekiel, and the rest, he saw done in his own person. Daniel 14:36; Ezekiel 3:12 Thence it appears that he went a long distance, seeing he was found at Azotus. (The Spirit) set him there, where he was thenceforth to preach: And passing through, he preached in all the cities, until he came to Cæsarea.
