And these things he said, setting laws and rules for his own disciples, that when they should have to receive as disciples those of all sorts that should come from the whole world, they might deal with them very gently. “Neither is new wine put into old wineskins.” Consider how his illustrations are like those in the Old Testament. The garment? The wineskins? For Jeremiah, too, calls the people “a waistcloth” and makes mention again of “jar” and of “wine.” Thus, the discourse being about gluttony and a table, he takes his illustrations from the same.
