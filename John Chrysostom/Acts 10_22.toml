"And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a just man, and one that feareth God and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by an holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee." They speak his praises, so as to persuade him that an Angel has in fact appeared unto him.

"And they said, etc. into his house." This he had ordered them. Do not think he has done this out of contempt: not as of contempt has he sent, but so he was ordered.

But observe what is said of him by the soldier whom Cornelius sent: "A just man, and one that feareth God": and then - for fearing lest Peter should refuse to come to him, as being a Gentile, he adds this - "and well reported of by all the nation of the Jews." Why then, there is nothing like alms; or rather great is the virtue of this thing.
