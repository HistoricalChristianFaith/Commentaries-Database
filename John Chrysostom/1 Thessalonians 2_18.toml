You, too, when you are about to perform any duty for God, expect manifold dangers, punishments, deaths. Don’t be surprised or disturbed if such things happen. For it is said, “My Son, if you come to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation.” For surely no one choosing to fight, expects to carry off the crown without wounds! And you, therefore, who have decided to wage full combat with the devil, don’t think to pursue such a life without danger, expecting luxury instead! God has not pledged to you his recompense and promise for this life. These splendid things await you in the future life! Be glad and rejoice then, if when you have yourself done any good action, you receive evil in return … inasmuch as your suffering is the source of a higher recompense!… We see Paul in prison, yes, even in chains, instructing and initiating. He does the very same in a court of justice, in shipwreck, in tempest and in a thousand dangers. You also imitate these saints, and as long as you are able continue in your good works. Although you see the devil thwarting you ten thousand times, never fall back! Perhaps you have lost your wealth in a shipwreck. Remember Paul, carrying God’s word, a message far more precious than all material wealth, was traveling to Rome and was wrecked, and sustained innumerable hardships. And this principle he himself signified when he said, “Many times we desired to come to you, but Satan hindered us.” And God permitted it, thus revealing more abundantly his power.
