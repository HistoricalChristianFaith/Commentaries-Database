And after some days, Paul said, etc. Acts 15:36 He put to Barnabas a necessity for their going abroad, saying Let us visit the cities in which we preached the word. But Paul begged, etc. Acts 15:38 And yet no need for him to beg, who had to make an accusation presently. This happens even in the case where God and men are the parties: the man requests, God is angry. For instance, when He says, If her father had spit in her face Numbers 12:14: and again, Let me alone, and in Mine anger I will blot out this people. Exodus 32:32 And Samuel when he mourns for Saul. 1 Samuel 15:35 For by both, great good is done. Thus also here: the one is angry, the other not so. The same happens also in matters where we are concerned. And the sharp contention with good reason, that Mark may receive a lesson, and the affair may not seem mere stage-playing. For it is not to be thought that he who bids, Let not the sun go down upon your wrath, Ephesians 4:26 would have been angry because of such a matter as this: nor that he who on all occasions gave way would not have given way here, he who so greatly loved Paul that before this he sought him in Tarsus, and brought him to the Apostles, and undertook the alms in common with him, and in common the business relating to the decree. But they take themselves so as to instruct and make perfect by their separation them that need the teaching which was to come from them. And he rebukes others indeed, but bids do good to all men. As in fact he does elsewhere, saying, But you, be not weary in well-doing. 2 Thessalonians 3:13 This we also do in our common practice. Here it seems to me that others also were alike displeased with Paul. And thereupon taking them also apart, he does all, and exhorts and admonishes. Much can concord do, much can charity. Though it be for a great matter you ask, though thou be unworthy, you shall be heard for your purpose of heart: fear not.

He went, it says, through the cities And, behold, there was a disciple, by name Timothy, who had a good report of the brethren which were in Lystra and Iconium. (v. 41; 16:1.) Great was the grace of Timothy. When Barnabas departed (ἀ πέστη), he finds another, equivalent to him. Of him he says, Remembering your tears and your unfeigned faith, which dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice. 2 Timothy 1:5 His father continued to be a Gentile, and therefore it was that (Timothy) was not circumcised. (a) Observe the Law already broken. Or if not so, I suppose he was born after the preaching of the Gospel but this is perhaps not so. (c) He was about to make him a bishop, and it was not meet that he should be uncircumcised. (e) And this was not a small matter, seeing it offended after so long a time: (b) for from a child, he says, you have known the Holy Scriptures. 2 Timothy 3:15 (d) And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for to keep.

For because there were offenses without number, their presence was needed. (d) How they do, he says. And this he did not know: naturally. See him ever alert, solicitous, not bearing to sit idle, though he underwent dangers without end. Do you mark, it was not of cowardice that he came to Antioch? He acts just as a physician does in the case of the sick. And the need of visiting them he showed by saying, In which we preached the word. And Barnabas determined, etc.
