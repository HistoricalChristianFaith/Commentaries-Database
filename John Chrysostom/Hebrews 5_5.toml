He appears to me in these words also to hint at the priests of the Jews, as being no longer priests, but intruders and corrupters of the law of the priesthood; "So Christ also glorified not Himself to be made an High Priest."

How then was He appointed (one says)? For Aaron was many times appointed as by the Rod, and when the fire came down and destroyed those who wished to intrude into the priesthood. But in this instance, on the contrary, they the Jewish Priests not only suffered nothing, but even are in high esteem. Whence then His appointment? He shows it from the prophecy. He has nothing to allege perceptible by sense, nothing visible. For this cause he affirms it from prophecy, from things future; "But He that said unto Him Thou art My Son, to-day have I begotten Thee." What has this to do with the Son? Yea (he says) it is a preparation for His being appointed by God.
