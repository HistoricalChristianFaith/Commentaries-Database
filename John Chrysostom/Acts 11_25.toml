"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus, for to seek Saul." He came to the athletic wrestler, the general fit to lead armies, the champion of single combat, the lion - I am at a loss for words, say what I will - the hunting-dog, killer of lions, bull of strength, lamp of brightness, mouth sufficing for a world.

"Then departed Barnabas to Tarsus," etc. But why did he take him off from Tarsus and bring him here? Not without good reason; for here were both good hopes, and a greater city, and a great body of people. See how grace works all, not Paul: by small means the affair was taking its commencement. When it is become difficult the Apostles take it up. Why did they not before this send Barnabas? Because they had enough to do with Jerusalem.
