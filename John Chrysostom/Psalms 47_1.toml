With hands that were previously defiled, accursed, daily stained with blood in the impure sacrifices in which you took the lives of your children, performed shameful rites and went beyond the limits of nature itself, with these hands now clap. “Shout to God in a voice of happiness.” With that tongue by which you tasted accursed things, by which you uttered blasphemous words, with that tongue shout a victory ode.… You have mounted above heavens and the heavens of heavens and have taken your place at the royal throne itself. Accordingly, “Shout to God,” that is, offer thanksgiving to him, the victory to him, the trophy to him. The conflict is not human or the battle physical, nor is the contest over any earthly concern but over the heavens and those in the heavens. He personally conducted this war and gave us a share in the victory.
