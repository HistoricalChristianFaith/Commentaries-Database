Look what they said to persuade people—“he was crucified.” What could be less persuasive than this? That he was buried by those to whom it was promised that he should be the salvation, that he who was buried forgives sins, even more than the law? And he does not say, “from which you would not,” but “from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.” “Everyone,” that is, whoever he is. For those [ordinances] are of no use, unless some benefit comes from them. This is why he brings in forgiveness later and shows it to be greater, when that which is impossible comes about. “Who are his witnesses,” he says, “to the people”—the people that killed him. They would not have been his witnesses had they not been strengthened by a divine power. They would not have borne such witness to bloodthirsty people, the very people who killed him. “Today I have begotten you,” he said. It is on this that the rest follows. Why didn’t [Paul] adduce some text, through which they would be persuaded that forgiveness of sins is through him? Because this was what he was trying to do: first to show he was risen; when this is acknowledged, the other becomes indisputable. And indeed “by him” is the remission of sins. Moreover, he wanted to make them yearn after this great thing.
