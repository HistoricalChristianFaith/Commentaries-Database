"And the voice spake unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, that call not thou common." "What God hath cleansed," saith it, "call not thou common." Great daring! It seems indeed to be spoken to him, but the whole is meant for the Jews. For if the teacher is rebuked, much more these.
