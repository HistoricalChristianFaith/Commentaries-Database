* And to make all men see, says he, what is the dispensation of the mystery which from all ages has been hid in God, who created all things.
Angels knew only this, that The Lord's portion was His people. Deuteronomy 32:8-9 And again it is said, The Prince of Persia withstood me. Daniel 10:13 So that it is nothing to be wondered at that they were ignorant of this; for if they were ignorant of the circumstances of the return from the Captivity, much more would they be of these things. For this is the gospel. It is He that shall save, it says, His people. Matthew 1:21 Not a word about the Gentiles. But what concerns the Gentiles the Spirit reveals. That they were called indeed, the Angels knew, but that it was to the same privileges as Israel, yea, even to sit upon the throne of God, this, who would ever have expected? Who would ever have believed?

* Which has been hid, says he, in God.
This dispensation, however, he more clearly unfolds in the Epistle to the Romans. In God, he continues, who created all things by Jesus Christ. And he does well to say by Jesus Christ; forasmuch as He who created all things by Him, reveals also this by Him; for He has made nothing without Him; for without Him, it is said, was not any thing made. John 1:30
