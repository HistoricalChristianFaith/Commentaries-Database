"And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is He which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead." This is great. Then he adduces the testimony from the Prophets.

"To testify," saith he - in a manner calculated to alarm - that they may not have it in their power to fall back upon the excuse of ignorance: and he does not say, "that He is the Son of God," but, what would most alarm them, "that it is He which is ordained of God, to be the Judge of quick and dead."
