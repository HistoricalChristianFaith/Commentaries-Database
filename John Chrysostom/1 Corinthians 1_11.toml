"For it has been signified unto me concerning you, my brethren, by them which are of the household of Chloe." Neither did he say this at the very beginning, but first he brought forward his charge; as one who put confidence in his informants. Because, had it not been so, he would not have found fault: for Paul was not a person to believe lightly. Neither then did he immediately say, "it has been signified," lest he might seem to blame on their authority: neither does he omit all mention of them, lest he should seem to speak only from himself. And again, he styles them "brethren;" for although the fault be plain, there is nothing against calling people brethren still. Consider also his prudence in not speaking of any distinct person, but of the entire family; so as not to make them hostile towards the informer: for in this way he both protects him, and fearlessly opens the accusation. For he had an eye to the benefit not of the one side only, but of the other also. Wherefore he says not, "It has been declared to me by certain," but he indicates also the household, lest they might suppose that he was inventing.

4. Â What was declared? "That there are contentions among you." Thus, when he is rebuking them, he says, "That there be no divisions among you;" but when he is reporting the statements of others, he does it more gently; saying, For it has been declared unto me...that there are contentions among you; in order that he might not bring trouble upon the informants.
