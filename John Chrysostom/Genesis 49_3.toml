See the extent of the good man’s wisdom. Intending to level a worse accusation against Reuben, he first mentioned the privileges conceded him by nature and the precedence he enjoyed in being the beginning of his line and enjoying the dignity of firstborn. Then he records his sins of free will as if on a bronze pillar to show that no advantage comes to us from natural advantage unless accompanied by good deeds of free will—these, you see, are what bring us commendation or lend us the stigma of blame. “Unyielding in endurance,” he says, “unyielding in willfulness”: the pride of place accorded you by nature you have forfeited by your own headstrong behavior.
