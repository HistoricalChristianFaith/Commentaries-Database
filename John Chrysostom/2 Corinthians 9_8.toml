And may God , that is able, fulfill all grace towards you.

By this prayer he takes out the way a thought which lay in wait against this liberality and which is now also an hinderance to many.

To do away with this fear then, he adds this prayer, saying, May He make all grace abound towards you. Not merely fulfil, but make it abound. And what is make grace abound? 'Fill you,' he means, 'with so great things, that you may be able to abound in this liberality.'

That ye, having always all sufficiency in every thing, may abound to every good work.

Observe, even in this his prayer, his great philosophy. He prays not for riches nor for abundance, but for all sufficiency. Nor is this all that is admirable in him; but that as he prayed not for superfluity, so he does not press sore on them nor compel them to give of their want, condescending to their weakness; but asks for a sufficiency, and shows at the same time that they ought not to abuse the gifts received from God. That ye may abound, he says, to every good work. 'It is therefore,' says he, 'I ask for this, that you may bestow on others also.' Yet he did not say, 'bestow,' but 'abound.' For in carnal things he asks for a sufficiency for them, but in spiritual things for abundance even; not in almsgiving only, but in all other things also, unto every good work. Then he brings forward unto them the prophet for a counsellor, having sought out a testimony inviting them to bountifulness,

Note how Paul does not pray for riches or abundance but only for enough to live on. Nor is this the only thing he should be admired for. He asks the same thing of the Corinthians.… He wants them to have enough of this world’s goods but more so an overflowing abundance of spiritual blessings.
