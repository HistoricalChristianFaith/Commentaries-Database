Then, since He had mentioned to us two pairs of apostles, that of Peter, and that of John, and after those had pointed out the calling of Matthew, but had said nothing to us either of the calling or of the name of the other apostles; here of necessity He sets down the list of them, and their number, and makes known their names, saying thus:

Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; first, Simon, who is called Peter. Matthew 10:2

Because there was also another Simon, the Canaanite; and there was Judas Iscariot, and Judas the brother of James; and James the son of Alph√¶us, and James the son of Zebedee.

Now Mark does also put them according to their dignity; for after the two leaders, He then numbers Andrew; but our evangelist not so, but without distinction; or rather He sets before himself even Thomas who came far short of him.

But let us look at the list of them from the beginning.

First, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother.

Even this is no small praise. For the one he named from his virtue, the other from his high kindred, which was in conformity to his disposition.

Then, James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother.

Do you see how He arranges them not according to their dignity. For to me John seems to be greater, not only than the others, but even than his brother.
