It is written in your law that the testimony of two men is true. If this is to be taken literally, in what respect does our Lord differ from human beings? The rule has been laid down for humanity on the ground that one man alone is not to be relied on. But how can this be applicable to God?… These words are quoted then with another meaning. When two men bear witness, both to an impersonal matter, their witness is true. This constitutes the testimony of two men. But if one of them bears witness to himself, then they are no longer two witnesses. Thus our Lord means to show that he is consubstantial with the Father, and does not need another witness, that is, besides the Father’s, “I and the Father that sent me.” … Again, on human principles, when a person bears witness, his honesty is assumed. And a person is admitted as a fair and competent witness in an impersonal matter but not in one relating to himself unless he is supported by other testimony. But here it is quite the opposite. Our Lord, though giving testimony in his own case, and though saying that he is borne witness to by another, pronounces himself worthy of belief, thus, showing his all-sufficiency. He says that he deserves to be believed.
