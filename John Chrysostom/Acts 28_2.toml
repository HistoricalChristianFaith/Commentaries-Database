"Showed," he says, "no little kindness to us-barbarians" (as they were) "-having kindled a fire:" else it were of no use that their lives be saved, if the wintry weather must destroy them.

The Jews then, beholding all the many miracles they did, persecuted and harassed Paul; but the barbarians, who had seen none, merely on the ground of his misfortune, were kind to him. "They showed no small kindness," and yet some of them were prisoners. Let those be ashamed that say, Do not do good to those in prison: let these barbarians shame us; for they knew not who these men were, but simply because they were in misfortune they were kind: thus much they perceived, that they were human beings, and therefore they considered them to have a claim upon their humanity.
