The Jews, who saw so many miracles, persecuted and harassed Paul. The barbarians, on the other hand, saw none and were kind to him solely because of his misfortune. “No doubt,” they said, “this man is a murderer.” They did not simply pronounce their judgment but added, “No doubt,” as if this was clear for anyone to see. “Justice,” they say, “has not allowed him to live.” So they too had an account of providence. These barbarians were far closer to truth than the philosophers. The latter did not allow providence to extend to the sphere below the moon. The former believed that God was present everywhere and that, even if one should escape many dangers, he would not escape in the end. Still, they do not make it their business to bring him to this end but respect him for now on account of his misfortune. They do not broadcast their judgment but only speak to each other. For the chains led them to suspect this. And yet they were prisoners. Let those be ashamed who say, “Do not do good to those in prison.” Let us feel shame before the barbarians. For they did not know who those men were, only that they were human beings from their misfortune.
