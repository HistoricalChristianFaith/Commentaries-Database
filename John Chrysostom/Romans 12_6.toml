Since then he had sufficiently comforted them, he wishes also to make them vie with each other,  and labor more in earnest, by showing that it is themselves that give the grounds for their receiving more or less. For he says indeed that it is given by God (as when he says, "according as God has dealt to every man the measure of faith;" and again, "according to the grace given unto us") [Romans 12:3], that he may subdue the haughty. But he says also that the beginnings lie with themselves, to rouse the listless. And this he does in the Epistle to the Corinthians also, to produce both these emotions. For when he says, "covet earnestly the gifts," [1 Corinthians 12:31], he shows that they were themselves the cause of the differences in what was given. But when he says, "Now all these things works one and the selfsame Spirit, dividing to every man severally as he will" [1 Corinthians 12:11], he is proving that those who have received it ought not to be elated, so using every way open to him to allay their disorder. And this he does here also. And again, to rouse those who have fallen drowsy, he says, "Whether prophecy, let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith." For though it is a grace, yet it is not poured forth at random, but framing its measure according to the recipients, it lets as much flow as it may find the vessel of faith that is brought to be capable of.

Although prophecy is a grace, it does not flow forth freely at random but is given only in proportion to our faith.
