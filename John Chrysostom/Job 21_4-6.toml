Let us admit, he says, that I am iniquitous and impious; but I gain no profit from these remarks and know that you will mock me; therefore, I do not yield. “And what!” he says, “is it a mortal who blames me?” that is, no mortal can blame me. I am not fighting against a man. “When I think of it, I am dismayed and pains seize my flesh.” Notice how he always stands up, how he puts forward his sufferings, how he indicates the reason for the terrible words he is going to speak, because he does not talk in this manner by himself or from a fixed position but because his soul is dismayed and his thoughts are darkened.
