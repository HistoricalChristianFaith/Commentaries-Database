If the Father judges no man, and you are not come to judge the world, who judges him? The word that I have spoken, the  same shall judge him.  For since they said, He is not from God, He says this,  that, they shall not then be able to say these things, but the words which I have spoken now, shall be in place of an accuser, convicting them, and cutting off all excuse. And the word which I have spoken. What manner of word?
