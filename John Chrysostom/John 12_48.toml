The word that I have just said shall be their accusers and deprive them of all excuses. The same word that I have spoken will be the word that will judge them. And what word is this? “That I have not spoken of myself, but the Father who sent me told me what I should say and what I should speak.” All these things were said on their account so that they might have no pretense or excuse.
