"And saw heaven opened, and, knit at the four corners, a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air." What is this? It is a symbol of the whole world. The man was uncircumcised: and - for he had nothing in common with the Jews - they would all accuse him as a transgressor: "thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them."

The earth then, this is what the linen sheet denotes, and the wild beasts in it, are they of the Gentiles, and the command, "Kill and eat," denotes that he must go to them also; and that this thing is thrice done, denotes baptism.

To me it seems that this also denotes the Gospel (or, "the Preaching"). That the thing taking place was of God the circumstances made evident, namely, both that he sees it descending from above, and that he is in a trance; and, that the voice comes from thence, and the thrice confessing that the creatures there were unclean, and its coming from thence, and being drawn back thither - all this is a mighty token of the cleanness imparted to them.
