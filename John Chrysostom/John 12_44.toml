As though He had said, Why fear ye to believe in Me? Faith passes to the Father through Me, as does also unbelief. See how in every way He shows the unvaryingness of His Essence.  He said not, He that believes Me, lest any should assert that He spoke concerning His words; this might have been said in the case of mere men, for he that believes the Apostles, believes not them, but God. But that you might learn that He speaks here of the belief on His Essence, He said not, He that believes My words, but, He that believes in Me. And wherefore, says some one, has He nowhere said conversely, He that believes in the Father, believes not on the Father but on Me? Because they would have replied, Lo, we believe in the Father, but we believe not on you. Their disposition was as yet too infirm. Anyhow, conversing with the disciples, He did speak thus: You believe in the Father,  believe also on Me John 14:1; but seeing that these then were too weak to hear such words, He leads them in another way, showing  that it is not possible to believe in the Father, without believing on Him. And that you may not deem that the words are spoken as of man, He adds,

Because the love of human praise prevented the chief rulers from believing, Jesus cried and said, He that believes in Me, believes not on Me, but on Him that sent Me: as if tosay, Why are you afraid to believe in Me? Your faith through Me passes to God.
He that believes on Me, believes not in Me, but on Him that sent Me: as if He said, He that takes water from a stream, takes the water not of the stream, but of the fountain. Then to show that it is not possible to believe on the Father, if we do not believe in Him, He says, He that sees Me, sees Him that sent Me. What then; Is God a body? By no means; seeing here is the mindâ€™s vision. What follows still further shows His union with the Father. I am come a light into the world. This is what the Father is called in many places. He calls Himself the light, because he delivers from error, and disperses the darkness of the understanding; that whosoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.
And to show that He does not let His despisers go unpunished, from want of power, He adds, And if any man hear My words and believe not, I judge him not.
But that this might not serve to encourage sloth, He warns men of aterrible judgment coming; He that rejects Me, and hears not My words, has one that judgeshim.
Or, I judge him not, i.e. I am not the cause of his destruction, but he is himself, by despising my words. The words that I have just said, shall be his accusers, and deprive him of all excuse; the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him. And what word? This, viz. that I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which sent Me gave Me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak. All these things were said on their account, that they might have no excuse.
