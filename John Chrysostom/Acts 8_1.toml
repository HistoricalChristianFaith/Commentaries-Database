“The persecution,” he says, “gained strength.” True, but especially then it delivered people who were previously possessed. For it planted miracles like forts among them. Even the death of Stephen did not quench their rage, but rather increased it. It dispersed the teachers, so that the discipleship became greater. There was joy, although there had been great lamentation. Note again the good: the malady lasted long enough, but it was this man who brought them deliverance.
