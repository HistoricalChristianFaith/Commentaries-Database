And now without scruple they had intercourse with Samaria, whereas it had been said to them, Go not into the way of the Gentiles and into any city of the Samaritans enter ye not. Matthew 10:5 Except the Apostles, it says: they, in this way also, wishing to win the Jews—but not to leave the city—and to be the means of inspiring others with boldness.

As for Saul, he made havoc of the Church, entering into every house, and haling men and women committed them to prison.

And Saul was consenting unto his death. Hereupon arises a persecution, and it becomes a great one. And at that time there was a great persecution against the Church which was at Jerusalem. And they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the Apostles.

Mark how once more God permits temptations to arise; mark, and well observe, how the events are ordered by Divine Providence. They were admired because of the signs: being scourged, they were none the worse for it: (some) were ordained in the matter of the widows : the word increased: once more, God permits a great hindrance to arise. And a persecution of no ordinary kind [and they were all scattered, etc.]; for they feared their enemies, now become more daring: and at the same time it is shown that they were but men, these that were afraid, that fled. For, that you may not say after these things that by grace alone they effected (what they did), they were also persecuted, and themselves became more timorous, while their adversaries were more daring. And were all scattered abroad, it says, except the Apostles. But this was divinely ordered, so that they should no longer all sit there in Jerusalem. And devout men, it says, carried Stephen to his burial, and made great lamentation over him.
