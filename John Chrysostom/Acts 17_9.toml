"And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go." A man worthy to be admired, that he put himself into danger, and sent them away from it. See how by giving security Jason sent Paul away: so that he gave his life to the hazard for him.

"When they had taken security" - a legal term - satisfactionem accipere, it is doubtful if, as Chrysostom supposes, Jason became surety in person. The surety was more probably a deposit of money and had for its object the guaranty that the peace should be kept, and nothing done contrary the Emperor and the state.
