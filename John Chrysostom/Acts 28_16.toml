"And when we came to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with a soldier that kept him." Leave was given him to dwell by himself. No slight proof this also of his being held in much admiration: it is clear they did not number him among the rest.

Paul therefore was now so much respected, that he was even permitted to be by himself: for if even before this they used him kindly, much more would they now. "He was suffered," it says, "to dwell by himself, with a soldier that kept him." That it might not be possible for any plot to be laid against him there either - for there could be no raising of sedition now. So that in fact they were not keeping Paul in custody, but guarding him, so that nothing unpleasant should happen: for it was not possible now, in so great a city, and with the Emperor there, and with Paul's appeal, for anything to be done contrary to order. So surely is it the case, that always through the things which seem to be against us, all things turn out for us. "With the soldier" - for he was Paul's guard.
