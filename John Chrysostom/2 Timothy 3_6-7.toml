Do you see them employing the artifice of that old deceiver, the weapons which the devil used against Adam? "Entering into houses," he says. Observe how he shows their impudence by this expression,  their dishonorable ways, their deceitfulness. "Leading captive silly women," so that he who is easy to be deceived is a "silly woman," and nothing like a man: for to be deceived is the part of silly women. "Laden with sins." See whence arises their persuasion, from their sins, from their being conscious to themselves of nothing good! And with great propriety has he said "laden."  For this expression marks the multitude of their sins, and their state of disorder and confusion; "led away with various lusts." He does not accuse nature, for it is not women simply, but such women as these, that he blames. And why "various lusts"? By that are implied their various faults, their luxury, their disorderly conduct, their wantonness. "Divers lust," he says, that is, of glory, of wealth, of pleasure, of self-will, of honor: and perchance other vile desires are implied.

"Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth." He does not say thus to excuse, but to threaten them severely; for their understanding was callous, because they had weighed themselves down with lusts and sins.
