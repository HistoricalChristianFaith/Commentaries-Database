Hom. in Matt., xiii: Because all that Christ did and suffered was for our teaching, He began after His baptism to dwell in the wilderness, and fought against the devil, that every baptized person might patiently sustain greater temptations after His baptism, nor be troubled, as if this which happened to Him was contrary to His expectation, but might bear up against all things, and come off conqueror. And the reason why He does not simply say that He went into the wilderness, but was driven, is that thou mayestunderstand that it was done according to the word of Divine Providence. By which also He shows that no man should thrust himself into temptation, but that those who from some other state are as it were driven into temptation, remain conquerors.
in Matt., Hom., xiii: But the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness, because He designed to provoke the devil to tempt Him, and thus gave Him an opportunity not only by hunger, but also bythe place. For then most of all does the devil thrust himself in, when he seesmen remaining solitary.
Vict. Ant.e Cat. in Marc.: But He says this to show of what nature was the wilderness, for it was impassable by man and full of wild beasts. It goes on; “and angels ministered unto Him.” For after temptation, and a victory against the devil, He worked the salvation of man. And thus the Apostle says, “Angels are sent to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation.” We must also observe, that to those who conquer in temptation angels stand near and minister.
