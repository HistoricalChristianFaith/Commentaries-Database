And besides, the sequel is enough to bear him out on this point, so now the discourse is for all in common. “ ‘But this is that which was spoken by the prophet Joel, and it shall come to pass in the last days,’ says the Lord God.” Nowhere as yet the name of Christ or his promise, but the promise is that of the Father.
