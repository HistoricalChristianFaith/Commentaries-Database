"Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them. And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did. For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed with them: and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed. And there was great joy in that city." "Hearing and seeing the miracles which he did." Just as in the case of Moses by contrast with the magicians the miracles were evident miracles, so here also. There was magic, and so these signs were manifest. "For unclean spirits came out of many that were possessed with them"; for this was a manifest miracle - not as the magicians did: for the other (Simon), it is likely, bound men with spells - "and many," it says, "that were palsied and lame were healed." There was no deceit here: for it needed but that they should walk and work.

"And there was joy." And yet there had been "great lamentation": true; but mark again the good.
