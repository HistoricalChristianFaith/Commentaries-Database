Again He speaks as a man and as a Prophet, since nowhere does He appear to have done anything by the Name of God.

Those that You gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

And in another place He says, Of all that You gave Me, I will surely lose nothing.  John 6:39 Yet not only was he  lost, but also many afterwards; how then says He, I will in nowise lose?  For My part, I will not lose. So in another place, declaring the matter was more clearly, He said, I will in nowise cast out. John 6:37 Not through fault of Mine, not because I either instigate or abandon them; but if they start away of themselves, I draw them not by necessity.
