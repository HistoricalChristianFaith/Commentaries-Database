Again He speaks as a man and as a Prophet, since nowhere does He appear to have done anything by the Name of God.

Those that You gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition, that the Scripture might be fulfilled.

And in another place He says, Of all that You gave Me, I will surely lose nothing.  John 6:39 Yet not only was he  lost, but also many afterwards; how then says He, I will in nowise lose?  For My part, I will not lose. So in another place, declaring the matter was more clearly, He said, I will in nowise cast out. John 6:37 Not through fault of Mine, not because I either instigate or abandon them; but if they start away of themselves, I draw them not by necessity.

In another place he says, “Of all that you gave me, I will surely lose nothing.” Yet not only was [Judas] lost, but also many afterward were lost too. So how then can he say, “I will not lose any?” [He means], “At least for my part, I will not lose them.” So in another place, declaring the matter more clearly, he said, “I will not reject anyone who comes to me.” In other words, [Jesus is saying], it is not through any fault on my part. They will not be lost at my instigation or because I abandon them. But if they start going away on their own, I will not force them back.
