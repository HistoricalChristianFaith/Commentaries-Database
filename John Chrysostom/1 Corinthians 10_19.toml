"What say I then? That an idol is anything? Or that a thing sacrificed to idols is anything?"

As if he had said, "Now these things I affirm, and try to withdraw you from the idols, not as though they could do any injury or had any power: for an idol is nothing; but I wish you to despise them." "And if you will have us despise them," says one, "wherefore do you carefully withdraw us from them?" Because they are not offered to your Lord.
