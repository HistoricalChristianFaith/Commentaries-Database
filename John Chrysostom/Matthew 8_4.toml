It was an ancient law that the leper when cleansed should not entrust the recognition of his cleansing to private judgment but should show himself to the priest. By this means it would be confirmed in his own eyes, and he could then be numbered among the clean. For if the priest had not corroborated it, he would have remained outside the camp among the unclean.

Jesus did not imply that showing the healing to the priest was something he needed. Rather, he temporarily remits him to the law. This stopped every mouth. He did this lest others might claim that Jesus had arrogated to himself the priest’s honor. He performed the miracle himself, yet he entrusted its examination to the authorities and caused them to sit as judges of his own miracles. He was saying in effect: “I am so far from struggling against Moses or the priests that I even guide those cleansed to submit themselves to the priests.”

What is meant by “a proof to the people”? It was for their reproof, or as a demonstration or for accusation if they should prove fickle. For since the religious professionals would call him a deceiver and imposter and persecute him as an adversary of God and transgressor of the law, he was prepared to say, “You shall bear witness to me that I am not a transgressor of the law.”
