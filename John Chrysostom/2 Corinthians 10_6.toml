Paul says that he will punish those who deserve it in due course, but first he wants to make sure that the Corinthians have been properly counseled. He sees that his people are mixed up with strangers. He wants them to withdraw from them first, before admonishing the latter. This is yet another sign of his great pastoral skill.
