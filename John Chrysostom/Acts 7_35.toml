This is very suitable to the matter in hand. "This Moses," he says. "This," the man who had been in danger of losing his life; the man who had been set at naught by them; "this" the man whom they had declined: "this" same, God having raised up, sent unto them. "Whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler?" just as they themselves (the hearers) said, "We have no king, but Caesar." He here shows also, that what was then done, was done by Christ. "The same did God send by the hand of the Angel," who said unto him, "I am the God of Abraham."

Marvel not, he says, if they on whom Christ confers His benefits refuse His kingdom, seeing in the case of Moses it was just the same. "He brought them out;" and rescued them not in a general way, but also while they were in the wilderness. Do you mark that they themselves (Stephen's hearers) are concerned in those old miracles also? "This is that Moses:" he, that conversed with God; he, that had been saved out of situations so strange and wonderful; he, that wrought so great works, and had so great power.
