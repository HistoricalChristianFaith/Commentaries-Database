"For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, which made silver temples of Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen." "Which made," it says, "silver temples of Diana." And how is it possible that temples could be made of silver? Perhaps as small boxes. Great was the honor paid to this Diana in Ephesus; since, when their temple was burnt it so grieved them, that they forbade even the name of the incendiary ever to be mentioned. See how, wherever there is idolatry, in every case we find money at the bottom of it. Both in the former instance it was for money, and in the case of this man, for money. It was not for their religion, because they thought that in danger; no, it was for their lucrative craft, that it would have nothing to work upon.
