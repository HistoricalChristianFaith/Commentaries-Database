Which made, it says, silver temples of Diana. And how is it possible that temples could be made of silver? Perhaps as small boxes (κιβώρια.) Great was the honor paid to this (Diana) in Ephesus; since, when (Hom. in Eph. Prol.) their temple was burnt it so grieved them, that they forbade even the name of the incendiary ever to be mentioned. See how, wherever there is idolatry, in every case we find money at the bottom of it. Both in the former instance it was for money, and in the case of this man, for money.
