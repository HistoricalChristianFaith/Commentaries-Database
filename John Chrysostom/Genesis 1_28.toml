So, after saying “male and female he made them” as though to bestow a blessing on each of them, he goes on, “God blessed them in the words, ‘Increase and multiply, fill the earth and gain dominion over it, and have control of the fish of the sea.’ ” Behold the remarkable character of the blessing! I mean, those words, “increase and multiply and fill the earth,” anyone could see are said of the brute beasts and the reptiles alike, whereas “gain dominion and have control” are directed to the man and woman. See the Lord’s loving kindness: even before creating them, he makes them share in this control and bestows on them the blessing. “Have control” the text says, “of the fish of the sea, the birds of heaven and all the cattle, the whole earth and all the reptiles creeping on the earth.” Did you notice the definitive character of this authority? Did you notice all created things placed under the control of this particular being? So no longer entertain casual impressions of this rational being but rather realize the extent of the esteem and the Lord’s magnanimity toward it and be amazed at his love beyond all telling.
