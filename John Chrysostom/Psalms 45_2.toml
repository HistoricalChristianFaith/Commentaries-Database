How, then, does another inspired author say, “We saw him: he had no form or beauty; instead, his form was dishonorable, of no importance beside human beings.” He is not speaking about deformity—God forbid—but about an object of scorn. You see, once having deigned to become human, he went through every demeaning experience, not choosing a queen for his mother, not placed in a bed of gold at the time of swaddling clothes but in a manger, not reared in an affluent home but in an artisan’s humble dwelling. Again, when he picked disciples, he did not pick orators and philosophers and kings but fishermen and tax collectors. He shared this simple life, not owning a house, or clad in rich clothing or enjoying similar fare, but nourished at others’ expense, insulted, scorned, driven out, pursued. Now, he did this to trample underfoot human conceit in fine style. So, since he did not fit himself out in any pomp or circumstance or attach to himself hangers on or bodyguards, but went about at times alone, like any ordinary person, thus that author said, “We saw him, and he had no form or beauty,” whereas the psalmist says, “Comely to behold beyond all human beings,” suggesting grace, wisdom, teaching, miracles. Then to underline the comeliness he says, “Grace streamed out on your lips.”
