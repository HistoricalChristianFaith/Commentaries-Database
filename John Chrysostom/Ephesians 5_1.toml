You are called to imitate God, to become like God. This can happen when you are reconciled with him.… Paul then adds another splendid incentive: You are to act “as beloved children.” He is saying, in effect: “You have another reason for imitating him, not only to receive good but also to be fittingly called his own children.” … Not all children imitate their father, but those who know themselves to be beloved act like “beloved children.
