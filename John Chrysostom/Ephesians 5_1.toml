That you may not then think it an act of necessity, hear how He says, that He gave Himself up. As your Master loved you, love thou your friend. Nay, but neither will you be able so to love; yet still do so as far as you are able. Oh, what can be more blessed than a sound like this! Tell me of royalty or whatever else you will, there is no comparison. Forgive another, and you are imitating God, you are made like God. It is more our duty to forgive trespasses than debts of money; for if you forgive debts, you have not imitated God; whereas if you shall forgive trespasses, you are imitating God. And yet how shall you be able to say, I am poor, and am not able to forgive it, that is, a debt, when you forgive not that which you are able to forgive, that is, a trespass? And surely thou dost not deem that in this case there is any loss. Yea, is it not rather wealth, is it not abundance, is it not a plentiful store?

And behold yet another and a nobler incitement: — as beloved children, says he. You have yet another cogent reason to imitate Him, not only in that you have received such good at His hands, but also in that you are called His children. And since not all children imitate their fathers, but those which are beloved, therefore he says, as beloved children.

You are called to imitate God, to become like God. This can happen when you are reconciled with him.… Paul then adds another splendid incentive: You are to act “as beloved children.” He is saying, in effect: “You have another reason for imitating him, not only to receive good but also to be fittingly called his own children.” … Not all children imitate their father, but those who know themselves to be beloved act like “beloved children.
