For Timothy, Scripture says, “was the son of a certain woman which was a Jewess, and believed.” How a Jewess? How believing? Because she was not of the Gentiles, “but on account of his father, who was a Greek, and of the Jews that were in those quarters, he took and circumcised him.” Thus, as these mixtures of Jews and Gentiles took place, the law began gradually to be dissolved.

Great was the grace of Timothy. When Barnabas departed, Paul found another equivalent to him. Of him he says, “Remembering your tears and your unfeigned faith, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois and in thy mother Eunice.” His father continued to be a Gentile.

For the praises of our ancestors, when we share in them, redound also to us. Otherwise, they avail nothing but rather condemn us.
