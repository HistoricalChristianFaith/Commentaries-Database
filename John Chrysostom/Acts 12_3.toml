For their own part, they now in consequence of Gamaliel's advice, abstained from bloodshedding: and besides, did not even invent accusations; but by means of others they compassed the same results. (c) This (counsel of Gamaliel's) above all was their condemnation: for the preaching was shown to be no longer a thing of men. He proceeded further to kill Peter also. ch. 5:8 In very deed was that fulfilled, We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 44:13 Seeing, it says, it was a pleasing thing to the Jews. Romans 8:36 A pleasing thing, bloodshed, and unrighteous bloodshed, wickedness, impiety! He ministered to their senseless (ἀ τόποις) lusts: for, whereas he ought to have done the contrary, to check their rage, he made them more eager, as if he were an executioner, and not a physician to their diseased minds. (And this) though he had numberless warnings in the case of both his grandfather and his father Herod, how the former in consequence of his putting the children to death suffered the greatest calamities, and the latter by slaying John raised up against himself a grievous war.

How was it that he did not kill Peter immediately? It mentions the reason, “it was the day of unleavened bread.” The more likely reason is that he wanted to make a spectacle of the slaughter. For their part, the Jews, following the advice of Gamaliel, now abstained from bloodshedding (besides, they did not even try to invent accusations), but by the hands of others they achieved the same results.… This, in particular, was their condemnation; for the preaching was shown to be no longer a thing of humankind.
