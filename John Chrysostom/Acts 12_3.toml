How was it that he did not kill Peter immediately? It mentions the reason, “it was the day of unleavened bread.” The more likely reason is that he wanted to make a spectacle of the slaughter. For their part, the Jews, following the advice of Gamaliel, now abstained from bloodshedding (besides, they did not even try to invent accusations), but by the hands of others they achieved the same results.… This, in particular, was their condemnation; for the preaching was shown to be no longer a thing of humankind.
