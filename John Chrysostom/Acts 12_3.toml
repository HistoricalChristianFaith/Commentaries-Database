And when he saw that it pleased the Jews. O excessive wickedness! On whose behalf was it, that he gratified them by doing murders thus without plan or reason? "And it was the day of unleavened bread." Again, the idle preciseness of the Jews: to kill indeed they forbade not, but at such a time they did such things!

And how was it he did not kill Peter immediately? It mentions the reason: "it was the day of unleavened bread:" and he wished rather to make a display with the killing of him. "And when he saw it pleased the Jews." For their own part, they now in consequence of Gamaliel's advice, abstained from bloodshedding: and besides, did not even invent accusations; but by means of others they compassed the same results. This counsel of Gamaliel's above all was their condemnation: for the preaching was shown to be no longer a thing of men. "He proceeded further to kill Peter also." In very deed was that fulfilled, "We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter." "Seeing," it says, "it was a pleasing thing to the Jews." A pleasing thing, bloodshed, and unrighteous bloodshed, wickedness, impiety! He ministered to their senseless lusts: for, whereas he ought to have done the contrary, to check their rage, he made them more eager, as if he were an executioner, and not a physician to their diseased minds.
