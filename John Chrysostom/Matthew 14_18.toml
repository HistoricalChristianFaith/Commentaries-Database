They continuing therefore to crawl on the ground, then at length He brings in His own part, and says, Bring them hither to me. For although the place be desert, yet He that feeds the world is here; and although the time be now past, yet He that is not subject to time is discoursing with you.

But John says also, that they were barley loaves, John 6:9 not mentioning it without object, but teaching us to trample under foot the pride of costly living. Such was the diet of the prophets also.

Finally he said to them, “Bring them here to me.” Although this was a deserted place, he that is here is ready to feed the world. The one who is speaking to you is not subject to time, even though “the day is now over.”In John’s Gospel it is further related that these were loaves of barley. This is not mentioned accidentally but with the object of teaching us to trample under foot13 the pride of costly living. Such was also the diet of the prophets.
