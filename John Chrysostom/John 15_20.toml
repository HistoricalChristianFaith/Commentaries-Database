He showed that in this point they would be his most ardent imitators. For while Christ was in the flesh, people made war against him, but when he was translated [to heaven], the battle next came on them. Then because they were so few, they were terrified at being about to encounter the attack of so great a multitude. And so he raises their souls by telling them that it was a special subject of joy that they were hated by them, “For you shall share my sufferings. You should not therefore be troubled, for you are not better than I.” As I told you before, “The servant is not greater than his lord.” Then there is also a third source of consolation, that the Father also is insulted together with them.
