How did they keep Your word? By believing in Me, and giving no heed to the Jews. For he that believes in Him, it says, 'has set  to his seal that God is true.' John 3:33 Some read, Now I know that all things whatsoever You have given Me are of You. But this would have no reason; for how would the Son be ignorant of the things of the Father? No the words are spoken of the disciples. From the time, He says, that I told them these things, they have learned that all that You have given Me is from You; nothing is alien, nothing peculiar to Me, with You.  (For whatever is peculiar, puts most things in the condition of being alien.  They therefore have known that all things, whatsoever I teach, are Your doctrines and teachings. And whence have they learned it? From My words;  for so have I taught them. And not only this have I taught them, but also that I came out from You. For this He was anxious to prove through all the Gospel.
