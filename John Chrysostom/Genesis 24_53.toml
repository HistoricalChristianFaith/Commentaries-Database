Learning now that he had the desired end in view, “he brought out presents of silver and gold and clothing and gave them to Rebekah.” Then he waited on her with confidence, as though she were already betrothed in word to Isaac. He presented her brother and mother with gifts, and, when he saw the matter had worked out in accord with his master’s command, only then was his own refreshment seen to. “They ate and drank,” the text says, remember, “he and the men who were with him, and he slept there the night. Rising the next morning he said, ‘Allow me to go that I may return to my master.’ ” Since everything has worked out well in this way from my point of view, he is saying, and, instead of anything being now left undone, since it also appeared satisfactory to you, “allow me to go that I may return to my master.”

Why do you hesitate and delay, he is saying, if God makes everything so easy for me?… Observe how even these men in their ignorance suggest to the maid what is going to happen, with God directing their minds to it. You see, they foretell to her both facts, that she would become countless thousands and that her offspring would take possession of the cities of their enemies. Do you see God’s providence emerging clearly in every situation, and how the Lord of all arranges for the future to be foretold even by nonbelievers?
