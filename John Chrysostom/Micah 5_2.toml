It was another prophet, again, who pointed out the place where he would be born. For Micah said, “And you, Bethlehem, the land of Judah, are by no means the least among the princes of Judah. For out of you will come the leader who will shepherd my people, Israel: and his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of eternity.” He revealed his existence before all ages. When he said “there will come the leader who will shepherd my people, Israel,” he revealed Christ’s birth in the flesh.
