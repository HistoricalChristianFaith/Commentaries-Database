It is not simply, spiritual men, but, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, for it needed very great superiority of mind (φιλοσοφίας) to bear the complainings of widows. For what profits it, that the dispenser of alms steal not, if nevertheless he waste all, or be harsh and easily provoked? And they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost.

Now when Matthias was to be presented, it was said, “It must be someone who has been with us the whole time.” But not so here, since this was different. No longer did they put it to the lot, and although they could have made the choice themselves, moved as they were by the Spirit, they wanted the testimony of the people. Determining the number, ordaining the chosen and other such business rested with them, but the choice itself they entrusted to the people, so as not to give the appearance of showing favor. For even God entrusted it to Moses to choose as elders the men he knew.
