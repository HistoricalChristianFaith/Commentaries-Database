This perseverance is to be attributed to Godâ€™s loving kindness, for not only do we not sink down under the weight of all our trials, but we even rejoice and speak boldly.

Therefore seeing we have this ministry, even as we obtained mercy we faint not, but we have renounced the hidden things of shame.

Seeing he had uttered great things and had set himself and all the faithful before Moses, aware of the height and greatness of what he had said, observe how he moderates his tone again. For it was necessary on account of the false Apostles to exalt his hearers also, and again to calm down that swelling; yet not to do it away, since this would be a trifler's part. Wherefore he manages this in another manner, by showing that not of their own merits was it, but all of the loving-kindness of God. Wherefore also he says, Therefore seeing we have this ministry. For nothing more did we contribute, except that we became ministers, and made ourselves subservient to the things given by God. Wherefore he said not 'largess ,' nor 'supply ,' but 'ministry.' Nor was he contented with this even, but added, as we obtained mercy. For even this itself, he says, the ministering to these things, is of mercy and loving-kindness. Yet it is mercy's to deliver from evils, not to give so many good things besides: but the mercy of God includes this also.

We faint not. And this indeed is to be imputed to His loving-kindness. For the clause, as we obtained mercy, take to be said with reference both to the ministry, and to the words, we faint not.  And observe how earnestly he endeavors to lower his own things. 'For,' says he, 'that one who has been counted worthy of such and so great things, and this from mercy only and loving-kindness, should show forth such labors, and undergo dangers, and endure temptations, is no great matter. Therefore we not only do not sink down, but we even rejoice and speak boldly.' For instance, having said, we faint not, he added,

2 Corinthians 4:2. But we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.

And what are the hidden things of shame? We do not, he says, profess and promise great things, and in our actions show other things, as they do; wherefore also he said, You look on things after the outward appearance; but such we are as we appear, not having any duplicity, nor saying and doing such things as we ought to hide and veil over with shame and blushes. And to interpret this, he added, not walking in craftiness. For what they considered to be praise, that he proves to be shameful and worthy of scorn. But what is, in craftiness? They had the reputation of taking nothing,, but they took and kept it secret; they had the character of saints and approved Apostles, but they were full of numberless evil things. But, says he, we have renounced these things: (for these are what he also calls the hidden things of shame; being such as we appear to be, and keeping nothing veiled over. And that not in this [our] life only, but also in the Preaching itself. For this is, nor handling the word of God deceitfully.

But by the manifestation of the truth.

Not by the countenance and the outward show, but by the very proof of our actions.

Commending ourselves to every man's conscience.

For not to believers only, but also to unbelievers, we are manifest; lying open unto all that they may test our actions, as they may choose; and by this we commend ourselves, not by acting a part and carrying about a specious mask. We say then, that we take nothing, and we call you for witnesses; we say that we are conscious of no wickedness, and of this again we derive the testimony from you, not as they (sc. false Apostles) who, veiling over their things, deceive many. But we both set forth our life before all men; and we lay bare the Preaching, so that all comprehend it.

2. Then because the unbelievers knew not its power, he added, this is no fault of ours, but of their own insensibility.
