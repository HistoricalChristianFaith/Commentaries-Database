He says here, “I must reveal myself and do those things that may show that I do the same things with the Father”—not things “similar” but “the same.” This is an expression that marks greater invariability and that is used of those who do not differ even a little. Who then, after this, will face him when he sees that he had the same power with the Father? For not only did he form or open eyes; he also gave the gift of sight. This is proof that he also breathed in the soul. If that [soul] did not work, the eye, though perfected, could never see anything. He gave both the energy, which is from the soul, and gave the member also, possessing all things, both arteries and nerves and veins, and all things of which our body is composed.

“While it is day” means I must work while people can still believe on me as long as this life lasts. “The night comes,” that is, the future, “when no one can work.” He did not say, “when I cannot work” but “when no one can work,” that is, when there is no longer faith, labors or repentance. For to show that he called faith a “work,” … he replied, “This is the work of God, that you believe on him whom he has sent.” Why then can no one do this kind of work in the future world? Because there is no faith there, but all, whether willingly or unwillingly, will simply submit.
