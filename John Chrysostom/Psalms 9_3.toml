Now, notice how he proclaims God’s strength: “They will lose heart and perish before your face.” Once more, on hearing “face,” do not form an impression of anything bodily. At this point, in fact, he is suggesting God’s power, his manifestation, the facility of his strength. Just as he says elsewhere, “He gazes on the earth and makes it tremble,” so here too he says the same thing. His gaze, you see, is sufficient to destroy his enemies.
