Many, I know, respect the Jews and think that their present way of life is a venerable one. This is why I hasten to uproot and tear out this deadly opinion. I said that the synagogue is no better than a theater, and I bring forward a prophet as my witness. Surely the Jews are not more deserving of belief than their prophets. “You had a harlot’s brow; you became shameless before all.” Where a harlot has set herself up, that place is a brothel and a theater; it also is a den of robbers and a lodging for wild beasts. Jeremiah said, “Your house has become for me the den of a hyena.” He does not simply say “of a wild beast” but “of a filthy wild beast,” and again, “I have abandoned my house, I have cast off my inheritance.” But when God forsakes a place, that place becomes the dwelling of demons.
