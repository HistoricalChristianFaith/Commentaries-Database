Ver. 18. "But I have all things and abound," i.e. through this gift you have filled up what was wanting, which would make them more eager. For benefactors, the wiser they are, the more do they seek gratitude from the benefited. That is, you have not only filled up what was deficient in former time, but you have gone beyond. For lest by these words he should seem to accuse them, see how he seals up all. After he had said, "Not that I seek for the gift," and "Now at length"; and had shown that their deed was a debt, for this is meant by, "I have all," then again he shows, that they had acted above what was due, and says, "I have all things and abound, I am filled." I say not this at hazard, or only from the feeling of my mind, but why? "Having received of Epaphroditus the things that came from you, an odor of a sweet smell; a sacrifice acceptable, well pleasing to God." Lo, whither he has raised their gift; not I, he says, received, but God through me. Wherefore though I be not in need, regard it not, for God had no need, and He received at their hands in such sort, that the Holy Scriptures shrunk not from saying, "God smelled a sweet savor" [Genesis 8:21], which denotes one who was pleased. For you know, indeed ye know, how our soul is affected by sweet savors, how it is pleased, how it is delighted. The Scriptures therefore shrunk not from applying to God a word so human, and so lowly, that it might show to men that their gifts have become acceptable. For not the fat, not the smoke, made them acceptable, but the purpose of mind which offered them. Had it been otherwise, Cain's offering too had been received. It says then, that He is even pleased, and how He is pleased. For men could not without this have learned. He then, who has no need, says that He is thus pleased, that they may not become remiss by the absence of need. And afterward, when they had no care for other virtues, and trusted to their offerings alone, behold, how again he sets them right by saying, "Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?" [Psalm 50:13] This Paul also says. "Not that I seek," says he, "for the gift."

“You have made my life overflow through your giving,” he says in effect. This was the distinctive mark of these people who were so very zealous. For the more philosophical the benefactors are, the more they are likely to seek thanks from their beneficiaries. On the contrary, Paul tells the Philippians that they have not only filled him up in what was lacking in the past but have exceeded all expectation.

“It is not I,” he says, “who have received but God through me. So I personally have no need of your gifts. Let this not concern you. And God himself has no need either. Yet he accepts these gifts.” … It is not the incense or the smoke that makes an acceptable offering but the will of the one who offers.
