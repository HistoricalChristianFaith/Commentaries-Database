And the day following Paul went in with us unto James: and all the elders were present. And when he had saluted them, he declared particularly what things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.

This was the Bishop of Jerusalem; and to him (Paul) is sent on an earlier occasion. This (James) was brother of the Lord; a great and admirable man. (To him, it says,) Paul entered in with us. Mark the (Bishop's) unassuming behavior: and the elders (were present). Again Paul relates to them the things relating to the Gentiles, not indulging in vainglory, God forbid, but wishing to show forth the mercy of God, and to fill them with great joy. Acts 15 See accordingly: when they heard it, it says, they glorified God,— not praised nor admired Paul: for in such wise had he narrated, as referring all to Him— and said unto him, You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are which believed. Observe with what modest deference they too speak: they said to him: not (James) as Bishop discourses authoritatively, but they take Paul as partner with them in their view; You see, brother: as though immediately and at the outset apologizing for themselves, and saying, We did not wish this. Do you see the necessity of the thing? 'how many thousands,' say they, 'of Jews there are which' have come together. And they say not, how many thousands we have made catechumens, but, there are. And these, say they, are all zealous for the law.

Again Paul describes to them in detail the things relating to the Gentiles. He does this not to indulge in vainglory, God forbid, but because he wishes to show the mercy of God and fill them with great joy. Look at the result: “When they heard it, they glorified God.” It was not upon Paul that they bestowed their praise and admiration. For he described everything in such a way as to refer it all to [God].
