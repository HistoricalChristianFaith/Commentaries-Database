Again Paul describes to them in detail the things relating to the Gentiles. He does this not to indulge in vainglory, God forbid, but because he wishes to show the mercy of God and fill them with great joy. Look at the result: “When they heard it, they glorified God.” It was not upon Paul that they bestowed their praise and admiration. For he described everything in such a way as to refer it all to [God].
