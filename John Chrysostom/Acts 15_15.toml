Not simply, Chose, but, for His Name, that is for His glory. His Name is not shamed by the taking (προλήψει) the Gentiles first, but it is even a greater glory.— Here some even great thing is hinted at: that these are chosen before all. After this I will return, and rebuild the tabernacle of David which is fallen down.

And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Men and brethren, hearken unto me: Symeon has declared how God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name. And to this agree the words of the prophets.

This (James) was bishop, as they say, and therefore he speaks last, and herein is fulfilled that saying, In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established. Deuteronomy 17:6; Matthew 18:16 But observe the discretion shown by him also, in making his argument good from the prophets, both new and old. For he had no acts of his own to declare, as Peter had and Paul. And indeed it is wisely ordered that this (the active) part is assigned to those, as not intended to be locally fixed in Jerusalem, whereas (James) here, who performs the part of teacher, is no way responsible for what has been done, while however he is not divided from them in opinion. (b) Men and brethren, he says, hearken unto me. Great is the moderation of the man. His also is a more complete oration, as indeed it puts the completion to the matter under discussion. (a) Symeon, he says, declared: (namely,) in Luke, in that he prophesied, Which You have prepared before the face of all nations, a light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of Your people Israel. (c) How God at the first did visit the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for His Name. Luke 2:25 Then, since that (witness), though from the time indeed he was manifest, yet had not authority by reason of his not being ancient, therefore he produces ancient prophecy also, saying, And to this agree the words of the Prophets, as it is written: After this I wilt return, and will build again the tabernacle of David which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up.
