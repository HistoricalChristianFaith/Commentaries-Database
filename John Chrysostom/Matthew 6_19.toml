Previously he had only said that we must show mercy. Here he also points out how great is the mercy we must show. He says, “Don’t store up treasure.” It would have been impossible to introduce his discourse on disdain for riches without much preparation. So he broke the discourse up into small portions. Having readied the hearer’s mind, he brings up the tougher subject in a way that is plausible.
