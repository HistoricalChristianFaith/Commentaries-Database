The Evangelist does not say what his teaching is. That it was very wonderful, however, is shown by its effect even on those who had accused him of deceiving the people, those who turned round and began to admire him. And the Jews marveled, saying, “How is this man so learned when he has never been instructed?” See how perverse they are even in their admiration. It is not his doctrine they admire, but another thing altogether.

Their wonder might have led them to infer that our Lord became possessed of this learning in some divine way and not by any human process. But they would not acknowledge this and contented themselves with wondering. So our Lord repeated it to them when he answered them and said, “My doctrine is not mine, but his that sent me.”
