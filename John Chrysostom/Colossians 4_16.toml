And when this Epistle has been read among you, cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans. I suppose there are some of the things therein written, which it was needful that those also should hear. And they would have the greater advantage of recognizing their own errors in the charges brought against others.

And that you also read the Epistle from Laodicea. Some say that this is not Paul's to them, but theirs to Paul, for he said not that to the Laodiceans, but that written from Laodicea.
