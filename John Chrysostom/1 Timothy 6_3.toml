Presumption therefore arises not from knowledge but from “knowing nothing.” For he that knows the doctrine of godliness is also the most disposed to moderation. He who knows sound words is not unsound. For what inflammation is to the body, pride is to the soul. And as we do not in the first case say that the inflamed part is healthy, so neither do we say of the soul that the arrogant part is healthy. It is possible then to be knowing and yet to know nothing.

If any man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which is according to godliness, he is proud, knowing nothing. Presumption therefore arises not from knowledge, but from knowing nothing. For he that knows the doctrines of godliness is also the most disposed to moderation. He who knows sound words, is not unsound. For what inflammation is in the body, that pride is in the soul. And as we do not in the first case say that the inflamed part is sound, so neither do we here consider the arrogant. It is possible then to be knowing, and yet to know nothing. For he that knows not what he ought to know, knows nothing. And that pride arises from knowing nothing is manifest from hence. Christ made Himself of no reputation Philippians 2:7, he therefore who knows this will not be high-minded. Man has nothing except from God, therefore he will not be high-minded. For what have you that thou did not receive? 1 Corinthians 4:7 He washed the feet of His disciples, how can he who knows this be setting himself up? Therefore He says, When you have done all, say we are unprofitable servants. Luke 17:10 The publican was accepted only from his humility, the Pharisee perished by his boastfulness. He who is puffed up knows none of these things. Again, Christ Himself says, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why do you smite me? John 18:23
