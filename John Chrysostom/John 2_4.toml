We know from the Gospel of St. Luke that Jesus greatly honored his mother since he tells us that Jesus was subject to his parents. … For where parents throw no obstacle in the way of God’s commands, it is our duty to be subject to them. But when they demand anything at an unseasonable time or cut us off from spiritual things, we should not be deceived into compliance.
