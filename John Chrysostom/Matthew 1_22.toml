Having established Joseph’s faith by all means—by past expectations, by future hopes, by present grace and by the honor given to himself—the angel then rings in the prophet also to give expression in support of all these, proclaiming beforehand the good things that are to occur to the world through the Son: Sins are removed and done away. “For he will save his people from their sins.” Here again the coming event exceeds all human expectation. From what are the people being saved? Not from visible warfare or barbarians but something far greater: from their own sins, a work that had never been possible to anyone before.

To make what he said easier to understand, the angel makes reference to Isaiah, and not to Isaiah only but to God who speaks through Isaiah. For he does not refer this saying to Isaiah as such but to the God of all. Hence he did not say simply that “All this took place to fulfill what was spoken by Isaiah” but “All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet.” The mouth indeed was Isaiah’s, but the oracle was wafted from above.
