“For to what angel did God ever say, ‘You are my Son, today I have begotten you’? Or again, ‘I will be to him a father, and he shall be a son to me’ ”? For these things indeed are spoken with reference also to the flesh.… So also the word today seems to me to be spoken here with reference to the flesh. For when he has taken hold of it, he then speaks out boldly about everything. For indeed the flesh partakes of the high things, just as the Godhead partakes of the lowly. For he who did not disdain to become human and did not decline the reality, how should he have declined the expressions?Seeing then that we know these things, let us be ashamed of nothing, nor have any high thoughts. For if he himself, being God and Lord and Son of God, did not decline to take the form of a slave, much more ought we to do all things, though they be lowly. For tell me, oh human, from where come your high thoughts? From things of this life? But these, as ever they appear, run by. Or from things spiritual? No, this is itself one spiritual essential: to have no high thoughts.

Our Lord Jesus Christ calls his coming in the flesh an exodus [or going out], as when he says, “The sower went out to sow.” And again, “I came from the Father and have come into the world.” And in many places one may see this. But Paul calls it a “coming in [or eisodus],” saying, “And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world,” meaning by this “bringing in” his taking flesh.Now why has he so used the expression? The things signified are manifest.… For Christ indeed calls it a “going out” justly, for we were out from God. For as in royal palaces, prisoners and those who have offended the king stand without, and he who desires to reconcile them does not bring them in but, himself going out, discourses with them until, having made them ready for the king’s presence, he may bring them in, so also Christ has done. Having gone out to us—that is, having taken flesh—and having talked with us of the king’s matters, so he brought us in, having purged the sins and made reconciliation. Therefore he calls it a “going out.” But Paul names it a “coming in,” from the metaphor of those who come into an inheritance and receive any portion or possession. For the saying, “and again, when he brings the firstborn into the world,” means “when he puts the world into his hand.” For when he was made known, then also he obtained possession of the whole of it. He says these things not concerning God the Word but concerning that which is according to the flesh. For if, according to John, “He was in the world, and the world came into being through him,” how is he “brought in,” other than in the flesh?

Lest upon hearing the words “and when he brings the firstborn into the world” you should think of it as a gift afterwards superadded to him, the apostle both corrected this beforehand and again further corrects, saying, “in the beginning.” Not now, but from the first. See again how he strikes both Paul of Samosata and Arius a mortal blow, applying to the Son the things which relate to the Father. He has also intimated another thing, by the way, greater even than this. For surely he has incidentally pointed out as well the transfiguration of the world, saying, “they will all grow old like a garment; like a mantle you will roll them up, and they will be changed.” That he also says in the Epistle to the Romans, that he shall transfigure the world. And showing the facility thereof, he adds, as if a person should roll up a garment, so shall he both roll up and change it. But if he with so much ease works the transfiguration and the creation to what is better and more perfect, did he need another for the inferior creation? How far does your shamelessness go? Surely it is a very great consolation to know that things will not be as they are, but they all shall receive change, and all shall be altered; but he himself remains ever existing and living without end, “and your years,” he says, “will never end.”
