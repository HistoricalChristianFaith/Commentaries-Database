"And the saying pleased the whole multitude." This too was worthy of their wisdom. All approved of what was said so sensible was it. "And they chose," it says (again it is the people that choose,) "Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Ghost, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch." And in this regard Philip also was admirable: for it is of him that the writer says: "And we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist, which was one of the seven; and abode with him."
