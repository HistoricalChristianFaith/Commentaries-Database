"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now." "Therefore it is expedient for you that I depart, if ye then will bear them when I departed." "And what hath come to pass? the Spirit greater than Thou, that now indeed we bear not, but It will fit us to bear? Is It working more powerful and more perfect?" "Not so; for He too shall speak My words."

(Hom. lxxviii) Having said then, Ye cannot bear them now, but then ye shall be able, and, The Holy Spirit shall lead you into all truth; lest this should make them suppose that the Holy Spirit was the superior, He adds, For He shall not speak of Himself but whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.
