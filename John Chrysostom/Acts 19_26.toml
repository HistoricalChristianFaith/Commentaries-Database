He overturns, says he, our craft: (e) From this work we have our wealth. Hath persuaded. How did he persuade— he, a man of mean consideration? How prevail over so great a force of habit? By doing what— by saying what? It is not for a Paul (to effect this), it is not for a man. Even this is enough, that he said, They are no gods. Now if the impiety (of the heathen religions) was so easy to detect, it ought to have been condemned long ago: if it was strong, it ought not to have been overthrown so quickly. (b) For, lest they should consider within themselves (how strange), that a human being should have such power as this, and if a human being has power to effect such things, why then one ought to be persuaded by that man, he adds: (f) not only is this our craft in danger to be set at naught, but also, as if forsooth alleging a greater consideration, the temple of the great goddess Diana, etc. (c) whom all Asia and the world worships.

Do you see how he demonstrated that Paul’s power was the greater and revealed all their gods to be miserable wretches, since a mere human, persecuted and only a tentmaker, had so much power? See how the enemies bore witness to the apostles. Earlier they said, “You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” Here, “Artemis may be deposed from her magnificence.” Earlier, the men “who had turned the world upside down” heard, “They have come here also.” Here, “There is danger that this trade of ours may come into disrepute.” So said the Jews with regard to Christ, “You see how the world is going after him,” and, “The Romans shall come and take away our city.”
