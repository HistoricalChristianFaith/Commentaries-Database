Do you see how he demonstrated that Paul’s power was the greater and revealed all their gods to be miserable wretches, since a mere human, persecuted and only a tentmaker, had so much power? See how the enemies bore witness to the apostles. Earlier they said, “You have filled Jerusalem with your teaching.” Here, “Artemis may be deposed from her magnificence.” Earlier, the men “who had turned the world upside down” heard, “They have come here also.” Here, “There is danger that this trade of ours may come into disrepute.” So said the Jews with regard to Christ, “You see how the world is going after him,” and, “The Romans shall come and take away our city.”
