He did not say, note, “My armies have proved your refuge, or money or ramparts”; instead, “the Lord has proved a refuge for the poor.” He personally established me in safety, he is saying; nothing, in fact, is equal to that refuge on the score of ease and security. The other refuges may be subject to scheming and cannot be found promptly and readily, but they are obstructed by time and place and countless circumstances; this, by contrast, you find close at hand, provided only you search for it diligently. “Even while I am talking to you, lo, I am at hand,” remember; and “I am a God close by, not a God far off.”  Consequently, there is no need of running around or traveling about; rather, those sitting at home can gain this refuge.
