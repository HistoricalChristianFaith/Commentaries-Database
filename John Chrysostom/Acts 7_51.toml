“You always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you.” When it was not his will that there should be sacrifices, you sacrificed; and when it is his will, you do not sacrifice. When he would not give you the commandments, you dragged them toward you; when you received them, you neglected them. Again, when the temple stood, you worshiped idols; and when it is his will to be worshiped without a temple, you do the opposite.
