What is the meaning of “my horn”? Scripture frequently employs this phrase, remember, as when it says, “His horn was exalted” and “The horn of his anointed was exalted.” So what on earth does “horn” mean? Force, glory, prominence, using a metaphor from the brute beasts: God implanted in them only the horn by way of glory and weaponry, and if they lose it, they lose most of their force; and like a soldier without weapons a bull without horns is also easily disposed of. So by this the woman means nothing other than this, my glory is exalted. How is it exalted? “In my God,” she says. Hence the exaltation is also secure, having a firm and permanent root: while glory from human beings corresponds to the baseness of those glorifying, and so is very liable to disappear, God’s glory is not like that, remaining forever permanent. - "Homilies on Hannah 4"
