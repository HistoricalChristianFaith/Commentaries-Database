“I put on righteousness,” he says. There are people who occupy higher positions than others but who often commit injustice. But this is not the case with Job, because he constantly lived in the greatest righteousness. So, when with regard to God you hear that “he is clothed with righteousness,” do not believe that real garments clothe incorporeal beings. Job did not wear that kind of garment either. “And I clothed myself with judgment like a double mantle.” That was my elegance. To be sure, others are unhappy with that activity; they find it unpleasant and heavy. But I did not, he says. As one is proud of a double mantle, so I was constantly glorified … in that activity. But who appointed him to be a judge? He became one by himself, thanks to his virtue, like Moses.
