"And on the morrow, as they journeyed, and drew nigh to the city" - observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, He causes this to take place - "Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray": that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber.

"And as they went on their journey, and drew nigh to the city": in order that Peter should not be in perplexity too long. "Peter went up upon the housetop," etc. Observe, that not even his hunger forced him to have recourse to the sheet.
