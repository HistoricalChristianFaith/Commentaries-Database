"But the Jews stirred up the devout and honorable women, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their coasts." "The devout women," instead of the proselyte-women. They did not stop at "envy," but added deeds also. Do you see what they effected by their opposing the preaching? to what dishonor they brought these "honorable women"?

"But the Jews stirred up the devout women, and raised persecution" - observe even of what is done by the women, they are the authors - "and cast them," it says, "out of their coasts," not from the city merely.
