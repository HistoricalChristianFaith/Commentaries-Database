Our Lord Jesus Christ came on this account, too, that we might see not only his glory here but also the glory to come. Therefore he said, “I will that where I am they also may be, in order that they may behold my glory.” Now, if this glory here has been so bright and splendid, what could one say of that other? It will not appear on this corrupt earth or while we are in our perishable bodies but in that immortal and everlasting creation, and with so much brightness that it is impossible to put it into words. Oh, blessed, and thrice-blessed, and blessed many times over, they who are deemed worthy to become beholders of that glory! With reference to it the prophet says, “Away with the impious, that he may not behold the glory of the Lord.”
