The sharp contention took place with good reason, to teach Mark a lesson and so that the matter should not look like stage playing. For would he, who had always yielded, not yield on this occasion? He who loved Paul so much that he sought him in Tarsus, brought him to the apostles, undertook the alms in common with him and received the business relating to the decree together with him? [Barnabas] would not have become angry for something like this. No, they parted from each other so that they might educate and bring to perfection those who needed their teaching.
