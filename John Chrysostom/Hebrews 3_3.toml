"For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses," (Again he is speaking of the Flesh), "inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honor than the house"; Moses himself also (he means) was of the house. Moreover he did not say, For this one was a servant, but the Other a master, but he covertly intimated it. If the people were the house and he was of the people, then he certainly was of the household. For so also we are accustomed to say, such an one is of such an one's house. For here he is speaking of a house, not of the temple, for the temple was not constructed by God, but by men. But He that made him is God. Moses he means. And see how he covertly shows the superiority. "Faithful," he says, "in all His house," being himself also of the house, that is, of the people. The builder has more honor than the house, yet he did not say "the artificer hath more honor than his works," but "he that hath builded the house, than the house."
