Let us mourn with Nahum and let us say with him, “Woe to him that builds up this house [by injustice].” Or rather let us mourn for them as Christ did in his day, when he said, “Woe to you rich, for you are now having your reward and your comfort.” Let us not, I beseech you, cease mourning in this way, and if it is not unbecoming, let us also bewail the apathy of our brothers. Let us not weep loudly for him who is already dead, but let us weep for the robber, the grasping, miserly, greedy man.
