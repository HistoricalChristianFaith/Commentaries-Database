For not the bodies only but also the very sepulchers of the saints have been filled with spiritual grace. For if in the case of Elisha this happened, and a corpse, when it touched the sepulcher, burst the bands of death and returned to life again, much rather now, when grace is more abundant, when the energy of the spirit is greater, is it possible that one touching a sepulcher, with faith, should win great power. On this account God allowed us the remains of the saints, wishing to lead us by them to the same emulation and to afford us a kind of haven and a secure consolation for the evils that are ever overtaking us. Therefore I beseech you all, if any is in despondency, if in disease, if under insult, if in any other circumstance of this life, if in the depth of sins, let him come here with faith, and he will lay aside all those things and will return with much joy, having procured a lighter conscience from the sight alone. But more, it is not only necessary that those who are in affliction should come here, but if any one be in cheerfulness, in glory, in power, in much assurance toward God, let not this person despise the benefit. For coming here and beholding this saint, he will keep these noble possessions unmoved, persuading his own soul to be moderate by the recollection of this person’s mighty deeds and not suffering his conscience by the mighty deeds to be lifted up to any self-conceit.
