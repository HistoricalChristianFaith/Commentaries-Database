"If I honor Myself, My honor is nothing." What say the heretics here? That He heard the question, "Art thou greater than our father Abraham?" and dared not to say to them, "Yea, I am greater," but did so in a covert manner. What then? Is His honor "nothing"? With respect to them it is nothing. And as He said, "My witness is not true," with reference to the opinion they would form of it, so also doth He speak here.

"There is One that honoreth Me." And wherefore said He not, "The Father that sent Me," as He did before, but, "Of whom ye say that He is your God. Yet ye have not known Him." Because He desired to show that they not only knew not His Father, but that they knew not God.
