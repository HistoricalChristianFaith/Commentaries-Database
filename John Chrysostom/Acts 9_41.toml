So did Christ to the daughter of Jairus: And (says the Evangelist) having taken her by the hand. Mark severally, first the life, then the strength brought into her, the one by the word, the other by his hand— And he gave her his hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive: to some for comfort, because they received back their sister, and because they saw the miracle, and for kindly support (προστασίαν) to others. And it was known throughout all Joppa; and many believed in the Lord. And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
