With regard to the Father, these words refer to Essence; with regard to the disciples, to agreement of mind and help from God. And how, tell me, is this reasonable? says some one. And how, pray, is the contrary reasonable? For great and altogether boundless is the interval between Christ and the disciples. And if the same words are employed, marvel not; for the Scripture is often wont to use in different senses the same words, when applied to God and to men. Thus we are called gods, and sons of God, yet the word has not the same force when applied to us and to God. And the Son is called Image, and Glory; so are we, but great is the interval between us. Again, You are Christ's, and Christ is God's 1 Corinthians 3:23, but not in like manner as Christ is God's are we Christ's. But what is it that He says? When I am arisen, He says, -->you shall know that I am not separated from the Father, but have the same power with Him, and that I am with you continually, when facts proclaim the aid which comes to you from Me, when your enemies are kept down, and you speak boldly, when dangers are removed from your path, when the preaching of the Gospel flourishes day by day, when all yield and give ground to the word of true religion. As the Father has sent Me, so send I you. John 20:21 Do you see that here also the word has not the same force? For if we take it as though it had, the Apostles will differ in nothing from Christ. But why says He, Then you shall know? Because then they saw Him risen and conversing with them, then they learned the exact faith; for great was the power of the Spirit, which taught them all things.
