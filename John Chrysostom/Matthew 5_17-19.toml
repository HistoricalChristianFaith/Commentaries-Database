(Hom. xvi.) Christ then fulfilled the Prophets by accomplishing what was therein foretold concerning Himselfâ€”and the Law, first, by transgressing none of its precepts; secondly, by justifying by faith, which the Law could not do by the letter.

He speaks not this of the old laws, but of those which He was now going to enact, of which he says, the least, though they were all great. For as He so oft spoke humbly of Himself, so does He now speak humbly of His precepts.

Or, when you hear the words, least in the kingdom of heaven, imagine nothing less than the punishment of hell. For He oft uses the word 'kingdom,' not only of the joys of heaven, but of the time of the resurrection, and of the terrible coming of Christ.
