Let your requests be spiritual … let your mind be alert, let your attention be concentrated on the words. Ask for the kind of things it is usual to ask of God so that you may gain what you ask. To the same end maintain your constant vigil, alert, keeping your attention undimmed, no yawning or switching your mind in one direction and another, but working out your salvation in fear and trembling. “Blessed is the person,” Scripture says, remember, “whose piety puts him in awe of everything.”
