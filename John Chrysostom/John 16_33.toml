“These things have I said to you so that you might have peace,” that is, that you may not drive me from your thoughts but receive me. No one should drag these words down into some type of doctrinal argument. They are spoken for our comfort and love. “For,” [Jesus might say], “not even when you suffer such things as I have mentioned will your troubles come to an end, but as long as you are in the world you will have sorrow, not only when I am betrayed but also afterward. However, raise up your spirits, for you will suffer no serious harm. When the Master is victorious, the disciples should not be dejected.” “And how,” tell me, “have you conquered the world?” “I have already said that I have cast down its ruler, but you shall know later when everything yields and obeys you.”
