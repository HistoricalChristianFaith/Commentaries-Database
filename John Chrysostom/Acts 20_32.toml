When [Paul] speaks in council, he follows what he does in writing an epistle. He begins with exhortation and ends with prayer. For since he has alarmed them greatly by saying, “Fierce wolves will come in among you,” look at the consolation he gives so that they should not be panic-stricken and lose all hope. “And now,” as always, “I commend you, brothers, to God and to the word of his grace.” That is, to his grace. For it is grace that saves. He reminds them of grace constantly, making them more earnest because they are debtors and persuading them to be of good courage. “Which is able to build you up.” He did not say “build” but “build up,” thereby showing that they were already built. Then he reminds them of the hope to come, “to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.”
