What he does when writing in an Epistle, this he does also when speaking in council: from exhorting, he ends with prayer: for since he had much alarmed them by saying, "Grievous wolves shall enter in among you," therefore, not to overpower them, and make them lose all self-possession, observe the consolation he gives. "And now," he says, as always, "I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace:" that is, to His grace: it is grace that saveth. He constantly puts them in mind of grace, to make them more earnest as being debtors, and to persuade them to have confidence. "Which is able to build you up." He does not say, to build, but, "to build up," showing that they had already been built. Then he puts them in mind of the hope to come; "to give you an inheritance," he says, "among all them which are sanctified." Then exhortation again.
