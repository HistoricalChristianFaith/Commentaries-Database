The object of Paul is to distinguish the Christian from the Jewish prayers. Therefore observe what he says, “In every place lifting up holy hands,” this being something which was not permitted the Jews, for they were not allowed to approach God, to sacrifice and perform their services elsewhere. Rather, assembling from all parts of the world in one place, they were bound to perform all their worship in the temple.… Henceforth the consideration is not of the place but of the manner of the prayer. “Pray everywhere,” but, “everywhere lift up holy hands.” That is the thing required. And what is “holy”? Pure. And what is pure? Not washed with water, but free from covetousness, murder, rapacity, violence, “without wrath and doubting.”
