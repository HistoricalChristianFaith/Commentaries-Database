“He argued in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.” But “when they opposed and reviled him,” he withdrew. By this [Paul] expected to draw them all the more. For why did he leave that house and go to one near the synagogue? Was it not for this? For it was not danger that he saw there. “Testifying to them,” it says. He did not yet teach, but he testified. “When they opposed,” it says, “and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said, ‘Your blood be upon your heads!’ ” He does this to frighten them not only with words but also with action. And he argues rather vehemently inasmuch as he has already persuaded many of them. “I am innocent,” he says, “from now on I will go to the Gentiles.” So we too are accountable for the blood of those entrusted to us, if we neglect them.
