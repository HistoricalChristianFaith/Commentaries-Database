he speaks the more vehemently as having already persuaded many. I, says he, am clean. Then we also are accountable for the blood of those entrusted to us, if we neglect them. From this time forth I will go to the Gentiles. So that also when he says, Henceforth let no man trouble me Galatians 6:17, he says it to terrify. For not so much did the punishment terrify, as this stung them. And having removed thence he came into the house of one named Justus, that worshipped God, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue

And he departed thence, and entered into a certain man's house, named Justus, one that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue. See how having again said, Henceforth— for all that, he does not neglect them; so that it was to rouse them that he said this, and thereupon came to Justus, whose house was contiguous to the synagogue, so that even from this they might have jealousy, from the very proximity. And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house. This also was, of all things, enough to bring them over. And many of the Corinthians hearing believed, and were baptized. Then spoke the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not your peace: for I am with you, and no man shall set on you to hurt you: for I have much people in this city.

“He argued in the synagogue every sabbath and persuaded Jews and Greeks.” But “when they opposed and reviled him,” he withdrew. By this [Paul] expected to draw them all the more. For why did he leave that house and go to one near the synagogue? Was it not for this? For it was not danger that he saw there. “Testifying to them,” it says. He did not yet teach, but he testified. “When they opposed,” it says, “and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said, ‘Your blood be upon your heads!’ ” He does this to frighten them not only with words but also with action. And he argues rather vehemently inasmuch as he has already persuaded many of them. “I am innocent,” he says, “from now on I will go to the Gentiles.” So we too are accountable for the blood of those entrusted to us, if we neglect them.
