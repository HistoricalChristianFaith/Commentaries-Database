There were, it is likely, in the time of our forefathers also, some who weakened the hands of the people Jeremiah 38:4, and brought into practice that which is mentioned by Ezekiel,â€” or rather who did the works of the false prophets, who profaned God among His people for handfuls of barley Ezekiel 13:19; a thing, by the way, done methinks by some even at this day. When, for example, we say that he who calls his brother a fool shall depart into hell-fire, others say, What? Is he that calls his brother a fool to depart into hell-fire? Impossible, say they. And again, when we say that the covetous man is an idolater, in this too again they make abatements, and say the expression is hyperbolical. And in this manner they underrate and explain away all the commandments. It was in allusion then to these that the blessed Paul, at this time when he wrote to the Ephesians, spoke thus, For this ye know, that no fornicator, nor unclean person, nor covetous man, which is an idolater, has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God; adding, let no man deceive you with empty words. Now empty words are those which for a while are gratifying, but are in nowise borne out in facts; because the whole case is a deception.
