"Now there are diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit."

And first he attends on him that had the lesser gift, and was grieved on this account. "For wherefore," says he, "are you dejected? Because you have not received as much as another? Still, consider that it is a free gift and not a debt, and you will be able to soothe your pain." For this cause he spoke thus in the very beginning: "but there are diversities of gifts." And he said not "of signs," nor "of wonders," but of "gifts," by the name of free gifts prevailing on them not only not to grieve but even to be thankful. "And withal consider this also," says he, that even if you are made inferior in the measure of what is given; in that it has been vouchsafed you to receive from the same source as the other who has received more, you have equal honor. For certainly you can not say that the Spirit bestowed the gift on him, but an angel on you: since the Spirit bestowed it both on you and him. Wherefore he added, "but the same Spirit." So that even if there be a difference in the gift, yet is there no difference in the Giver. For from the same Fountain you are drawing, both thou and he.

Even if the gift bestowed on you is less than the gift bestowed on someone else, the Giver is the same, and therefore you have equal honor with him. It is the same Fountain from which you draw refreshment.
