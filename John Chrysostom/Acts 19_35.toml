Rightly does the grammarian say, "Who is ignorant of the city of the Ephesians?" … He does not say "Who does not know Artemis?" but "Who does not know your city?" which is what they were worshiping: … they were trying to make their faith a pretext for making money.

"And when the town clerk had appeased the people, he said, Ye men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Diana, and of the image which fell down from Jupiter?" As if the thing were not palpable. With this saying first he extinguished their wrath. "And of the Diopetes." There was another sacred object that was so called. Either he means the piece of burnt earth or her image.

Well, and with rebuke does the town clerk say, "What man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians-" coming to the point which they were frightened about. Is it this, says he, that ye do not worship her? And he does not say, "That knoweth not" Diana, but, "our city," that it always worshipped her.
