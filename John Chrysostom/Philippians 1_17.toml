What means, "that I am set for the defense of the Gospel"?  It is, They are preparing for  the account which I must give to God, and assisting me.

What is meant by "for the defense"? I have been appointed to preach, I must give account, and answer for the work to which I have been appointed; they assist me, that my defense may be easy; for if there be found many who have been instructed and have believed, my defense will be easy. So it is possible to do a good work, from a motive which is not good. And not only is there no reward in store for such an action, but punishment. For as they preached Christ from a desire to involve the preacher of Christ in greater perils, not only shall they receive no reward, but shall be subject to vengeance and punishment.  "And some of love." That is, they know that I must give account for the Gospel.

Note Paul’s wisdom. He does not hurl around scurrilous accusations. He calmly describes what has come to pass.… Though the aim and motives on which they acted were corrupted, still the preaching itself was not corrupted. And the preaching of Christ occurred despite it all.
