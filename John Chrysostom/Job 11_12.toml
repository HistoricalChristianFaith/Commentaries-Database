Zophar is right in saying, “Like an ass of the desert.” The ass does not stop braying. There is no difference, he says, between our words and those incomprehensible sounds that an ass produces at random and foolishly. We criticize everything, with regard to everything, and we put the blame on everything. Again they exhort Job to take care of his life. But that is useless. That is why Job had said, “If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head.” What is the use of that? Job says, I am righteous, but in his judgment, I am impure.
