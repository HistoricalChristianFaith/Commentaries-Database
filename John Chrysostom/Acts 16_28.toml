For whom did that event happen at midnight? And for whom was it accompanied by an earthquake? Listen to God’s dispensation and be filled with wonder! The chains were loosed and the doors opened. But this event happened for the jailer alone. It was not for show but salvation. That the prisoners did not know they were freed is clear from what Paul says …, “He cried out with a loud voice and said, ‘Do not harm yourself, for we are all here.’ ” They would not have stayed within if they had known that the doors had been opened and they had been freed. Those who break through walls, leap over roofs and eaves and dare anything even when they are bound would have not tolerated staying when their chains had been loosed and the doors had been opened and the jailer sleeping.… And the imprisoned are usually bound during the night, and not during the day. With much care, therefore, he was able to see them carefully bound again and sleeping. If these things had been done during the day, there would have been a big riot. Why was the prison shaken by the earthquake? In order that the jailer might get up to see that spectacle: only he was worthy of salvation.
