O the folly! Make, say they; that they may go before us. Whither? Into Egypt. See how hard they were to tear away from the customs of Egypt! What do you say? What, not wait for him that brought you out, but flee the benefit, and deny the Benefactor? And mark how insulting they are: For as for this Moses, they say:— which brought us out of the land of Egypt nowhere the name of God: instead of that, they ascribed all to Moses. Where they ought to give thanks (to God), they bring Moses forward: where it was, to do as the Law bade them, they no longer make account of Moses. We know not what has become of him. And yet he told them that he was going up to receive the Law: and they had not patience to wait forty days. Make us gods— they did not say, a God.— And yet one may well wonder at this, that they do not even know.
