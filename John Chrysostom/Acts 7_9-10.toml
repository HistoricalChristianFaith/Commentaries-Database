"And God was with him"--this also is for them--"and delivered him out of all his afflictions." He shows that unknowingly they helped to fulfill the prophecy, and that they were themselves the cause, and that the evils recoiled on their own selves.

And he shows, that the saints were not exempt from tribulation, but that in their very tribulations they obtained help. And that these persons did themselves help to bring about the results, who wished to cut short these same afflictions: just as these made Joseph the more glorious: just as the king did Moses, by ordering the children to be killed: since had he not ordered, this would not have been: just as also that Hebrew drives Moses into exile, that there he may have the Vision, having become worthy. Thus also him who was sold for a slave, makes He to reign as king there, where he was thought to be a slave. Thus also does Christ in His death give proof of His power: thus also does He there reign as king where they sold Him.
