[Nicodemus] coming to Jesus, as to a man, is confused and startled and perplexed on learning greater things than any human being could speak, things no one had ever heard before. For a while, he is impressed by the sublime character of the sayings, but his mind is darkened and unstable, borne about in every direction and on the point of falling away from the faith. Therefore he objects to what he has heard as being impossible in order to bring out a fuller explanation from Jesus.… There were two difficulties for him. The first concerned the kind of birth Jesus was talking about; the second, this idea of the kingdom since neither had the name of the kingdom ever been heard among the Jews, nor of a birth like this. But he stops for a while at the first, which most astonished him.

You call him “Master” and say that he “comes from God,” and yet you do not receive his words but utilize a word with your master that brings in endless confusion. For the “how” is the doubting question of those who have no strong belief and are still earthbound. Therefore Sarah laughed when she said, “How?” And many others who have asked this question have fallen from the faith.Some ask, “How was he begotten?” others, “How was he made flesh?” They subject that infinite essence to the weakness of their own reasonings. Knowing this, we ought to avoid this unseasonable curiosity because those who search into these matters will, without ever learning the “how,” fall away from the right faith. Nicodemus here asks from anxiety.… But observe how ridiculous anyone talks when he commits spiritual things to his own reasonings.
