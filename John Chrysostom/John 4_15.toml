See how the woman is led step by step to a higher understanding. First, she thought Jesus was some lax Jew who was transgressing the law.… Then, when she heard about the living water, she thought it meant material water. Afterwards, she understands it as spoken spiritually and believes that it can take away thirst. However, she does not yet know what it is, only understanding that it was superior to material things … “The woman says to him, ‘Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst nor come here to draw.’ ” Observe how she prefers him to the patriarch Jacob for whom she previously had had such veneration.
