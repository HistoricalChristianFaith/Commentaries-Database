Let us return to what was said earlier and observe the wisdom of the apostles. They did not go about boasting and say, “How we settled the discussion with the priests!” They were not ambitious for honor but “went to their friends.” See how they do not throw themselves upon temptations, but when temptations present themselves endure them with courage. Had it been one of the other disciples, perhaps he might have been emboldened by the crowd’s boldness to act with arrogance and speak countless harsh words. But not these, who are true philosophers and do everything with mildness and with gentleness.
