Not for their own glory did they tell the tale-how should such be their motive?-but what they displayed was the proofs therein exhibited of the grace of Christ. All that their adversaries had said, this they told; their own part, it is likely, they omitted: this made the hearers all the more courageous. What then? These again flee to the true Succor, to the Alliance invincible, and again, "with one accord."

See the unostentatious conduct of the Apostles, and their largeness of mind. They did not go about boasting, and say, "How we served the priests!" nor were they ambitious of honor: but, we read, "they came unto their own company." Observe how they do not cast themselves upon temptations, but when the temptations present themselves, with courage endure them. Had it been some other of the disciples, perhaps, emboldened by the countenance of the multitude, he might have insulted, might have vented ever so many harsh expressions. But not so these true philosophers; they do all with mildness and with gentleness.
