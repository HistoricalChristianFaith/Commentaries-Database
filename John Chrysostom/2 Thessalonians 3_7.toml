A teacher demonstrates great confidence if he uses his own good actions to reprove his disciples. And so Paul writes, “For yourselves know how you ought to imitate us.” And he ought to be a teacher more of life than of the word. Let no one think that Paul says this because of a boastful heart. The necessity of the situation in Thessalonica drove him to speak this way, with a view to the advantage of the entire community.
