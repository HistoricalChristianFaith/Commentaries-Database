For if a chain for Christ’s sake is not a shame but a boast, much more is slavery not to be considered a reproach. And Paul says this not to exalt himself but for a merciful purpose. He believes his chains demonstrate he can be trusted. He does not mention his chains for his own sake but that he may more readily obtain the favor from Philemon.

Great is Paul’s self-designation. He mentions no title of principality and power but speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although many other things made him illustrious … yet he sets down none of these but mentions the chain instead of all, for this made him more conspicuous and illustrious than these other things.… But it is customary with those who love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for those who are beloved, than in the benefits they receive from them. A king is not so proud of his diadem, as was Paul, who gloried in his chains.

If “beloved,” then his confidence is not boldness nor conceit but proof of deep affection. If Philemon is a “fellow laborer,” then not only may he be instructed in such a matter, but he ought to acknowledge it as a favor. For Philemon is bringing blessing upon himself, and he is building up the same work [i.e., of spreading the gospel and bringing others to faith]. So that apart from any request, Paul says, you have another reason for granting the favor. For if he is profitable to the gospel and you are anxious to promote the gospel, then you should be the one pleading with me, rather than me with you.
