First, it is necessary to state the argument of the Epistle, then also the matters that are questioned respecting it. What then is the argument? Philemon was a man of admirable and noble character. That he was an admirable man is evident from the fact, that his whole household was of believers, and of such believers as even to be called a Church: therefore he says in this Epistle, And to the Church that is in your house. Philemon 2 He bears witness also to his great obedience, and that the bowels of the Saints are refreshed in him. Philemon 7 And he himself in this Epistle commanded him to prepare him a lodging. Philemon 22 It seems to me therefore that his house was altogether a lodging for the Saints. This excellent man, then, had a certain slave named Onesimus. This Onesimus, having stolen something from his master, had run away. For that he had stolen, hear what he says: If he has wronged you, or owes you anything, I will repay you. (v. 18, 19.) Coming therefore to Paul at Rome, and having found him in prison, and having enjoyed the benefit of his teaching, he there also received Baptism. For that he obtained there the gift of Baptism is manifest from his saying, Whom I have begotten in my bonds. Philemon 10 Paul therefore writes, recommending him to his master, that on every account he should forgive him, and receive him as one now regenerate.
But because some say, that it was superfluous that this Epistle should be annexed, since he is making a request about a small matter in behalf of one man, let them learn who make these objections, that they are themselves deserving of very many censures. For it was not only proper that these small Epistles, in behalf of things so necessary, should have been inscribed, but I wish that it were possible to meet with one who could deliver to us the history of the Apostles, not only all they wrote and spoke of, but of the rest of their conversation, even what they ate, and when they ate, when they walked, and where they sat, what they did every day, in what parts they were, into what house they entered, and where they lodged — to relate everything with minute exactness, so replete with advantage is all that was done by them. But the greater part, not knowing the benefit that would result thence, proceed to censure it.

For if only seeing those places where they sat or where they were imprisoned, mere lifeless spots, we often transport our minds there, and imagine their virtue, and are excited by it, and become more zealous, much more would this be the case, if we heard their words and their other actions. But concerning a friend a man enquires, where he lives, what he is doing, whither he is going: and say, should we not make these enquiries about these the general instructors of the world? For when a man leads a spiritual life, the habit, the walk, the words and the actions of such an one, in short, all that relates to him, profits the hearers, and nothing is a hindrance or impediment.

But it is useful for you to learn that this Epistle was sent upon necessary matters. Observe therefore how many things are rectified thereby. We have this one thing first, that in all things it becomes one to be earnest. For if Paul bestows so much concern upon a runaway, a thief, and a robber, and does not refuse nor is ashamed to send him back with such commendations; much more does it become us not to be negligent in such matters. Secondly, that we ought not to abandon the race of slaves, even if they have proceeded to extreme wickedness. For if a thief and a runaway become so virtuous that Paul was willing to make him a companion, and says in this Epistle, that in your stead he might have ministered unto me Philemon 13, much more ought we not to abandon the free. Thirdly, that we ought not to withdraw slaves from the service of their masters. For if Paul, who had such confidence in Philemon, was unwilling to detain Onesimus, so useful and serviceable to minister to himself, without the consent of his master, much less ought we so to act. For if the servant is so excellent, he ought by all means to continue in that service, and to acknowledge the authority of his master, that he may be the occasion of benefit to all in that house. Why do you take the candle from the candlestick to place it in the bushel?

I wish it were possible to bring into the cities those (servants) who are without. What, say you, if he also should become corrupt. And why should he, I beseech you? Because he has come into the city? But consider, that being without he will be much more corrupt. For he who is corrupt being within, will be much more so being without. For here he will be delivered from necessary care, his master taking that care upon himself; but there the concern about those things will draw him off perhaps even from things more necessary, and more spiritual. On this account the blessed Paul, when giving them the best counsel, said, Are you called, being a servant? Care not for it: but if even you may be made free, use it rather 1 Corinthians 7:21; that is, abide in slavery. But what is more important than all, that the word of God be not blasphemed, as he himself says in one of his Epistles. Let as many servants as are under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and His doctrine be not blasphemed. 1 Timothy 6:1 For the Gentiles also will say, that even one who is a slave can be well pleasing to God. But now many are reduced to the necessity of blasphemy, and of saying Christianity has been introduced into life for the subversion of everything, masters having their servants taken from them, and it is a matter of violence.

Let me also say one other thing. He teaches us not to be ashamed of our domestics, if they are virtuous. For if Paul, the most admirable of men, speaks thus much in favor of this one, much more should we speak favorably of ours. There being then so many good effects— and yet we have not mentioned all— does any one think it superfluous that this Epistle was inserted? And would not this be extreme folly? Let us then, I beseech you, apply to the Epistle written by the Apostle. For having gained already so many advantages from it, we shall gain more from the text.

For if a chain for Christ’s sake is not a shame but a boast, much more is slavery not to be considered a reproach. And Paul says this not to exalt himself but for a merciful purpose. He believes his chains demonstrate he can be trusted. He does not mention his chains for his own sake but that he may more readily obtain the favor from Philemon.

Great is Paul’s self-designation. He mentions no title of principality and power but speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although many other things made him illustrious … yet he sets down none of these but mentions the chain instead of all, for this made him more conspicuous and illustrious than these other things.… But it is customary with those who love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for those who are beloved, than in the benefits they receive from them. A king is not so proud of his diadem, as was Paul, who gloried in his chains.

If “beloved,” then his confidence is not boldness nor conceit but proof of deep affection. If Philemon is a “fellow laborer,” then not only may he be instructed in such a matter, but he ought to acknowledge it as a favor. For Philemon is bringing blessing upon himself, and he is building up the same work [i.e., of spreading the gospel and bringing others to faith]. So that apart from any request, Paul says, you have another reason for granting the favor. For if he is profitable to the gospel and you are anxious to promote the gospel, then you should be the one pleading with me, rather than me with you.
