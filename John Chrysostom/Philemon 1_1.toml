Great is Paul’s self-designation. He mentions no title of principality and power but speaks of bonds and chains! Truly great indeed! Although many other things made him illustrious … yet he sets down none of these but mentions the chain instead of all, for this made him more conspicuous and illustrious than these other things.… But it is customary with those who love, to glory more in the things which they suffer for those who are beloved, than in the benefits they receive from them. A king is not so proud of his diadem, as was Paul, who gloried in his chains.
