The master of the church has many names: being called the Father, the way, the life, the light, the arm, the propitiation, the foundation, the door, the sinless one, the treasure, Lord, God, Son, the only begotten, the form of God, the image10 of God. So it is with the church itself. Does one name suffice to present the whole truth? By no means. But for this reason there are countless names, that we may learn something concerning God, though it is but a small part.
