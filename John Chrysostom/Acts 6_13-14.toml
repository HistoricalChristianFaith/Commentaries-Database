They say not, "he speaketh," but, "he ceaseth not to speak. And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon him, and caught him, and brought him to the council, and set up false witnesses, which said, This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law." "Ceaseth not," say they, as if he made this his business. "For we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us." "Jesus," they say, "the Nazarene," as a term of reproach, "shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs." This is also what they said about Christ. "Thou that destroyest this Temple." For great was their veneration for the Temple (as indeed they had chosen to leave their own country in order to be near it) and for the name of Moses. The charge is twofold. If He "shall change the customs," He will also introduce others instead: observe how the charge is a bitter one, and fraught with perils.

"We have heard him," they say, "speaking blasphemous words against Moses and against God": and again, "This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law," and with an addition, "the customs which Moses delivered to us"; Moses, not God. Upon the supposition of a design to overturn their manner of life, they accused him of impiety also.
