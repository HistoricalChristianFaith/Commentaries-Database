"But this [man] after He had offered one sacrifice for sins for ever, sat down on the right hand of God, from henceforth expecting till His enemies be made His footstool." [Hebrews 10:14-15] "For by one offering He has perfected forever them that are sanctified. Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us." He had said that those [sacrifices] are not offered; he reasoned from what is written, [and] from what is not written;  moreover also he put forward the prophetic word which says, "sacrifice and offering You would not." He had said that He had forgiven their sins.
