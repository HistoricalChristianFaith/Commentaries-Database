What then? He Himself speaks nothing, nor Moses, nor Elias, but He that is greater than all, and more worthy of belief, the Father, utters a voice out of the cloud.

Wherefore out of the cloud? Thus does God ever appear. For a cloud and darkness are round about Him; and, He sits on a light cloud; Isaiah 19:1 and again, Who makes clouds His chariot; and, A cloud received Him out of their sight; Acts 1:9 and, As the Son of Man coming in the clouds. Daniel 7:13

In order then that they might believe that the voice proceeds from God, it comes from thence.

And the cloud was bright.

For as, when He threatens, He shows a dark cloud—as on Mount Sinai; for Moses, it is said, entered into the cloud, and into the thick darkness; and as a vapor, so went up the smoke; and the prophet said, when speaking of His threatening, Dark water in clouds of the air; — so here, because it was His desire not to alarm, but to teach, it is a bright cloud.

And whereas Peter had said Let us make three tabernacles, He showed a tabernacle not made with hands. Wherefore in that case it was smoke, and vapor of a furnace; but in this, light unspeakable and a voice.

Then, to signify that not merely concerning some one of the three was it spoken, but concerning Christ only; when the voice was uttered, they were taken away. For by no means, had it been spoken merely concerning any one of them, would this man have remained alone, the two being severed from Him.

Why then did not the cloud likewise receive Christ alone, but all of them together? If it had received Christ alone, He would have been thought to have Himself uttered the voice. Wherefore also the evangelist, making sure this same point, says, that the voice was from the cloud, that is, from God.

And what says the voice? This is my beloved Son. Now if He is beloved, fear not thou, O Peter. For you ought indeed to know His power already, and to be fully assured touching His resurrection; but since you know not, at least from the voice of the Father take courage. For if God be mighty, as surely He is mighty, very evidently the Son is so likewise. Be not afraid then of those fearful things.

But if as yet thou receive it not, consider at least that other fact, that He is both a Son, and is beloved. For This, it is said, is My beloved Son. Now if He is beloved, fear not. For no one gives up one whom he loves. Be not thou therefore confounded; though you love Him beyond measure, you love Him not as much as He that begot Him.

In whom I am well pleased. For not because He begot Him only, does He love Him, but because He is also equal to Him in all respects, and of one mind with Him. So that the charm of love is twofold, or rather even threefold, because He is the Son, because He is beloved, because in Him He is well pleased.

But what means, In whom I am well pleased? As though He had said, In whom I am refreshed, in whom I take delight; because He is in all respects perfectly equal with Himself, and there is but one will in Him and in the Father, and though He continue a Son, He is in all respects one with the Father.

Hear ye Him. So that although He choose to be crucified, you are not to oppose Him.
