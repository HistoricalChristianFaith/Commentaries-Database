Words of exceeding wrath!

For I perceive that you are in the gall of bitterness, and in the bond of iniquity. Acts 8:23 Words of exceeding wrath! But otherwise he did not punish him: that faith may not thereafter be of compulsion; that the matter may not seem to be carried ruthlessly; that he may introduce the subject of repentance: or also, because it suffices for correction to have convicted him, to have told him what was in his heart, to have brought him to confess himself overcome (ὅ τι ἐ& 128confession that he has done wrong.

“For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity.” These are words of strong disapproval, but otherwise he [Peter] did not punish him [Simon], because he did not want faith hereafter to come from compulsion or to appear ruthless in his treatment of the affair, but rather to introduce the subject of repentance. It is sufficient, for the purpose of correction, to convince him, to say what was in his heart. It is sufficient for him to confess he was caught.
