"Wherefore? because I love you not? God knoweth." Quickly [is it done], and by an easy method. But still, not even so did he rid them of those charges. For he neither said, "ye are not weak," nor yet, "ye are strong;" but, "I love you," which very greatly aggravated the accusation against them. For the not receiving from them, because they felt it an exceeding grievance, was a proof of special love toward them. So he acted in two contrary ways out of love; he both did receive, and did not receive: but this contrariety was on account of the disposition of the givers. And he did not say, "I therefore do not take of you, because I exceedingly love you," for this would have contained an accusation of their weakness and have thrown them into distress; but he turned what he said to another reason. What then is this?
