Why do you say this? Why do you mention this? What has happened? Have you nothing to accuse them of? He first alarms them, then adds, “And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound in the Spirit, not knowing what shall befall me there; except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. But I do not account my life of any value or as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.” Why does [Paul] say this? He is preparing them to be always ready for dangers both seen and unseen and to obey the Spirit in everything. He shows that he is led away for great things. “Except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city.” He shows that he is led away willingly, and so that you should not imagine him forced by compulsion or necessity, he says, “in every city.” Then he adds, “I do not account my life as precious to myself, if only I may accomplish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus.” Do you see that these are not the words of one lamenting but of one who is in control, teaching and sympathizing with them in what has happened? He did not say, “We grieve, but it is necessary to bear it,” but “I do not account.…” He repeats this, not to extol himself but to teach them, through the earlier words, humility, and through these, bravery and boldness.
