Ver. 18. "And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work."

See how near he had been to death. He had fallen into the very jaws of the lion. For he calls Nero a lion from his ferocity, and the violent and daring character of his government. "The Lord delivered me," he says, "and will deliver." But if he says, "He will deliver me," why does he say, "I am ready to be offered"? Attend to the expression, "He delivered me," he says, "from the lion's mouth"; and again, "He will deliver me," not from the lion's mouth, but "from every evil work." For then He delivered me from the danger; but now that enough has been done for the Gospel, He will yet again deliver me from every sin, that is, He will not suffer me to depart with condemnation. For that he should be able to "resist unto blood striving against sin" [Hebrews 12:4], and not yield, is a deliverance from another lion, even the devil, so that this preservation is greater than the former when he seems to be given up.

"And will preserve me unto His heavenly kingdom; to Whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen."

This then is salvation, when we shine forth there. But what means, "He will preserve me unto His kingdom"? He will deliver me from all blame, and preserve me there. For this is to be preserved unto His kingdom, to die here on account of it. For "He that hates his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal." [John 12:25]

"To whom be glory." Lo, here is a doxology to the Son.
