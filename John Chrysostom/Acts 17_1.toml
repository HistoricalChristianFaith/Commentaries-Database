“And as was his custom, Paul went into the synagogue of the Jews.” Although he had said, “We turn to the Gentiles,” he did not abandon these people, for great was his desire toward them. Listen to what he says, “Brothers, my heart’s desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved,” and, “I wished myself accursed from Christ for my brothers.” He did this because of the promise and the glory of God and because he did not wish to offend the Gentiles.
