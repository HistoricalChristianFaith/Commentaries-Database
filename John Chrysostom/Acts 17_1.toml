Again they pass through the small towns and hurry to the biggest, since the word was to flow to nearby cities as from a source.

Again they haste past the small cities, and press on to the greater ones, since from those the word was to flow as from a fountain into the neighboring cities. "And Paul, as his manner was, went into the synagogue of the Jews." Although he had said, "We turn to the Gentiles" (ch. xiii. 46), he did not leave these alone: such was the longing affection he had towards them. For hear him saying, "Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved" (Rom. x. 1): and, "I wished myself accursed from Christ for my brethren." (ib. ix. 3.) But he did this because of God's promise and the glory: and this, that it might not be a cause of offence to the Gentiles.
