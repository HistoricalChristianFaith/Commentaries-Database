There was a law before, and there is a law now: “The law of the Spirit of life has delivered me.” There was worship before, and there is worship now: “Whose worship,” Paul says, and again, “Who serve God in spirit.” There was a covenant before, and there is a covenant now: “I will make a new covenant with you, not according to the covenant that I made with your ancestors.” There was holiness before, and there is holiness now. There was a baptism before, and there is a baptism now. There was a sacrifice before, and there is a sacrifice now. There was a temple before, and there is a temple now. There was a circumcision before, and there is a circumcision now. So also there was grace before, and there is a grace now. But the first-named as types, and the others as the reality, have kept the same name but not the same meaning. Thus, even in pictures and images one that is done in black and white shades is said to be a person, and likewise one that has been done in realistic colors. Similarly, in the case of statues, both the gold one and clay one are called statues, but the one as a model, the other as the real statue.
