* The exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe.

Yes, when Prophets had availed nothing, nor Angels, nor Archangels, when the whole creation, both visible and invisible, had failed, (the visible lying before us, and without any power to guide us, and much also which is invisible,) then He ordered His own coming, to show us that it was a matter which required Divine power.

* The riches of the glory,

That is, the unutterable glory; for what language shall be adequate to express that glory of which the saints shall then be partakers? None. But verily there is need of grace in order that the understanding may perceive it, and admit even so much as at least one little ray. Some things indeed they knew even before; now he was desirous that they should learn more, and know it more clearly. Do you see how great things He has wrought? He has raised up Christ. Is this a small thing? But look again. He has set Him at His right hand. And shall any language then be able to represent this? Him that is of the earth, more mute than the fishes, and made the sport of devils, He has in a moment raised up on high. Truly this is indeed the exceeding greatness of His power. And behold, whither He has raised Him.

When the prophets had achieved nothing, nor angels nor archangels, nor the whole creation visible and invisible … he decided to appear himself in the flesh to show that this was a matter that required divine power.
