They did not say, choose, but, show which one to these two you have chosen: knowing that all things were foreordained by God.

Why did Peter not ask Christ to give him someone to replace Judas? It is better as it is. For in the first place, they were engaged in other things; second, this was the greatest proof of Christâ€™s presence with them. For just as he chose when he was among them, so he chose now in absence. This was no small consolation.
