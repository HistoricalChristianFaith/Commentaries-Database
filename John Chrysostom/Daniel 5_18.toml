And in the Old Testament it may be found, in that grace many times came on unworthy persons that it might do good to others.â€¦ Nebuchadnezzar was very full of iniquity; yet to him [Daniel] revealed what was to follow after many generations. And again to the son of this last, though surpassing his father in iniquity, he signified the things to come, ordering a marvelous and great dispensation. Accordingly because then also the beginnings of the gospel were taking place, and it was requisite that the manifestation of its power should be abundant, many even of the unworthy used to receive gifts. However, from those miracles no gain accrued to them; rather, they are punished even more.
