“Having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation, that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him.” He means that they are not forced to go about and seek God or that God determines their seeking of God, not continuously but in “allotted periods.” With this Paul shows that even if they sought him they would not find him, although he was as conspicuous for discovery as something tangible in their midst.… “Yet he is not far from each one of us” but close to all people. What Paul means is this. Not only did he give “life and breath and everything,” but also the sum and total of everything: he led people to the knowledge of himself, giving us the means through which we can find him and understand him. But we did not wish to seek him, even though he was close at hand. “Not far,” Paul says, “from each of us.” He means that he is close to all people all over the world. What can be greater than this?
