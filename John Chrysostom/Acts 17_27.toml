(a) It means either this, that He did not compel them to go about and seek God, but according to the bounds of their habitation: (c) or this, that He determined their seeking God, yet not determined this (to be done) continually, but (determined) certain appointed times (when they should do so): showing now, that not having sought they had found: for since, having sought, they had not found, he shows that God was now as manifest as though He were in the midst of them palpably (ψηλαφώμενος). (e) Though He be not far, he says, from every one of us, but is near to all. See again the power (or, what it is to be God,) of God. What says he? Not only He gave life and breath and all things, but, as the sum and substance of all, He brought us to the knowledge of Himself, by giving us these things by which we are able to find and to apprehend Him. But we did not wish to find Him, albeit close at hand. Though He be not far from every one of us. Why look now, He is near to all, to every one all the world over! What can be greater than this? See how he makes clear riddance of the parcel deities (τοὺς μερικούς)! What say I, afar off? He is so near, that without Him we live not: for in Him we live and move and have our being.

“Having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their habitation, that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel after him and find him.” He means that they are not forced to go about and seek God or that God determines their seeking of God, not continuously but in “allotted periods.” With this Paul shows that even if they sought him they would not find him, although he was as conspicuous for discovery as something tangible in their midst.… “Yet he is not far from each one of us” but close to all people. What Paul means is this. Not only did he give “life and breath and everything,” but also the sum and total of everything: he led people to the knowledge of himself, giving us the means through which we can find him and understand him. But we did not wish to seek him, even though he was close at hand. “Not far,” Paul says, “from each of us.” He means that he is close to all people all over the world. What can be greater than this?
