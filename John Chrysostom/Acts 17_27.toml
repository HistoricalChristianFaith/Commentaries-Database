"That they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after Him, and find Him, though He be not far from every one of us: for in Him we live, and move, and have our being." This is said by Aratus the poet. Observe how he draws his arguments from things done by themselves, and from sayings of their own.

"And hath determined the times appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him." It means either this, that He did not compel them to go about and seek God, but according to the bounds of their habitation: or this, that He determined their seeking God, yet not determined this to be done continually, but determined certain appointed times when they should do so: showing now, that not having sought they had found: for since, having sought, they had not found, he shows that God was now as manifest as though He were in the midst of them palpably. "Though He be not far," he saith, "from every one of us," but is near to all. See again the power of God. What saith he? Not only He gave "life and breath and all things," but, as the sum and substance of all, He brought us to the knowledge of Himself, by giving us these things by which we are able to find and to apprehend Him. But we did not wish to find Him, albeit close at hand. "Though He be not far from every one of us." Why look now, He is near to all, to every one all the world over! What can be greater than this? See how he makes clear riddance of the parcel deities!
