This parable is delivered against those who will not assist their neighbours either with money, or words, or in any other way, but hide all that they have.

Observe also that the Lord does not require the reckoning immediately, that you may learn His long suffering. To me He seems to say this covertly, alluding to the resurrection.

Thou good servant, (Ps. 16:11.) this he means of that goodness which is shown towards our neighbour.

By this word joy He expresses complete blessedness.

Also he who has the graces of eloquence and of teaching to profit withal, and uses it not, loses that grace; but he who does his endeavour in putting it to use acquires a larger share.

The wicked servant is punished not only by loss of his talent, but by intolerable infliction, and a denunciation in accusation joined therewith.

Observe that not only he who robs others, or who works evil, is punished with extreme punishment, but he also who does not good works.
