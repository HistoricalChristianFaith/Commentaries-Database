Then he adds [Hebrews 3:14], "For we have been made partakers of Christ." What is this, "We have been made partakers of Christ"? We partake of Him (he means); we were made One, we and He — since He is the Head and we the body, "fellow-heirs and of the same body; we are one body, of His flesh and of His bones." [Ephesians 3:6; Romans 12:5; Ephesians 5:30]

"If we hold fast the beginning of our confidence [or, the principle of our subsistence ] steadfast unto the end." What is "the principle of our subsistence"? The faith by which we stand, and have been brought into being and were made to exist, as one may say.

What is the beginning of confidence? It means faith, through which we subsisted and have come to be and have been made to share in being.
