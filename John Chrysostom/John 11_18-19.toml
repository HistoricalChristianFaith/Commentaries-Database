“Two miles.” This is mentioned to account for so many coming from Jerusalem.… But how could the Jews console the loved ones of Christ, when they had resolved that whoever confessed Christ should be put out of the synagogue? Perhaps the extreme affliction of the sisters excited their sympathy, or they wished to show respect for their rank. Or perhaps those who came were of the better sort, as we find that many of them believed. Their presence is mentioned to do away with all doubt that Lazarus was really dead.
