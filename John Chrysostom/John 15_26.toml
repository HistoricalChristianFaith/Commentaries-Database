He shall be worthy of belief, for He is the Spirit of Truth. On this account He called It not Holy Spirit, but Spirit of Truth. But the, proceeds from the Father, shows that He  knows all things exactly, as Christ also says of Himself, that I know whence come and whither I go John 8:14, speaking in that place also concerning truth. Whom will send. Behold, it is no longer the Father alone, but the Son also who sends. And ye too, He says, have a right to be believed, who have been with Me, who have not heard from others. Indeed, the Apostles confidently rely on this circumstance, saying, We who ate and drank with Him. Acts 10:41 And to show that this was not merely said to please, the Spirit bears witness to the words spoken. Acts 10:44

[The Spirit] shall be worthy of belief because he is the Spirit of truth. This is why he called it not the Holy Spirit but the “Spirit of truth.” But when he says it “proceeds from the Father,” he shows that [the Spirit] knows all things precisely, just as Christ also says of himself, “I know from where I come and where I am going.” He also was speaking in that place about truth. “Whom I will send” indicates that it is no longer the Father alone but the Son also who sends.
