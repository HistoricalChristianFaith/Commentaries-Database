The soldiers did these things to him, but while on the cross, he commits his mother to the disciple, teaching us to show every care for our parents even to our last breath. When indeed she unseasonably troubled him, he said, “Woman, what have I to do with you?” and “Who is my mother?” But here he shows how much he loves his mother and commits her to the disciple whom he loved.
