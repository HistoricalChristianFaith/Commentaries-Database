It is one thing to be free from accusation, but it is a far greater thing to appear as servants of God. To be acquitted of all accusation is not nearly as grand as to be covered with praise.

"But in every thing commending ourselves as ministers of God."

This is far greater. Â For it is not the same thing to be free from accusation; and to exhibit such a character as in everything to appear "ministers of God." For neither is it the same thing to be quit of accusation, and to be covered  with praises. And he said not appearing, but "commending," that is 'proving.' Then he mentions also whence they became such. Whence then was it? "In much patience," he says, laying the foundation of those good things. Wherefore he said not barely "patience," but "much," and he shows also how great it was. For to bear some one or two things is no great matter. But he adds even snow storms of trials in the words, "In afflictions, in necessities." This is a heightening of affliction, when the evils are unavoidable, and there lies upon one as it were a necessity hardly extricable  of misfortune. "In distresses." Either he means those of hunger and of other necessaries, or else simply those of their trials.
