What then saith He? He doth not answer them directly, to show that, if they had been willing to see His authority, they could; but He asks them again, saying, "The baptism of John, whence is it? From heaven, or of men?"

And what sort of inference is this? The greatest surely. For if they had said, from heaven, He would have said unto them, why then did ye not believe him? For if they had believed, they would not have asked these things. For of Him John had said, "I am not worthy to loose the latchet of His shoe;" and, "Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sins of the world;" and, "This is the Son of God;" and, "He that cometh from above is above all;" and, "His fan is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His floor." So that if they had believed him, there was nothing to hinder them from knowing by what authority Christ doeth these things.
