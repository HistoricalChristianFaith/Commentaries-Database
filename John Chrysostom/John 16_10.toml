That is, I have exhibited a blameless  life, and this is the proof, that, 'I go to the Father.' For since they continually urged this against Him, that He was not from God, and therefore called Him a sinner and transgressor, He says, that the Spirit shall take from them this excuse also. For if My being deemed not to be from God, shows Me to be a transgressor, when the Spirit shall have shown that I have gone there, not merely for a season, but to abide there, (for the, 'You see Me no more,' is the expression of one declaring this,) what will they say then? Observe how by these two things, their evil suspicion is removed; since neither does working miracles belong to a sinner, (for a sinner cannot work them,) nor does the being with God continually belong to a sinner. So that you can  no longer say, that 'this man is a sinner,' that 'this man is not from God.'

Jesus is saying here, “My going to the Father will prove that I have led an irreproachable life.” For since they continually accused him of not being from God because he was a sinner and transgressor, the Spirit will take away from them this accusation as well.… Again when he says that the Spirit will convict the world, “of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged,” he makes their argument concerning righteousness moot as well, inasmuch as he conquered the devil. If he had been a sinner, he could not have overthrown the devil. Not even a righteous person would have been strong enough to do that. “But those who trample on him afterward shall know that he has been condemned through me. And my resurrection, which is the mark of [my Father] who condemned the devil, will clearly show that the devil was not able to detain me. And so they can no longer say that I had a devil or that I was a deceiver.”
