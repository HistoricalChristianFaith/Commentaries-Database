Jesus is saying here, “My going to the Father will prove that I have led an irreproachable life.” For since they continually accused him of not being from God because he was a sinner and transgressor, the Spirit will take away from them this accusation as well.… Again when he says that the Spirit will convict the world, “of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged,” he makes their argument concerning righteousness moot as well, inasmuch as he conquered the devil. If he had been a sinner, he could not have overthrown the devil. Not even a righteous person would have been strong enough to do that. “But those who trample on him afterward shall know that he has been condemned through me. And my resurrection, which is the mark of [my Father] who condemned the devil, will clearly show that the devil was not able to detain me. And so they can no longer say that I had a devil or that I was a deceiver.”
