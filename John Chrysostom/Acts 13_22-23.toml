"And when he had removed him, He raised up unto them David to be their king: to whom also He gave testimony, and said, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man after Mine own heart, which shall fulfil all My will. Of this man's seed hath God according to His promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus." This was no small thing that Christ should be from David.

Observe how he twines the thread of his discourse alternately from things present, from the prophets. Thus, "from this man's seed according to the promise" - the name of David was dear to them; well then, is it not a thing to be desired that a son of his, he says, should be their king?

The Promise then, he says, the fathers received; ye, the reality. And observe, he nowhere mentions right deeds of theirs, but only benefits on God's part: "He chose: Exalted: Suffered their manners:" these are no matters of praise to them: "They asked, He gave." But David he does praise, and him only, because from him the Christ was to come. "I have found David, the son of Jesse, a man after Mine own heart, which shall fulfil all My will." Observe also; it is with praise that he says of him, "David after that he had served the will of God:" just as Peter - seeing it was then the beginning of the Gospel - making mention of him, said, "Let it be permitted me to speak freely of the patriarch David." Also, he does not say, Died, but, "was added to his fathers."
