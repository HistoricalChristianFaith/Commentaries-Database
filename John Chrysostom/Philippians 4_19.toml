Behold how he invokes blessings upon them, as poor men do. But if even Paul blesses those who give, much more let us not be ashamed to do this when we receive. Let us not receive as though we ourselves had need, let us not rejoice on our own account, but on that of the givers. Thus we too who receive shall have a reward, if we rejoice for their sake. Thus we shall not take it hardly, when men do not give, but rather shall grieve for their sake. So shall we render them more zealous, if we teach them, that not for our own sake do we so act; "but may my God" fulfill every need of yours, or every grace, or every joy.  If the second be true, "every grace," he means not only the alms, which are of earth, but every excellency. If the first, "your every need," which I think too should rather be read, this is what he means to show. As he had said, "ye lacked opportunity," he here makes an addition, as he does in the Epistle to the Corinthians, saying, "And He that supplies seed to the sower, may He supply bread for food, and multiply your seed for sowing, and increase the fruits of your righteousness." [2 Corinthians 9:10] He invokes blessings upon them, that they may abound, and have wherewith to sow. He blesses them too, not simply that they might abound, but "according to His riches," so that this too is done in measured terms. For had they been as he was, so truly wise, so crucified, he would not have done this; but since they were men that were handicraftsmen, poor, having wives, bringing up children, ruling their families, and who had given these very gifts out of small possessions, and had certain desires of the things of this world, he blesses them appropriately. For it is not unseemly to invoke sufficiency and plenty upon those who thus use them. See too what he said. He said not, May He make you rich, and to abound greatly; but what said he? "May He fulfill every need of yours," so that you may not be in want, but have things for your necessities. Since Christ too, when He gave us a form of prayer, inserted also this in the prayer, when He taught us to say,

"Give us this day our daily bread." [Matthew 6:11]

"According to His riches." That is, according  to His free gift, i.e. it is easy to Him, and possible, and quickly. And since I have spoken of need, do not think that he will drive you into straits. Wherefore he added, "according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus." So shall all things abound to you, that you may have them to His glory. Or, you are wanting in nothing; (for it is written, "great grace was upon them all, neither was there any that lacked.") [Acts 4:33] Or, so as to do all things for His glory, as if he had said, that you may use your abundance to His glory.

They were artisans and paupers. They had wives, reared children and owned houses. They had given these gifts freely from their small means. There was nothing absurd in praying that such people so situated should have sufficiency and plenty. He does not ask God to make them rich or affluent. He asks only that God may “supply their every need”—so they will not be in want but will have what they need.
