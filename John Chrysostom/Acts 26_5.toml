Then how should I have become a seditious person, who when young was (thus) testified of by all? Then too from his sect: after the most straitest sect says he, of our religion I lived. What then, if though the sect indeed be worthy of admiration, you are evil? Touching this also I call all to witnessâ€” touching my life and conversation. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?
