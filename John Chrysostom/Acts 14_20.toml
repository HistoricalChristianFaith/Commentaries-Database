“But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city.” … Here the saying is fulfilled, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” This is greater than the raising of the lame man!… “He entered the city.” Do you see his zeal? Do you see how fervent he is, how set on fire? He entered the city itself again, to show that if he should ever withdraw, it is because he had sown the word and did not wish to inflame their anger.
