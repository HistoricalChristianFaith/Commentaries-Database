"Lest any man," he says, "should think of me above that which he seeth me to be, or that he heareth aught from me."-"Howbeit as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city." Here is fulfilled that saying, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for My strength is made perfect in weakness." Greater this than the raising of the lame man! "Came into the city." Do you mark the zeal, do you mark how fervent he is, how set on fire! He came into the city itself again: for proof that if on any occasion he did retire, it was because he had sown the word, and because it was not right to inflame their wrath.

"Howbeit," etc. "and came into the city." For that the spirits of the disciples might not be downcast because they who were accounted gods suffered such treatment, they came in unto them and discoursed.
