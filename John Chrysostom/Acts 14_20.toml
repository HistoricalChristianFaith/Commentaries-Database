Howbeit as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up and came into the city. (d) Here is fulfilled that saying, My grace is sufficient for you, for My strength is made perfect in weakness. 2 Corinthians 12:9 Greater this than the raising of the lame man! (f) Came into the city. Do you mark the zeal, do you mark how fervent he is, how set on fire! He came into the city itself again: for proof that if on any occasion he did retire, it was because he had sown the word, and because it was not right to inflame their wrath. (h) Then they went over all the cities in which they had been in danger. And on the morrow, it says, he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe. And when they had preached the Gospel to that city, and had taught many, they returned again to Lystra, and to Iconium, and Antioch, confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God.

“But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city.” … Here the saying is fulfilled, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my strength is made perfect in weakness.” This is greater than the raising of the lame man!… “He entered the city.” Do you see his zeal? Do you see how fervent he is, how set on fire? He entered the city itself again, to show that if he should ever withdraw, it is because he had sown the word and did not wish to inflame their anger.
