"When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life." Do you mark that it all came of Peter's discourse, by his admirably skilful way of relating the facts? They glorified God that He had given repentance to themselves also: they were humbled by these words. Hence was the door of faith opened thenceforth to the Gentiles.

Whence being at last afraid, "they held their peace and glorified God." It was not possible for me to hinder - a forcible plea indeed, and such as might well put them to shame.
