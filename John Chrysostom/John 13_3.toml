Here the Evangelist says, even  wondering, that one so great, so very great, who came from God and went to Him, who rules over all, did this thing, and disdained not even so to undertake such an action. And by the giving over, methinks St. John means the salvation of the faithful. For when He says, All things are given over  to Me of My Father Matthew 11:27, He speaks of this kind of giving over; as also in another place He says, Yours they were, and You gave them Me John 17:6; and again, No man can come unto Me except the Father draw him John 6:44; and, Except it be given him from heaven. John 3:27 The Evangelist then either means this, or that Christ would be nothing lessened by this action, since He came from God, and went to God, and possessed all things. But when you hear of giving over, understand it in no human sense, for it shows how He honors the Father, and His unanimity with Him. For as the Father gives over to Him, so He to the Father. And this Paul declares, saying, When He shall have given over  the kingdom to God, even the Father. 1 Corinthians 15:24 But St. John has said it here in a more human sense, showing His great care for them, and declaring His unutterable love, that He now cared for them as for His own; teaching them the mother of all good, even  humblemindedness, which He said was both the beginning and the end of virtue. And not without a reason is added the,  He came from God and went to God: but that we may learn that He did what was worthy  of One who came thence and went there, trampling down all pride.

The Evangelist wonders aloud how one who was so very great, who came from God and went to him and ruled over everything, did not disdain to undertake such an action [of humility]. And by “giving over” I think John means the salvation of the faithful, … not that Christ would in any way be lessened by this action, since he came from God and went to God and possessed all things. But when you hear of “giving over,” you should not think of this action in human terms, because it shows how he honors the Father and demonstrates his unanimity with him. For just as the Father gives over to him, so he also gives over to the Father, as Paul declares saying, “When he shall have given over the kingdom to God, even the Father.” But John here means this in a more human sense, showing his great care for them and declaring his unutterable love in now caring for them as for his own.
