The Evangelist wonders aloud how one who was so very great, who came from God and went to him and ruled over everything, did not disdain to undertake such an action [of humility]. And by “giving over” I think John means the salvation of the faithful, … not that Christ would in any way be lessened by this action, since he came from God and went to God and possessed all things. But when you hear of “giving over,” you should not think of this action in human terms, because it shows how he honors the Father and demonstrates his unanimity with him. For just as the Father gives over to him, so he also gives over to the Father, as Paul declares saying, “When he shall have given over the kingdom to God, even the Father.” But John here means this in a more human sense, showing his great care for them and declaring his unutterable love in now caring for them as for his own.
