[Paul] called together the leaders of the Jews and argued with them. They left in disagreement. They were taunted by him, yet they dared not say anything. For the matter concerning Paul had not been turned over to their authority. It is wonderful how all things come about on our behalf not through what seems to be for our safety but rather through the opposite. I give the following example for your edification. “The Pharaoh ordered the infants to be thrown into the Nile.” Had the infants not been thrown into the Nile, Moses would not have been saved, nor would he have been raised in the palace. It was not when [Moses] was saved that he was in honor but when he was exposed. This was done by God to show his ingenuity and resourcefulness. The Jew threatened him, saying, “Are you thinking of killing me?” This helped him. It was part of the divine plan to ensure that he would see that vision in the desert, that the proper time would be fulfilled and that he would learn philosophy in the desert and live in safety. The same thing happens in all the plots of the Jews against him. He becomes more renowned, as was the case with Aaron. They rose up against him and thereby made him so renowned2 that his ordination was unquestionable and he was subsequently held in admiration because of the bronze tablets. Of course you know the story, so I will leave out the narrative. If you wish, let us go back to the beginning for other such examples.… The three children were thrown into the furnace, and through this they became more renowned. Daniel was cast into the pit and was thus made more illustrious. You see, in every case, trials bring forth great good even in this life, not to mention in the life to come. For with evil the same thing happens as when one is fighting fire with a reed: it seems to beat the fire but is in fact making it brighter and consuming itself. Evil becomes the fuel and the foundation of brightness for virtue. For with God turning unrighteousness to good account, our character shines forth all the more. Again, when the devil contrives anything of this kind, he is making those who endure more renowned.
