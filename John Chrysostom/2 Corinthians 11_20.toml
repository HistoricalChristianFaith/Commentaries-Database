"For you bear with a man," he says, "if he devour you."

How then did you say, "that wherein they glory, they may be found even as we?" [2 Corinthians 11:12] Do you see that he shows that they did take of them, and not simply take, but even in excess: for the term "devour" plainly shows this,

"If a man bring you into bondage." 'You have given away both your money,' he says, 'and your persons, and your freedom. For this is more than taking of you; to be masters not only of your money, but of yourselves also.' And he makes this plain even before, where he says, "If others partake of this right over you, do not we much more?" [1 Corinthians 9:12] Then he adds what is more severe, saying,

"If a man exalt himself." 'For neither is your slavery of a moderate sort, nor are your masters gentle, but burdensome and odious.'

"If a man smite you on the face." Do you see again a further stretch of tyranny? He said this, not meaning that they were stricken on the face, but that they spat upon and dishonored them.
