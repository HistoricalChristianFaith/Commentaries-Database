"And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men. And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius, because he was the chief speaker." But this purpose was not yet manifest, for they spake in their own tongue, saying, "The gods in the likeness of men are come down to us": therefore the Apostle said nothing to them as yet.

"And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercurius." I suppose Barnabas was a man of dignified appearance also. Here was a new sort of trial, from immoderate zeal, and no small one: but hence also is shown the virtue of the Apostles, and how on all occasions they ascribe all to God.
