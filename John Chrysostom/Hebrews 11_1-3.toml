But I will make the matter more plain by an example. Christ said that Jerusalem should be taken and should be so taken as no city ever was before, and that it should never be raised up, and in fact this prediction came to pass. He said that there should be “great tribulation,” and it came to pass. He said that, as a grain of mustard seed is sown, so should the preaching of the gospel be extended, and every day we see this happening over the world. He said that they who left father or mother or brothers or sisters should have both fathers and mothers, and this we see fulfilled by facts. He said, “In the world you have tribulation, but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world”;23 that is, no one shall get the better of you. And this we see by events has come to pass. He said that “the gates of hell shall not prevail against the church,” even though persecuted, and that no one shall quench the preaching of the gospel; and the experience of events bears witness to this prediction also. And yet, when he said these things, it was very hard to believe him. Why? Because all these were words, and he had not as yet given proof of the things spoken. So that they have now become far more credible. He said that “the gospel will be preached throughout the whole world, then the end will come.” Lo! Now you have arrived at the end, for the greater part of the world has been preached to; therefore, the end is now at hand. Let us tremble, beloved. But what, tell me? Are you anxious about the end? It indeed is itself near, but each person’s life and death is nearer. For it is said, “The days of our years are seventy years; but if one be in strength, fourscore years.” The day of judgment is near. Let us fear. “A brother does not redeem; shall man redeem?” There we shall repent much, “but in death no man shall praise him.” Wherefore he says, “Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving,” that is, his coming. For here in this life indeed, whatever we do has efficacy; but there, no longer. Tell me, if a person placed us for a little while in a flaming furnace, should we not submit to anything in order to escape, even were it necessary to part with our money or to undergo slavery? How many have fallen into grievous diseases and would gladly give up all to be delivered from them, if the choice were offered them? If in this world, then, a disease of short duration so afflicts us, what shall we do yonder, when repentance will be of no avail?

Oh, what an expression has he used in saying “an evidence of things not seen.” For we say there is “evidence” in the case of things that are very plain. Faith then is seeing things not plain, he means, and brings what are not seen to the same full assurance with what are seen. So then neither is it possible to disbelieve in things which are seen, nor, on the other hand, can there be faith unless a person is more fully assured with respect to things invisible than he is with respect to things that are most clearly seen. For since the objects of hope seem to be unsubstantial, faith gives them substantiality or, rather, does not give it, but is itself their substance. For instance, the resurrection has not come, nor does it exist substantially, but hope makes it substantial in our soul. This is the meaning of “the substance of things.”If therefore it is an “evidence of things not seen,” why do you wish to see them, so as to fall away from faith and from being just? Since “the just shall live by faith,” you, if you wish to see these things, are no longer faithful. You have labored, he says; you have struggled. I too allow this; nevertheless, wait, for this is faith. Do not seek the whole “here.”

Faith needs a generous and vigorous soul, one rising above all things of sense and passing beyond the weakness of human reasonings. For it is not possible to become a believer otherwise than by raising one’s self above the common customs of the world.Inasmuch then as the souls of the Hebrews were thoroughly weakened—though they had begun from faith, yet from circumstances, I mean sufferings, afflictions, they had afterwards become faint-hearted and of little spirit and were shaken from their position—he encouraged them first indeed from these very things, saying, “Recall the former days”; next from the Scripture, saying, “But the righteous shall live by faith”;34 afterwards from arguments, saying, “But faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.” And now again from their forefathers, those great and admirable people, as much as saying, “If, where the good things were close at hand, all were saved by faith, much more are we.”
For when a soul finds one that shares its same sufferings, it is refreshed and recovers breath. This we may see both in the case of faith and in the case of affliction, “that we may be mutually encouraged by each other’s faith.” For people are very distrustful, cannot place confidence in themselves, are fearful about whatever things they think they possess and have great regard for the opinion of the many.
What then does Paul do? He encourages them by the patriarchs.… Since faith is slandered as being a thing that cannot be demonstrated and rather a matter of deceit, he shows that the greatest things are attained through faith and not through reasonings. And how does he show this, tell me? It is manifest, he says, that God made the things which are out of things which are not, things which appear out of things which appear not, things which subsist out of things which subsist not. But where is it shown that he did this even “by a Word”? For reason suggests nothing of this kind, but, on the contrary, suggests that the things that appear are formed out of things that appear.
Therefore the philosophers expressly say that “nothing comes out of things that are not being sensual” and trusting nothing to faith. And yet these same people, when they happen to say anything great and noble, are caught entrusting it to faith. For instance: They say that “God is without beginning and unborn”—yet reason does not suggest this, but the contrary. Consider how great their folly, I ask you. They say that God is without beginning, and yet this is far more wonderful than the creation out of things that are not. For to say that he is without beginning, that he is unborn, neither begotten by himself nor by another is more full of difficulties than to say that God made the things which are out of things which are not. For here there are many things uncertain, as that some one made it, that what was made had a beginning, that, in a word, it was made. But in the other case, what? He is self-existing, unborn; he neither had beginning nor time. Tell me, do not these things require faith? But he did not assert this, which was far greater, but the lesser. How does it appear, he would say, that God made these things? Reason does not suggest it. No one was present when it was done. How is it shown? It is plainly the result of faith. “By faith we understand that the world was created.” Why “by faith”? Because “the things that are seen were not made of things which do appear.” For this is faith.
