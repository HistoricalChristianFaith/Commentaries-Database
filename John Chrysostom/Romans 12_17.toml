For if you find fault with another who plots against you, why do you make yourself liable to this accusation? If he did amiss how do you come not to shun imitating him? And observe how he puts no difference here but lays down one law for all. For he does not say, "recompense not evil" to the believer, but to "no man," be he heathen, be he contaminated, or what not. "Provide things honest in the sight of all men."

Paul means this: As far as possible, play your part and give nobody, either Jew or Gentile, any cause for fighting. But if you see the faith suffering anywhere, do not put harmony above truth. Make a noble stand, even to the point of death. And even then, do not be at war in your soul or of an adverse temper, but concentrate on the things themselves.

If you find fault with someone who is plotting against you, why expose yourself to the same accusation?
