For if you find fault with another who plots against you, why do you make yourself liable to this accusation? If he did amiss how do you come not to shun imitating him? And observe how he puts no difference here but lays down one law for all. For he does not say, "recompense not evil" to the believer, but to "no man," be he heathen, be he contaminated, or what not. "Provide things honest in the sight of all men."
