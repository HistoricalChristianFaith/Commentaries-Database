See a mother’s affection, or rather God’s designs: He it was who prompted her to make plans and also made sure all turned out well. Do you see the mother’s excellent planning? See also Jacob’s circumspection in showing his mildness of manner in his reply. “He replied to his mother, ‘My brother Esau is hairy, whereas my skin is smooth. Perhaps my father may touch me, and I will appear ridiculous to him and bring on myself a curse, and not blessing’ ” Remarkable the child’s dutifulness and his respect for his father: “I am afraid,” he says. “My efforts may have the contrary effect. I may seem out of step with my father’s wishes and win a curse instead of a blessing.” So what does Rebekah do, this extraordinary woman of great affection? Since she was not concocting this only out of her own thinking but was also implementing the prediction from on high, she took every care to banish fear from the child and instill courage so as to bring off the plan. Instead of promising him that he would be able to deceive his father and elude detection, what did she say? “Let the curse on you fall on me, child; just heed my word, and go and fetch it for me.” “Even if anything like this should happen,” she is saying, “you personally will suffer no harm. So don’t be afraid: Take heart, ‘heed my word,’ and do what I advise you.” This really is a mother’s love, readily accepting everything for her child’s sake.
