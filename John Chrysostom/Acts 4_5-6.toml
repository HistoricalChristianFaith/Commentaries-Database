"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes, and Annas the High Priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the High Priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem."

"And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem."
