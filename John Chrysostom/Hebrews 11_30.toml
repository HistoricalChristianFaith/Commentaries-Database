By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been compassed about for seven days. For assuredly the sound of trumpets is not able to throw down stones, though one blow for ten thousand years; but Faith can do all things.

Do you see that in all cases it is not by natural sequence, nor yet by any law of nature that it was changed, but all is done contrary to expectation? Accordingly in this case also all is done contrary to expectation. For inasmuch as he had said again and again, that we ought to trust to the future hopes, he introduced all this argument with reason, showing that not now [only], but even from the beginning all the miracles have been accomplished and achieved by means of it.

“By faith, the walls of Jericho fell down, after they had been encircled for seven days.” For assuredly the sound of trumpets cannot throw down stones, even if one blows for ten thousand years, but faith can do all things.Do you see that in all cases it is not by natural sequence, nor yet by any law of nature, that it was changed, but all is done contrary to expectation? Accordingly, in this case also, all is done contrary to expectation. For since he had said again and again that we ought to trust to future hopes, he again introduced all this argument with good reason, showing that not now only, but even from the beginning, all the miracles have been accomplished and achieved by means of it.
