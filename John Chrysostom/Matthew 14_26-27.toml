“When the disciples,” it is said, “saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit! And they cried out for fear.” This is the way he constantly deals with our fears. He does not hesitate to bring on worse things, even more alarming than those before. They were troubled here not only by the storm but also by the distance from the land. Note that he did not too easily remove the darkness. He did not come quickly to their rescue. He was training them, as I said, by the continuance of these fears and instructing them to be ready to endure.

Accordingly, neither did he present himself to them at once. For it is written that “in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.” He was instructing them not too hastily to seek for deliverance from their pressing dangers but to bear all challenges courageously. In any case, just when they looked to be delivered, their fear was again heightened.
