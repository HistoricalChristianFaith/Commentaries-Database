Let us not therefore give up in despair; for to fall is not so grievous as to lie where we have fallen. It is not so dreadful to be wounded as it is to refuse healing after being wounded. “For who shall boast that he has his heart chaste? or who shall say confidently that he is pure from sin?” These things I say not to make you more negligent but to prevent your despairing.
