Peter, therefore, taking courage from his master’s voice and from what had already happened, arms himself against the assailants. “And how,” someone says, “does he who was told not to have money, not to have two coats—how does he come to possess a sword?” I think he had prepared it long before because he was afraid this very thing would happen. But you might say, “How does he, who was forbidden even to strike a blow with the hand, become a [potential] killer?” He certainly had been commanded not to defend himself, but here he did not defend himself but his master. And besides, they were not as yet perfect or complete. But if you want to see Peter endued with heavenly wisdom, you shall after this see him wounded and bearing it meekly, suffering ten thousand dreadful things and not once moved to anger.

He therefore restored the servant’s ear and said to Peter, “All they that take the sword shall perish by the sword.” And as he did at the washing of the feet, when he checked his impetuosity by a reproof, he does the same here as well. The Evangelist adds the name of the servant, because what was done was very great, not only because he healed him but because he healed one who had come against him and who shortly after would strike him, and because he prevented the hostility that would probably have been kindled against the disciples by this deed. For this reason the Evangelist has given the name: so that the people of that time might search and inquire diligently as to whether these things had really happened. And not without a cause does he mention the “right ear,” but as I think desiring to show the impetuosity of the apostle, that he almost beheaded the man. Yet Jesus not only restrains him by a threat but also calms him by other words, saying, “The cup that my Father has given me, shall I not drink it?”
