"And the patriarchs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt." Here again, the type of Christ. Though they had no fault to find with him, and though he came on purpose to bring them their food, they thus ill-treated him. Still here again the promise, though it is a long while first, receives its fulfillment.

"And the patriarchs," he says, "moved with envy." Where it does no harm, he humors them: for they prided themselves much on these also.
