And the patriarchs, he says, moved with envy. Acts 7:9 Where it does no harm, he humors (χαρίζεται) them: for they prided themselves much on these also.— And he shows, that the saints were not exempt from tribulation, but that in their very tribulations they obtained help. And that these persons did themselves help to bring about the results, who wished to cut short these same (afflictions): just as these made Joseph the more glorious: just as the king did Moses, by ordering the children to be killed: since had he not ordered, this would not have been: just as also that (Hebrew) drives Moses into exile, that there he may have the Vision, having become worthy. Thus also him who was sold for a slave, makes He to reign as king there, where he was thought to be a slave. Thus also does Christ in His death give proof of His power: thus also does He there reign as king where they sold Him.

And circumcised him on the eighth day: and Isaac (begot) Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs. Acts 7:8.— Here he seems to hint now at the type. And the patriarchs moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt. Acts 7:9 Here again, the type of Christ. Though they had no fault to find with him, and though he came on purpose to bring them their food, they thus ill-treated him. Still here again the promise, though it is a long while first, receives its fulfillment.

Still here again the promise, though it is a long while first, receives its fulfillment. And God was with him— this also is for them— and delivered him out of all his afflictions.
