"Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of God." See what faith, what piety! He knew that it was no word of man that Peter spake, when he said, "God hath shown me." Then says the man, "We are present to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord."

But Cornelius says, "We are present before God to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord": not, Before man, but, "Before God." This is the way one ought to attend to God's servants. Do you see his awakened mind? Do you see how worthy he was of all these things?
