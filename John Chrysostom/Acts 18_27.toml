"And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren wrote, exhorting the disciples to receive him." He wished then also to depart into Achaia, and these also encouraged him to do so, having also given him letters. In faith, he did all by faith; "the brethren wrote," etc. Nowhere envy, nowhere an evil eye. Aquila teaches, or rather this man lets himself be taught. He was minded to depart, and they send letters.
