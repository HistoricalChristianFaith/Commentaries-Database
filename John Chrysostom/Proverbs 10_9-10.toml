Absalom was a treacherous man and “stole all men’s hearts.” Observe how great was his treachery. It is recorded, “He went about, and said ‘Have you no judgment?’ ” wishing to conciliate everyone to himself. But David was guileless. What then? Look at the end of them both, look, how full of utter madness was the former! For inasmuch as he looked solely to the hurt of his father, in all other things he was blinded. But not so David. For “he that walks uprightly, walks securely.”
