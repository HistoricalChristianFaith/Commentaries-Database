3. In the next place, having praised them, he says, [Hebrews 10:35] "Cast not away therefore your confidence, which has great recompense of reward." What do you mean? He did not say, 'you have cast it away, and recover it': but, which tended more to strengthen them, "you have it," he says. For to recover again that which has been cast away, requires more labor: but not to lose that which is held fast does not. But to the Galatians he says the very opposite: "My children of whom I travail in birth again, till Christ be formed in you" [Galatians 4:19]; and with reason; for they were more supine, whence they needed a sharper word; but these were more faint-hearted, so that they rather needed what was more soothing.

"Cast not away therefore" (he says) "your confidence," so that they were in great confidence towards God. "Which has" (he says) "great recompense of reward." "And when shall we receive them (some one might say)? Behold! All things on our part have been done." Therefore he anticipated them on their own supposition, saying in effect, If you know that you have in heaven a better substance, seek nothing here.

"For you have need of patience," not of any addition [to your labors], that you may continue in the same state, that you may not cast away what has been put into your hands. You need nothing else, but so to stand as you have stood, that when you come to the end, you may receive the promise.
