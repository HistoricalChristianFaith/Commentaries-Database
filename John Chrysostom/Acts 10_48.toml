"And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ." After he has cleared himself, then, and not before, he commands them to be baptized: teaching them by the facts themselves. Such was the dislike the Jews had to it! Therefore it is that he first clears himself, although the very facts cry aloud, and then gives the command. "Then prayed they him" - well might they do so - "to tarry certain days:" and with a good courage thenceforth he does tarry.
