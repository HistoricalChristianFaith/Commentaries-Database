Wherefore also He rebukes him, saying, Are ye also yet without understanding? Matthew 15:16 For as to the multitude, they did not perhaps so much as understand the saying; but themselves were the persons offended. Wherefore, whereas at first, as though asking in behalf of the Pharisees, they were desirous to be told; when they heard Him denouncing a great threat, and saying, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be rooted up, and, They are blind leaders of the blind, they were silenced. But he, always ardent, not even so endures to hold his peace, but says, Declare unto us this parable. Matthew 15:15

What then says Christ? With a sharp rebuke He answers, Are ye also yet without understanding? Do ye not yet understand?
