In what did St. Paul surpass the rest of the apostles?… Is it not because of the excellence of his epistles? By this he has helped and will help and, as long as the human race remains, will never stop helping the faithful, not only of his own time but from that day to this and those who shall believe until the coming of Christ. For his writings fortify the churches all over the world like a wall of steel.… His writings are not only useful to us for the refutation of false doctrine and the establishment of the true, but they help us very greatly, too, in living a good life.… These facts are enough to show that he took great pains over this part of his work. But listen also to what he says to his disciple in a letter, “Give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.”

It is not possible, I say, not possible, ever to exhaust the mind of the Scriptures. It is a well which has no bottom.
