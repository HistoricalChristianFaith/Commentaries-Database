It is not possible, I say, not possible, ever to exhaust the mind of the Scriptures. It is a well which has no bottom.

In what did St. Paul surpass the rest of the apostles? … Is it not because of the excellence of his epistles? By this he has helped and will help and, as long as the human race remains, will never stop helping the faithful, not only of his own time but from that day to this and those who shall believe until the coming of Christ. For his writings fortify the churches all over the world like a wall of steel…. His writings are not only useful to us for the refutation of false doctrine and the establishment of the true, but they help us very greatly, too, in living a good life…. These facts are enough to show that he took great pains over this part of his work. But listen also to what he says to his disciple in a letter, “Give heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.”

Even Timothy is commanded to apply to reading. Let us then be instructed not to neglect the study of the sacred writings. Again, observe, he says, Till I come. Mark how he consoles him, for being as it were an orphan, when separated from him, it was natural that he should require such comfort. Till I come, he says, give attendance to reading the divine writings, to exhortation of one another, to teaching of all.
