Why, O mortal, do you pile up gold? Why acquire for yourself a more bitter slavery? A harsher imprisonment? Why create for yourself a more piercing anxiety? You think that the veins of gold in the mines or the gold in palaces could be yours. In fact, even if you had that pile of wealth, you would only hoard it. It would not serve you, because if you do not make use even now of your goods, not touching them as though they belonged to someone else, how much more would you do so if you had more? Usually, for the avaricious, the more abundant the wealth they surround themselves with, the more they save. “But,” you could reply, “I know that it’s mine.” In that case, the possession is only in your thoughts and not in enjoyment. But, you could object, I will be formidable before others. Actually, you would be more vulnerable before the rich, the poor, thieves, calumniators, servants—in effect, before all those who might plot against you. If you want to be formidable, eliminate the occasions by which all those who do this kind of thing might take advantage of and harm you. Have you never heard the proverb that says that not even a hundred people together could ever despoil a poor, naked person? In fact, he has the greatest defender, poverty, one that not even the king could subjugate and conquer. Instead, all these things create anguish for the avaricious person. And why speak of people, given that moths and worms war against such an individual? But why even speak of moths? A long period of time is sufficient, even with no one to bother them, for riches to undergo major damage. What, therefore, is the pleasure of riches? I see the unpleasant aspects, whereas you speak to me of the pleasure you derive from them. What, you might reply, are the unpleasant aspects? Worries, plots, hostilities, hatred, fear, endless thirst after riches and anxiety over them. If someone embraces the girl he loves but cannot satisfy his desire, he suffers an even greater torment. This also happens to the rich person. He certainly has riches and is with them, but he cannot satisfy all his desire. The same happens with all rich people as what is spoken of by a wise man: “Like the desire of a eunuch to deflower a maiden,” and, “Like a eunuch who embraces a virgin and groans.”
