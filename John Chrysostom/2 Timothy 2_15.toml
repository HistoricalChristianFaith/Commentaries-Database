This he has well said. For many distort the text of Scripture and pervert it in every way, and many additions are made to it. He has not said “directing” but “rightly dividing,” that is, cutting away what is spurious, with much vehemence assailing it and extirpating it. With the sword of the Spirit cut off from your preaching, as from a thong, whatever is superfluous and foreign to it.
