And what marvel, if he himself [were so], when his seed also dwelt in this same way? For seeing the promise disproved (since He had said, To you will I give this land, and to your seed Genesis 12:7; 13:15), he saw his son dwelling there; and again his grandson saw himself dwelling in a land not his own; yet was he nowise troubled. For the affairs of Abraham happened as we might have expected, since the promise was to be accomplished afterwards in his family (although it is said even to himself, To you, and to your seed, not, to you through your seed, but to you and to your seed): still neither he, nor Isaac, nor Jacob, enjoyed the promise. For one of them served for hire, and the other was driven out: and he himself even was failing through fear: and while he took some things indeed in war, others, unless he had had the aid of God, would have been destroyed. On this account [the Apostle] says, with the heirs of the same promise; not himself alone, he means; but the heirs also.
