What evidence demonstrates that he has risen? “As he said”—that is, the event is known on the testimony of the angelic visitor. And if you refuse to believe the angel, then remember Jesus’ own words, and you will not hesitate to believe me. The evidence, however, is further presented: “Come and see the place where he lay.” For this purpose the angel had rolled away the stone: that they might see the evidence of his resurrection.
