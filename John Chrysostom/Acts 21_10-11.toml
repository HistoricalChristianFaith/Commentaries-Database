"And as we tarried there many days, there came down from Judea a certain prophet, named Agabus. And when he was come unto us, he took Paul's girdle, and bound his own hands and feet, and said, Thus saith the Holy Ghost, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles." He who formerly had declared about the famine, the same says, This "man, who owneth this girdle, thus shall they bind." The same that the prophets used to do, representing events to the sight, when they spoke about the captivity - as did Ezekiel - the same did this Agabus. And Agabus does not say, "They shall bind" Paul, that he may not seem to speak upon agreement with Paul, but "the man that owneth this girdle" - so then he had a girdle also.
