Do you see how he shows him to be a thief, and an alien, and one that enters in softly? For he has already represented him to be entering in. "Beware." And he well said "makes spoil." As one digging away a mound from underneath, may give no perceptible sign, yet it gradually settles, so do you also beware; for this is his main point, not even to let himself be perceived. As if some one were robbing every day, and he (the owner of the house) were told, "Beware lest there be some one"; and he shows the way — through this way — as if we were to say, through this chamber;  so, "through philosophy," says he.

Then because the term "philosophy" has an appearance of dignity, he added, "and vain deceit." For there is also a good deceit; such as many have been deceived by, which one ought not even to call a deceit at all. Whereof Jeremiah speaks; "O Lord, You have deceived me, and I was deceived"  [Jeremiah 20:7]; for such as this one ought not to call a deceit at all; for Jacob also deceived his father, but that was not a deceit, but an economy. "Through his philosophy," he says, "and vain deceit, after the tradition of men, after the rudiments  of the world, and not after Christ." Now he sets about to reprove their observance of particular days,  meaning by elements of the world the sun and moon;  as he also said in the Epistle to the Galatians, "How turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly elements?" [Galatians 4:9] And he said not observances of days, but in general of the present world, to show its worthlessness: for if the present world be nothing, much more then its elements. Having first shown how great benefits and kindnesses they had received, he afterwards brings on his accusation, thereby to show its greater seriousness, and to convict his hearers. Thus too the Prophets do. They always first point out the benefits, and then they magnify their accusation; as Esaias says, "I have begotten children, and exalted them, but they have rejected me" [Isaiah 1:2, Septuagint]; and again, "O my people, what have I done unto you, or wherein have I grieved you, or wherein have I wearied you"? [Micah 6:3] and David; as when he says, "I heard you in the secret place of the tempest" [Psalm 81:7, Septuagint]; and again, "Open your mouth, and I will fill it." [Psalm 81:10] And everywhere you will find it the same.

That indeed were most one's duty, not to be persuaded by them, even did they say anything to the purpose; as it is, however, obligations apart even, it would be our duty to shun those things. "And not after Christ," he says. For were it in such sort a matter done by halves, that you were able to serve both the one and the other, not even so ought ye to do it; as it is, however, he suffers you not to be "after Christ." Those things withdraw you from Him. Having first shaken to pieces the Grecian observances, he next overthrows the Jewish ones also. For both Greeks and Jews practiced many observances, but the former from philosophy, the latter from the Law. First then, he makes at those against whom lay the heavier accusation. How, "not after Christ"?
