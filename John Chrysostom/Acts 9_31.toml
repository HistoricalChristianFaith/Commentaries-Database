"Then, it says, the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the comfort of the Holy Ghost." He is about to relate that Peter goes down from Jerusalem, therefore that you may not impute this to fear, he first says this. For while there was persecution, he was in Jerusalem, but when the affairs of the Church are everywhere in security, then it is that he leaves Jerusalem. See how fervent and energetic he is! For he did not think, because there was peace, therefore there was no need of his presence.

Paul departed, and there was peace: there is no war nor disturbance. Them, they respected most, as having often stood by them, and as being held in admiration by the multitude: but him, they despised, and were more savage against him. See, how great a war, and immediately, peace! See what that war effected. It dispersed the peace-makers. In Samaria, Simon was put to shame: in Judea, the affair of Sapphira took place. Not that, because there was peace, therefore matters became relaxed, but such was the peace as also to need exhortation.

"So the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace" - i.e. it increased: and peace with itself, that peace which is peace indeed: for the war from without would have done them no harm - "they being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the consolation of the Holy Ghost." And the spirit consoled them both by the miracles and by the works, and independently of these in the person of each individual.
