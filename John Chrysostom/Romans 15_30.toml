Here he again puts forward Christ and the Spirit, and makes no mention whatever of the Father. And I say this, that when you find him mentioning the Father and the Son, or the Father only, you may not despise either the Son or the Spirit. And he does not say the Spirit, but "the love of the Spirit." For as Christ loved the world, and as the Father does, so does the Spirit also. And what is it that you beseech us, let me hear? "To strive together with me in your prayers to God for me,"

Here Paul mentions Christ and the Spirit but not the Father. I say this so that when you find him mentioning the Father and the Son or just the Father you will not devalue either the Son or the Spirit on that account. Note that he does not just say the Spirit but “the love of the Spirit,” for the Spirit loves the world just as Christ and the Father do also.
