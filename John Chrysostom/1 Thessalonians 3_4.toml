You shouldn’t be troubled, Paul says, for nothing strange, nothing contrary to expectation is happening. These words were sufficient to encourage them. Christ spoke to his disciples in the same way and for the same reason. For hear him saying, “Now I have told you before it came to pass, that when it has come to pass you may believe.” For greatly indeed, greatly does it tend to the comfort of others to have heard from their teachers what is to happen. It is the same for those who are sick. If their physicians explain what is happening and what to expect, their anxiety is dramatically reduced. But if anything happens unexpectedly, as though beyond the physician’s ability and knowledge, the patient is afflicted and troubled. It is much the same here. Paul knew beforehand and lets them know in advance that “we are about to be afflicted,” “as it came to pass, and you know.” He not only says that this came to pass but that he foretold many things, and they occurred as he predicted. “For we are appointed to these things.” Hence, you shouldn’t be troubled and disturbed about the past, nor even about the future. If any troubling thing should happen, “we are appointed for this very thing.”
