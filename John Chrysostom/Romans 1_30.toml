Classing things which to many seem to be matters of indifference among his accusations of sin, Paul further strengthens his case, going up to the stronghold of their wickedness and styling them “boastful.” For although sinning is high-minded, boasting is even worse.… Furthermore, they were “inventors of evil.” Not content with the evil which already exists in the world, they went and invented more! Again, this is the behavior of those who are determined and in earnest, not of those who are distracted and forced off course.
