Who is this who before was “barren” and “desolate”? Clearly it is the church of the Gentiles, which was before deprived of the knowledge of God. Who is “she who has the husband”? Plainly the synagogue. Yet the barren woman surpassed her in the number of her children, for the other embraces one nation, but the children of the church have filled the country of the Greeks and of the barbarians, the earth and the sea, the whole habitable world.
