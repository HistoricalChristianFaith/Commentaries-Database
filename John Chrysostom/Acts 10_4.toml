Observe how what the angel speaks he does not speak immediately, but first rouses and elevates his mind. At the sight, there was fear, but a fear in moderation, just so far as served to fix his attention. Then also the words relieved him of his fear. The fear roused him: the praise mitigated what was unpleasant in the fear. Your prayers, says he, and your alms have come up for a memorial before God. And now send men to Joppa, and call for one Simon, whose surname is Peter.
