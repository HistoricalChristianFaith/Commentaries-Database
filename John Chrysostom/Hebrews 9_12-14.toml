For, he says, if “the blood of bulls” is able to purify the flesh, much more shall the blood of Christ wipe away the defilement of the soul. Because you may not suppose when you hear the word sanctifies that it is some great thing, he marks out and shows the difference between each of these purifications and how the one of them is high and the other low. And he says it is so with good reason, since that is “the blood of bulls” and this “the blood of Christ.”

“Shall purify your conscience,” the apostle says, “from dead works.” And well said he “from dead works”; if any man touched a dead body, he was polluted. And here also, if any touch a “dead work,” those ones are defiled through their conscience.… Here the apostle declares that it is not possible while one has “dead works to serve the living God,” for they are both dead and false.
