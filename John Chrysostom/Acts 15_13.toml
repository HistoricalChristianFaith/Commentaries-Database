(b) Peter indeed spoke more strongly, but James here more mildly: for thus it behooves one in high authority, to leave what is unpleasant for others to say, while he himself appears in the milder part. (a) But what means it, How God first (πρὥτον) did visit?

This James was bishop, as they say, and therefore he speaks last. Here is fulfilled that saying, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established.” But notice his wisdom, how he bases his argument on the prophets of old. For he had no acts of his own to declare, as had Peter and Paul. And indeed it is wisely ordered that this part is assigned to those two, who are not intended to stay in Jerusalem, but James, who is to teach them, is not responsible and so is not separated from them in opinion.… “Brothers,” he says, “listen to me.” Great is his moderation, and more complete is this speech, as indeed it puts an end to the matter under discussion.
