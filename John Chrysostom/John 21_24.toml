Why is it then, that, when none of the others do so, he alone uses these words and that for the second time witnessed to himself? For it seems to be offensive to the hearers. Why then does he do it? He is said to have been the last one who embarked on writing [a Gospel]. Christ had moved and roused him to the work, which is why he continually sets forth his love, alluding to the cause by which he was impelled to write. Therefore he also continually makes mention of it, to make his record trustworthy and to show that he came to this work motivated by that love. “And I know,” he says, “that the things are true that he says.”
