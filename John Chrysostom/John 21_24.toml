Why is it, that then, when none of the others do so, he alone uses these words, and that for the second time, witnessing to himself? For it seems to be offensive to the hearers. What then is the cause? He is said to have been the last who came to writing, Christ  having moved and roused him to the work; and on this account he continually sets forth his love, alluding to the cause by which he was impelled to write. Therefore also he continually makes mention of it, to make his record trustworthy, and to show, that, moved from thence,  he came to this work. And I know, he says, that the things are true which he says. And if the many believe not, it is permitted them to believe from this. From what? From that which is said next.
