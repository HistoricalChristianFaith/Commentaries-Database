"And hath made of one blood all nations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth." This is peculiar to God. Look, then, whether these things may not be predicated of the Son also. "Being Lord," he saith, "of heaven and earth" - which they accounted to be God's. Both the creation he declares to be His work, and mankind also. "Having determined," he says, "the times assigned to them, and the bounds of their habitation."

"And made," he says, "of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth." These things are better than the former: and what an impeachment both of the atoms and of matter, that creation is not partial work, nor the soul of man either. If God, He made all: but if He made not, He is not God. Gods that made not heaven and earth, let them perish. He introduces much greater doctrines, though as yet he does not mention the great doctrines; but he discoursed to them as unto children. And these were much greater than those. Creation, Lordship, the having need of naught, authorship of all good - these he has declared.
