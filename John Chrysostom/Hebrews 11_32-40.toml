“And what shall I more say? For time would fail me to tell.” After this Paul no longer puts down the names, but, having ended with a harlot and put them to shame by the quality of the person, he no longer enlarges on the histories, lest he should be thought tedious. However, he does not set them aside but runs over them, doing both very judiciously, avoiding satiety without spoiling the closeness of the argument. He was neither altogether silent, nor did he speak so as to annoy, for he effected both points. For when a person is contending vehemently in argument, if he persists in contending, he wears out the hearer, annoying him when he is already persuaded and gaining the reputation of vain ambitiousness. For he ought to accommodate himself to what is expedient. “And what more do I say?” he says. “For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets.”Some find fault with Paul because he puts Barak, Samson and Jephthah in these places. What do you say? After having introduced the harlot, shall he not introduce these? For do not tell me of the rest of their life but only whether they did not believe and shine in faith. “And the prophets,” he says, “who through faith conquered kingdoms.” Do you see that he does not here testify to their life as being illustrious, for this was not the point in question; the inquiry thus far was about their faith. For tell me whether they did not accomplish all by faith?
“By faith,” he says, “they conquered kingdoms”—those with Gideon. “Enforced justice.” Who? The same. Plainly, he here means kindness. I think it is of David that he says “they received promises.” But of what sort were these? Those in which the Lord said that his “sons shall sit upon” his “throne.”
“Stopped the mouths of lions, quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword.” See how they were in death itself, Daniel encompassed by the lions, the three children abiding in the furnace, the Israelites, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, in diverse temptations; and yet not even so did they despair. For this is faith. When things are turning out adversely, then we ought to believe that nothing adverse is done but all things in due order.
“Escaped the edge of the sword.” I think that he is again speaking of the three children.
“Won strength out of weakness.” Here be alludes to what took place at their return from Babylon. For “out of weakness” is out of captivity. When the condition of the Jews had now become desperate, when they were no better than dead bones, who could have expected that they would return from Babylon, and not return only but also “become mighty” and “put foreign armies to flight”? “But to us,” someone says, “no such thing has happened.” But these are figures of “the things to come.” “Women received their dead by resurrection.” He here speaks of what occurred in regard to the prophets Elisha and Elijah, for they raised the dead.

After he said, “They were put to death by the sword, and others were tortured,” after he recounted many and different modes of martyrdom, he went on to say, “Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and run with perseverance.” Do you see that he called Abel a martyr, as well as Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob? For some of these died for God’s sake in the same way that Paul spoke of when he said, “I die daily”;11 they died not by dying but only by their willingness to die.

“Others suffered mocking and scourging, and even chains and imprisonment.” He ends with these, things that come nearer home. For these examples especially bring consolation when the distress is from the same cause, since even if you mention something more extreme, yet unless it arises from the same cause, you have effected nothing. Therefore, he concluded his discourse with this, mentioning “chains, imprisonments, scourges, stonings,” alluding to the case of Stephen, also to that of Zechariah.

Some “escaped the edge of the sword,” and some “were killed with the sword.” What is this? Which do you praise? Which do you admire? The latter or the former? No, he says. The former, indeed, is appropriate to you. The latter, because faith was strong even unto death itself, were a type of things to come. For the wonderful qualities of faith are two; it both accomplishes great things and suffers great things, treating suffering as if it were nothing.

What then is the reward of so great a change? What is the recompense? They have not yet received it but are still waiting; and after thus dying in so great tribulation, they have not yet received it. They gained their victory so many ages ago but have not yet received their reward. And you who are yet in the conflict, are you vexed?Do you also consider what a thing it is, and how great, that Abraham should be sitting and the apostle Paul waiting till you have been perfected, so that they may then be able to receive their reward? For the Savior has told them before that, unless we also are present, he will not give it to them, just as an affectionate father might say to sons who were well approved and had accomplished their work that he would not give them to eat unless their siblings came. And are you vexed that you have not yet received the reward? What then shall Abel do, who was victor before all and is sitting uncrowned? Or Noah? Or those who lived in those early times, seeing that they wait for you and those after you? Do you see that we have the advantage of them? For “God,” he says, “has provided some better thing for us.” In order that they might not seem to have the advantage over us of being crowned before us, God appointed one time of crowning for all; and he that gained the victory so many years before will receive his crown with you. Do you see God’s tender mercy? And he did not say, “that they without us might not be crowned” but “that apart from us they should not be made perfect,” so that at that time they appear perfect also. They were before us as regards the conflicts but are not before us as regards the crowns. God did not wrong them; God honored us. For they also wait for the siblings, for, if we are “all one body,” the pleasure becomes greater to this body when it is crowned altogether and not part by part. For the righteous are also worthy of admiration in this, that they rejoice in the welfare of their siblings, as in their own, and, for themselves also, it is according to their wish to be crowned along with their own members. To be glorified all together is a great delight.
