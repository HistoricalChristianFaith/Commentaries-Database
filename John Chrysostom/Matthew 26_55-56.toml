Then he also adds, “Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.” By this he makes it clear that the seizure was of his permission. He passes over the miracles and mentions only his teaching, that he might not seem to boast.When I taught, you did not seize me. Why now, when I hold my peace, do you come against me? I was in the temple every day, and no one seized me. Now you come to me late and at midnight with swords and staves! What need is there of these weapons? I have been around daily. Thus he was teaching them that unless he had voluntarily yielded, not even then would they have succeeded. Even then those who were holding him with their hands would not succeed in doing so if he were not willing.

After this, he solves also the difficulty of why he willed it at this time. “All this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.” See how even up to the last hour and in the very act of being betrayed, he did everything he did seeking their amendment and healing, employing prophecy and argument and admonition. Those who take up coercion will perish by their coercion. To show that he is suffering voluntarily, he says, “I was daily with you teaching.” All this was to show his accord with his Father’s will and “that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.”But why did they not lay hold on him in the temple? Because they would not have dared to do so in the temple on account of the people. This is why he continued teaching at all times and places, even to the last hour, taking away their excuse. In order to obey the prophets, he gave up even his very life. In no way did he teach contrary to the prophets.
“Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.” Up until the time he was seized, they remained. But when he had said these things to the multitudes, they fled. For from then on they could see that escape was no longer possible. So he gave himself up to them voluntarily, saying that this was done according to the Scriptures.
