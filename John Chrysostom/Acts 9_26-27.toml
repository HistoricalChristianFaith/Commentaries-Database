One may well be much at a loss here to understand how it is that, whereas in the Epistle to the Galatians Paul says, "I went not to Jerusalem," but "into Arabia" and "to Damascus," and, "After three years I went up to Jerusalem," and "to see Peter" (Gal. i. 17), here the writer says the contrary. Well, then, either Paul means, "I went not up with intent to refer or attach myself to them" - for what saith he? "I referred not myself, neither went I to Jerusalem to those who were Apostles before me:" or else, that the laying await for him in Damascus was after his return from Arabia; or else, again, that the visit to Jerusalem was after he came from Arabia. Certainly of his own accord he went not to the Apostles, but "assayed to join himself unto the disciples" - as being a teacher, not a disciple - "I went not," he says, "for this purpose, that I should go to those who were Apostles before me: certainly, I learnt nothing from them."
