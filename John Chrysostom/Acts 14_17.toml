"Nevertheless, He left not Himself without witness, in that He did good, giving you rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness." See how covertly he puts the accusation "in that He did good," etc. And yet if God did this, He could not have "let them alone;" on the contrary, they ought to be punished, for that, enjoying so great benefits, they had not acknowledged Him, not even as their feeder. "From heaven," he says, "giving you rain." Thus also David said, "From the fruit of their corn and wine and oil were they made to abound" and in many places speaking of Creation, he brings forward these benefits: and Jeremiah mentions first Creation, then Providence shown by the rains, so that the Apostle here discourses as taught from those Scriptures. "Filling," he says, "with food and gladness." With large liberality the food is given, not merely for a frugal sufficiency, nor stinted by the need.
