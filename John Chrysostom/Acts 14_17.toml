Notice that [Paul’s] wish was not to increase the accusation against them but rather that they themselves should refer everything to God.… Notice how covertly he phrases the accusation. And yet if he did this, he would not have allowed them [to walk in their own ways]. He would have had to punish them for having enjoyed so many goods without acknowledging him as their provider. But he does not say this clearly. “He gave you rain from heaven.” Thus also David, “From the fruit of their corn and wine and oil were they made to abound”; and in many places when he is speaking of creation, he brings forward these benefits. Jeremiah also mentions first the creation, then the providence that is shown by the rains. Taught by those Scriptures, the apostle says, they were satisfied “with food and gladness.” With liberality is the food given, not only for sufficiency or even according to need. “With these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.” Indeed, it was especially with this that they gained admiration. Do you see that their point was to put an end to that madness?
