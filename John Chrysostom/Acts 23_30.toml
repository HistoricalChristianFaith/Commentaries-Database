See how the letter speaks for him as a defence— for it says, I found nothing worthy of death, but as accusation against them (rather) than against him. About to have been killed of them: so set upon his death were they. First, I came with the army, and rescued him: then also I brought him down unto them: and not even so did they find anything to lay to his charge: and when they ought to have been stricken with fear and shame for the former act, they again attempt to kill him, insomuch that again his cause became all the more clear. And his accusers, he says, I have sent unto you: that at the tribunal where these things are more strictly examined, he may be proved guiltless.

See how Paul is reckoned innocent through the vote of the foreigners, like Christ with Pilate. See how their evil intentions are defeated: they handed him over, so that he might be killed and condemned, but the opposite happened, and he was saved and found innocent. If things did not go this way, [Paul] would have been torn into pieces, would have perished, would have been condemned.
