See how Paul is reckoned innocent through the vote of the foreigners, like Christ with Pilate. See how their evil intentions are defeated: they handed him over, so that he might be killed and condemned, but the opposite happened, and he was saved and found innocent. If things did not go this way, [Paul] would have been torn into pieces, would have perished, would have been condemned.

If he was acquitted of the charge, why did the tribune send the accusers? That the enquiry might be more strict: that the man might be the more entirely cleared.
