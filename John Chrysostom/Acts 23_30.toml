See how Paul is reckoned innocent through the vote of the foreigners, like Christ with Pilate. See how their evil intentions are defeated: they handed him over, so that he might be killed and condemned, but the opposite happened, and he was saved and found innocent. If things did not go this way, [Paul] would have been torn into pieces, would have perished, would have been condemned.
