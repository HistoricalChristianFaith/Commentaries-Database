For "we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle." Not as the Jewish ordinances, are those among us, as it is not lawful even for the High Priest to partake of them. So that since he had said, "Do not observe," and this seemed to be the language of one who is throwing down his own building, he again turns it round. What, have not we then observances as well (he says)? Yea we have, and we observe them very earnestly too, not sharing them even with the priests themselves.
