What is, I sanctify Myself? I offer to You a sacrifice. Now all sacrifices are called holy, and those are specially called holy things, which are laid up for God. For whereas of old in type the sanctification was by the sheep, but now it is not  in type, but by the truth itself, He therefore says, That they may be sanctified in Your truth. For I both dedicate them to You, and make them an offering; this He says, either because their Head was being made so,  or because they also were sacrificed; for, Present, it says, your bodies a living sacrifice, holy Romans 12:1; and, We were counted as sheep for the slaughter. Psalm 43:22 And He makes them; without death, a sacrifice and offering; for that He alluded to His own sacrifice, when He said, I sanctify, is clear from what follows.

What does he mean by “I sanctify myself”? He means, “I offer to you a sacrifice.” Now all sacrifices are called “holy.” But those that are specially called “holy” are reserved for God. In [Old Testament times], sanctification was typologically indicated by the sheep. But now it is not in type but in truth itself. Therefore he says, “That they may be sanctified in your truth.” “For I both dedicate them to you and make them an offering.” He says this either because the disciples’ Head was being made so, or because they too would be sacrificed. For it says elsewhere, “Present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy,” and “We were counted as sheep for the slaughter.” And he makes them a sacrifice and offering apart from death. For it is clear from what follows that he was alluding to his own sacrifice when he said, “I sanctify.”
