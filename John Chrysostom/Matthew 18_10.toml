He calls little ones not them that are really little, but them that are so esteemed by the multitude, the poor, the objects of contempt, the unknown (for how should he be little who is equal in value to the whole world; how should he be little, who is dear to God?); but them who in the imagination of the multitude are so esteemed.

And He speaks not of many only, but even of one, even by this again warding off the hurt of the many offenses. For even as to flee the wicked, so also to honor the good, has very great gain, and would be a twofold security to him who gives heed, the one by rooting out the friendships with them that offend, the other from regarding these saints with respect and honor.

Then in another way also He makes them objects of reverence, saying, That their angels do always behold the face of my Father which is in Heaven.

Hence it is evident, that the saints have angels, or even all men. For the apostle too says of the woman, That she ought to have power on her head because of the angels. 1 Corinthians 10:10 And Moses, He set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. Deuteronomy 32:8

But here He is discoursing not of angels only, but rather of angels that are greater than others. But when He says, The face of my Father, He means nothing else than their fuller confidence, and their great honor.
