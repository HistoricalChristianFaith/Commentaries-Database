"Wherefore come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch no unclean thing; and I will receive you, saith the Lord."

And He said not, 'Do not unclean things'; but, requiring greater strictness, 'do not even touch,' saith he, 'nor go near them.' But what is filthiness of the flesh? Adultery, fornication, lasciviousness of every kind. And what of the soul? Unclean thoughts, as gazing with unchaste eyes, malice, deceits, and whatsoever such things there be. He wishes then that they should be clean in both. Seest thou how great the prize? To be delivered from what is evil, to be made one with God.
