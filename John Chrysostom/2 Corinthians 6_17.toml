Unclean things refer to adultery and fornication in the flesh and to evil thoughts in the soul. We must be delivered from both.

[[commentary]]
quote='''
Wherefore come ye out from among them, and be ye separate, and touch no unclean thing; and I will receive you, says the Lord.

And He said not, 'Do not unclean things;' but, requiring greater strictness, 'do not even touch,' says he, 'nor go near them.' But what is filthiness of the flesh? Adultery, fornication, lasciviousness of every kind. And what of the soul? Unclean thoughts, as gazing with unchaste eyes, malice, deceits, and whatsoever such things there be. He wishes then that they should be clean in both. Do you see how great the prize? To be delivered from what is evil, to be made one with God. Hear also what follows.
