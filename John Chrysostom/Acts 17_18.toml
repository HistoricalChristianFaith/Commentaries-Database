By the term resurrection the Athenians understood a god, for they were accustomed even to worship females.… They called their gods daimones, for their cities were full of daimones.

It is a wonder the philosophers did not laugh him to scorn, speaking in the way he did. "And some said, What does this babbler mean to say?" insolently, on the instant: this is far from philosophy. "Other some said, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods," from the preaching, because he had no arrogance. They did not understand, nor comprehend the subjects he was speaking of - how should they? affirming as they did, some of them, that God is a body; others, that pleasure is the true happiness. "Of strange gods, because he preached unto them Jesus and the Resurrection": for in fact they supposed "Anastasis" (the Resurrection) to be some deity, being accustomed to worship female divinities also.

"And certain philosophers," etc. How came they to be willing to confer with him? They did it when they saw others reasoning, and the man having repute in the encounter. And observe straightway with overbearing insolence, "some said, What would this babbler say? For the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit." Other some, He seemeth to be a setter-forth of strange deities: for so they called their gods.
