“Then Job answered and said, ‘Yes, I know that my accusation comes from my hands.’ ” This means, I carry along with me the evidence that accuses me. I draw from myself the demonstration of my afflictions. “His hand has been made heavy upon me, and I groan over me.” If it were possible, he says, to discuss my punishments with him, it would also be possible to find them out. If only I could plead my case in justice, he says, and meet him and learn what he would have answered me! See how he obtained exactly what he desired. That is, in fact, what occurs at the end of the book. I wanted to know what he would have said to me and whether he would have punished me just the same; and, by saying so, I had no intention of condemning any injustice on his part. - "Commentary on Job 23.2b"
