For what intent and purpose does the angel say to the women, “Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus”? First to deliver them from dread and then to announce to them the resurrection. He addresses them personally: “I know you seek Jesus who was crucified.” By this he treated them with great honor. To be afraid is not for you but for those that crucified Jesus. The contrast here is between the extreme punishment that awaits those who dared to crucify Jesus and the freedom from fear for those who, having repented, sought after him. It was both by his words and by his appearance that the angel brought them deliverance from fear. The brightness of his appearance was such as to bring good news. He went on to say, “I know that you seek Jesus the crucified.” Note that he is not ashamed to call him “the crucified.” For it is chiefly by his crucifixion that he blesses.
