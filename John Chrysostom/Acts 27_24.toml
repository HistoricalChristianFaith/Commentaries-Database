See how, after such a storm, [Paul] does not speak to them by insulting them but desiring that later they will believe him. Therefore he takes the things he had said as a testimony of the truth of those things he will say. And he predicts two events: first, that they will land on an island, lose the ship, but be safe (and this was a prophecy and not a supposition), and second, that “he had to stand before Caesar.”
