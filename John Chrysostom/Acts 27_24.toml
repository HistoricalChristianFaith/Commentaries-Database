See how, after such a storm, [Paul] does not speak to them by insulting them but desiring that later they will believe him. Therefore he takes the things he had said as a testimony of the truth of those things he will say. And he predicts two events: first, that they will land on an island, lose the ship, but be safe (and this was a prophecy and not a supposition), and second, that "he had to stand before Caesar."

"God hath given thee all them that sail with thee." This is not spoken boastfully, but in the wish to win those who were sailing in the ship: for he spoke thus, not that they might feel themselves bound to him, but that they might believe what he was saying. "God hath given thee;" as much as to say, They are worthy indeed of death, since they would not listen to thee: however, this is done out of favor to thee.
