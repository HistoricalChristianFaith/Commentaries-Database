JOB MEANS TO SAY THIS: there is no memory or trace left of my former prosperity. And that is even worse than my misfortune itself. “Oh, that one would indeed weigh the wrath that is upon me and take up my sorrow in a balance together!” And Job now tries to describe his sorrows. “I perceive my food to be loathsome [as the smell of a lion].” I wish to die, but I do not die. I suffer so because I am a man and not a stone; I am an ephemeral human being, I do not enjoy the aid from above. Among my nearest relations, some pass me by without seeing me; others trample me underfoot. No trace of my former prosperity remains.
