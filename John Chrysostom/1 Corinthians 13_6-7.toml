"Rejoices not in unrighteousness:" i.e., does not feel pleasure over those that suffer ill: and not this only, but also, what is much greater, "rejoices with the truth." "She feels pleasure," says he, "with them that are well spoken of," as Paul says, "Rejoice with them that rejoice, and weep with them that weep." [Romans 12:15]

Hence, she "envies not," hence she "is not puffed up:" since in fact she accounts the good things  of others her own.

Do you see how by degrees love makes her nursling an angel? For when he is void of anger, and pure from envy, and free from every tyrannical passion, consider that even from the nature of man he is delivered from henceforth, and has arrived at the very serenity of angels.

Nevertheless, he is not content with these, but has something even more than these to say: according to his plan of stating the stronger points later. Wherefore he says, "bears all things." From her long-suffering, from her goodness; whether they be burdensome, or grievous, or insults, or stripes, or death, or whatsoever else. And this again one may perceive from the case of blessed David. For what could be more intolerable than to see a son rising up against him, and aiming at the usurpation, and thirsting for a father's blood? Yet this did that blessed one endure, nor even so could he bear to throw out one bitter expression against the parricide; but even when he left all the rest to his captains, gave a strong injunction respecting his safety. For strong was the foundation of his love. Wherefore also it "bears all things."

Now its power the Apostle here intimates, but its goodness, by what follows. For, "it hopes all things," says he, "believes all things, endures all things." What is, "hopes all things?" It does not despair, says he, "of the beloved, but even though he be worthless, it continues to correct, to provide, to care for him."

"Believes all things." "For it does not merely hope," says he, "but also believes from its great affection." And even if these good things should not turn out according to its hope, but the other person should prove yet more intolerable, it bears even these. For, says he, it "endures all things."
