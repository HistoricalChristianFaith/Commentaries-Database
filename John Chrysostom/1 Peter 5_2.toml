Christ said: “He who would be first among you, let him serve, for he who humbles himself will be exalted above all.” What do you mean? If I humble myself, will I then be exalted? Yes, says Jesus. For such is my power that I can turn something into its exact opposite. I am skilled and capable, do not doubt it. The nature of things obeys my will, not the other way round.
