You see, once fear of Laban faded and was no more, then fear of his brother took hold of Jacob; so the loving Lord wanted to give the good man heart and drive out all his apprehension. Thus he caused Jacob to see the angels’ camp. “God’s angels accosted him,” the text says, remember. “Jacob said, ‘This is God’s camp,’ and he called that place Camps,” with the result that from the name there was a constant reminder of the vision that occurred to him there.
