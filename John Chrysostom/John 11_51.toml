Do you see the great power in the high priest’s authority?… Even though he was unworthy of the office of the high priest, he prophesied, although he did not know what he was saying. Divine grace merely made use of his mouth, without touching his corrupt heart.… See how great the power of the Spirit is. It was able to bring forth a marvelous prophecy even from an evil imagination.
