Do you see how great is the force of the High Priest's authority? Or, since he had in any wise been deemed worthy of the High Priesthood, although unworthy thereof, he prophesied, not knowing what he said; and the grace merely made use of his mouth, but touched not his accursed heart. Indeed many others have foretold things to come, although unworthy to do so, as Nebuchadnezzar, Pharaoh, Balaam; and the reason of all is evident. But what he says is of this kind. You still sit quiet, you give heed but carelessly to this matter, and know not how to despise one man's safety for the sake of the community. See how great is the power of the Spirit; from an evil imagination It was able to bring forth words full of marvelous prophecy. The Evangelist calls the Gentiles children of God, from what was about to be: as also Christ Himself says, Other sheep I have John 10:16, so calling them from what should afterwards come to pass.

But what is, being High Priest that year? This matter as well as the rest had become corrupt; for from the time that offices became matters of purchase, they were no longer priests for the whole period of their lives, but for a year. Notwithstanding, even in this state of things the Spirit was still present. But when they lifted up their hands against Christ, then It left them, and removed to the Apostles. This the rending of the veil declared, and the voice of Christ which said, Behold, your house is left unto you desolate. Matthew 23:38 And Josephus, who lived a short time after, says, that certain Angels who yet remained with them, (to see) if they would alter their ways, left them.  While the vineyard stood, all things  went on; but when they had slain the Heir, no longer so, but they perished. And God having taken it from the Jews, as a glorious garment from an unprofitable son, gave it to right-minded servants of the Gentiles, leaving the others desolate and naked. It was, moreover, no small thing that even an enemy should prophesy this. This might draw over others also. For in respect of his  will, matters fell out contrariwise, since,  when He died, the faithful were on this account delivered from the punishment to come. What means, That He might gather together those near and those afar off John 11:52? He made them one Body. The dweller in Rome deems the Indians a member of himself. What is equal to this gathering together? And the Head of all is Christ.

Do you see the great power in the high priest’s authority?… Even though he was unworthy of the office of the high priest, he prophesied, although he did not know what he was saying. Divine grace merely made use of his mouth, without touching his corrupt heart.… See how great the power of the Spirit is. It was able to bring forth a marvelous prophecy even from an evil imagination.
