Then the decree is made in common. "Then pleased it the Apostles and elders, together with the whole Church, to choose men of their own company" - do you observe they do not merely enact these matters, and nothing more? - "and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas: namely, Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren: and they wrote letters by them after this manner." And observe, the more to authenticate the decree, they send men of their own, that there may be no room for regarding Paul and his company with suspicion. There was a design of Providence in the disputation also, that after the disputation the doctrine might be more firm.
