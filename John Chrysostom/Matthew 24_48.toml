After this, as He ever does, not by the honor only laid up for the good, but also by the punishment threatened against the wicked, does He correct the hearers.

But if any one should say, Do you see what a thought has entered into his mind, because of the day's not being known, my Lord, he says, delays His coming? we should affirm, that it was not because the day is not known, but because the servant is evil. Else wherefore came not this thought into the heart of the faithful and wise servant. For what, even though the Lord tarry, O wretched man, surely you look that He will come. Why then do you not take care?

Hence then we learn, that He does not so much as tarry. For this judgment is not the Lord's, but that of the evil servant's mind, wherefore also he is blamed for this. For in proof that He does not tarry, hear Paul saying, The Lord is at hand, be careful for nothing; Philippians 4:5-6 and, He that comes will come, and will not tarry. Hebrews 10:37
