The sailors however, were about to escape, having no faith in what was said: but the centurion does believe Paul. For he says, If these flee, "ye cannot be saved": so saying, not on this account, but that he might restrain them, and the prophecy might not fall to the ground. See how as in a church they are instructed by the calmness of Paul's behavior, how he saved them out of the very midst of the dangers. And it is of providential ordering that Paul is disbelieved, that after proof of the facts, he might be believed: which accordingly was the case.
