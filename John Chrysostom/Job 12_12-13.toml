“In the length of time is wisdom, and in long life knowledge.” In this passage it can be gathered that reason is natural to humanity as well as eating; or, at the beginning he said, “Are you really the only men?” Since I am a man, he means, I can understand what you also understand. “In length of time,” he says, “is wisdom.” It seems to me that he is criticizing them. “Do you believe,” he says, “that you have found out all things?” Even if we possess reason to discern, we need a long time to find out things. “With him are wisdom and power, with him counsel and understanding.” “All wisdom indeed,” he says, “is in God, in his fullness, and it is in him without any need of time.” … Therefore, is it possible that since we know that, we also know all things? I know that the wicked are punished; but I am punished despite my justice, so time is needed to understand this.
