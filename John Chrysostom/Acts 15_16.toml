But if one would look into the matter closely, the kingdom of David does in fact now stand, his Offspring reigning everywhere. For what is the good of the buildings and the city, with none obeying there? And what is the harm arising from the destruction of the city, when all are willing to give their very souls? There is that come which is more illustrious than David: in all parts of the world is he now sung. This has come to pass: if so, then must this also come to pass, And I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up: to what end? that the residue of men may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom My Name is called.
