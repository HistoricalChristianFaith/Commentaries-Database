And by you to pass into Macedonia, and to come again from Macedonia unto you, and of you to be set forward on my journey unto Judæa. When I therefore was thus minded, did I show fickleness?

3. Here in what follows, he directly does away with the charge arising out of his delay and absence. For what he says is of this nature. I was minded to come unto you. 'Wherefore then did I not come? Is it as light-minded and changeable?' for this is, did I show fickleness? By no means. But wherefore? Because what things I purpose, I purpose not according to the flesh. What is, not according to the flesh? I purpose not 'carnally.'

2 Corinthians 1:17. That with me there should be the yea yea and the nay nay.

But still even this is obscure. What is it then he says? The carnal man, that is, he that is rivetted to the present things and is continually occupied in them, and is without the sphere of the Spirit's influence, has power to go every where, and to wander wherever he will. But he that is the servant of the Spirit, and is led, and led about by Him, cannot everywhere be lord of his own purpose, having made it dependent upon the authority thence given; but it so fares with him as if a trusty servant, whose motions are always ruled by his lord's biddings and who has no power over himself nor is able to rest even a little, should make some promise to his fellow-servants, and then because his master would have it otherwise should fail to perform his promise. This then is what he means by, I purpose not according to the flesh. I am not beyond the Spirit's governance, nor have liberty to go where I will. For I am subject to lordship and commands, the Comforter's, and by His decrees I am led, and led about. For this cause I was unable to come, for it was not the Spirit's will. As happened also frequently in the Acts; for when he had purposed to come to one place, the Spirit bade him go to another.  So that it was not from lightness, that is, fickleness in me that I came not, but that being subject to the Spirit I obeyed Him. Did you mark again his accustomed logic? That by which they thought to prove that he purposed according to the flesh, namely, the non-fulfilment of his promise, he uses as the special proof that he purposed according to the Spirit, and that the contrary had been purposing according to the flesh. What then? Says one: was it not with the Spirit that he promised what he did? By no means. For I have already said that Paul did not foreknow every thing that was to happen or was expedient. And it is for this reason that he says in the former Epistle, that you may set me forward on my journey wherever I go; 1 Corinthians 16:6 entertaining this very fear that after he had said, 'into Judæa,' he might be compelled to go elsewhither; but now when his intention had been frustrated, he says it, And of you be set forward on my journey unto Judæa. So much as was of love, he states, namely, the coming to them; but that which had no reference to them, his going, namely, from them into Judæa, he does not add definitely. When however he had been proved wrong , he afterwards says here boldly, toward Judæa. And this too befell for good, lest any among them should conceive of them the Apostles, Acts 14:13 more highly than they deserved. For if in the face of these things they wished to sacrifice bulls to them, upon what impiety would they not have driven, had they not given many instances of human weakness? And why marvel if he knew not all things that were to happen, seeing that ofttimes he even in prayers knows not what is expedient.

For, says he we know not what we should pray for as we ought. And that he may not seem to be speaking modestly, he not only says this, but instances wherein he knew not in prayers what was expedient. Wherein then was it? When he entreated to be delivered from his trials, saying, There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me. Concerning this thing I besought the Lord thrice. And he said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you: for My power is made perfect in weakness. 2 Corinthians 12:7-9 Do you see how he knew not to ask what was expedient, and so although he asked often he obtained not.
