Then those (brethren) also exhorted them: and having established them, for towards Paul they were contentiously disposed, so departed from them in peace. And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed them. And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto the Apostles.

for this also was needful, that (Paul and Barnabas) might be quit of all suspicion. Being prophets also themselves, it says, exhorted the brethren with many words. It shows here the right that Paul and Barnabas have to be believed. For Paul also might have done this, but it behooved to be done by these. And after they had tarried there a space, they were let go in peace.
