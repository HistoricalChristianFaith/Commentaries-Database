What? Is none of these to be punished? No, not if they are willing to repent. [Paul] says this not of the departed but of those whom he is addressing. He does not [yet] call you to account, Paul says. He does not say, “He neglected” or “He permitted,” but “You were ignorant. He overlooked.” That is, he does not exact punishment from you as from people deserving punishment. You were ignorant. And he does not say, “You willfully did wrong,” which is what he showed above when he said, “everywhere to repent.” Here he hints at the whole world. See how he leads them away from the partial deities. “Because he has fixed a day,” he says, “on which he will judge the world in righteousness.” Look, again he uses the expression world, referring thus to humans. “By a man whom he has appointed, by raising him from the dead.” See how he again declares the passion by pointing to the resurrection. That the judgment is true is clear from the resurrection, for the latter helps to establish the former. That everything he said was spoken with truth is clear from the fact that he rose again. That they gave to all people this assurance, that he rose from the dead, this is clear hereafter.

Look, he even introduced the subject of the resurrection of all. For in no other way can the world be judged. The words “by raising him from the dead” are spoken in regard to the body. For this is what was dead, what had fallen.

What do you do, Paul? You say nothing about the form of God nor that he is equal to God or anything concerning the splendor of his glory. Indeed the time to say these things had not yet come, but it was enough that they admitted that he was a man. And Christ did the same, and Paul actually learned these things from him. In fact, Christ did not reveal his divinity immediately, but first Christ was believed to be simply a man and a prophet; then he appeared to be what he really was.
