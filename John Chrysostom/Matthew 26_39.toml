By saying then, “If it be possible, let it pass from me,” he showed his true humanity. But by saying, “Nevertheless not as I will, but as you will,” he showed his virtue and self-command. This too teaches us, even when nature pulls us back, to follow God. In order to make clear that he is truly God and truly human, words alone would not suffice. Deeds were needed. So he joined deeds with words in order that even those who have been highly contentious may believe that he both became man and died. Admittedly some still do not believe that this was so. But many more would have been unable to have believed if his face had not been seen at Gethsemane. See in how many ways he shows the reality of the incarnation. He demonstrates both by what he speaks and by what he suffers.
