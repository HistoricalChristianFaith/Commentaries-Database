Notice how previously, in placing the servant under oath, he instructed him about the Creator of all. Now, as Abraham was about to pray, he used the same words, by every means teaching the servant to have confidence in him and, in this spirit, set out on the journey, as also to trust in its outcome. You see, Abraham teaches him how much favor from the God of all Abraham had enjoyed from the outset and the fact that this same benefactor, who had plucked him from his own country, had managed his fortunes so well to this point. At the height of old age, God had granted him the birth of Isaac and would personally also take care of what lay ahead. “The Lord, the God of heaven and earth, who took me from my father’s house and from the land where I was born,” the same who spoke to me in the words, “I will give this land to you and your descendants,” who has demonstrated such extraordinary care for me, “he will personally send his angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.”

Have confidence, Abraham is saying, and depart. I am convinced that the One who has demonstrated such great kindness in my regard will add this to his former blessings and send his angel before you. He will personally prepare the way before you; he will also personally make the woman known to you; you will take her and return. But should it happen—perish the thought—that she refuses to accompany you, you will be discharged from the obligation of the oath. “Nevertheless don’t take my son there.” You see, I have no doubt that the Lord will take care of you. Showing how he trusted in God’s power, Abraham forbade the servant to conduct Isaac there. Then, after he had given detailed instructions to the servant and relieved him of concern (the servant, after all, was afraid he would be convicted of perjury if he failed to discharge his command), “he placed his hand under his thigh,” the text goes on, “and gave him his oath on this matter,” that he would not take Isaac there.
