6. [Hebrews 4:3] For "we who have believed," he says, "do enter into rest." From what this is evident, he adds: "as He said, as I have sworn in My wrath, if they shall enter into My rest: although the works were finished from the foundation of the world." This indeed, is not evidence that we shall enter in, but that they did not enter in. What then? Thus far he aims to show that as that rest does not hinder the speaking of another rest, so neither does this [exclude] that of Heaven. Up to this point then, he wishes to show that they [the Israelites] did not attain to the rest. For because he means this, he says [Hebrews 4:4-5], "For he spoke in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all His works. And in this place again, if they shall enter into My rest." You see how that does not hinder this from being a rest?
