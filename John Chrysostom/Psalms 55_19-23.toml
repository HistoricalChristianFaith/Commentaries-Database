With this in mind, then, let each of us apply the remedies from Scripture appropriate to ourselves. This, you see, is the reason these matters are freely proposed to everyone: people of good will are able to apply the fitting remedy to the ailment that is threatening them and secure a rapid return to health—provided someone does not resist the healing processes of the treatment but rather gives evidence of personal gratitude. There is, after all, no ailment of soul or body besetting the human race that cannot come to healing from this source. Why is that, tell me? A person comes to this source burdened with care and the pressure of affairs and on that account is overwhelmed with despair on entering—only to hear at once the words of the inspired author, “Why are you grief-stricken, my soul, and why do you trouble me? Hope in God, for I shall praise him, my God, the help of my countenance.” Receiving sufficient encouragement from this, he goes away throwing off all that faintheartedness. Likewise another person is oppressed by poverty and at his last gasp, depressed at seeing others flush with money, full of their own importance and putting on airs; this person in turn hears the words of the same inspired author, “Cast your care on the Lord, and he will sustain you”; and again, “Do not worry when someone becomes rich and the luxury of his house increases, because at his death he will not take any of it with him.” Another person, too, is in dire straits through being subjected to scheming and calumnies and finds life insupportable, unable to find human help from any quarter; but this person too is instructed by this blessed author in the midst of such terrible difficulties not to take refuge in human resource—listen, after all, to his words, “While I remembered them in prayer, they spoke calumnies against me.” Do you see from what source he looks for assistance? Other people, he is saying, concoct schemes and calumnies and plots, whereas I take refuge in the unassailable rampart, in the firm anchor, in the haven waves cannot threaten—that is, in prayer, by means of which all difficulties are made light and easy for me.
