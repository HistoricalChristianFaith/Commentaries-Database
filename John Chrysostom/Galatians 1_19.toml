“And I saw no other but James the brother of the Lord.” See how much greater is his friendship for Peter, for he stayed on his account.… [He says of James] “I saw,” not “I was taught.” But see with what honor he named this man also. For he says not simply James but adds the solemn title. So free of jealousy was he. For had he wished only to indicate whom he meant he could have identified him by another name and called him the son of Clopas, as the Evangelist does.
