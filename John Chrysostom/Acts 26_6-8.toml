"And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?" Two arguments he lays down for the Resurrection: one, the argument from the prophets: and he does not bring forward any prophet in particular, but the doctrine itself as held by the Jews: the other and stronger one, the argument from the facts-especially from this, that Christ Himself held discourse with him. And he lays the ground for this by other arguments, relating accurately his former madness.

Then too, with high commendation of the Jews, he says, "Night and day," says he, "serving God look to attain unto." So that even if I had not been of unblemished life, it is not for this doctrine that I ought to be brought to trial:-"for which hope, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews." And then another argument "Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God should raise the dead?" Since, if such an opinion had not existed, if they had not been brought up in these dogmas, but they were now for the first time brought in, perhaps some one might not have received the saying.

"But, for this hope" he says, "I stand and am judged." This hope is honored among themselves also, because of this they pray, because of this they worship, that unto this they may attain: this same do I show forth. Why then, it is acting like madmen, to be doing all things for the sake of attaining to this, and yet to persecute him who believes in the same.
