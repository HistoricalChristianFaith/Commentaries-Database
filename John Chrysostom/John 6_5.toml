So in the Old [Testament] He spoke to Moses, for He wrought not the sign until He had asked him, What is that in your hand? Because things coming to pass unexpectedly and all at once,  are wont to throw us into forgetfulness of things previous, therefore He first involved him in a confession of present circumstances, that when the astonishment should have come upon him, he might be unable afterwards to drive away the remembrance of what he had confessed, and thus might learn by comparison the greatness of the miracle, which in fact takes place in this instance; for Philip being asked, replied,

This shows that He sat not at any time idly  with the disciples, but perhaps carefully conversing with them, and making them attend  and turn towards Him, a thing which peculiarly marks  His tender care, and the humility and condescension of His demeanor towards them.

Now the other Evangelists say, that the disciples came and asked and besought Him that He would not send them away fasting, while St. John says, that the question was put to Philip by Christ. Both occurrences seem to me to be truly reported, but not to have taken place at the same time, the former account being prior to the other, so that the two are entirely different.

Wherefore then does He ask Philip? He knew which of His disciples needed most instruction; for this is he who afterwards said, Show us the Father, and it suffices us John 14:8, and on this account Jesus was beforehand bringing him into a proper state.  For had the miracle simply been done, the marvel would not have seemed so great, but now He beforehand constrains him to confess the existing want, that knowing the state of matters he might be the more exactly acquainted with the magnitude of the miracle about to take place.

Jesus spoke the same way to Moses in the Old Testament, for he did not bring about a sign until he had asked him, “What is that in your hand?” Because things that happen unexpectedly and all at once are liable to throw us into forgetfulness of what happened previously, Jesus first involved Philip in a confession of the present circumstances. In this way, when the astonishment comes upon him, afterwards he might be unable to drive away the memory of what he had confessed, and thus might learn by comparison the greatness of the miracle, which in fact takes place in this instance.
