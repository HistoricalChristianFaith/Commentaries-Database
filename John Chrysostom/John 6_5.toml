Jesus spoke the same way to Moses in the Old Testament, for he did not bring about a sign until he had asked him, “What is that in your hand?” Because things that happen unexpectedly and all at once are liable to throw us into forgetfulness of what happened previously, Jesus first involved Philip in a confession of the present circumstances. In this way, when the astonishment comes upon him, afterwards he might be unable to drive away the memory of what he had confessed, and thus might learn by comparison the greatness of the miracle, which in fact takes place in this instance.
