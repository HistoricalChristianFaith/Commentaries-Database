Do you see how even Pharaoh realized that these things became clear to Joseph through a revelation from on high? I mean, whom would we find, he is saying, so imbued with grace as to have the spirit of God in him? “He said to Joseph, ‘Since God has revealed all this to you, there is no person more discerning than you.’ ” Consider in this instance how, when the resourceful God wishes to put his decisions into effect, no difficulty can arise from events that occur in the meantime. Witness, for example, the slaughter that nearly occurred, so to say, at the hands of his brothers, the selling, the accusation that led him into the utmost peril, imprisonment for such a long period of time, and how after all this happened to him he was raised, you might almost say, to the royal throne.
