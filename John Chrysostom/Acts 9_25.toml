"Then the disciples took him by night," that the affair might not be suspected, "and let him down by the wall in a basket." What then? having escaped such a danger, does he flee? By no means, but goes where he kindled them to greater rage.

"Then the disciples," etc. Of this occurrence he says: "The ethnarch of Aretas the king kept the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to apprehend me." But observe the Writer here, that he does not tell the story ambitiously, and so as to show what an important person Paul was, saying, "For they stirred up the king," and so forth: but only, "Then the disciples took him by night, and let him down by the wall-in a basket:" for they sent him out alone, and none with him. And it was well they did this: the consequence being, that he showed himself to the Apostles in Jerusalem. Now they sent him out, as bound to provide for his safety by flight: but he did just the contrary-he leaped into the midst of those who were mad against him.

This is to be on fire, this to be fervent indeed! From that day forth he knew all the commands which the Apostles had heard: "Except a man take up his cross, and follow Me." The very fact that he had been slower to come than the rest made him more zealous: for "to whom much is forgiven" the same will love more, so that the later he came, the more he loved: and having done ten thousand wrongs, he thought he could never do enough to cast the former deeds into the shade.

That he fled from Damascus, this was no cowardice: he preserved himself for the preaching. Had he been a coward, he would not have gone to Jerusalem, would not immediately have commenced teaching: he would have abated somewhat of his vehemence: for he had been taught by the fate of Stephen. He was no coward, but he was also prudent in husbanding himself. Wherefore he thought it no great thing to die for the Gospel's sake, unless he should do this to great advantage: willing not even to see Christ, Whom most of all he longed to see, while the work of his stewardship among men was not yet complete.
