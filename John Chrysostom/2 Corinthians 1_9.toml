Paul was expecting death, but things had not come to that point. In the natural course of events, he should have died, but God did not allow that to happen in order that Paul would learn not to trust in himself but in God.

"But we had the answer of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God which raises the dead."

What is this, "the answer of death?"  The vote, the judgment, the expectation. For so spoke our affairs; our fortunes gave this answer, "We shall surely die."

To be sure, this did not come to the proof, but only as far as to our anticipations, and stopped there: for the nature of our affairs did so declare, yet the power of God allowed not the declaration to take effect, but permitted it to happen only in our thought and in expectation: wherefore he says, "We had the answer of death in ourselves," not in fact.  And wherefore permitted He peril so great as to take away our hope and cause us to despair? "That we should not trust in ourselves," says he, "but in God." These words Paul said, not that this was his own temper. Away with such a thought, but as attuning  the rest by what he says of himself, and in his great care to speak modestly. Whence also further on he says, "There was given to me a thorn in the flesh, (meaning his trials,) lest I should be exalted overmuch." [2 Corinthians 12:7] And yet God does not say that He permitted them for this, but for another reason. What other? That His strength might be the more displayed; "For," says he, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is made perfect in weakness." [2 Corinthians 1:9] But, as I said, he no where forgets his own peculiar character, classing himself with those who fall short exceedingly and stand in need of much discipline and correction. For if one or two trials suffice to sober even ordinary men, how should he who of all men had most cultivated lowliness of mind his whole life long and had suffered as no other man did, after so many years and a practice of wisdom  worthy of the heavens, be in need of this admonition? Whence it is plain that here too, it is from modesty and to calm down those who thought highly of themselves and boasted, that he thus speaks, "That we should not trust in ourselves, but in God."

And observe how he treats them tenderly  here also. For, says he, these trials were permitted to come upon us for your sakes; of so great price  are you in God's sight; for "whether we be afflicted," says he, "it is for your consolation and salvation;" but they were "out of measure" for our sake, lest we should be high minded. "For we were weighed down exceedingly, beyond our power, that we should not trust in ourselves, but in God that raises the dead." He again puts them in mind of the doctrine of the Resurrection whereon he said so much in the former Epistle, and confirms it from the present circumstance; whence he added,
