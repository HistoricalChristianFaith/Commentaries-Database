"Furthermore, we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us, and we gave them reverence." Again, he reasons from their own experiences, from what they themselves suffered. For as he says above, "Call to mind the former days," so here also "God" (he saith) "dealeth with you as with sons," and ye could not say, We cannot bear it: yea, "as with sons" tenderly beloved. For if they reverence their "fathers of the flesh," how shall not you reverence your heavenly Father?

"Furthermore," he saith, "we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in subjection to the Father of spirits, and live?" ("To the Father of spirits," whether of spiritual gifts, or of prayers, or of the incorporeal powers.) If we die thus, then "we shall live. For they indeed for a few days chastened us after their own pleasure," for what seems so is not always profitable, but "He for our profit."
