“I have torn all that was received unjustly.” Without boasting, I have torn what I had received. And the expression “on my shoulders” suggests that some [of his friends] gloried in the afflictions of the others; and I did not content myself with giving it back simply, but I nullified it by tearing it. “I have torn all that was received unjustly.”
