From the baptism itself he (John) prophesies: and he leads them (to see) that this is the meaning of John's baptism. (a) That they should believe in Him that was to come: on what kind (of Person)? I indeed baptize you with water, but He that comes after me, shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost. Matthew 3:11 And when Paul, it says, had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Ghost came on them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.
