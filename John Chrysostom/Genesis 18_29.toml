Who could worthily praise the God of all for his marvelous long suffering and considerateness or congratulate the good man for enjoying such great confidence? “He continued to speak,” the text goes on. “ ‘But what if only forty can be found there?’ He replied, ‘For the sake of the forty I will not destroy it.’ ” Then at that point the good man, while respecting God’s ineffable long suffering and being afraid of ever seeming to go too far and surpass the limit in his entreaty, said, “Pardon me, Lord, if I continue to speak: if only thirty can be found there?” Since he saw God was disposed to kindness, he still did not proceed gradually with his compromise. He sought to rescue not merely five good people but ten in pursuing his request thus, “If only thirty can be found there?” He replied, “I will not destroy it if I find thirty there.” Consider the degree of the good man’s persistence. As though he personally were due to be liable for sentence, he takes great pains to snatch the people of Sodom from the impending punishment. “He said, ‘Since I am able to speak to the Lord, what if there are only twenty there?’ He replied, ‘For the sake of the twenty I will not destroy it.’ ” O, the goodness of the Lord beyond all telling and all imagining! I mean, which of us living in the middle of countless evils could ever choose to exercise such wonderful considerateness and loving kindness in executing a sentence against our peers?
