But what is “new”? He will drink it new as having an immortal and incorruptible body, a spiritual body. He will not drink out of need for drink. For it is not a body that suffers or has bodily needs. It was not because he needed to eat and drink after the resurrection that he spoke in this way of that which is new but in order to give them full assurance of his resurrection. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

For because he had discoursed with them concerning his Passion and cross, he again introduces what he has to say about his resurrection. Here he speaks of “my Father’s kingdom,” which was his way of speaking of his own resurrection. And in what sense did he drink after he was raised again? We must answer carefully to guard against those of low mind who might suppose the resurrection was merely an appearance. The apostles understood themselves after the resurrection to have eaten and drunk with him. He said this to show them that they would see him manifestly risen and that he would be with them once more. They themselves were to be witnesses to these events, in that they both saw them and experienced them. So he says, I will not drink the fruit of this vine again with you “until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father’s kingdom.” You will see me rise again. You will bear witness to my resurrection. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

Do you see how much diligence has been used, that it should be ever borne in mind that He died for us? For since the Marcionists, and Valentinians, and Manichæans were to arise, denying this dispensation, He continually reminds us of the passion even by the mysteries, (so that no man should be deceived); at once saving, and at the same time teaching by means of that sacred table. For this is the chief of the blessings; wherefore Paul also is in every way pressing this.

Then, when He had delivered it, He says, I will not drink of the fruit of this wine, until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. For because He had discoursed with them concerning passion and cross, He again introduces what He has to say of His resurrection, having made mention of a kingdom before them, table, and rise up in drunkenness, whereas it were meet to give thanks, and end with an hymn.

He gave thanks to instruct us after what manner we ought to celebrate this mystery, and showed also thereby that He came not to His Passion against His will. Also He taught us to bear whatsoever we suffer with thanksgiving, and infused into us good hopes. For if the type of this sacrifice, to wit, the offering of the paschal lamb, became the deliverance of the people from Egyptian bondage, much more shall the reality thereof be the deliverance of the world.“And gave it to them, saying, Drink ye allof it.” That they should not be distressed at hearing this, He first drank His own blood to lead them without fear to the communion of these mysteries.
“This is my blood of the new testament;” that is, the new promise, covenant, law; for this blood was promised from of old, and this guarantees the new covenant; for as the Old Testament had the blood of sheep and goats, so the New has the Lord’s Blood.
And in calling it blood, He foreshews His Passion, “My blood . which shall beshed for many.” Also the purpose for which He died, adding, “For the remission of sins;” as much as to say, The blood of the lamb was shed in Egypt for the salvation of the first born of the Israelites, this My Blood is shed for there mission of sins.
Thus saying, He shows that His Passion is a mystery of the salvation of men, by which also He comforts His disciples. And as Moses said, “This shall be an ordinance to thee for ever,”
