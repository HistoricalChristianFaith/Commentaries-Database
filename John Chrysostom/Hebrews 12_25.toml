"See that ye refuse not Him that speaketh"; that is, that ye reject Him not. "For if they escaped not who refused Him that spake on earth." Whom does he mean? Moses, I suppose. But what he says is this: if they, having "refused Him" when He gave laws "on earth, did not escape," how shall we refuse Him, when He gives laws from Heaven? He declares here not that He is another; far from it. He does not set forth One and Another, but He appears terrible, when uttering His Voice "from Heaven." It is He Himself then, both the one and the other: but the One is terrible. For he expresses not a difference of Persons but of the gift. Whence does this appear? "For if they escaped not," he says, "who refused Him that spake on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from Him that speaketh from heaven." What then? Is this one different from the other? How then does he say, "whose voice then shook the earth"? For it was the "voice" of Him who "then" gave the Law, which "shook the earth."
