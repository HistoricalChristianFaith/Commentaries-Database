What then says Christ? Not even with all this was He satisfied, but He makes her perplexity yet more intense again, saying,

It is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast it to the dogs. Matthew 15:26

And when He vouchsafed her a word, then He smote her more sharply than by His silence. And no longer does He refer the cause to another, nor say, I am not sent, but the more urgent she makes her entreaty, so much the more does He also urge His denial. And He calls them no longer sheep, but children, and her a dog.

What then says the woman? Out of His own very words she frames her plea. Why, though I be a dog, said she, I am not an alien.

Justly did Christ say, For judgment am I come. John 9:32 The woman practises high self-command, and shows forth all endurance and faith, and this, receiving insult; but they, courted and honored, requite it with the contrary.

For, that food is necessary for the children, says she, I also know; yet neither am I forbidden, being a dog. For were it unlawful to receive, neither would it be lawful to partake of the crumbs; but if, though in scanty measure, they ought to be partakers, neither am I forbidden, though I be a dog; nay, rather on this ground am I most surely a partaker, if I am a dog.

With this intent did Christ put her off, for He knew she would say this; for this did He deny the grant, that He might exhibit her high self-command.

For if He had not meant to give, neither would He have given afterwards, nor would He have stopped her mouth again. But as He does in the case of the centurion, saying, I will come and heal him, Matthew 8:7 that we might learn the godly fear of that man, and might hear him say, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof; Matthew 8:8 and as He does in the case of her that had the issue of blood, saying, I perceive that virtue has gone out of me, Luke 8:46 that He might make her faith manifest; and as in the case of the Samaritan woman, that He might show how not even upon reproof she desists: John 4:18 so also here, He would not that so great virtue in the woman should be hid. Not in insult then were His words spoken, but calling her forth, and revealing the treasure laid up in her.

But do thou, I pray you, together with her faith see also her humility. For He had called the Jews children, but she was not satisfied with this, but even called them masters; so far was she from grieving at the praises of others.
