Why, having passed by the others, does he speak with Peter on these matters? He does so because he was the chosen one of the apostles, the mouthpiece of the disciples and the leader of the band. This is why Paul went up, at one time, to inquire of him rather than of the others. And at the same time he does this to show him that he must now be joyful since the denial was put behind him. And so, Jesus entrusts to him primacy over his brothers. He does not bring up the denial, nor does he reproach him for what had taken place. Rather, he says, If you love me, preside over your brothers, and now show them the warmth of love that you have always shown and in which you rejoiced. And the life that you said you would lay down for me, now give for my sheep.

There are indeed many other things that are able to give us boldness toward God and to show us bright and approved, but that which most of all brings good will from on high is tender care for our neighborâ€”which is what Christ requires of Peter here.
