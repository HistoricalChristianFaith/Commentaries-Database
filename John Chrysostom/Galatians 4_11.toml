Do you see the compassion of the apostle? They were being corrupted. He trembles and fears. Therefore he expresses this in a very solicitous manner, saying “I labored for you,” as if to say, “Do not render such strenuous toils ineffectual for me.” In saying “I fear” … he has both stirred them up for a contest and directed them toward better hopes.
