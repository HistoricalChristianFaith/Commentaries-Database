"And having taken him, they brought him to the Areopagus" - not to punish, but in order to learn - "to the Areopagus" where the trials for murder were held. Thus observe, in hope of learning they ask him, saying, "May we know what is this new doctrine spoken of by thee? For thou bringest certain strange matters to our ears": everywhere novelty is the charge: "we would fain know therefore, what these things may mean." It was a city of talkers, that city of theirs. "For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing."

"And having taken him, they brought him," etc. The Athenians no longer enjoyed their own laws, but were become subject to the Romans. Then why did they hale him to the Areopagus? Meaning to overawe him - the place where they held the trials for bloodshed. "May we know, what is this new doctrine spoken of by thee? For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears; we would fain know therefore what these things mean. For all the Athenians and strangers which were there spent their time in nothing else, but either to tell, or to hear some new thing." Here the thing noted is, that though ever occupied only in this telling and hearing, yet they thought those things strange - things which they had never heard.
