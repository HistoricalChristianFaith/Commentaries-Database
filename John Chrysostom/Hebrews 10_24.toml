And again in other places, The Lord is at hand; be careful for nothing. Philippians 4:5-6 For now is our salvation nearer: Henceforth the time is short. Romans 13:11

What is, not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together? 1 Corinthians 7:29 He knew that much strength arises from being together and assembling together. For where two or three (it is said) are gathered together in My name, there am I in the midst of them Matthew 18:20; and again, That they may be One, as we also are John 17:11; and, They had all one heart and [one] soul. Acts 4:32 And not this only, but also because love is increased by the gathering [of ourselves] together; and love being increased, of necessity the things of God must follow also. And earnest prayer (it is said) was made by the people. Acts 12:5 As the manner of some is. Here he not only exhorted, but also blamed [them].

And let us consider one another, he says, to provoke unto love and to good works. He knew that this also arises from gathering together. For as iron sharpens iron Proverbs 17:17, so also association increases love. For if a stone rubbed against a stone sends forth fire, how much more soul mingled with soul! But not unto emulation (he says) but unto the sharpening of love. What is unto the sharpening of love? Unto the loving and being loved more. And of good works; that so they might acquire zeal. For if doing has greater force for instruction than speaking, you also have in your number many teachers, who effect this by their deeds.

What is let us draw near with a true heart? That is, without hypocrisy; for woe be to a fearful heart, and faint hands Sirach 2:12: let there be (he means) no falsehood among us; let us not say one thing and think another; for this is falsehood; neither let us be fainthearted, for this is not [a mark] of a true heart. Faintheartedness comes from not believing. But how shall this be? If we fully assure ourselves through faith.

Having our hearts sprinkled: why did he not say having been purified? [Because] he wished to point out the difference of the sprinklings: the one he says is of God, the other our own. For the washing and sprinkling the conscience is of God; but the drawing near with truth and in full assurance of faith is our own. Then he also gives strength to their faith from the truth of Him that promised.

What is and having our bodies washed with pure water? With water which makes pure; or which has no blood.
