Now if Timothy come to you  , see that he be with you without fear.

Perhaps some one may think there is something unworthy of Timothy's courage in this piece of advice. But not on Timothy's account is this said, but for the hearers' sake: lest by their design against him they should hurt themselves: since he for his part had his station always in the way of dangers.

"For as a child serves a father," says he, "so he served with me in furtherance of the Gospel." [Philippians 2:22] But lest from boldness towards the disciple they should proceed also to the teacher, and become worse, he checks them from afar off, saying, "that he may be with you without fear;" that is, that none of those desperate persons rise up against him. For he intended perhaps to rebuke them about the things concerning which Paul also had written: and indeed Paul professed to send him for this very reason. "For I have sent Timothy unto you," says he, [1 Corinthians 4:17] "who shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ even as I teach every where in every Church." In order then that they might not through confidence in their high birth and wealth, and the support of the people, and the wisdom from without, attack him and spit upon him and plot against him, being grieved at the reproofs which came from him; or lest in revenge for the teacher's rebuke they should demand satisfaction of him, so punishing the other; therefore he says, "that he be without fear with you." As if he had said, "Tell me not of those who are without, the Gentiles and unbelievers. It is your part that I require, you for whom also the whole Epistle was composed," the persons also whom in the beginning and the outset he had frightened. Wherefore he says, "with you."

Then in virtue of his ministry he sets him forth as a person to be fully trusted; saying "For the work of the Lord he works." That is; "look not," says he, "to this, his not being rich, namely, nor highly educated, nor old: but what commands are laid upon him, what work he is doing. 'For the work of the Lord he works.'" And this serves him instead of all nobility and wealth and age and wisdom.

And he is not content with this, but adds, "Even as I also." And some way above, "Who is my beloved son and faithful in the Lord; he shall put you in remembrance of my ways in Christ." Seeing then that he was both young, and had been singly entrusted with the improvement of so numerous a people, both of which things tended to bring him into contempt, he adds, as we might expect,

It might be thought that this is some criticism of Timothyâ€™s self-confidence, but Paul says this for the sake of the Corinthians, because if they turn against him they will only hurt themselves.
