For what reason then does he write only to Titus and Timothy? It is because he had already committed the care of churches to them, and certain specified places had been assigned to them, but the others were listening in to what he said to them. For so preeminent in virtue was Timothy that his youth was no impediment to his promotion; therefore he writes, “Let no man despise your youth.” … For where there is virtue, all other things are superfluous, and there can be no impediment.
