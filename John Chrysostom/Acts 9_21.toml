"But all that heard him were amazed, and said: Is not this he that destroyed them which called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for that intent, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?" And with this very thing, he put all in fear: for, said they, Hither also is he come for this very thing. They were reduced to utter incredulity. And yet they ought not to have wondered only, but to worship and reverence. "Is not this he," etc. He had not merely been a persecutor, but "destroyed them which called on this Name"-they did not say, "on Jesus;" for hatred, they could not bear even to hear His name-and what is more marvellous still, "and came hither for this purpose," etc. "We cannot say, that he associated with the Apostles before." See by how many witnesses he is confessed to have been of the number of the enemies!
