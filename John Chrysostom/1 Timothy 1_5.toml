“Because of the increase of wickedness, the love of most will grow cold.” It is this that has been the occasion of all heresies. For those who do not love their brothers and sisters easily come to envy those in high repute. From envying, they have become eager for power, and from a love of power have introduced heresies. On this account Paul having said, “that you might charge some that they teach no other doctrine,” now shows that the manner in which this may be effected is by charity.
