And not even when they had knocked did they obtain, but they heard that fearful saying, Depart, I know you not. Matthew 25:12 And when He has said this, nothing else but hell is left, and that intolerable punishment; or rather, this word is more grievous even than hell. This word He speaks to them also that work iniquity.
