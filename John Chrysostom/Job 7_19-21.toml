What does Job mean when he says, “What shall I be able to do for you?” What should I do in order to expiate my fault, in order to be reconciled with you? “O you who understand the human mind, why did you make me to be your accuser?” Job speaks this way not because he accuses God—God forbid!—but because what has happened to him raises a serious accusation against God. That is why he says, “You who understand the human mind.” Even if they do not speak, you know their secret thoughts and all their intimate reflections, “such a righteous man has suffered such tremendous misfortunes!” But Job does not have the attitude of a man who tries to justify himself. In fact, he has not said, “I am righteous.” Rather, they are deeply concerned about me, and that is why they have complained against you because of my trials.
