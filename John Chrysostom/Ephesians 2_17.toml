Peace, says he, that peace which is towards God. He has reconciled us. For the Lord Himself also says, Peace I leave with you; my peace I give unto you. John 14:27 And again, Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world. John 16:33 And again, Whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do. John 14:14 And again, For the Father loves you. John 16:27 These are so many evidences of peace. But how towards the Gentiles? Because through Him we both have our access in one Spirit unto the Father, not ye less, and they more, but all by one and the same grace. The wrath He appeased by His death, and has made us meet for the Father's love through the Spirit. Mark again, the in means by or through. By Himself and the Spirit that is, He has brought us unto the Father. So then you are no more strangers and sojourners, but fellow citizens with the saints.

Perceive ye that it is not with the Jews simply, no, but with those saintly and great men, such as Abraham, and Moses, and Elias? It is for the self-same city with these we are enrolled, for that we declare ourselves. For they that say such things, says he, make it manifest that they are seeking after a country of their own. Hebrews 11:14 No longer are we strangers from the saints, nor foreigners. For they who shall not attain to heavenly blessings, are foreigners. For the Son, says Christ, abides for ever. John 8:35
