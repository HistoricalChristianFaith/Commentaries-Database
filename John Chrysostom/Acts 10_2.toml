Observe with whom the beginning of the Gentiles is made— with a devout man, and one proved to be worthy by his works.

that you may not imagine that it is because of his high station that these things are done.— When Paul was to be brought over, there is no angel, but the Lord Himself: and He does not send him to some great one, but to a very ordinary person: but here, on the contrary, He brings the chief Apostle (to these Gentiles), not sends them to him: herein condescending to their weakness, and knowing how such persons need to be treated. As indeed on many occasions we find Christ Himself hasting (to such), as being more infirm. Or (it may be) because (Cornelius) was not able himself to leave his home. But here again is a high commendation of alms, just as was there given by means of Tabitha. A devout man, it says, and one that feared God with all his house. Let us hear this, whoever of us neglect them of our own house, whereas this man was careful of his soldiers also. And that gave alms, it says, to all the people. Both his doctrines and his life were right. He saw in a vision evidently, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
