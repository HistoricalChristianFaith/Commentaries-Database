"To Him give all the prophets witness, that through His name, whosoever believeth in Him shall receive remission of sins." This is a proof of that which was about to be: this is the reason why he here cites the Prophets.

"To him give all the Prophets witness," etc. When by the terror he has agitated them, then he brings in the pardon, not spoken from himself but from the Prophets. And what is terrifying is from him, what is mild from the Prophets.
