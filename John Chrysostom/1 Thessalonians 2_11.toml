As ye know how we exhorted and comforted each one of you, as a father does his own children. Above having spoken of his behavior here he speaks of his love, which was more than what belonged to his rule over them. And what is said marks his freedom from pride. As a father his own children, exhorting you, and encouraging you, and testifying, to the end that you should walk worthily of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. When he says, and testifying, then he makes mention of fathers; although we testified, it was not violently, but like fathers. Each one of you. Strange! In so great a multitude to omit no one, neither small nor great, neither rich nor poor. Exhorting you, he says; to bear. And comforting and testifying. Exhorting, therefore they did not seek glory; and testifying, therefore they did not flatter. That ye should walk worthily of God, who calls you into His own kingdom and glory. Observe again, how, in relating, he both teaches and comforts. For if He has called them unto His kingdom, if He called them unto glory, they ought to endure all things. We entreat you, not that you should grant us any favor, but that you should gain the kingdom of heaven.
