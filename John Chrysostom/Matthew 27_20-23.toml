Since the crowd asked for the other, Pilate said, “What shall I do then with the Christ?” In this way he was trying to make them embarrassed, by giving them the power to choose, that at least out of shame they might release him and their generosity could be expressed. It made them contentious to hear it said that he had done no wrong. Yet they were being given an opportunity to save him out of humanity. Surely this is an offer whose plausibility cannot be disputed.
