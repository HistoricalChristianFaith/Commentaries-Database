Do you see how by their contentious behavior they extended the preaching further and [how the apostles] gave themselves the more to the Gentiles, having made their defense and cleared themselves of indictments from their own people?… Through their jealousy they brought it about that the apostles spoke out boldly and went to the Gentiles. For this is why he said, “Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, ‘It was necessary that the word of God should be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it from you and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.’ ” They were about to go out to the Gentiles. But notice how the boldness is accompanied with measure. For if Peter defended himself, much more are these in need of a defense, since no one had called them there. And by saying “first,” he showed that to those as well it was their duty [to preach], and by saying “necessary,” he showed that it was necessary to preach to them as well. “Since you turn away,” he does not say, “woe to you” and “you are punished,” but “we turn to the Gentiles.” The boldness is full of much gentleness.
