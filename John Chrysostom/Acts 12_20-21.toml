Why does he mention this history? Say, what has it to do with the Gospel, that Herod is incensed with the Tyrians and Sidonians? It is not a small matter, even this, how immediately justice seized him; although not because of Peter, but because of his arrogant speaking. "And he went down from Judea to Caesarea, and there abode. And Herod was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon." He is now going to mention a matter of history: this is the reason why he adds the names, that it may be shown how he keeps to the truth in all things. "And," it says, "having made Blastus the king's chamberlain their friend, they desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king's country." For probably there was a famine. I suppose it was also to bring those men of Tyre and Sidon to apologize, that he withdrew from Jerusalem: for with those he was incensed, while paying such court to these. See how vainglorious the man is: meaning to confer the boon upon them, he makes an harangue. But Josephus says, that he was also arrayed in a splendid robe made of silver.
