As though he said, I have with me three, five, or ten thousand. What then? Has the people come to be  three, five, or ten thousand? That seed that compared with the stars of heaven for multitude, or the sand of the sea? Is this the way you deceive us and put a cheat upon us, by making the whole people yourself and the few that are with you; and did you inflate us with idle hopes, and say that the promise has been fulfilled, when all are lost, and the salvation comes down to a few?

What then is the answer?
