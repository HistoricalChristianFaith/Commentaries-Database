He knew this from the first, and plans his discourse beforehand (with a view to it). Gentiles? What Gentiles henceforth? They were no longer Gentiles, the Truth having come. It is nothing wonderful, he says, if before the act of baptism they received the Spirit: in our own case this same happened. Peter shows that not as the rest either were they baptized, but in a much better way. This is the reason why the thing takes place in this manner, that they may have nothing to say, but even in this way may account them equal with themselves.

And why did he not speak of the linen sheet? Observe Peter's freedom from all vainglory: but, that he is sent of God, this indeed he mentions; of the manner in which he was sent, he speaks not at present; when the need has arisen, seeing he had said, You know that it is unlawful for a man that is a Jew to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another nation, he simply adds, but to me God has shown, etc. There is nothing of vainglory here. All you, he says, know. He makes their knowledge stand surety for him. But Cornelius says, We are present before God to hear all things that are commanded you of the Lord
