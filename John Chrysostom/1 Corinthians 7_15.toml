"Yet if the unbelieving departs, let him depart," for in this case the matter is no longer fornication. But what is the meaning of, "if the unbelieving departs?" For instance, if he bid you sacrifice and take part in his ungodliness on account of your marriage, or else part company; it were better the marriage were annulled, and no breach made in godliness. Wherefore he adds, "A brother is not under bondage, nor yet a sister, in such cases." If day by day he buffet you and keep up combats on this account, it is better to separate. For this is what he glances at, saying, "But God has called us in peace." For it is the other party who furnished the ground of separation, even as he did who committed uncleanness.
