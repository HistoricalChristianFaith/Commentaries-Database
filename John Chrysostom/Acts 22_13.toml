Lo! Again another witness. And see how unexceptionable he makes him also. And one Ananias, he says, a devout man according to the law,— so far is it from being anything alien!— having a good report of all the Jews that dwelt (there). And I in the same hour received sight. Then follows the testimony borne by the facts. Observe how it is interwoven, of persons and facts; and the persons, both of their own and of aliens: the priests, the elders, and his fellow-travellers: the facts, what he did and what was done to him: and facts bear witness to facts, not persons only. Then Ananias, an alien; then the fact itself, the recovery of sight; then a great prophecy. And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen you, that you should know His will, and see That Just One.
