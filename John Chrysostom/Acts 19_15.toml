"Jesus I know, and Paul I know." For, that there may not seem to be any slight put upon the Name of Jesus, the demon first confesses Him, and then has permission given him. For, to show that it was not any weakness of the Name, but all owing to the imposture of those men, why did not the same take place in the case of Paul? "They fled out of that house naked and wounded": he sorely battered their heads, perhaps rent their garments. "Jesus," says he, "I know," etc. Be ashamed, ye that are ignorant of Him. "And Paul I know." Well said, "Think not that it is because I despise them, that I do these things." Great was the fear of the demon. And why without these words did he not rend their garments? For so he would both have sated his wrath, and established the delusion. He feared as I said, the unapproachable force, and would not have had such power had he not said this.
