"In the Lord" either means spiritually and with much zeal, or rather "in the Lord" means God willing. Receive him in a manner worthy of saints, as saints should be received with all joy.

All this he does for their sakes, not for that of his messengers, for greater gain has the doer than the receiver of a good deed. "And such hold in honor," that is, receive him in a manner worthy of saints.

“Receive him in the Lord”—this means spiritually, that is, with great eagerness. It means receive him in the Lord because it is God’s will. “Give him, as saints ought to do, the reception due to a saint, with all joy.” Paul says this for the sake of the congregation rather than Epaphroditus. The profit of doing good is greater than that of receiving reward.
