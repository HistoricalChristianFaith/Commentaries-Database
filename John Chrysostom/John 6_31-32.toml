He calls this the “true bread,” not because the miracle of the manna was false but because it was a type and not the very truth itself. But in mentioning Moses, Jesus does not compare himself with him, for the Jews did not as yet prefer him to Moses, of whom they still had a higher opinion. So that after saying, “Moses did not give,” he does not say “I give” but says that the Father, and not Moses, gives. When they heard this, the people replied, “Give us this bread to eat.” They still thought that it was something material, and they yet expected to satisfy their appetites, and so they quickly ran to him. And what does Christ do? Leading them on little by little, he says, “The bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.”
