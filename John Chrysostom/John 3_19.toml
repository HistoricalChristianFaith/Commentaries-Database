They are punished because they would not leave the darkness and hurry to the light.… Had I come to demand an accounting of their deeds, they might have been able to say that was the reason they stayed away. But now I have come to free them from the darkness and to bring them to the light. Who can pity the person who does not choose to approach the light when it comes to him but would rather remain in the darkness?

Then, because it seemed incredible that someone should prefer the light to darkness, he gives the reason for the infatuation, that is, that their deeds were evil.… Indeed, if he had come for judgment, there would have at least been a reason for not receiving him because one who is conscious of his crimes naturally avoids the judge. But criminals practically run to meet one who brings them pardon. Therefore, it might have been expected that those who are conscious of their sins would have gone to meet Christ, as many indeed did. Publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus.… But the majority was too cowardly to undergo the work of virtue for righteousness’ sake, and they persisted in their wickedness to the end.… They are always doing evil and looking for ways to roll around in the mire of sin, with no desire to subject themselves to my laws.
