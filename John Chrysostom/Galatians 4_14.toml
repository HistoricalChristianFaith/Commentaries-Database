Ver. 14. "But you received me as an Angel of God."

Was it not then absurd in them to receive him as an Angel of God, when he was persecuted and driven about, and then not to receive him when pressing on them what was fitting?

What is he saying? “I was persecuted, I was flogged, I underwent many near-deaths in preaching to you, and even so you did not despise me.” For that is the meaning of “you did not scorn or despise me.” Do you perceive his spiritual understanding? For even in the course of his self-defense he continues to exhort them anew, showing what he has suffered on their account.

Do you see the absurdity of receiving him as an angel of God when pursued and persecuted but not receiving him when he commands what is necessary?
