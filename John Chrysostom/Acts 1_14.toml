"These were all continuing with one accord in prayer together with the women." For this is a powerful weapon in temptations; and to this they had been trained. "Continuing with one accord." Good. Besides, the present temptation directed them to this: for they exceedingly feared the Jews. "With the women," it is said: for he had said that they had followed Him: "and with Mary the mother of Jesus." How then is it said, that "that disciple" took her to his own home, at that time? But then the Lord had brought them together again, and so returned.

"And they continued," it is said, "with one accord in prayer." Do you see how watchful they were? "Continuing in prayer," and "with one accord," as it were with one soul, continuing therein: two things reported in their praise.

"And Mary the Mother of Jesus and His brethren." Now Joseph perhaps was dead: for it is not to be supposed that when the brethren had become believers, Joseph believed not; he who in fact had believed before any. Certain it is that we nowhere find him looking upon Christ as man merely.
