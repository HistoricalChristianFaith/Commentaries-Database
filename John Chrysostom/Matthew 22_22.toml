When they heard these things, their mouths were stopped, and they marvelled at His wisdom. Ought they not then to have believed, ought they not to have been amazed. For indeed, He gave them proof of His Godhead, by revealing the secrets of their hearts, and with gentleness did He silence them.

What then? Did they believe? By no means, but they left Him, and went their way; and after them, came to Him the Sadducees.

As when one seeks to dam a stream of running water, as soon as one outlet is stopped up it makes another channel for itself; so the malevolence of the Jews, foiled on one hand, seeks itself out another course. "Then went the Pharisees; went” to theHerodians. Such as the plan was, such were the planners; “They send unto Him their disciples with the Herodians.”.
Hom. lxx: They send their disciples and Herod’s soldiers together, that whatever opinion He might give might be found fault with. Yet would they rather have had Him say somewhat against the Herodians; for being themselves afraid tolay hands on Him because of the populace, they sought to bring Him into danger through His liability to pay tribute.
This is the commonest act of hypocrites, to commend those they would ruin. Thus, these break out into praises of Him, saying, “Master, we know that Thouart true.” They call Him Master, that, deceived by this show of honour and respect, He might in simplicity open all His heart to them, as seeking to gain them for disciples.
This was a covert allusion to Herod and Caesar.
They knew that certain had before suffered death for this very thing, as plotting a rebellion against the Romans, therefore they sought by such discourse to bring Him into the same suspicion.
He therefore calls them hypocrites, that seeing Him to be a discerner of human hearts, they might not be hardy enough to carry through their design. Observe thus how the Pharisees spoke fair that they might destroy Him, but Jesus put them to shame that He might save them; for God’s wrath is more profitable toman, than man’s favour.
But when you hear this command to render to Caesar the things of Caesar, know that such things only are intended which in nothing are opposed to religion; if such there be, it is no longer Caesar’s but the Devil’s tribute. And moreover, that they might not say that He was subjecting them to man, He adds, “And unto God the things that are God’s.”
