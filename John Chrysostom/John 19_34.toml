Yet the soldiers, in order to gratify the Jews, pierced his side with a spear and now insulted the dead body. O abominable and accursed purpose! Yet, beloved, do not be confused or despondent. What these men did from a wicked will fought on the side of the truth, since there was a prophecy that spoke concerning this very circumstance: “They shall look on him whom they pierced.” And not only this, but this deed would become evidence to confirm the faith of those who should afterward disbelieve, as it was for Thomas and those like him. With this too an ineffable mystery was accomplished. For “there came forth water and blood.” Not without purpose or by chance did those fountains spring forth. Rather, it is because the church consists of these two together. And those who have been initiated know this, being regenerated indeed by water and nourished by the blood and the flesh. And so, the mysteries take their beginning. In this way, when you approach that awesome cup, you may so approach as though you were drinking from his very side.
