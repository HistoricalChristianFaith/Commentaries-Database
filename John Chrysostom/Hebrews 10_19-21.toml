“For the entrance into the sanctuary.” What does he mean here by “entrance”? Heaven and the access to spiritual things. “Which he opened,” that is, which he prepared and which he began. For the beginning of using is thereafter called the opening, which he prepared, he means, and by which he himself passed. “The new and living way.” Here he expresses “the full assurance of hope.” “New,” he says. He is anxious to show that we have all things greater; since now the gates of heaven have been opened, which was not done even for Abraham. “The new and living way,” he says, for the first was a way of death, leading to Hades, but this of life. And yet he did not say, “of life,” but called it indeed “living” namely, that which persists by God’s own command. “Through the curtain,” he says, “of his flesh.” … And with good reason did he call the flesh “a curtain.” For when it was lifted up on high, then the things in heaven appeared.
