"Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus." Having shown the difference of the High Priest, and of the sacrifices, and of the tabernacle, and of the Covenant, and of the promise, and that the difference is great, since those are temporal, but these eternal, those "near to vanishing away," these permanent, those powerless, these perfect, those figures, these reality. For (he says) "not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life." And "Thou art a Priest for ever." Behold the continuance of the Priest. And concerning the Covenant, That (he says) is old (for "that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away"), but this is new; and has remission of sins, while that has nothing of the kind: for (he says) "the Law made nothing perfect." And again, "sacrifice and offering Thou wouldest not." That is made with hands, while this is "not made with hands": that "has the blood of goats," this of the Lord; that has the Priest "standing," this "sitting." Since therefore all those are inferior and these greater, therefore he says, "Having therefore, brethren, boldness."

"Boldness": from whence? As sins (he means) produce shame, so the having all things forgiven us, and being made fellow-heirs, and enjoying so great Love, produces boldness.

"For the entrance into the holiest." What does he mean here by "entrance"? Heaven, and the access to spiritual things.
