Therefore I said with good reason, that the woman did not at all understand Christ's words, "Though he were dead, yet shall he live." At least observe, that she speaketh as though the thing were impossible on account of the time which had intervened. For indeed it was a strange thing to raise a corpse which had been dead four days, and was corrupt. To the disciples Jesus said, "That the Son of Man may be glorified," referring to Himself; but to the woman, "Thou shalt see the glory of God," speaking of the Father. Seest thou that the weakness of the hearers is the cause of the difference of the words? He therefore remindeth her of what He had spoken unto her, well nigh rebuking her, as being forgetful.

"Said I not unto thee, that if thou wouldest believe, thou shouldest see the glory of God?" A great blessing truly is faith, great, and one which makes great those who hold it rightly with good living. By this men are enabled to do the things of God in His name. And well did Christ say, "If ye have faith ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove, and it shall remove"; and again, "He that believeth on Me, the works that I do shall he do also, and greater works than these shall he do." What meaneth He by "greater"? Those which the disciples are seen after this to work. For even the shadow of Peter raised a dead man; and so the power of Christ was the more proclaimed. Since it was not so wonderful that He while alive should work miracles, as that when He was dead others should be enabled to work in His name greater than He wrought. This was an indisputable proof of the Resurrection.
