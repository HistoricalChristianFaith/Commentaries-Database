Do you observe how both there (at Damascus), and here, the rest take care for him, and provide for him the means of departure, and that we nowhere find him thus far receiving (direct supernatural) aid from God? So the energy of his character is betokened. To Cæsarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus: so that, I suppose, he did not continue his journey by land, but sailed the rest of it. And this (departure) is Providentially ordered, that he might preach there also: and so likewise were the plots against him ordered by God's Providence, and his coming to Jerusalem, that the story about him might no longer be disbelieved. For there he was speaking boldly, it says, in the name of the Lord Jesus; and he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists; and again, he was with them coming in and going out.— So the Church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace— i.e. it increased: and peace with itself, that peace which is peace indeed: for the war from without would have done them no harm — they being edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and abounded in the consolation of the Holy Ghost. And the spirit consoled them both by the miracles and by the works, and independently of these in the person of each individual. And it came to pass, etc. And Peter said unto him, Eneas, etc.

these things were demonstrative of the former, and by his acts he made good what was spoken of him. And he spoke, and disputed with the Hellenists.
