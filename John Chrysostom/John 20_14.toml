And by what kind of consequence is it, that she having spoken to them, and not having yet heard anything from them, turned back?

But why, after speaking with the angels and not having yet heard anything from them, did Mary turn back? I think that while she was speaking, Christ suddenly appeared behind her and struck the angels with awe. And when they saw their ruler, they showed immediately by their attitude, their gaze and their movements that they saw the Lord. This is what drew the woman’s attention and caused her to turn around. This is how he appeared to them, but this is not how he appeared to the woman in order not to terrify her at the first sight of him. Rather, he appears to her in a more humble and ordinary form, as is clear from her reaction, supposing that he was the gardener. It was appropriate to lead one of so lowly a mind to higher matters not all at once but gently. He therefore in turn asks her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?”
