For the present he says no more than this: if He is Just, they are guilty. And hear the voice of His mouth. See how high he raises the fact! For you shall be His witness— for this, because you will not betray the sight and hearing (i.e. prove false to)— both of what you have seen, and of what you have heard: by means of both the senses he claims his faith, fullness— to all men. And now why do you tarry? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.

For [Paul] truly became a witness to [Jesus], and a witness as one should be, both by what he did and by what he said. We too must be such witnesses and not betray what we have been entrusted. I speak not only of doctrines, but also of our way of life. Look, what he knew, what he heard, he bore witness to this before all, and nothing hindered him. We too have heard that there is a resurrection and ten thousand good things; therefore, we ought to bear witness to this before all. “We do in fact bear witness,” you say, “and believe.” How, since we do the opposite? Tell me, if someone should say he was a Christian but should then apostatize and act like a Jew, would his testimony be sufficient? No, not at all; for people would look for testimony through his actions. Likewise, if we say that that there is a resurrection and ten thousand good things but then look down upon them and prefer the things here, who will believe us? For all people pay attention not to what we say but to what we do. “You will be a witness,” [Christ] says, “to all.” That is, not only to the friends, but also to the unbelievers. For this is what witnesses are for: they persuade not those who know but those who do not. Let us become trustworthy witnesses. How will we become trustworthy? By the life we lead.
