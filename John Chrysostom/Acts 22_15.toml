For the present he says no more than this: if He is Just, they are guilty. And hear the voice of His mouth. See how high he raises the fact! For you shall be His witness— for this, because you will not betray the sight and hearing (i.e. prove false to)— both of what you have seen, and of what you have heard: by means of both the senses he claims his faith, fullness— to all men. And now why do you tarry? Arise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on His name.
