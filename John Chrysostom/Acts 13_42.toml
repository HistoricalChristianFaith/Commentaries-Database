Did you notice Paul’s wisdom? Not only did he win admiration at the time, but also put in them a second longing for listening, sowing as it were seeds in his speech and not resolving the issues at hand or following the subject to its conclusion, so as to ready them and accustom them to himself and not to make them flaccid by hurtling everything at their souls at once. He said, “Through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,” but he did not reveal how. After this point, he puts Paul first. Do you see their great eagerness? “They followed them,” he says. Why didn’t he baptize them immediately? It was not the proper time; there was need to persuade them so that they might remain steadfast.
