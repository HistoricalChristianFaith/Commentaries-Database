Do you mark Paul's wisdom? He not only gained admiration at the time, but put into them a longing desire for a second hearing, while in what he said he dropped some seeds as it were, and forbore to solve the questions raised, or to follow out the subject to its conclusion, his plan being to interest them and engage their good-will to himself, and not make people listless and indifferent by casting all at once into the minds of those who first heard him. He told them the fact, that "through this Man is remission of sins announced unto you," but the how, he did not declare.
