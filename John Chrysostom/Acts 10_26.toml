Do you mark how, before all else (the Apostles) teach them this lesson, not to think great things of them? And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that had come together. And he said unto them, You know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God has showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean. (v. 27, 28.) Observe, he straightway speaks of the mercy of God, and points out to them that it is a great grace that God has shown them. Observe also how while he utters great things, at the same time he speaks modestly. For he does not say, We, being men who do not deign to keep company with any (such), have come to you: but what says he? You know— God commanded this — that it is against law to keep company with, or come unto, one of another nation. Then he goes on to say, And to me God has shown— this he says, that none may account the thanks due to him— that I should call no man— that it may not look like obsequiousness to him, no human being, says he— common or unclean.

Observe how free from adulation his speech is on all occasions, and how full of humility. And conversing with him, he came in.
