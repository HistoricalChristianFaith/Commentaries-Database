See, I ask you, dearly beloved, in this instance once again Sarah not tolerating the brashness of Ishmael and unable to put up equably with the maidservant’s son being reared with Isaac. So just as she previously wished to check Hagar’s arrogance and in her extreme irritation had her sent packing, so in this case too she wanted to nip Ishmael’s forwardness in the bud. Not bearing to see the son born of grace and of the very gift of God being reared along with that of the Egyptian maidservant, she said to Abraham, “Send away the maidservant and her son: surely the son of the maidservant will not share the inheritance with my son?” Since she realized that she herself was in fact in extreme old age, and she saw the patriarch was well on (after all, they were both advanced in years), she was afraid that in the event of their sudden passing Ishmael would, on the score of his being born of an association of the patriarch, endeavor to thrust himself into his father’s inheritance and become a sharer of it with Isaac. Hence she said, “Send away from here the maidservant and her son.” Let her learn at this stage, she is saying, that the son of the maidservant has nothing in common with my son, Isaac. It is, in fact, not fair that the slave’s son should be reared with that of the mistress, my son.
