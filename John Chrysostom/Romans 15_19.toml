Count up all the places Paul had been—not just in the Roman Empire but beyond its frontiers as well. Phoenicia, Syria, Cilicia and Cappadocia for a start, but also the back country—Arabia, Persia and Armenia. This is why he said “as far round as Illyricum,” so that you would not only think of the direct route from Jerusalem to Illyricum but consider also all the surrounding countries as well.
