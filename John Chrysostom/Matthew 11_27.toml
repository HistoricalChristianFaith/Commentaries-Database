These things which the Lord spoke to His disciples, made them more zealous. As afterwards they thought great things of themselves, because they cast out dæmons, therefore He here reproves them; for what they had, was by revelation, not by their own efforts. The Scribes who esteemed themselves wise and understanding were excluded because of them-pride, and therefore He says, Since on this account the mysteries of God were hid from them, fear ye, and abide as babes, for this it is that has made you partakers in the revelation. But as when Paul says, God gave them, over to a reprobate mind, (Rom. 1:28), he does not mean that God did this, but they who gave Him cause, so here, Thou hast hid these things from the wise and understanding. And wherefore were they hid from them? Hear Paul speaking, Seeking to set up their own righteousness, they were not subject to the righteousness of God (Rom. 10:3.)

Because He had said, I confess unto thee, Father, because thou hast hid these things from the wise, that you should not suppose that He thus thanks the Father as though He Himself was excluded from this power, He adds, All things are committed to me by my Father. Hearing the words are committed, do not admit suspicion of any thing human, for He uses this word that you may not think there be two gods unbegotten. For at the time that He was begotten He was Lord of all.

By this that He only knows the Father, He shows covertly that He is of one substance with the Father. As though He had said, What wonder if I be Lord of all, when I have somewhat yet greater, namely to know the Father and to be of the same substance with Him?

When He says, Neither does any know the Father but the Son, He does not mean that all men are altogether ignorant of Him; but that none knows Him with that knowledge wherewith He knows Him; which may also be said of the Son. For it is not said of some unknown God (i. e. who was not the Creator.) as Marcion declares.

If then He reveals the Father, He reveals Himself also. But the one he omits as a thing manifest, but mentions the other because there might be a doubt concerning it. Herein also He instructs us that He is so one with the Father, that it is not possible for any to come to the Father, but through the Son. For this had above all things given offence, that He seemed to be against God, and therefore He strove by all means to overthrow this notion.

But when you hear, they are delivered, do not surmise anything human. For He uses this expression, to prevent your imagining two unoriginate Gods. Since, that He was at the same time both begotten, and Lord of all, He declares in many ways, and in other places also.

Then He says what is even greater than this, lifting up your mind; And no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knows any man the Father, but the Son. Which seems indeed to the ignorant unconnected with what went before, but has full accordance therewith. As thus: having said, All things are delivered unto me of my Father, He adds, And what marvel, so He speaks, if I be Lord of all? I who have also another greater privilege, the knowing the Father, and being of the same substance. Yea, for this too He covertly signifies by His being the only one who so knew Him. For this is His meaning, when He says, No man knows the Father but the Son.

And see at what time He says this. When they by His works had received the certain proof of His might, not only seeing Him work miracles, but endowed also in His name with so great powers. Then, since He had said, You have revealed them unto babes, He signifies this also to pertain to Himself; for neither knows any man the Father, says He, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son is willing to reveal Him; Matthew 11:27 not to whomsoever He may be enjoined, to whomsoever He may be commanded. But if He reveals Him, then Himself too. This however He let pass as acknowledged, but the other He has set down. And everywhere He affirms this; as when He says, No man comes unto the Father, but by me. John 14:6

And thereby he establishes another point also, His being in harmony and of one mind with Him. Why, says He, I am so far from fighting and warring with Him, that no one can even come to Him but by me. For because this most offended them, His seeming to be a rival God, He by all means does away with this; and interested Himself about this not less earnestly, but even more so, than about His miracles.

But when He says, Neither knows any man the Father, save the Son, He means not this, that all men were ignorant of Him, but that with the knowledge wherewith He knows Him, no man is acquainted with Him; which may be said of the Son too. For it was not of some God unknown, and revealed to no man, that He was so speaking, as Marcion says; but it is the perfection of knowledge that He is here intimating, since neither do we know the Son as He should be known; and this very thing, to add no more, Paul was declaring, when he said, We know in part, and we prophesy in part. 1 Corinthians 13:9

This may seem to the uninitiated quite disconnected with the passage that went before, but the two stand in full accord. Having said “all things have been delivered to me by my Father,” he adds, “and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and any one to whom the Son chooses to reveal him.” In this he is quietly signifying his great privilege of knowing the Father and being of the same substance with him, he being the only One who knows the Father so intimately.…Note the timing and context in which he said this. It was just after he had worked miracles and the disciples of John had received proofs of his might by his works. He then thanks the Father that “that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes.”
