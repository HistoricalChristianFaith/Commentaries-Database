Mark how he ends with a fearful consideration. He does not discourse to them from the Prophets, but from things present, of which themselves were witnesses. Of course (the Prophets) also themselves anon add their testimony (infra v. 15), and make the reason stronger by what has now come to pass. And observe, he first permits the question to be moved in the Church, and then speaks. And put no difference betweenâ€” he said not, them of the circumcision, but us and them, i.e. the Gentiles: for this (gradual advance) little by little is stronger. Why therefore do you tempt God? who has become (the) God of the Gentiles: for this was tempting: * * * whether He is able to save even after the Law. See what he does. He shows that they are in danger. For if, what the Law could not do, faith had power to do, we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they comp. : but faith falling off, behold, themselves (are) in destruction. And he did not say, Why do ye disbelieve? Which was more harsh, but, Tempt God, and that when the fact is demonstrated.

(c) Great effrontery this, of the Pharisees, that even after faith they set up the Law, and will not obey the Apostles. But see these, how mildly they speak, and not in the tone of authority: such words are amiable, and more apt to fix themselves in the mind. Observe, it is nowhere a display of words, but demonstration by facts, by the Spirit. And yet, though they have such proofs, they still speak gently. And observe they do not come accusing those at Antioch, but declaring all things that God had done with them:

How full of power these words! The same that Paul says at large in the Epistle to the Romans, the same says Peter here. For if Abraham, says (Paul), was justified by works, he has whereof to glory, but not before God. Romans 4:2 Do you perceive that all this is more a lesson for them than apology for the Gentiles? However, if he had spoken this without a plea for speaking, he would have been suspected: an occasion having offered, he lays hold of it, and speaks out fearlessly. See on all occasions how the designs of their foes are made to work with them. If those had not stirred the question, these things would not have been spoken, nor what follows.
