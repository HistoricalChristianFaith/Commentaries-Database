"But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they." How full of power these words! The same that Paul says at large in the Epistle to the Romans, the same says Peter here. "For if Abraham," says Paul, "was justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God." Do you perceive that all this is more a lesson for them than apology for the Gentiles? However, if he had spoken this without a plea for speaking, he would have been suspected: an occasion having offered, he lays hold of it, and speaks out fearlessly. See on all occasions how the designs of their foes are made to work with them. If those had not stirred the question, these things would not have been spoken, nor what follows.

Then he shows, not that the Law was evil, but themselves weak. "But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they." Mark how he ends with a fearful consideration. He does not discourse to them from the Prophets, but from things present, of which themselves were witnesses. For if, what the Law could not do, faith had power to do, "we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they:" but faith falling off, behold, themselves are in destruction. "And put no difference between"-he said not, them of the circumcision, but "us and them," i.e. the Gentiles: for this gradual advance little by little is stronger.
