His charm, in fact, was evident from [Zion] even in the Old Testament. I mean, the temple, the Holy of Holies, all the worship and the living of the old legislation, the multitude of priests, sacrifices, whole burnt offerings, sacred hymns and psalmody and everything stemming from it—the type of things to come from this was sketched out ahead of time. But when the reality arrived, it took its beginning from there as well. From there shone out the cross.… There occurred the resurrection, there the ascension, there the prelude and commencement of our salvation, there the ineffable teachings began to be proclaimed. There the Father was first revealed, the Only-begotten known and the wonderful grace of the Spirit given. And there the apostles took the first steps of preaching about spiritual matters, about the gifts, the powers, the promise of good things to come. Considering all this, the inspired author calls it his maturity. God’s beautiful maturity, you see, is his goodness and lovingkindness and his beneficence to all people.
