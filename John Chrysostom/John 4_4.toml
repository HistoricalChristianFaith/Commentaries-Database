Jesus only takes up Samaria along the way, as the evangelist implies by saying, “He had to pass through Samaria.” As the apostles, when expelled by the Jews went to the Gentiles, so Christ, when the Jews drove him out, goes to the Samaritans.… He did this in order to deprive the Jews of any excuse and so that they might not be able to say, “He left us and went to the uncircumcised.”
