For inasmuch as another King was about to arise from Ephraim, therefore it is said, And he bowed himself upon the top of his staff. That is, even though he was now an old man, he bowed himself to Joseph, showing the obeisance of the whole people which was to be [directed] to him.

Do you see how he foretold the things which were to be afterwards? Do you see how great faith they had? How they believed concerning the things to come?
