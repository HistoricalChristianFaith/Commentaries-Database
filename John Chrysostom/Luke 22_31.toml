Now He said not, 'I have granted,' but I have prayed. For He speaks humbly as approaching to His Passion, and that He may manifest His human nature. For He who had spoken not in supplication, but by authority, Upon this rock I will build my Church, and I will give you the keys of the kingdom, how should He have need of prayer that He might stay one agitated soul? He does not say, &#8220;I have prayed that you deny not,&#8221; but that you do not abandon your faith.
