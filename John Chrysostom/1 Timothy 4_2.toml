“Speaking lies in hypocrisy.” This implies that they do not utter these falsehoods through ignorance and unknowingly but as acting a part, knowing the truth but “having their conscience seared,” for they are men who live evil lives.

In what way then is she a virgin who has fallen away from the faith, who has devoted herself to the deceivers, who obeys the demons and honors falsehood? In what way is she a virgin who has a seared conscience? For the virgin must be pure not only in body but also in soul if she is going to receive the holy bridegroom.… Virginity is defined by holiness of body and soul. But if a woman is unholy and impure in each respect, how could she be a virgin?… But she shows me a pale face, wasted limbs, a shabby garment and gentle glance.… What is the good of all that when the eye of the soul is bold, for what could be more audacious than that eye encouraging her real eyes to consider the objects of God’s creation as bad?
