Do you see the great strength which comes from concord? And do you see the great harm caused by contentiousness? A kingdom in revolt destroys itself. When two brothers are bound together and united into one, they are more unbreakable than any wall.

“A brother helped by his brother is like a fortified and elevated city: and is as strong as a well fortified palace of kings.” The disciples of Christ were of the same mind, like brothers, and were fortified like a royal palace surrounded by many walls as they helped each other. They were firm in their unity, and their mutual aid made them stronger and stronger.
