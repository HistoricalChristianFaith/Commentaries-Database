“A brother helped by his brother is like a fortified and elevated city: and is as strong as a well fortified palace of kings.” The disciples of Christ were of the same mind, like brothers, and were fortified like a royal palace surrounded by many walls as they helped each other. They were firm in their unity, and their mutual aid made them stronger and stronger. Commentary on the Proverbs of Solomon, Fragment

Do you see the great strength which comes from concord? And do you see the great harm caused by contentiousness? A kingdom in revolt destroys itself. When two brothers are bound together and united into one, they are more unbreakable than any wall. .
