“He is wise in mind, mighty and strong,” with good reason. Indeed, since God is wise, his benefits are countless. But if you do not believe, O mortal, let us bring our reflection to its conclusion. If he pronounces one thousand words, we cannot answer a single one. These are wise words. In fact, that righteous man said, “Also the righteous will be happy.” About what righteous man is he speaking? But where will we ever find a man who is righteous before God? “Not one of his thousand words.” This is exactly what the prophet said as well: “No living person will be found righteous before you.” “If you observe our faults, O Lord, O Lord, who will survive?” … God has created human nature. Why? Out of pure benevolence, as all the rest of creation. He has created the universe and all the rest for humans. He stated a commandment, but humanity did not consider it. Afterward he gave them the law, but they neglected it. Then he sent his Son, but they did not consider him either. Then he gave them repentance, but they did not ponder it. Then he threatened them with the punishment of hell, but they disregarded it. But why did he want to save them? Do you want us to ask Paul himself? Listen to what he says: “God dealt with me mercifully because I acted in the ignorance of disbelief.” And then, after being called, Paul testified to the profound and providential care, of which he was an object.
