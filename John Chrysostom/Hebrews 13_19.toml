"But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be restored to you the sooner." His thus praying was the act of one who loved them greatly, and that not simply, but with all earnestness, that so, he says, I may come to you speedily. The earnest desire to come to them is the mark of one conscious to himself of nothing wrong, also the entreating them to pray for him.
