How can the table which is the cause of so many blessings, and which is teeming with life, become a cause of judgment? It is not from its own nature, says Paul, but because of the attitude of the one who comes to it. For just as the presence of Christ, which conveyed to us those great and unspeakable blessings, condemned those who did not receive them, so also the holy Communion becomes a means of greater punishment to those who partake unworthily.
