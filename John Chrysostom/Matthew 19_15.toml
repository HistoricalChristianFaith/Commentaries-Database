The flesh as it delights not in good, if it hear any good readily forgets it; but the evil that it has it retains ever. But a little while before Christ took a little child and said, “Except ye become as this child, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven,” yet His disciples, presently forgetting this innocence of children, now forbid children, as unworthy to come to Christ.
Or the disciples would have thrust them away, from respect to Christ’s dignity. But the Lord teaching them holy thoughts, and to subdue the pride of this world, took the children into His arms, and promised to such the kingdom of heaven; “But Jesus saith unto them, Suffer little children and forbid them notto come unto me, for of such is the kingdom of heaven.”.
For who were worthy to come to Christ, if simple infancy were thrust away? Therefore he said, “Forbid them not.” For if they shall turn out saints, why hinder ye the sons from coming to their Father? And if sinners, why do yepronounce a sentence of condemnation, before you see any fault in them?
