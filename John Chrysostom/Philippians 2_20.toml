At the same time too, he honors them by sending Timothy. What do you say? Do you send Timothy? And wherefore? Because I have no one likeminded; that is, none of those whose care is like mine, none who will care truly for you. Philippians 2:20 Had he then no one of those who were with him? No one likeminded, that is, who has yearnings and takes thought for you as I do. No one would lightly choose, he means, to make so long a journey for this purpose. Timothy is the one with me who loves you. For I might have sent others, but there was none like him. This then is that likemindedness, to love the disciples as the master loves them.
