Then he brings forward unto them the prophet for a counsellor, having sought out a testimony inviting them to bountifulness, and says, "As it is written, He hath scattered abroad, he hath given to the poor; His righteousness abideth for ever." This is the import of "abound;" for the words, "he hath dispersed abroad," signify nothing else but the giving plentifully. For if the things themselves abide not, yet their results abide. For this is the thing to be admired, that when they are kept they are lost; but when dispersed abroad they abide, yea, abide for ever. Now by "righteousness," here, he means love towards men. For this maketh righteous, consuming sins like a fire when it is plentifully poured out.
