[Peter] shows that he did nothing himself. “For it was the very thing that we obtained,” he says, “that those men received.” “If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus, who was I that I could withstand God?” To silence them more effectively, he added “the same gift.” Do you see how he does not allow them to have less? “When they believed,” he says, “God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus.” He makes them clean, and he does not say “to you” but “to us.” That is, why do you feel aggrieved when we call them partners? “When they heard this they were silenced. And they glorified God, saying, ‘Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance to life.’ ” Do you see how it all came about through the oratory of Peter, who did well to report the events? They glorified God because he had given them repentance. They were humbled by these words. From this point on the door of faith was open to the Gentiles.
