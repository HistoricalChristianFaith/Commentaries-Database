In the next place, lest hearing [the words] after the same [example], you should think that the punishment is the same, hear what he adds; For the Word of God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, and pierces even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. In these words he shows that He, the Word of God, wrought the former things also, and lives, and has not been quenched.
Do not then when hearing the Word, think of it lightly. For He is sharper, he says, than a sword. Observe His condescension; and hence consider why the prophets also needed to speak of saber and bow and sword. If you turn not, it is said, He will whet His sword, He has bent His bow and made it ready. Psalm 7:12 For if now, after so long a time, and after their being perfected, He cannot smite down by the name of the Word alone, but needs these expressions in order to show the superiority [arising] from the comparison [of the Gospel with the law]: much more then [of old].

Piercing, he says, even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit. What is this? He hinted at something more fearful. Either that He divides the spirit from the soul, or that He pierces even through them disembodied, not as a sword through bodies only. Here he shows, that the soul also is punished, and that it thoroughly searches out the most inward things, piercing wholly through the whole man.

And is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart, neither is there any creature that is not manifest in His sight. In these words most of all he terrified them. For do not (he says) be confident if you still stand fast in the Faith, but without full assurance. He judges the inner heart, for there He passes through, both punishing and searching out.
