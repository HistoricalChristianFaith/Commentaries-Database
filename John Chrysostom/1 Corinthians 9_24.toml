Paul says this not because he thinks that only one person will be saved but because he wants to point out how much diligence is required in order to succeed. It is not enough merely to believe and then contend in any which way. Unless we have run our race in such a way as to be blameless and to come near to the prize, it will not benefit us. Even if you think you are perfect in your knowledge you have still not obtained everything, so you must continue to run in order to obtain the prize.
