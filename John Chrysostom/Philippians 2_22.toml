And that I speak not at random, "you yourselves," he says, "know, that as a child serves a father, so he served with me in furtherance of the Gospel." He presents then Timothy to them, and with reason, that he might enjoy much honor from them. This too he does when he writes to the Corinthians, and he says, "Let no man therefore despise him, for he works the work of the Lord as I also do." [1 Corinthians 16:10] This he said not as caring for him, but for those who receive him, that they might receive a great reward.
