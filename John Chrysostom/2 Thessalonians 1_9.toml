But where, I ask, will be the location of hell? Somewhere, I think, far removed from this world. For as the prisons and the mines are at a great distance from royal residences, so will hell be located far from this world. We aren’t interested in finding its location but in escaping it. And just because God doesn’t punish everyone here, don’t doubt things to come. For God is merciful and patient. That is why he issues warnings and doesn’t immediately cast us into hell. For “I don’t desire,” he says, “the death of a sinner.” These words have no meaning, however, if sinners never die. And I know, indeed, that there is nothing less pleasant to you than these words. But to me nothing is more pleasant.… Let us, then, continually discuss these things. For to remember hell prevents our falling into hell. Do you not hear St. Paul saying, “Who shall suffer everlasting punishment from the face of the Lord”?
