Here Paul shows that we must scrutinize our lives. We must test what we have done not cheaply but stringently. For example, suppose you have done something good. Consider whether it might have been through vanity or through necessity, or with animosity, or in hypocrisy, or through some other self-centered motive.

He says this not by way of command but by way of concession. It is as though he had said, “It is absurd to boast, but if you must, do not boast against your neighbor, like the Pharisee.” The person who learns this lesson will also soon give up boasting altogether. Thus Paul’s reason for conceding this was to drive out the larger malady by small steps. For the one who is accustomed to boast with regard to himself alone, and not against others, will soon reform this fault also. If he does not think himself better than others—for that is the meaning of not looking to the other—but is chastened by examining himself by himself, he will later stop this boasting too.
