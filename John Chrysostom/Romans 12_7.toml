Here he names a comprehensive thing. For the Apostleship even is called a ministry, and every spiritual work is a ministry. This is indeed a name of a peculiar office (viz. the diaconate); however, it is used in a general sense. "Or he that teaches, on teaching." See with what indifference he places them, the little first and the great afterwards, again giving us the same lesson, not to be puffed up or elated.

The word service is comprehensive, covering everything from the apostleship itself to any spiritual function. It is indeed the name of a particular office [viz., the diaconate], but here it is used in a general sense.
