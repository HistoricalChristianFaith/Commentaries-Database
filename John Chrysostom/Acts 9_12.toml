He did not persuade him, much less had He said this. So that he shall not disbelieve you, he has seen in a vision. Observe how in the former instance neither is Philip told all immediately. Fear not, He says: for this man is a chosen vessel for Me.

What may be the reason that He neither drew any one of high authority and importance, nor caused such to be forthcoming for the purpose of instructing Paul? It was, because it was not meet that he should be induced by men, but only by Christ Himself: as in fact this man taught him nothing, but merely baptized him; for, as soon as baptized (φωτισθείς), he was to draw upon himself the grace of the Spirit, by his zeal and exceeding earnestness. And that Ananias was no very distinguished person, is plain. For, the Lord, it says, spoke unto him in a vision, and Ananias answered and said, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he has done to Your saints at Jerusalem.
