Such is the way with the vulgar, to jump to conclusions and become enraged on any pretext. That is why one must do everything after careful consideration. But see how contemptible they are, how exposed to all excitements.… “Some cried one thing, some another; for the assembly was in confusion.” For such is the behavior of a crowd. It simply follows, as when fire alights on wood. “And most of them did not know why they had come together.”
