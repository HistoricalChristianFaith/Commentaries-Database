By saying, “Do not be amazed,” he indicates [Nicodemus’s] confusion and leads him by way of example to something lighter than the body.… He speaks neither of dense bodies nor of things that are purely incorporeal. For if Nicodemus had heard this there is no way he could have received it. Instead, he found something in between what is and what is not a body, namely, the motion of the wind.… Although he says “it blows where it pleases,” he does not say this as if the wind had any power of choice. He is simply declaring that its natural motion is powerful and cannot be hindered.… The expression, therefore, “blows where it pleases,” is that of one who would show that it cannot be restrained, that it is spread abroad everywhere and that no one can stop it from passing here and there. It goes abroad with great might, and no one is able to turn aside its violence.… It establishes the power of the Comforter. For no one can hold the wind; it moves where it pleases. And so, whether it is the laws of nature or the limits of bodily generation or anything else like this—they have no ability to restrain the operations of the Spirit.

Here is the conclusion of the whole matter. If, he says, you do not even know how to explain the motion or path of this wind, which you perceive by hearing and feeling, why are you so over anxious about the working of the divine Spirit, when you do not even understand how the wind works, although you hear its voice?… As then the wind is not visible, although it utters a sound, so neither is the birth of that which is spiritual visible to our bodily eyes. And yet, the wind is a body, although a very subtle one. For whatever is the object of our senses is bodily. If then you do not complain when you cannot see this body and you still believe, why, when you hear of “the Spirit,” do you hesitate and demand such exact accounts, although you do not act this way in the case of a body?
