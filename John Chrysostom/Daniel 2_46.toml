The people who were in Babylon say this: being there, I will remember you. Therefore, let us also, as being in Babylon, [do the same]. For although we are not sitting among warlike foes, yet we are among “enemies.” For some indeed were captives but did not feel their captivity, as Daniel, as the three children; who, even while they were in captivity became in that very country more glorious even than the king who had made them captive.… Do you see how great is virtue? When they were in actual captivity, he waited on them as masters. He therefore was the captive, rather than they.… Do you see that the really splendid things are those that relate to God, whereas human things are a shadow?… Let us fear God, beloved, let us fear [him]: even should we be in captivity, we are more glorious than all people. Let the fear of God be present with us, and nothing will bring us grief, even though they speak of poverty, or of disease, or of captivity, or of slavery or of any other grievous thing. In fact, even these very things will themselves work together for us the other way. These men were captives, and the king worshiped them. Paul was a tent maker, and they sacrificed to him as a god.
