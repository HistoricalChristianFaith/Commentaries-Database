He then also hinting this, what does he say? [Hebrews 10:37] "Yet a little while and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry." For lest they should say, And when will He come? He comforts them from the Scriptures. For thus also when he says in another place, "Now is our salvation nearer" [Romans 13:11], he comforts them because the remaining time is short. And this he says not of himself but from the Scriptures.  But if from that time it was said, "Yet a little while, and He that shall come will come, and will not tarry," it is plain that now He is nearer. Wherefore also waiting is no small reward.
