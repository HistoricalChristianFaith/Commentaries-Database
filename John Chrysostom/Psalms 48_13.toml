The psalmist exhorts the people, “Behold this city.” … Understand something from … its structure, its beauty, its fame, so as to learn from this God’s power, how he made the lost city more mighty, and recount to your progeny God’s power and the enduring course of his providence; his care of us, his leadership and shepherding last forever. Stories of this to those who come after will, in fact, prove an occasion for great advance in wisdom, a basis for more precise knowledge of God and a study of virtue.
