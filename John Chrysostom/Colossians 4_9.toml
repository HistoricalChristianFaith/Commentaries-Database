Ver. 9. "With Onesimus, the beloved and faithful brother, who is one of you. They shall make known unto you all things that are done here."

Onesimus is the one about whom, writing to Philemon, he said, "Whom I would fain have kept with me, that in your behalf he might minister unto me in the bonds of the Gospel: but without your mind I would do nothing." [Philemon 1-3, 14] And he adds too the praise of their city, that they might not only not be ashamed, but even pride themselves on him. "Who is one of you," he says. "They shall make known unto you all things that are done here."

Ver. 9. "They shall make known unto you," he says, "all things that are done here." Why did you not come with them, says one? But what is, "They shall make known unto you all things"? My bonds, that is, and all the other things that detain me. I then, who pray to see them, who also send others, should not myself have remained behind, had not some great necessity detained me. And yet this is not the language of accusations â€” yes, of vehement accusation. For the assuring them that he had both fallen into trials, and was bearing them nobly, is the part of one who was confirming the fact, and lifting up again their souls.

Ver. 9. "With Onesimus," he says, "the beloved, and faithful brother."

Paul calls a slave, brother: with reason; seeing that he styles himself the servant of the faithful. [2 Corinthians 4:5] Bring we down all of us our pride, tread we under foot our boastfulness. Paul names himself a slave, he that is worth the world, and ten thousands of heavens; and do you entertain high thoughts? He that seizes all things for spoil as he will, he that has the first place in the kingdom of heaven, he that was crowned, he that ascended into the third heaven, calls servants, "brethren," and "fellow-servants." Where is your madness? Where is your arrogance?

So trustworthy was Onesimus become, as to be entrusted even with such things as these.
