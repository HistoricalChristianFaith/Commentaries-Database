In our affairs, beloved, we have great need of perseverance. And perseverance is the fruit when [Christ’s] teachings become deeply rooted in us. No assault of the wind will be strong enough to uproot the oak that has sent its roots deep down into the depths of the earth and has become firmly encompassed by them. Similarly, no one will be strong enough to overpower the soul that is nailed down by the fear of God, because to be nailed down is to be more securely fastened than to be rooted. In fact, the prophet prayed for this when he said, “Nail my flesh with your fear.”
