The law served death but was not its cause. What caused death was sin, but the law brought in punishment and showed the sin up for what it wasâ€”it did not cause it. The law did not minister to the existence of sin or death but to the suffering of retribution by the sinner, so that in this way it was even more destructive of sin.
