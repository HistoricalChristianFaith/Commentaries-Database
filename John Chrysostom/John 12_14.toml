But how does it happen that the other evangelists say that he sent disciples and said, “Loose the donkey and the colt,” while John says nothing of the kind but that, “having found a young donkey, he sat on it”? Because it is likely that both circumstances took place, and that after the donkey was loosed, while the disciples were bringing it, he found [the colt] and sat on it.
