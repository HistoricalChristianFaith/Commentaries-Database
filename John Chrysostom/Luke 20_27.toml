As the saints claim as their own the common Lord of the world, not as derogating from His dominion, but testifying their affection after the manner of lovers, who do not brook to love with many, but desire to express a certain peculiar and especial attachment; so likewise does God call Himself especially the God of these, not thereby narrowing but enlarging His dominion; for it is not so much the multitude of His subjects that manifests His power, as the virtue of His servants. Therefore He does not so delight in the name of the Godof heaven and earth, as in that of in God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Now among menservants are thus denominated by, their masters; for we say, 'The steward of such a man', buton the contrary God is called the God of Abraham.
