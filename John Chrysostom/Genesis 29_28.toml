You observe once again that the nuptials were conducted with all seemliness. Don’t be disturbed, however, to hear that he married the elder girl and then the younger or judge happenings in those times by present conditions. In those times, you see, since it was the very beginning, people were allowed to live with two or three wives or more so as to increase the race; now, on the contrary, because through God’s grace the human race has expanded into a vast number, the practice of virtue has also increased. I mean, Christ by his coming has sown the seeds of virtue among human beings and turned them into angels, so to say, thus rooting out all that former practice. Do you see how we should not be proposing that practice but rather seek out everywhere what is useful? Take note. Since the practice itself was evil, see how it has been rooted out, and no one is free now to propose it. Consequently I beseech you, far from seeking to adopt it in any way, search rather for what is useful, not what is spiritually harmful. If something good comes our way, even if it is not general practice, let us adopt it; but if it is harmful, even if general practice, let us avoid and turn away from it.
