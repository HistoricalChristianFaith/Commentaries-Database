"For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise your own conceits."

Meaning by mystery here, that which is unknown and unutterable, and hath much of wonder and much of what one should not expect about it. As in another passage too he says, "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed." What then is the mystery?

"That blindness in part hath happened unto Israel." Here again he levels a blow at the Jew, while seeming to take down the Gentile. But his meaning is nearly this, and he had said it before, that the unbelief is not universal, but only "in part." As when he says, "But if any hath caused grief, he hath not grieved me, but in part": And so here too he says what he had said above, "God hath not cast off His people whom He foreknew": and again, "What then? Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid": This then he says here also; that it is not the whole people that is pulled up, but many have already believed, and more are likely to believe.
