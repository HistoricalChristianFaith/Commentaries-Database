O the wickedness! Though he had continually heard him speaking in the temple and teaching openly, he now wants to be informed. For since they had no charge to bring, they inquired concerning his disciplesâ€”perhaps where they were, why he had collected them, with what intention and on what terms. And this he said because he wanted to prove that Jesus was a seditious person and a rebel since no one listened to him except them alone, as though his were some factory of wickedness.
