7. "Nay, already it is altogether a defect in you, that you have lawsuits one with another."

Do you see for what place he reserved this point? And how he has cleared the discussion of it in good time? For "I talk not yet," says he, "which injures, or which is injured." Thus far, the act itself of going to law brings each party under his censure, and in that respect one is not at all better than another. But whether one go to law justly or unjustly, that is quite another subject. Say not then, "which did the wrong?" For on this ground I at once condemn you, even for the act of going to law.

Now if being unable to bear a wrong-doer be a fault, what accusation can come up to the actual wrong? "Why not rather take wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?"
