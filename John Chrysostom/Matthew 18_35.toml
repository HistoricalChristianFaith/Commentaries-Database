“In anger his lord delivered him to the jailers, till he should pay all his debt.” This means forever, since he will never pay it. For since you did not become better by receiving blessings, it remains for you to be corrected by punishment. For since you have not become better by the kindness shown to you, it remains that you will be corrected only by vengeance. Although it is said that the blessings and gifts of God are irrevocable, our recalcitrance may frustrate even this intention of God. For what, then, can be a more grievous thing than to be vengeful, especially when it appears to overthrow so great a gift of God. The text does not simply say they “delivered him” but “in anger delivered him.” For when he had earlier commanded him to be sold, his were not the words of wrath but, rightly understood, a moment of great mercy. He did not in fact show wrath at that point. But in this case it is a sentence of great anger, punishment and vengeance. So what does the parable mean? “So also my heavenly Father will do to you,” he says, “if you do not forgive your brother from your heart.” Note that he did not say “your Father” but “my Father.” For it is not proper for God to be called the Father of one who is so wicked and malicious.
