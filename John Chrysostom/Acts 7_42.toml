Hence these same customs date their origin, hence the sacrifices: they were themselves the first that made sacrifices to their idols! For that is why it is marked, They made a calf in Horeb, and offered sacrifices to the idol: seeing that, before this the name of sacrifice is nowhere mentioned, but only lively ordinances, and lively oracles. And rejoiced— that is the reason for the feasts. Exodus 32:5-6 As it is written in the Book of the Prophets— and observe, he does not cite the text without a purpose, but shows by it that there is no need of sacrifices; saying: Did ye offer slain beasts and sacrifice to Me?— He lays an emphasis on this word (to Me?). You cannot say that it was from sacrificing to Me, that you proceeded to sacrifice to them:— by the space of forty years: and this too, in the wilderness, where He had most signally shown Himself their Protector. Yea, you took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan: images which you made to worship them. The cause of sacrifices!
