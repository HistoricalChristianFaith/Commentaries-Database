“But God turned and gave them over to worship the host of heaven.” From here come these customs and from here the sacrifices. They themselves were the first to offer sacrifices to the idols. For it is noted that they made a bull calf in Horeb and “offered sacrifices to the idol,” since previously “sacrifices” is nowhere mentioned, only “statutes of life” and “words of life.” “And they rejoiced,” it says, and so the reason for the feasts. “As it is written in the book of the prophets.” Notice he does not cite the text without a purpose but shows that there is no need of sacrifices. “Did you offer to me slain beasts and sacrifices?…” He speaks emphatically. “You cannot say,” he says, “that it was from sacrificing to me that you proceeded to sacrifice to them.” And this in the desert, where he had especially shown himself their champion.
