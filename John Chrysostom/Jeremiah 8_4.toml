God is indeed good to everyone, but he shows his patient endurance especially to those who sin. If you want to hear a paradoxical statement—paradoxical because it is not customary but true for the great piety it reveals—listen. God always seems to be severe to the righteous. But he seems good to sinners and quick to clemency. He restores the one who sinned and fell, and he tells him, “Shall not he who falls get up? Or the one who turns away, shall he not turn back again?” And “Why did the stupid daughter of Judah turn away with a shameless revolting?” And again, “Return to me, and I will return to you.”

The very thing I said in the beginning, I say now, that both of these cause us to betray our salvation: placing our courage in our goodness and losing our hope to wickedness. This is why Paul, to protect those who remain in goodness, said, “Let any one who thinks that he stand take heed in fear that he fall.” And again: “I am afraid that, after preaching to others, I myself should be disapproved.” In order to lift up those who are found fallen in wickedness and to excite them to greater readiness, he bore testimony to the Corinthians. He wrote to them, “I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned before and have not repented.” In this way, he revealed that the sinners do not deserve equal pity with the unrepentant. And the prophet said to them, “Shall not he that falls arise, or he that turns away, shall he not turn back again?” Hence, as long as the “today” is said let us not despair but have good hope in the Master. Let us recognize the vast sea of his philanthropy.

Is it not strange that others do not even now despair of your salvation? They instead are continually praying that they may have their member restored to them. However, while they pray, you yourself, having once fallen, are unwilling to get up again and remain prostrated. You all but cry aloud to the enemy: “Slay me, smite me, spare not.” “Does he who falls not rise up again?” so speaks the divine oracle. But you strive against this and contradict it. If one who has fallen despairs, it is as much as to say that he who falls does not rise up again. I entreat you. Do not do so great a wrong to yourself. Do not pour on us such a flood of sorrow. I do not say this merely at the present time when you have not yet completed your twentieth year. But I would entreat you, even if after achieving many things and spending your whole life in Christ, you had experienced this attack. Even then, in extreme old age, it would not have been right to despair. But call to mind the robber who was justified on the cross. The laborers who came the eleventh hour and received the wages of the whole day.
