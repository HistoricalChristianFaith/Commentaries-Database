There is no difference at all between the Greek, the Scythian, the Thracian or even the Jew, for all are in the same plight…. Even if you have not done the same sins as others, you have still been deprived of God’s glory just as they have been, because you are among those who have offended…. However, Paul was saying this not to cast them into despair but rather to show the love of the Lord toward man, as he goes on to say [in the following verses].
