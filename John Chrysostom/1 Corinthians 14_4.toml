What then? Did they edify no man? "Yes," saith he, "themselves alone:" wherefore also he adds, "He that speaketh in tongue edifieth himself."

And how, if he know not what he saith? Why, for the present, he is speaking of them who understand what they say; understand it themselves, but know not how to render it unto others.

"But he that prophesieth edifieth the Church." Now as great as is the difference between a single person and the Church, so great is the interval between these two. Seest thou his wisdom, how he doth not thrust out the gift and make nothing of it, but signifies it to have some advantage, small though it be, and such as to suffice the possessor only?
