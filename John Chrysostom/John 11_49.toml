1.  The heathen are stuck fast in the destruction which they made; in the trap which they hid is their foot taken. Psalm 9:15, Septuagint This has been the case with the Jews. They said that they would kill Jesus, lest the Romans should come and take away their place and nation; and when they had killed Him, these things happened unto them, and when they had done that by doing which they thought to escape, they yet did not escape. He who was slain is in Heaven, and they who slew have for their portion hell. Yet they did not consider these things; but what? They desired, It says, from that day forth to kill Him John 11:53, for they said, The Romans will come, and will take away our nation; and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, (being more shameless than the rest,) You know nothing. What the others made matter of doubt, and put forth in the way of deliberation, this man cried aloud, shamelessly, openly, audaciously. For what says he? You know nothing, nor consider that it is expedient that one man should die, and that the whole nation perish not.

But what does it mean when it says “being high priest that year”? This matter as well as the rest had been corrupted. For from the time that offices became matters of purchase, they were no longer priests for the whole period of their lives but for a year. Notwithstanding, even in this state of things the Spirit was still present. But when they lifted up their hands against Christ, then it left them and went to the apostles.
