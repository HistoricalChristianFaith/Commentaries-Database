But what does it mean when it says “being high priest that year”? This matter as well as the rest had been corrupted. For from the time that offices became matters of purchase, they were no longer priests for the whole period of their lives but for a year. Notwithstanding, even in this state of things the Spirit was still present. But when they lifted up their hands against Christ, then it left them and went to the apostles.
