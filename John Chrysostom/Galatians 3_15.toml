Ver. 15. "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men; Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed, no one makes it void or adds thereto."

"To speak after the manner of men" means to use human examples.  Having founded his argument on the Scriptures, on the miracles wrought among themselves, on the sufferings of Christ, and on the Patriarch, he proceeds to common usages; and this he does invariably, in order to sweeten his discourse, and render it more acceptable and intelligible to the duller sort. Thus he argues with the Corinthians, "Who feeds a flock, and eats not of the milk of the flock? Who plants a vineyard, and eats not the fruit thereof?" [1 Corinthians 9:7] and again with the Hebrews, "For a testament is of force where there has been death; for does it ever avail while he that made it lives?" [Hebrews 9:17] One may find him dwelling with pleasure on such arguments. In the Old Testament God does the same thing in many instances, as, "Can a woman forget her sucking child?" [Isaiah 49:15] and again, "Shall the clay say to him that fashions it, What do you make?" [Isaiah 45:9] and in Hosea, He represents a husband set at nought by his wife. [Hosea 2:5 ff] This use of human examples frequently occurs in types also, as when the prophet takes the girdle, [Jeremiah 13:1-9] and goes down to the potter's house [Jeremiah 18:1-6] The meaning of the present example is, that Faith is more ancient than the Law, which is later and only temporary, and delivered in order to pave the way for Faith. Hence he says, "Brethren, I speak after the manner of men;" above he had called them "foolish," now he calls them "brethren," at once chiding and encouraging them. "Though it be but a man's covenant, yet when it has been confirmed." If a man, says he, makes a covenant, does any one dare to come afterwards and overturn it, or subjoin anything to it? For this is the meaning of "or adds thereto." Much less then when God makes a covenant; and with whom did God make a covenant?
