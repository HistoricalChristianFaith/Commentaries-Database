Then after so great a storm he does not speak as insultingly over them, but as wishing that at any rate he might be believed for the future. Wherefore also he alleges what had taken place for a testimony of the truth of what was about to be said by him. One is not likely to have a good reception, when he chides in the midst of calamity; but when he tells them what more there is to come of the calamity, and then predicts the good, then he is acceptable. Therefore he attacks them then first, when "all hope that they should be saved was taken away": that none may say, Nothing has come of it. And their fear also bears witness.
