After they had departed with fear and joy, Jesus met them, saying, “Hail!” They ran to him with great joy and gladness. They “took hold of his feet.” Thus they received by his touch an irrefutable proof of his resurrection, with full personal assurance of it. And they “worshiped him.”What does he then say? “Do not be afraid.” Again, Jesus himself casts out their fear, making room for faith: “Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me.” Note well how he himself sends good tidings to his disciples by these women. He thereby brings honor to women, as I have so often said, honor to that sex which is most prone to be dishonored. Through these women he brings good hope and the healing of that which was diseased.
Some among you may desire to be like these faithful women. You too may wish to take hold of the feet of Jesus. You can, even now. You can embrace not only his feet but also his hands and even his sacred head. You too can today receive these awesome mysteries with a pure conscience. You can embrace him not only in this life but also even more fully on that day when you shall see him coming with unspeakable glory, with a multitude of the angels. If you are so disposed, along with him, to be compassionate, you shall hear not only these words, “All hail!”
