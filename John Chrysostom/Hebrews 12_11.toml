They who drink bitter medicines first submit to some unpleasantness and afterwards feel the benefit. For such is virtue, such is vice. In the latter, there is first the pleasure, then the despondency; in the former, first the despondency, and then the pleasure. But there is no equality; for it is not the same to be first grieved and afterwards pleased and to be first pleased and afterwards grieved. How so? Because, in the latter case, the expectation of coming despondency makes the present pleasure less, but, in the former, the expectation of coming pleasure cuts away the violence of present despondency. The result is that, in the one instance, we never have pleasure; in the latter, we never have grief.…From this Paul then undertakes to console them and again takes up the common judgment of people, which no one is able to stand against or to contend with the common decision, when one says what is acknowledged by all.
You are suffering, he says. For such is chastisement; such is its beginning. “For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant.” He said well, “seems.” Discipline, he means, is not grievous but “seems” so. “All discipline” … means both human and spiritual. Do you see that he argues from our common notions? “Seems painful,” he says, so that it is not really so. For what sort of pain brings forth joy? So neither does pleasure bring forth despondency.
Nevertheless, “later it yields the peaceful fruits of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.” Not “fruit” but “fruits,” a great abundance.
“To those,” he says, “who have been trained by it.” That is, to those who have endured for a long while and been patient. And he uses an auspicious expression; so then, discipline is exercise, making the athlete strong and invincible in combats, irresistible in conflicts.
