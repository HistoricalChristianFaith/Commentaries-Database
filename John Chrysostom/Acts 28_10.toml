not that he received wages, God forbid; but as it is written, The workman is worthy of his meat. And when we departed, they laded us with such things as were necessary. Matthew 10:10 It is plain that having thus received them, they also received the word of the preaching: for it is not to be supposed, that during an entire three months they would have had all this kindness shown them, had these persons not believed strongly, and herein exhibited the fruits (of their conversion): so that from this we may see a strong proof of the great number there was of those that believed. Even this was enough to establish (Paul's) credit with those (his fellow-voyagers). Observe how in all this voyage they nowhere touched at a city, but (were cast) on an island, and passed the entire winter (there, or) sailing— those being herein under training for faith, his fellow-voyagers, I mean. (a) And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.

both us and the rest. See how when they were quit of the storm, they did not become more negligent, but what a liberal entertainment was given to them for Paul's sake: and three months were they there, all of them provided with sustenance. See how all this is done for the sake of Paul, to the end that the prisoners should believe, and the soldiers, and the centurion. For if they were very stone, yet from the counsel they heard him giving, and from the prediction they had heard him making, and from the miracles they knew him to have wrought, and from the sustenance they by his means enjoyed, they must have got a very high notion of him. See, when the judgment is right, and not preoccupied by some passion, how immediately it gets right judgings, and gives sound verdicts. And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose sign was Castor and Pollux. And landing at Syracuse, we tarried there three days. And from thence we fetched a compass, and came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli: where we found brethren, and were desired to tarry with them seven days: and so we went toward Rome. And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as Appii forum, and the Three Taverns: whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.

“They presented,” it says, “many gifts to us.” Not that [Paul] received wages, God forbid, but as it is written, “The worker is worth his keep.” “When we sailed, they put on board whatever we needed.” It is clear that their hosts, who afforded them such hospitality, also received the word of the preaching. For they would not have been treated so kindly for three days had their hosts not believed strongly and shown the fruits of conversion.
