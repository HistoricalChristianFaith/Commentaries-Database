Christ rebukes the state of mind in which the father had come to him and spoken to him as he did because, before the miracle, the father’s faith was not that strong. The fact that he came and entreated Jesus was nothing special, for parents often are so carried away by their affection that they consult not only those physicians they depend on, but even people they do not depend on at all. This is because they do not want to leave any possibility unexplored.… But if he had any strong reliance on Christ, he would not have hesitated to go to Jesus in Judea when his child was at the point of death.
