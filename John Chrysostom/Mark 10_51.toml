He will save assuredly; yet he will do so just in the way he has promised. But in what way has he promised? On our willing it, and on our hearing him. For he does not make a promise to blocks of wood.

(Hom. in Matt. 66) Or He asks, lest men should think that what He granted the man was not what he wanted. For it was His practice to make the good disposition of those who were to be cured known to all men, and then to apply the remedy, in order to stir up others to emulation, and to show that he who was to be cured was worthy to obtain the grace. It goes on: The blind man said unto him, Lord, that I may receive my sight.
