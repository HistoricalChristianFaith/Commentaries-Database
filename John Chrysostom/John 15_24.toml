Jesus proclaims ahead of time that there will be no small punishment against them. For, since they continually pretended that they persecuted him on account of the Father, to deprive them of this excuse he says: I gave them doctrine, I added miracles, which, according to Moses’ law, should convince all if the doctrine itself is good also. If I had not done among them the works that no one else had ever done, they would have had no sin.
