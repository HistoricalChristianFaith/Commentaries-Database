At this point he is describing a harsh war concerted from every direction and a famous victory. You see, after he said that God comes to [the city’s] aid and gives evidence of great care, he then shows also how he came to its aid. When countless nations made an attack (this he suggests, note, in mentioning the great number of kings), and not simply an attack but concerted and combined, such extraordinary developments occurred that they departed, marveling at the surprising turn of events.… Thus it is clear that instead of the war being conducted in terms of human logic, it was God whose tactics directed the fighting, who not only depressed the enemies’ spirits but also shook their resolve by causing distress in their ranks and prompting an unspeakable fear in them. It was the same as if a great fleet had assembled and an unfavorable wind came on them and smashed the ships, sank the triremes and instilled instant disorder.
