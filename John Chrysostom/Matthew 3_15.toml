To this Jesus did not merely reply “Let it be so,” but he added pointedly, “now.” The implication: It will not be so forever. You will not always see the One for whom the prophets have longed. But for the present, permit this. And then he shows how this baptism is fitting. Why? “For thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” The whole law is fulfilled by “all righteousness,” by which all the commandments are performed. He is in effect saying, “Since then we have performed all the rest of the commandments, this baptism alone remains. I have come to do away with the curse that is appointed for the transgression of the law. So I must therefore first fulfill it all and, having delivered you from its condemnation, bring it to an end. It is fitting for me therefore to fulfill the whole law by the same rule by which it is fitting for me to do away with the curse that is written against you in the law. This is the very purpose of my assuming flesh and coming to you.”
