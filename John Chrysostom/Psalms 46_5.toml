He who is in fact so exalted, uncircumscribed by place, the ineffable being, deigned to call our city his dwelling and sustains it from every quarter. This, you see, is the meaning of “in her midst,” as elsewhere also he says, “Behold, I am with you.” He supports it on all sides; thus not only will the city come to no harm, but it will not even be shaken. The reason is that it enjoys the most prompt assistance, which is ever ready and prepared; this, you see, is the meaning of “as day dawns,” not pending or delayed but ever fresh and abounding, and at the appropriate time.
