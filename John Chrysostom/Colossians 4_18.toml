Hear Paul’s chains, and you will understand that to be in affliction is no proof of being forsaken. Would you wear silken robes? Remember Paul’s chains, and these fine clothes will appear to you more worthless than the rags of a menstruating woman. Would you array yourself with gold trinkets? Listen in your mind to Paul’s chains, and trinkets will seem to you no better than a withered bulrush…. Would you daub yourself with pastes and pigments and similar things? Think of Paul’s tears: for three years, night and day, he continued to weep…. What fountain will you compare to these tears? Homilies on Colossians
