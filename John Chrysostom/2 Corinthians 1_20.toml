"For how many soever be the promises of God, in Him is the yea, and in Him the Amen, unto the glory of God by us."

What is this, "how many soever the promises of God?" The Preaching promised many things; and these many things they proffered and preached. For they discoursed of being raised again, and of being taken up, and of incorruption, and of those great rewards and unspeakable goods. As to these promises then, he saith that they abide immoveable, and in them is no yea and nay, that is, the things spoken were not now true, and now false, as was the case about my being with you, but always true.

And first indeed he contends for the articles of the faith, and the word concerning Christ, saying, "My word" and my preaching, "was not yea and nay;" next, for the promises "for how many soever be the promises, of God, in Him is the yea." But if the things He promised are sure and He will certainly give them, much more is He Himself and the word concerning Him, sure, and it can not be said that He is now, and now is not, but He "always" is, and is the same. But what is, "In Him is the yea, and the Amen." He signifies that which shall certainly be. For in Him, not in man, the promises have their being and fulfilment. Fear not, therefore; for it is not man so that thou shouldest mistrust; but it is God Who both said and fulfilleth. "Unto the glory of God through us." What is, "unto [His] glory through us?" He fulfilleth them by us, that is, and by His benefits towards us unto His glory; for this is "for the glory of God." But if they be for the glory of God, they will certainly come to pass. For His own glory He will not think little of, even did He think little of our salvation. But as it is, He thinketh not little of our salvation either, both because He loveth mankind exceedingly, and because our salvation is bound up with His glory from these things accruing.
