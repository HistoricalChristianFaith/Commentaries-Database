For the disciples of John being ever jealously disposed towards Christ's disciples and Christ Himself, when they saw them baptizing, began to reason with those who were baptized, as though their baptism was in a manner superior to that of Christ's disciples; and taking one of the baptized, they tried to persuade him of this; but persuaded him not. Hear how the Evangelist has given us to understand that it was they who attacked him, not he who set on foot the question. He does not say, that a certain Jew questioned with them, but that, there arose a questioning from the disciples of John with a certain Jew,  concerning purification.

2. And observe, I pray you, the Evangelist's inoffensiveness. He does not speak in the way of invective, but as far as he is able softens the charge, merely saying, that a question arose; whereas the sequel (which he has also set down in an inoffensive manner) makes it plain that what was said was said from jealousy.

Why, when the disciples of Jesus were baptizing, didn’t John stop baptizing? Why did he continue even until he was led to prison?… He would have made the disciples of Jesus seem the more revered if he had stopped when they began.… But he did so because he did not want to excite his own disciples to an even stronger rivalry and contention than there already was between the two. For even if he had proclaimed Christ ten thousand times and given him the chief place, making himself much more the inferior, he still would not have been able to persuade his disciples to run to Christ. In fact, they would have most likely become more hostile. This is why Christ began to preach more constantly once John was removed. Indeed, the reason, I think, why John’s death was permitted and Christ was made the great preacher in his place was so that the people might transfer their affections entirely to Christ and no longer be divided between the two.…Instead, by continuing to preach, John received no glory for himself but sent hearers to Christ. And he was better able to do this service than Christ’s own disciples were. This is because his testimony was so free from suspicion and his reputation with the people so much higher than theirs.…
But if anyone asks how the disciples’ baptism was better than John’s, we reply that it was not. Both alike were without the gift of the Spirit, both parties alike had one reason for baptizing, that is, to lead the baptized to Christ.… That the baptisms had no superiority over one another is shown by what follows [in the dispute].…
For the disciples of John did become so envious of Christ’s disciples, and even of Christ himself, that when they saw the latter baptizing, they threw contempt on their baptism as being inferior to that of John’s. And they tried to persuade one of those who were baptized of this but were not successful. That it was they who began the dispute, and not the Jews, the Evangelist implies by saying that “there arose a question from John’s disciples with a certain Jew,” instead of saying, “A certain Jew posed a question.”
