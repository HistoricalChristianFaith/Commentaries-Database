"Watch ye, stand fast in the faith."

Not in the wisdom which is without: for there it is not possible to stand, but to be borne along; even as "in the faith" ye may "stand." "Quit you like men, be strong." "Let all that you do be done in love." Now in saying these things, he seems indeed to advise; but he is reprimanding them as indolent. Wherefore he says, "Watch," as though they slept; "Stand," as though they were rocking to and fro: "Quit you like men," as though they were playing the coward: "Let all that you do be done in love," as though they were in dissensions. And the first caution refers to the deceivers, viz., "Watch," "stand:" the next, to those who plot against us, "Quit you like men:" the third, to those who make parties and endeavor to distract, "Let all that you do be done in love;" which thing is "the bond of perfectness," and the root and fountain of all blessings.

But what means, "All things in love?" "Whether any one rebuke," says he, "or rule or be ruled, or learn or teach, let all be in love:" since in fact all the things which have been mentioned arose from neglect of it. For if this had not been neglected, they would not have been puffed up, they would not have said, "I am of Paul, and I of Apollos." If this had existed, they would not have gone to law before heathens, or rather they would not have gone to law at all. If this had existed, that notorious person would not have taken his father's wife: they would not have despised the weak brethren; there would have been no factions among them; they would not have been vain-glorious about their gifts. Therefore it is that he says, "Let all things be done in love."
