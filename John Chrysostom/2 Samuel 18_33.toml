So great is the concern and sympathy of a good pastor. For David was deeply moved at their falling, as when one’s own children are killed. And on this ground he begged that the wrath might come upon himself. And in the beginning of the slaughter he would have done this, unless he had seen it advancing and expected that it would come to himself. When therefore he saw that this did not happen, but that the calamity was raging among them, he no longer forbore but was touched more than for Amnon his firstborn. For then he did not ask for death, but now he begs to fall in preference to the others. Such ought a ruler to be and to grieve rather at the calamities of others than his own. Some such thing he suffered in his son’s case likewise, that you might see that he did not love his son more than his subjects. The youth was promiscuous and mistreated his father, yet still the father said, “Would that I might have died for you!” What do you say, you blessed one, you who are meekest of all men? Your son was set upon killing you and surrounded you with unnumbered ills. And when he had been removed, and the trophy was raised, do you then pray to be slain? Yes, he says, for it is not for me that the army has been victorious, but I am warred against more violently than before, and my insides are now more torn than before.
