It is well said, Of the fathers, to show that they were not Jews, but aliens from the law, and that it was not from zeal (for the law) that they were acting. That you should know His will. Why then His will is this. See how in the form of narrative it is teaching. And see That Just One, and hear the voice of His mouth. For you shall be His witness unto all men of what you have seen and heard. And see, he says, that Just One.
