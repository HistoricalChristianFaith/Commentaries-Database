"And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldest know His will, and see That Just One." It is well said, "Of the fathers," to show that they were not Jews, but aliens from the law, and that it was not from zeal for the law that they were acting. "That thou shouldest know His will." Why then His will is this. See how in the form of narrative it is teaching. "And see That Just One, and hear the voice of His mouth." See how high he raises the fact! For the present he says no more than this: if He is Just, they are guilty.
