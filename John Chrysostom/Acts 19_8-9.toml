"And having entered in to the synagogue," etc. But why did he speak boldly? It means, he was ready to confront dangers, and disputed more openly, not veiling the doctrines. "But when some were hardened, and spake evil of the way, having departed from them, he separated the disciples." He put a stop, it means, to their evil-speaking: he did not wish to kindle their envy, nor to bring them into more contention. Hence let us also learn not to put ourselves in the way of evil-speaking men, but to depart from them: he did not speak evil, when himself evil spoken of. "He disputed daily," and by this gained the many, that, being evil intreated and evil spoken of, he did not utterly break away from them, and keep aloof. The evil-speakers are defeated. They calumniated the doctrine itself; therefore so as neither to rouse the disciples to wrath, nor disturb them, he withdrew, showing that everywhere alike they repel salvation from them.
