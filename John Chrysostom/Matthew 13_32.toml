Therefore He brought forward the similitude of this herb, which has a very strong resemblance to the subject in hand.
Thus He meant to set forth the most decisive sign of its greatness. Even so then shall it be with respect to the gospel too, says He. Yea, for His disciples were weakest of all, and least of all; but nevertheless, because of the great power that was in them, It has been unfolded in every part of the world.

Therefore he brought forward the similitude of this herb, which has a very strong resemblance to the kingdom of heaven. It indeed is “the least of all seeds, but when it is grown, it is the greatest among herbs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.” Thus he meant to set forth the most decisive sign of its greatness. “Even so then shall it also be with respect to the gospel,” he says. For his disciples were weakest of all and least of all. Nevertheless, because of the great power that was in them, it has grown and been unfolded in every part of the world.

Seeing the Lord had said above that three parts of the seed perish, and one only is preserved, and of that one part there is much loss by reason of thetares that are sown upon it; that none might say, Who then and how many shall they be that believe; He removes this cause of fear by the parable of the mustard seed. Therefore it is said, “Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like unto a grain of mustard seed.”.
Or; The seed of the Gospel is the least of seeds, because the disciples were weaker than the whole of mankind; yet forasmuch as there was great might inthem, their preaching spread throughout the whole world. And therefore it follows, “But when it isgrown it is the greatest among herbs,” that is among dogmas.
