And [Peter] withdrew to another place. He did not tempt God or even throw himself into temptation. When they were commanded to do something, they did it. “Go,” the angel said, “and speak in the temple to the people.” The angel did not say this here, but, by silently removing him and bringing him out by night, he gave him the power to withdraw. And this is done to teach us that matters are often providentially arranged in human terms, in this case, to prevent him from falling into danger again.
