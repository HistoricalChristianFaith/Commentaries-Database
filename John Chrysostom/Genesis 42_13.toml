O what duplicity! They included in the number even the one sold to merchants and said not “We were twelve” but “We are twelve; see, the youngest is with our father.” This in fact was what Joseph was anxious to learn, whether or not they had treated their brother in the same way. “See, the youngest is with our father, while the other one is no longer alive.” They did not admit their guilt openly but said simply, “He is no longer alive.” From this he arrived at the suspicion that they had done the same thing to Benjamin as well, and so he replied, “That is what I said to you—you are spies. In fact, you are not to leave here until your youngest brother comes here.” I want to see him, I desire to set my eyes on the one who caused the same birth pangs as I. Actually, I suspect the same hatred for your brother as you displayed toward me. So if you are prepared to, “send one of your number and bring him here to me”; as for yourselves, stay in prison until he arrives. You see, when he arrives he will clear you of all suspicion. If in fact this doesn’t happen, it will be clear that you are spies and have come here for that purpose. With these words “he put them in jail.”
