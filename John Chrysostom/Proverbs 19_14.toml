When a certain wise man says, “It is by the Lord that a man is matched with a woman,” he means this: God made marriage, and not that it is God that joins together every man that comes to be married with a woman. For we see many that come to be with one another for evil, even by the law of marriage, and this we should not ascribe to God. .
