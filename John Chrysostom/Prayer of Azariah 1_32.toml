Here you see not only the yoke of an animal but also the chariots of the infinitude of martyrs and God who is above these chariots and leads them to heaven. Regarding the souls of the saints being the chariots of God, listen to what the prophet says, “The chariots of God are thousands on thousands.” What he gave to the heavenly powers, he has also given to our nature. He is seated on the cherubim, as the psalm says, “He rode on a cherub and flew,” and, “He who sits on the cherubim and looks into the depths.” And this is what he has also given to us. He sits on them; he dwells in us. “I will dwell in you and walk among you.” They became a chariot; we become a temple. Have you noticed the relationship of honor? Have you noticed how he has mollified both what is higher and what is lower? For this reason, if we desire it, we differ from the angels in nothing.
