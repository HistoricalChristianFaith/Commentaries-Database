The reason why the good Lord inflicted this penalty on the king, guiltless though he was of sin, was that he might accede to the just man’s prayers and thus resolve the problem, thereby rendering the just man more famous and well known. You see, all God’s planning and each arrangement he makes have the purpose of rendering conspicuous those who serve him, just like lamps, and making their virtue obvious in every way.
