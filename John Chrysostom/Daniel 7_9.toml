Are they not the thrones concerning which our Lord said, “You will sit on twelve thrones”? … Beloved, do not imagine God as having anything like a body, and do not think that God, who is boundless, can be confined to a throne. For if “in his hands are the boundaries of the earth,” and if “he erected the mountains,” and if “all the nations are reckoned as spittle in his sight” and if “all things are as dust before him,” as he himself says, what place would be able to enclose him altogether at one time? What shall we say? The state of affairs cannot be exactly as it is described; God is not confined to a throne. If he was wearing clothing, how would fire not consume it? And why is that one called the Ancient of Days, when he existed before all ages? In what way can he even be said to be ancient, since the Scripture says, “You are always the same.” Why then is he called ancient, when it is written, “And your years will not come to an end?” And what would be the garment to be cast around a boundless and incorporeal being? For it says, “There is no end to his greatness.” And again, “If I ascend into heaven, you are there; if I descend into hell, you are there.” How then can he be restrained by human clothing and yet not consume it? But truly the prophet was able to see and read many other things of this type. How were his hairs not burned with fire?

Let us strive with our minds to understand, beloved, for it is no small matter that we are discussing. He says, “Thrones were set, and the Ancient of Days was seated.” Who is he? When you heard about a bear, you did not think about a bear; when you heard about a lioness, you did not perceive that animal but rather kingdoms; and when you heard about the sea, you did not perceive a sea but rather the world. Each time you thought of something else as being present in those images. That is also the case now. What is an Ancient of Days? He is similar to an old man. Now this old man takes shape for the purposes for which he appears. And here he shows that old men must be entrusted with rendering judgment. For just as when you hear the word throne, you do not understand it to mean a mere chair—for who would lay hold of such a base and vulgar meaning, when God seems fully armed here and bloodthirsty there?—so he wishes this to mean that it is a time for judgment. “His clothing was white as snow.” Why? It is not only a time of judgment but also retribution. All those must stand before him because “his judgment will go forth like the light.”

And again, “The Ancient of Days sat,” here again, taking the term “ancient” as among those laudatory expressions that confer highest glory. Elsewhere the Scripture takes the term “old” in the sense of blame; for seeing that the things are of various aspects as being composed of many parts, it uses the same words both in a good and an evil import, not according to the same shade of meaning.
