Whether any inquire about Titus; he is my partner and my fellow-worker to youward.

What is, Whether about Titus? 'If,' says he, 'it be necessary to say any thing, this I have to say,' that he is my partner and fellow-worker to youward. For he either means this; or, 'if you will do anything for Titus, you will do it unto no ordinary person, for he is my partner.' And while appearing to be praising him, he magnifies them, showing them to be so disposed towards himself as that it were sufficient ground of honor among them that any one should appear to be his partner. But, nevertheless, he was not content with this, but he also added another thing, saying, fellow-worker to youward. Not merely fellow-worker, 'but in matters concerning you, in your progress, in your growth, in our friendship, in our zeal for you;' which last would avail most especially to endear him unto them.

Or our brethren: 'or whether you wish,' he says, 'to hear any thing about the others: they too have great claims to be commended to you. For they also,' he says, 'are our brethren, and,

The messengers of the Churches,' that is, sent by the Churches. Then, which is greater than all,

The glory of Christ; for to Him is referred whatever shall be done to them. 'Whether then ye wish to receive them as brethren, or as Apostles of the Churches, or as acting for the glory of Christ; you have many motives for good will towards them. For on behalf of Titus, I have to say, that he is both my partner, and a lover of you; on behalf of these, that they are brethren, that they are the messengers of the churches, that they are the glory of Christ. Do you see that it is plain from hence also, that they were of such as were unknown to them?  For otherwise he would have set them off by those things with which he had also set off Titus, namely, his love towards them. But whereas as yet they were not known to them, 'Receive them,' he says, 'as brethren, as messengers of the churches, as acting for the glory of Christ.'

It is clear from this that Titus had a special task relating to the church at Corinth, whereas the others were unknown there.
