"That which I speak, I speak not after the Lord, but as in foolishness, in this confidence of glorifying."

Do you see how glorying is not "after the Lord?" For He says, "When you shall have done all, say, We are unprofitable servants." [Luke 17:10] Howbeit, by itself indeed it is not "after the Lord," but by the intention it becomes so. And therefore he said, "That which I speak," not accusing the motive, but the words. Since his aim is so admirable as to dignify the words also. For as a manslayer, though his action be of those most strictly forbidden, has often been approved from the intention; and as circumcision, although it is not 'after the Lord,' has become so from the intention, so also glorying. And wherefore then does he not use so great strictness of expression? Because he is hastening on to another point, and he freely gratifies even to superfluity those who are desirous to find a handle against him, so that he may say only the things that are profitable; for when said they were enough to extinguish all that suspicion. "But as in foolishness." Before he says, Would that you could bear with me in a little foolishness,'' [2 Corinthians 11:4] but now "as in foolishness;" for the farther he proceeds, the more he clears his language. Then that you may not think that he plays the fool on all points, he added, "in this confidence of glorying." In this particular he means: just as in another place he said, "that we be not put to shame," and added, "in this confidence of glorying." [2 Corinthians 9:4] And again, in another place, having said, "Or what I purpose do I purpose according to the flesh, that with me there should be the yea yea, and the nay nay?" [2 Corinthians 1:17] And having shown that he cannot in all cases even fulfil what he promises, because he does not purpose after the flesh, lest any should make this suspicion stretch to the doctrine also, he adds, "But as God is faithful our word towards you was not yea and nay." [2 Corinthians 1:18]

2. And observe how after having said so many things before, he again sets down yet other grounds of excuse, saying further thus...
