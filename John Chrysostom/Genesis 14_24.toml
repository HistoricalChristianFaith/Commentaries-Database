These I will allow to take a portion, he says, since they have given evidence of deep friendship. “These,” you see, the text says, “were Abram’s confederates,” that is, they were joined in friendship, willing to share the perils with him. Hence, with the intention of rewarding them, he is even prepared to take some portion, and in this once again he fulfills the apostolic law in the words “the worker deserves his fare.” I mean, he lets them take no more than their due: “except what my young men consumed and the portion for the men who accompanied me, Eschol, Aner and Mamre—they will take a portion.” Do you see the precision of the patriarch’s virtue? He gives evidence as well of good sense in the matter of his disregard and scorn for wealth. And at the same time [he does] everything so as not to appear to have acted from pretense or contempt and thus to have entertained grandiose notions about winning the victory.
