(Hom. lxx.) They send their disciples and Herod's soldiers together, that whatever opinion the might give might be found fault with. Yet would they rather have had Him say somewhat against the Herodians; for being themselves afraid to lay hands on Him because of the populace, they sought to bring Him into danger through His liability to pay tribute.

This was a covert allusion to Herod and Cæsar.

They knew that certain had before suffered death for this very thing, as plotting a rebellion against the Romans, therefore they sought by such discourse to bring Him into the same suspicion.

But when you hear this command to render to Cæsar the things of Cæsar, know that such things only are intended which in nothing are opposed to religion; if such there be, it is no longer Cæsar's but the Devil's tribute. And moreover, that they might not say that He was subjecting them to man, He adds, And unto God the things that, are God's.
