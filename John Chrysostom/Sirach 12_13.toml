Like a wild beast fallen onto a noble and delicate body incapable of defending itself, thus vanity has sunk its heavy teeth into you and injected its poison and diffused a great stench. It has thrown away some parts, after having mutilated them; other parts it has torn to pieces, again others devoured. And, if it were possible for someone to see vanity and the church in the same arena, the pitiful spectacle might have looked like this—although much more distressing than what happens in the arena—the body thrown away with the beast towering over it and watching over every part of it. The beast drives back anyone who assaults it and does not distance itself or abandon that body. Who then will chase this wild animal away? It is the duty of him who wages this battle to send his angels, invoked by us, and, after they have closed this beast’s daring and impudent mouth as if with braces, they will chase it away. But when he waged the battle it was under the condition that once it was chased away, we would not go after it. And so, after he sends it away, ordering that terrible beast to stay away from us, if we—even after we have been saved from its clutches and it has been chased into its cave—covered with a thousand wounds still go looking for it again and get it roused up and excited again, then he will not have further pity on us, and he will not save us: “Who, in fact, will have pity on a snake charmer bitten by a serpent and on those who get close to the wild beasts?”
