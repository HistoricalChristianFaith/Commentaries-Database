For since he had spoken of those who "caused divisions and offenses among them," he has mentioned "the God of peace" also, that they might feel hopeful about the riddance of these evils. For he that rejoices in this (i.e., peace) will put an end to that which makes havoc of it. And he does not say, will subject, but "will bruise" [Genesis 3:19], which is a stronger expression. And not those people only, but also him who was the general over them herein, Satan. And not "will bruise" merely, but "under your feet," so that they may obtain the victory themselves, and become noble by the trophy. And the time again is made a ground of comfort. For he adds, "shortly." And this was prayer and prophecy as well at once. "The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you."

That greatest weapon; that impregnable wall; that tower unshaken! For he reminds them of the grace, that he may give them the more alacrity. Because if you have been freed from the ills more grievous by far, and freed by grace only, much more will you be freed from the lesser, now you have become friends too, and contribute your own share likewise. You see how he neither puts prayer without works, nor works without prayer. For after giving them credit for their obedience, than he prays; to show that we need both, our own part as well as God's part, if we are to be duly saved. For it was not before only, but now too, even though we be great and in high esteem, we need grace from Him.
