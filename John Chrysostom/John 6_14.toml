"And the multitudes said, that this is of a truth The Prophet." Oh, excess of gluttony! He had done ten thousand things more admirable than this, but nowhere did they make this confession, save when they had been filled. Yet hence it is evident that they expected some remarkable prophet; for those others had said to John, "Art thou that Prophet?" while these say, "This is that Prophet."
