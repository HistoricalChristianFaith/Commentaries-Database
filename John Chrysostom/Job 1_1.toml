Each of these epithets is sufficient to show the beauty of Job’s soul. But, as a lover multiplies the details in order to describe the one he loves, so the same occurs here. “Blameless” the text says, that is, perfectly virtuous. “Upright,” and also “true,” and also “pious,” and again, “he turned away from any evil.” Notice the words “from any,” and not simply from one evil and not from another. Where are those who assert that human nature is inclined toward evil? What fear, what tribunals and what laws made Job as he is?
