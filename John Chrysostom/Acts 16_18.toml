In imitation of his teacher; for so too did Christ rebuke. For he did not wish to have testimony from them. And why did the demon do this? Because he wanted to confound the order of things, to snatch away the apostles' dignity and to persuade many to pay attention to him. If that had happened, they would have appeared trustworthy from then on and introduced their own designs. To prevent this and to forestall deceit, [Paul] silences them even though they speak the truth, so that no one should pay any attention to their lies but stop listening altogether to what they say.

At first then, Paul would not admit it, but scorned it, not wishing to cast himself all at once upon miracles; but when it continued to do this, and pointed to their work "who preach unto us the way of salvation," then he commanded it to come out. For it says, "Paul being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour."

"And Paul being grieved," etc. By their clamor and shouting they thought to alarm them the magistrates: saying, "These men do exceedingly trouble our city." What sayest thou? Dost thou believe the demon? Why not here also? He saith, They are "servants of the most high God"; thou sayest, "They exceedingly trouble our city": he saith, "They show us the way of salvation"; thou sayest, "They teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive." Observe, how they do not attend even to the demon, but look only to one thing, their covetousness.
