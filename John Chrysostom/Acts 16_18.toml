Why did the demon utter these words, and why did Paul forbid him? The one acted maliciously, the other wisely. For [Paul] did not want to make him believable. If Paul had admitted his testimony, the demon would have deceived many of the believers, since he was accepted by Paul. For this reason he allows him to say things against them, in order to establish things for him, and the demon uses agreement for the purpose of destruction. At first then, Paul did not admit him but spat upon him, not wishing to cast himself entirely upon miracles. But when the demon continued to do this for many days and pointed to their work, “These men are servants of the most high God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation,” he commanded it to come out.

In imitation of his teacher; for so too did Christ rebuke. For he did not wish to have testimony from them. And why did the demon do this? Because he wanted to confound the order of things, to snatch away the apostles’ dignity and to persuade many to pay attention to him. If that had happened, they would have appeared trustworthy from then on and introduced their own designs. To prevent this and to forestall deceit, [Paul] silences them even though they speak the truth, so that no one should pay any attention to their lies but stop listening altogether to what they say.
