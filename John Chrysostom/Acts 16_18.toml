In imitation of his teacher; for so too did Christ rebuke. For he did not wish to have testimony from them. And why did the demon do this? Because he wanted to confound the order of things, to snatch away the apostles’ dignity and to persuade many to pay attention to him. If that had happened, they would have appeared trustworthy from then on and introduced their own designs. To prevent this and to forestall deceit, [Paul] silences them even though they speak the truth, so that no one should pay any attention to their lies but stop listening altogether to what they say.
