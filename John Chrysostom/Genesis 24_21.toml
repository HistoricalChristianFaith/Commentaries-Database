The dutiful servant therefore now saw God’s providence distinctly. “He kept observing her closely,” the text goes on, “and remained silent so as to know if the Lord had made his journey successful or not.” What is the meaning of “kept observing her closely”? He kept studying the maiden’s very words, her gaze, her walk, her appearance, everything else about her, and waited to see “if the Lord had successfully conducted his journey or not.” You see, what had happened so far, the text is saying, showed the maiden’s great virtue that exceeded ordinary limits. Hence, to reward her for her response and the offer of water, the text goes on, he pressed upon her “golden earrings and two bracelets.” He carefully made enquiries about her, asking, “Whose daughter are you?” and “Is there room in your father’s house for us to rest?”
