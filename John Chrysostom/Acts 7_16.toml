It shows, that they were not masters even to the extent of a burying-place. But when the time of the promise drew near, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt, till another king arose, which knew not Joseph (v. 17, 18). Observe, that it is not during the four hundred years that He multiplies them, but (only) when the end was about to draw near. And yet already four hundred years were passed, nay more, in Egypt. But this is the wonder of it. The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and evil-entreated our fathers, that they should cast out their young children, to the end they might not live.
