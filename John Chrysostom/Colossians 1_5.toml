He speaks of the good things to come. This is with a view to their temptations, that they should not seek their rest here. For lest any should say, "And where is the good of their love toward the saints, if they themselves are in affliction?" he says, "We rejoice that you are securing for yourselves a noble reception in heaven." "Because of the hope," he says, "which is laid up." He shows its secureness. "Whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth." Here the expression is as if he would chide them, as having changed from it when they had long held it.

"Whereof," says he, "ye heard before in the word of the truth of the Gospel." And he bears witness to its truth. With good reason, for in it there is nothing false.

"Of the Gospel." He does not say, "of the preaching," but he calls it the "Gospel," continually  reminding them of God's benefits.  And having first praised them, he next reminds them of these.

[Paul] speaks of the good things to come. He has in view their temptations. They should not seek their rest here…. “Because of the hope,” he says, “which is laid up.” He shows how secure this hope is.
