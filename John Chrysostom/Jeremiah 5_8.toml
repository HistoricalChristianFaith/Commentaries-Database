Some are so cold and senseless that they are always looking only for the things that are here and saying such things as, “Let me enjoy all the present things for a time, and then I will consider things out of sight. I will gratify my belly. I will be a slave to pleasures. I will make full use of the present life; give me today, and take tomorrow.” What foolishness! How are these people any different from goats and swine? For if the prophet allows that they are not to be considered human when they “neigh after their neighbor’s wife,” who shall blame us for considering them to be goats and swine and more insensible than donkeys when they hold as uncertain those things that, in the end, are even more evident than what we see?
