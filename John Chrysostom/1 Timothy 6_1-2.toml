Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers. Rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their service are believers and beloved. In the epistles to the Ephesians and Colossians he commands the same. So it is obvious that Paulâ€™s intention is not to abolish slavery as a social institution. Rather, he attacks slavery in its worst form, the slavery to evil, which pays no respect to any external freedom.
