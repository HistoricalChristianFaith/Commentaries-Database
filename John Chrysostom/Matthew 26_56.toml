See how even up to the last hour, and in the very act of being betrayed, He did all things for their amendment, healing, prophesying, threatening. For, He says, they shall perish by the sword. To show that He is suffering voluntarily, He says, I was daily with you teaching; to manifest His accordance with the Father, He adds, That the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled.

But wherefore did they not lay hold on Him in the temple? Because they would not have dared in the temple, on account of the people. Wherefore also He went forth without, both by the place and by the time giving them security, and even to the last hour taking away their excuse. For He who, in order that He might obey the prophets, gave up even Himself, how did He teach things contrary to them?

Then all His disciples, it is said, forsook Him, and fled. For when He was seized, they remained; but when He had said these things to the multitudes, they fled. For thenceforth they saw that escape was no longer possible, when He was giving Himself up to them voluntarily, and saying, that this was done according to the Scriptures.
