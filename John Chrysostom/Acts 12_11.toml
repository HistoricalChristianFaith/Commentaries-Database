And when Peter was come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews. When the angel departed, then Peter understood: "Now I perceive," says he, not then. But why is this so, and why is Peter not sensible of the things taking place, although he had already experienced a like deliverance when all were released? The Lord would have the pleasure come to him all at once, and that he should first be at liberty, and then be sensible of what had happened.

And when he came to himself: for in very truth, it was indeed an amazement. "Now," saith he, "I know" - now, not then, when I was in the prison - "that the Lord hath sent His Angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the people of the Jews."

Now know I that the Lord hath sent His Angel. Why is not this effected by themselves? I answer: By this also the Lord honors them, that by the ministry of His Angels he rescues them. Then why was it not so in the case of Paul? There with good reason, because the jailer was to be converted, whereas here, it was only that the Apostle should be released. And God disposes all things in divers ways. And there too, it is beautiful, that Paul sings hymns, while here Peter was asleep.
