“Therefore I ask that you not be discouraged by my tribulations for you, which are your glory.” How are Paul’s tribulations “for them”? How are they “their glory”? It is because God so loved them that he gave even the Son for them and afflicted his servants for them. Paul was in prison so that they might attain so many blessings. Surely this comes from God’s exceeding love toward them. It illustrates what God also says concerning the prophets, “I have slain them by the word of my mouth.” But why were they fainting through another’s affliction? He means they were troubled and distressed. Paul says the same things when writing to the Thessalonians: “that no one be moved by these afflictions.” For we should rejoice in afflictions rather than grieve in them. If you find consolation in being warned beforehand, we tell you that here we have tribulation. And why you ask? Because the Lord has ordered it so.
