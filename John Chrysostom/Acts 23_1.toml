Right justly, and ruler-like, and mildly: And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.

And they that stood by said, Do you revile God's high priest? Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was the high priest: for it is written, You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.
