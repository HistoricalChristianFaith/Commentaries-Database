He spoke these things in order to show that he would return unexpectedly and suddenly and when many were living luxuriously. For Paul also says this: “When they shall speak of peace and security, then sudden destruction will come upon them.”  To show just how unexpectedly he uses the metaphor “as travail comes upon a woman with child.”
