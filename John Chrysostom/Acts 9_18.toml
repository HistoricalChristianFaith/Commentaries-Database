"And immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales." Some say this was a sign of his blindness. Why did he not blind his eyes entirely? This was more wonderful, that, with his eyes open, he did not see: which was just his case in respect of the Law, until the Name of Jesus was put on him. With hands laid on, he spake these words. "And immediately there fell from his eyes," etc.: a double blindness is removed.
