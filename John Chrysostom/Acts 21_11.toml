so then he had a girdle also. But when they could not persuade him— this was why they wept— then they held their peace. Do you mark the resignation? Do you mark the affection? They held their peace, it says, saying, The will of the Lord be done.

He who formerly had declared about the famine, the same says, This man, who owns this girdle, thus shall they bind. Acts 11:28 The same that the prophets used to do, representing events to the sight, when they spoke about the captivity— as did Ezekiel— the same did this (Agabus). And, what is the grievous part of the business, deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.

But why did [Agabus] use a belt with his cloak? This was the custom among people of ancient times, before men went on to dress in this soft and loose fashion. For instance, Peter appears to have been so “belted,” and Paul as well, for he says, “the man who owns this belt.” And Elijah5 too was dressed thus, and every one of the saints, since they were always in action, either traveling or working earnestly for some other necessity. But this was not the only reason: they did this also to trample on all display and observe every austerity. Indeed this is what Christ called the greatest praise of virtue, when he said, “What then did you go out to see? Someone dressed in soft robes? Look, those who wear soft robes are in royal palaces.”
