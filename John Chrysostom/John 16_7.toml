Observe how He consoles them again. I speak not, He says, to please you, and although you be grieved ten thousand fold, yet must ye hear what is for your good; it is indeed to your liking that I should be with you, but what is expedient for you is different. And it is the part of one caring for others, not to be over gentle with his friends in matters which concern their interests, or to lead them away from what is good for them.

For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come. 

What here say those who hold not the fitting opinion concerning the Spirit? Is it expedient that the master depart, and the servant come? Do you see how great is the honor of the Spirit?

But if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And what the gain?

But why didn’t the Spirit come before he departed? He could not come because the curse had not yet been taken away, sin had not yet been forgiven, and everything was still subject to the penalty for it. “It is necessary then,” Jesus says, “that the enmity be put away, that we be reconciled to God and then receive that gift.” But why does he say, “I will send him”? It means, “I will prepare you beforehand to receive him.” For how can that which is everywhere be “sent”? In addition, he shows the distinction of the persons. Moreover, he speaks in this way for two reasons: first, because they were finding it hard to be separated from him, to persuade them to hold fast to the Spirit. And second, in order that they might cherish the Spirit. For Christ himself could have accomplished these things, but he concedes to the Spirit the working of miracles so that they might understand his dignity. For as the Father could have brought into being things that are, but it was the Son who did so in order that we might understand his power, so also is it in this case. For this reason he himself was made flesh by delegating the performing of this work to the Spirit, thus silencing those who take the argument of his ineffable love for an occasion of impiety.
