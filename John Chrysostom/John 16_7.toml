But why didn’t the Spirit come before he departed? He could not come because the curse had not yet been taken away, sin had not yet been forgiven, and everything was still subject to the penalty for it. “It is necessary then,” Jesus says, “that the enmity be put away, that we be reconciled to God and then receive that gift.” But why does he say, “I will send him”? It means, “I will prepare you beforehand to receive him.” For how can that which is everywhere be “sent”? In addition, he shows the distinction of the persons. Moreover, he speaks in this way for two reasons: first, because they were finding it hard to be separated from him, to persuade them to hold fast to the Spirit. And second, in order that they might cherish the Spirit. For Christ himself could have accomplished these things, but he concedes to the Spirit the working of miracles so that they might understand his dignity. For as the Father could have brought into being things that are, but it was the Son who did so in order that we might understand his power, so also is it in this case. For this reason he himself was made flesh by delegating the performing of this work to the Spirit, thus silencing those who take the argument of his ineffable love for an occasion of impiety.
