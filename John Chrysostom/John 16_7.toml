Observe how He consoles them again. I speak not, He says, to please you, and although you be grieved ten thousand fold, yet must ye hear what is for your good; it is indeed to your liking that I should be with you, but what is expedient for you is different. And it is the part of one caring for others, not to be over gentle with his friends in matters which concern their interests, or to lead them away from what is good for them.

For if I go not away, the Comforter will not come. 

What here say those who hold not the fitting opinion concerning the Spirit? Is it expedient that the master depart, and the servant come? Do you see how great is the honor of the Spirit?

But if I depart, I will send Him unto you. And what the gain?
