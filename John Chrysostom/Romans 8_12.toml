Once again, Paul is not speaking here about the nature of the flesh.… For in many ways we are indebted to that. We have to give it food, warmth, rest, medicine, clothing and a thousand other things. In order to show us that this is not what he is talking about, Paul adds the words: “to live according to the flesh.” … It is not to take charge of our life. The flesh must follow, not lead, and it must receive the laws of the Spirit, not seek to control us.
