Paul does everything he can to embarrass the questioner. He does not answer him right away either, but prefers to shut him up with a further question.… This is what a good teacher does. He does not follow his pupils’ fancy everywhere but leads them to his own mind and pulls up the thorns, and then puts the seed in and does not immediately answer all the questions put to him.
