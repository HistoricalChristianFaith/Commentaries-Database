Observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, he causes this to take place: “Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray”; that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber. “And he became very hungry and would have eaten; but while they made ready, there fell upon him a trance.” What does this expression, “trance,” mean? There was presented to him in the ecstatic vision a kind of spiritual view; the soul, so to speak, was caused to be out of the body.
