What means this expression, ἔ κστασις, trance? Rather, there was presented to him a kind of spiritual view (θεωρία): the soul, so to say, was caused to be out of the body (ἐ ξέστη). And saw heaven opened, and, knit at the four corners, a certain vessel descending unto him, as it had been a great sheet, and let down to the earth: wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and fowls of the air. And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat. But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. And the voice spoke unto him again the second time, What God has cleansed, that call not thou common. This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.

Observe how the Spirit connects the times: no sooner than this, and no later, he causes this to take place: “Peter about the sixth hour went up upon the housetop to pray”; that is, privately and quietly, as in an upper chamber. “And he became very hungry and would have eaten; but while they made ready, there fell upon him a trance.” What does this expression, “trance,” mean? There was presented to him in the ecstatic vision a kind of spiritual view; the soul, so to speak, was caused to be out of the body.
