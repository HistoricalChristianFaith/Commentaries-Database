He more than sufficiently released him of his fear, if the case be so that this man shall be so zealous in our cause, as even to suffer many things. And justly he is called a vessel (or, instrument)— for reason shows that evil is not a physical quality: a vessel of election (or, chosen instrument), He says; for we choose that which is approved. And let not any imagine, that (Ananias) speaks in unbelief of what was told him, as imagining that Christ was deceived: far from it! But affrighted and trembling, he did not even attend to what was said, at hearing the name of Paul. Moreover, the Lord does not tell that He has blinded him: at the mention of his name fear had prepossessed his soul: see, he says, to whom You are betraying me: 'and hither for this very purpose is he come, to bind all that call upon Your Name.'

For I, says He, will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name's sake. At the same time also this is said by way of putting Ananias to the blush: If he, that was so frantic, shall suffer all things, and thou not willing even to baptize him! It is well, says he: let him continue blind (this is why he says these words): he is blind: why dost Thou at all bid me open his eyes, that he may bind (men) again? Fear not the future: for that opening of his eyes he will use not against you, but for you (with reference to that saying, That he may receive his sight
