"It is well," saith he: "let him continue blind" (this is why he says these words): "he is blind: why dost Thou at all bid me open his eyes, that he may bind men again?" Fear not the future: for that opening of his eyes he will use not against you, but for you (with reference to that saying, "That he may receive his sight," these words are spoken): for not only will he do you no harm, but he "will suffer many things."

How then does He say, "He shall bear My name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel?" Not, certainly persuade. Besides which, on other occasions we find the Jews were persuaded, but here they were not. Where most of all they ought to have been persuaded, as knowing his former zeal in their cause, here they were not persuaded.
