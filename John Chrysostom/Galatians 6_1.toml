"Brethren,  even if a man be overtaken in any trespass."

Forasmuch] as under cover of a rebuke they gratified their private feelings, and professing to do so for faults which had been committed, were advancing their own ambition, he says, "Brethren, if a man be overtaken." He said not if a man commit but if he be "overtaken" that is, if he be carried away.

"You which are spiritual  restore such a one,"

He says not "chastise" nor "judge," but "set right." Nor does he stop here, but in order to show that it behooved them to be very gentle towards those who had lost their footing, he subjoins,

"In a spirit of meekness."

He says not, "in meekness," but, "in a spirit of meekness," signifying thereby that this is acceptable to the Spirit, and that to be able to administer correction with mildness is a spiritual gift. Then, to prevent the one being unduly exalted by having to correct the other, puts him under the same fear, saying,

"Looking to yourself, lest you also be tempted."

For as rich men convey contributions to the indigent, that in case they should be themselves involved in poverty they may receive the same bounty, so ought we also to do. And therefore he states this cogent reason, in these words, "looking to yourself, lest you also be tempted." He apologizes for the offender, first, by saying "if you be overtaken;" next, by employing a term indicative of great infirmity ; lastly, by the words "lest you also be tempted," thus arraigning the malice of the devil rather than the remissness of the soul.

The Galatians were gratifying their private feelings under pretext of rebuke. They appeared to be doing this to correct the sins of others. Paul wanted to put a stop to their love of being first. He says, “Brothers, if someone is overtaken in any trespass.” Note that he does not say “if he trespasses” but “if he is overtaken,” that is, if he is caught off guard.

Paul does not say “punish” or “pass judgment” but “restore.” Nor did he even stop there, but showing that he strongly desired them to be patient with those who stumbled he adds “in a spirit of gentleness.” He does not say “in gentleness” but “in a spirit of gentleness,” showing that this also is the will of the Spirit and that the capacity to correct another’s faults is a spiritual gift.
