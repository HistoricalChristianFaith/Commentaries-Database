(Hom. xxxix. 2) Or, He did not say, He that heareth My words, and believeth on Me; as they would have thought this empty boasting and arrogance. To say, Believeth on Him that sent Me, was a better way of making His discourse acceptable. To this end He says two things: one, that he who hears Him, believes on the Father; the other, that he who hears and believes shall not come into condemnation.

Christ did not say, “He who hears my words and believes in me,” since they would have thought this was empty boasting and arrogance.… To say “believes in him who sent me” was a better way of making his discourse acceptable when they learned that those who hear him believe in the Father also.
