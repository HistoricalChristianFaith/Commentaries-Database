(Hom. xxxix. 2) Or, He did not say, He that heareth My words, and believeth on Me; as they would have thought this empty boasting and arrogance. To say, Believeth on Him that sent Me, was a better way of making His discourse acceptable. To this end He says two things: one, that he who hears Him, believes on the Father; the other, that he who hears and believes shall not come into condemnation.

Do you see how continually He puts the same thing to cure that feeling of suspicion, both in this place and in what follows by fear and by promises of blessings removing their jealousy of Him, and then again condescending greatly in words? For He said not, he that hears My words, and believes in Me, since they would have certainly deemed that to be pride, and a superfluous pomp of words; because, if after a very long time, and ten thousand miracles, they suspected this when He spoke after this manner, much more would they have done so then. It was on this account that at that later period  they said to Him, Abraham is dead, and the prophets are dead, how sayest Thou,  If a man keep My saying, he shall never taste of death? John 8:52 In order therefore that they may not here also become furious, see what He says, He that hears My word, and believes in Him that sent Me, has everlasting life. This had no small effect in making His discourse acceptable, when they learned that those who hear Him believe in the Father also; for after having received this with readiness, they would more easily receive the rest. So that the very speaking in a humble manner contributed and led the way to higher things; for after saying, has everlasting life, He adds,

And comes not into judgment, but is passed from death unto life.

By these two things He makes His discourse acceptable; first, because it is the Father who is believed on, and then, because the believer enjoys many blessings. And the comes not into judgment means, is not punished, for He speaks not of death here, but of death eternal, as also of the other life which is deathless.

Christ did not say, “He who hears my words and believes in me,” since they would have thought this was empty boasting and arrogance.… To say “believes in him who sent me” was a better way of making his discourse acceptable when they learned that those who hear him believe in the Father also.
