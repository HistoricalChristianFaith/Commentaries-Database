In order, therefore, to solve this difficulty [of Peter’s beckoning] himself, John says, “He lay on the bosom of Jesus.” Do you think that you have learned a little thing when you have heard that “he lay” and that their Master allowed such boldness to them? If you want to know the cause of this, the action was because of love. Therefore he says, “whom Jesus loved.” I suppose also that John did this for another reason, wanting to show that he was exempt from the charge and so he speaks openly and out of confidence. Again, why did he use these words, not at any other point of time but only when the chief of the apostles beckoned? That you might not deem that Peter beckoned to him as being greater, he says that the thing took place because of the great love [that Jesus had toward him]. But why does he still lie on his bosom? They had not as yet formed any high assessment concerning him. Besides, in this way he calmed their despondency. For it is probable that at this time their faces were clouded over. If they were troubled in their souls, much more would they be so in their countenances. Soothing them therefore by word and by the question, he makes a way beforehand and allows him to lean on his breast. Observe also his modesty, for he mentions not his own name but the one “whom he loved.”
