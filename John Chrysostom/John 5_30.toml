(Hom. xxxix. 4) That is, nothing that is a departure from, or that is unlike to, what the Father wishes, shall ye see done by Me, but as I hear, I judge. He is only showing that it was impossible He should ever wish any thing but what the Father wished. I judge, His meaning is, as if it were My Father that judged.

(Hom. xxxix. 4) He shows that the Father's will is not a different one from His own, but one and the same, as a ground of defence. Nor marvel if being hitherto thought no more than a mere man, He defends Himself in a somewhat human way, and shows his judgment to be just on the same ground which any other person would have taken; viz. that one who has his own ends in view, may incur suspicion of injustice, but that one who has not cannot.

Christ’s meaning is nothing other than this: I do not have a will different and apart from that of the Father. Rather, if [the Father] desires anything, then I do as well. If I desire it, then so does he. Since therefore no one could object to the Father judging, so neither may anyone object to me, for the sentence of each is given from the same mind.” And if [Jesus] utters these words rather as a man, do not be surprised that they still considered him to be a mere man.… “For as in the case of people, [he might say], one who is free from selfishness cannot be justly charged with having given an unfair decision, so neither will you now be able to accuse me. One who has his own ends in view may incur suspicion of injustice, but one who does not have his own interests at heart cannot be suspected of such injustice.”
