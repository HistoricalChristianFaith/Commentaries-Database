And observe how unassuming the expression is. That he may not seem to prophesy, but to speak as of conjecture, I perceive, says he. For they would not have received it, had he said this at the outset. In fact he does prophesy on this former occasion, as he does afterward, and says (there), The God whom I serve, leading them on. Then how comes it that it was not with loss (of any) of their lives? It would have been so, but that God brought them safe through it. For as far as depended on the nature of the thing, they had perished, but God prevented it. Then, to show that it was not from conjecture that he so spoke, the master of the ship said the contrary

See [Paul’s] modesty: in order that he may not appear to prophesy but to speak as if from supposition, he says “I see.” They would have not received his words if he had pronounced them at once. In the first place he prophesies and says, “God, whom I worship,” thus leading them. How would have it happened without a loss of lives? There surely would be such a loss if God did not save them.
