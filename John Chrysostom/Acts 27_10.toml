See [Paul’s] modesty: in order that he may not appear to prophesy but to speak as if from supposition, he says “I see.” They would have not received his words if he had pronounced them at once. In the first place he prophesies and says, “God, whom I worship,” thus leading them. How would have it happened without a loss of lives? There surely would be such a loss if God did not save them.
