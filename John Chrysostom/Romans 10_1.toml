"Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is, that they might be saved."

He is now going again to rebuke them more vehemently than before.  Wherefore he again does away with every suspicion of hatred, and makes a great effort beforehand to correct misapprehension. Do not then, he says, mind words or accusations, but observe that it is not in any hostile spirit that I say this. For it is not likely that the same person should desire their salvation, and not desire it only, but even pray for it, and yet should also hate them, and feel aversion to them. For here he calls his exceeding desire, and the prayer which he makes (εὐδοκίαν]), "heart's desire." For it is not the being freed from punishment only, but that they may also be saved, that he makes so great a point of, and prays for. Nor is it from this only, but also from the sequel that he shows the goodwill that he has towards them. For from what is open to him, as far as he can, he forces his way, and is contentious to find out some shadow at least of an excuse for them. And he has not the power, being overcome by the nature of the facts.

Paul continues to demonstrate his deepseated good will toward the Jews.… He even does his best to find excuses for them, but in the end he is overcome by the nature of the facts and cannot do so.
