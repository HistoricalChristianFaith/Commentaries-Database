What insults a person more: when he says something and receives no answer or when he is silent and receives no answer? Obviously a person is most insulted when he speaks and receives no answer. God is insulted when he speaks and you will not heed what he says. They said in ancient days to the prophets, “Do not speak to us.” But you do worse. You say, “Speak to us, but we will not obey.” They turned the prophets away in order to keep them from speaking, sensing that there was some sort of awe or obligation in the voice itself. But you, with excessive contempt, do not even do this. Believe me, if you stopped our mouths by putting your hand over them, it would not be as great of an insult as it is for you to hear but not obey.
