Prayer is a mighty weapon if offered with suitable mind. Learn its strength from the following examples! Continued entreaty has overcome shamelessness, injustice, savagery and effrontery, as when he says, “Listen to what the unjust judge says.” On another occasion, continued entreaty also overcame hesitation and accomplished what friendship did not. “Even though he will not give to him because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give to him.” Tireless persistence also made her worthy who was unworthy. “It is not fair,” he said, “to take the children’s food and throw it to the dogs.” “Yes, Lord,” she replied, “yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ table.” Let us then devote ourselves to prayer. It is a mighty weapon if offered with earnestness, without vainglory and with a sincere mind. Prayer routed enemies and benefited an entire nation, undeserving though it was. “I have heard their groaning,” he said, “and I have come down to rescue them.” Prayer is a saving medicine and has power to prevent sins and heal misdeeds. It was to prayer that the widow, left all alone, turned her mind.
