Prayer is a mighty weapon if offered with suitable mind. Learn its strength from the following examples! Continued entreaty has overcome shamelessness, injustice, savagery and effrontery, as when he says, "Listen to what the unjust judge says." On another occasion, continued entreaty also overcame hesitation and accomplished what friendship did not. "Even though he will not give to him because he is his friend, at least because of his persistence he will get up and give to him." Tireless persistence also made her worthy who was unworthy. "It is not fair," he said, "to take the children's food and throw it to the dogs." "Yes, Lord," she replied, "yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table." Let us then devote ourselves to prayer. It is a mighty weapon if offered with earnestness, without vainglory and with a sincere mind. Prayer routed enemies and benefited an entire nation, undeserving though it was. "I have heard their groaning," he said, "and I have come down to rescue them." Prayer is a saving medicine and has power to prevent sins and heal misdeeds. It was to prayer that the widow, left all alone, turned her mind.

"I have seen, I have seen the affliction of My people which is in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt." See, how He shows, that both by kindnesses, and by chastisements, and by miracles, God was drawing them to Him: but they were still the same. That God is everywhere present, they learned.

Hearing these things, let us in our afflictions flee to Him. "And their groaning," saith He, "I have heard:" not simply, "because of their calamities." But if any should ask, Why then did He suffer them to be evil entreated there? Why, in the first place, to every just man his sufferings are the causes of his rewards. And in the next place, as to why He afflicted them: it was to show His power, that He can do all, and not only so, but that He may also train them. Observe in fact; when they were in the desert, then they "waxed fat, they grew thick, they spread out in breadth, they kicked": and ever and always ease was an evil. Therefore also from the beginning He said to Adam: "In the sweat of thy face thou shalt eat thy bread." Also it was in order that having come out of much suffering into rest, they might give thanks to God. For affliction is a great good. For hear the Prophet saying, "It is good for me, that Thou hast humbled me."
