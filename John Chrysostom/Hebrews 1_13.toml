4. "But to which of the Angels said He at any time, Sit on My right hand until I make your enemies your footstool?" Behold, again he encourages them, inasmuch as their enemies were to be worsted, and their enemies are the same also with Christ's.

This again belongs to Sovereignty, to Equal Dignity, to Honor and not weakness, that the Father should be angry for the things done to the Son. This belongs to His great Love and honor towards the Son, as of a father towards a son. For He that is angry in His behalf how is He a stranger to Him? Which also he says in  the second Psalm, "He that dwells in heaven shall laugh them to scorn, and the Lord shall have them in derision. Then shall He speak unto them in His wrath, and vex them in His sore displeasure." [Psalm 2:4-5] And again He Himself says, "Those that would not that I should reign over them, bring hither before Me, and slay them." [Luke 19:27] For that they are His own words, hear also what He says in another place, "How often would I have gathered your children together, and you would not! Behold, your house is left desolate." [Luke 13:34-35] And again, "The kingdom shall be taken from you, and shall be given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof." [Matthew 21:43] And again, "He that falls upon that stone shall be broken, but on whomsoever It shall fall, It will grind him to powder." [Matthew 21:44] And besides, He who is to be their Judge in that world, much more did He Himself repay them in this. So that the words "Till I make your enemies your footstool" are expressive of honor only towards the Son.
