Do you also see that he does not say that all will be saved but only those who are worthy will be saved?… He does not speak of the “sands of the sea” without cause, but he does so to remind them of the ancient promise they had made themselves unworthy of. Why are you bothered, as though the promise has not been kept? The prophets demonstrate that not everyone will be saved.… It not only demonstrates that only a few will be saved, and not everyone, but also says how they will be saved. How are they to be saved, and by what manner will God consider them to be worthy?… Faith is such that it holds salvation in a few short words.
