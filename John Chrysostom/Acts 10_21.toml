"Then Peter went down to the men which were sent unto him from Cornelius; and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what is the cause wherefore ye are come?" He saw a soldier, saw a man: it was not that he was afraid, on the contrary, having first confessed that he was the person whom they sought, then he asks for the cause of their coming; that it may not be supposed that the reason of his asking the cause, was, that he wished to hide himself: he asks it in order that if it be immediately urgent, he may also go forth with them, but if not, may receive them as guests.
