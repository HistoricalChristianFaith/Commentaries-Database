Paul says the “secrets of men” and not the sins of men, in order to add to their fear.… For men sit in judgment on overt acts alone.If a secret deed of any one of us were brought into the open right now, in the midst of the church, what would we do except pray for death and have the earth swallow us up, rather than have so many witnesses of wickedness?
