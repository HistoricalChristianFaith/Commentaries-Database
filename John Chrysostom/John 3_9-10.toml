Observe how Jesus never accuses Nicodemus of wickedness but only of simplicity and a lack of wisdom. But someone will say: What connection does this birth have with Jewish doctrines? What doesn’t it have in common with them? The first man that was made, the woman that was made out of his rib, the barren that bare, the miracles that were worked by means of water, for instance, Elisha’s bringing up the iron from the river, the passage of the Red Sea, the pool that the angel troubled and Naaman the Syrian’s purification in the Jordan—these were all types and figures of the spiritual birth and purification that would take place in the future. Many passages in the prophets too have a hidden reference to this birth, as for instance … “your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” … and “Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven.” Isaac also was a type of this birth.… Referring to these passages, our Jesus says, “Are you a master in Israel, and you do not know these things?”
