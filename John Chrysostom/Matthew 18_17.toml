For since you appeared to be too weak alone, make yourself more powerful by this addition. For surely the two are sufficient to convict him that has sinned. Do you see how He seeks not the good of him that has been pained only, but of him also that has given the pain. For the person injured is this one who is taken captive by his passion, he it is that is diseased, and weak, and infirm. Wherefore He often sends the other to this one, now alone, and now with others; but if he continue in it, even with the church. For, Tell it, says He, to the Church. Matthew 18:17 For if He were seeking this one's advantage only, He would not have commanded to pardon, seventy times seven, one repenting. He would not so often have set so many over him to correct his passion; but if he had remained incorrigible after the first conference would have let him be; but now once, and twice, and thrice, He commands to attempt his cure, and now alone and now with two, now with more.

Wherefore, with respect to them that are without He says no such thing, but, If any one smite you, He says, on your right cheek, turn to him the other also, Matthew 5:39 but here not in such wise. For what Paul means, saying, What have I to do to judge them also that are without? 1 Corinthians 5:12 but the brethren he commands both to tell of their faults, and to avoid them, and to cut them off, not being obedient, that they may be ashamed; this Himself also does here, making these laws about the brethren; and He sets three over him for teachers and judges, to teach him the things that are done at the time of his drunkenness. For though it be himself that has said and done all those unreasonable things, yet he will need others to teach him this, like as the drunken man. For anger and sin is a more frantic thing than any drunkenness, and puts the soul in greater distraction.

Who, for instance, was wiser than David? Yet for all that, when he had sinned he perceived it not, his lust keeping in subjection all his reasoning powers, and like some smoke filling his soul. Therefore he stood in need of a lantern from the prophet, and of words calling to his mind what he had done. Wherefore here also He brings these to him that has sinned, to reason with him about the things he had done.

But for what reason does He command this one to tell him of his fault, and not another? Because this man he would endure more quietly, this, who has been wronged, who has been pained, who has been despitefully used. For one does not bear in the same way being told by another of one's fault concerning him that has been insulted, as by the insulted person himself, especially when this person is alone convicting him. For when he who should demand justice against him, even this one appears to be caring for his salvation, this will have more power than anything in the world to shame him.

Do you see how this is done not for the sake of just punishment, but of amendment? Therefore He does not at once command to take with him the two, but when himself has failed; and not even then does He send forth a multitude against him; but makes the addition no further than two, or even one; but when he has contemned these too, then and not till then He brings him out to the church.

So much earnestness does He show, that our neighbor's sins be not exposed by us. And indeed He might have commanded this from the first, but that this might not be, He did not command it, but after a first and second admonition He appoints this.

But what is, In the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established? You have a sufficient testimony. His meaning is, that you have done all your part, that you have left undone none of the things which it pertained to you to do.

But if he shall neglect to hear them also, tell it to the church, that is, to the rulers of it; but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be to you as an heathen man and a publican. For after this such a one is incurably diseased.

But mark thou, I pray you, how everywhere He puts the publican for an example of the greatest wickedness. For above too He says, Do not even the publicans the same? Matthew 5:46 And further on again, Even the publicans and the harlots shall go before you into the Kingdom of Heaven, Matthew 21:31 that is, they who are utterly reprobated and condemned. Let them hearken, who are rushing upon unjust gains, who are counting up usuries upon usuries.
