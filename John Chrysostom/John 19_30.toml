Do you see how He does all things calmly, and with power? And what follows shows this. For when all had been completed,

He bowed His head, (this had not been nailed,) and gave up  the ghost.

That is, died. Yet to expire does not come  after the bowing the head; but here, on the contrary, it does. For He did not, when He had expired, bow His head, as happens with us, but when He had bent His head, then He expired. By all which things the Evangelist has shown, that He was Lord of all.

But the Jews, on the other hand, who swallowed the camel and strained at the gnat, having wrought so atrocious a deed, are very precise concerning the day.
