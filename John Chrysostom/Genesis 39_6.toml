That wicked beast the devil, however, seeing the good man’s standing and the fact that he emerged even more conspicuous from those very things thought to be adversities, gnashed his teeth and fell into a rage. He could not bear to see the good man becoming so much more commendable as each day passed. He dug a deep pit for him and prepared what he thought was a mighty precipice that would bring him to his ruin and a terrible storm capable of causing him shipwreck. But the devil discovered before long that he was wasting his time and only heaping coals on his own head. “Joseph cut a fine figure and was good-looking,” the text says. Why does it describe to us his physical charm? For us to learn that he was striking not only for charm of soul but also for his person. After all, Joseph was in the bloom of youth, “cut a fine figure and was good-looking.” Sacred Scripture tells us this about him in advance so as to teach us that the Egyptian woman was under the spell of the young man’s beauty in inviting him to that illicit association.
