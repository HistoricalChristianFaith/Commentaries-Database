"Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus through the will of God, to the saints which are at Ephesus,  and the faithful in Christ Jesus. Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ."

Observe, he applies the word "through" to the Father. But what then? Shall we say that He is inferior? Surely not.

"To the saints," says he, "which are at Ephesus, and the faithful in Christ Jesus."

Observe that he calls saints, men with wives, and children, and domestics. For that these are they whom he calls by this name is plain from the end of the Epistle, as, when he says, "Wives, be in subjection unto your own husbands." [Ephesians 5:22] And again, "Children, obey your parents:" [Ephesians 6:1] and, "Servants, be obedient to your masters." [Ephesians 6:5] Think how great is the indolence that possesses us now, how rare is anything like virtue now and how great the abundance of virtuous men must have been then, when even secular men could be called "saints and faithful." "Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ." "Grace" is his word; and he calls God, "Father," since this name is a sure token of that gift of grace. And how so? Hear what he says elsewhere; "Because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father." [Galatians 4:6]

"And from the Lord Jesus Christ."

Because for us men Christ was born, and appeared in the flesh.
