Only Luke is with me. For he adhered to him inseparably. It was he who wrote the Gospel, and the General Acts; he was devoted to labors, and to learning, and a man of fortitude; of him Paul writes, whose praise is in the Gospel throughout all the Churches. 2 Corinthians 8:18

Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is profitable to me for the ministry.

It is not for his own relief, but for the ministry of the Gospel that he wanted him. For though imprisoned, he did not cease to preach. So it was on the same account he sent for Timothy, not for his own, but for the Gospel's sake, that his death might occasion no disturbance to the faithful, when many of his own disciples were present to prevent tumults, and to console those who would scarce have endurance to bear up at his death. For it is probable that the believers at Rome were men of consequence.

For the same reason he sent for Timothy, not for his own comfort but for the work of the gospel, so that his death would not disturb the faithful.
