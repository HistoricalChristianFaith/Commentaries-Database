See how great the heavenly wisdom of the women is, although their understanding is weak. For when they saw Christ, they did not break out into mourning and wailing and loud crying, as we do when we see any of those we know coming in on our grief. Rather, immediately they reverence their Teacher. So then both these sisters believed in Christ, but not in a right way. For they did not yet certainly know either that he was God or that he did these things by his own power and authority, although on both points he had taught them. For they showed their ignorance of the former by saying, “If you had been here, our brother would not have died” and of the latter by saying, “Whatever you will ask of God, he will give it to you.”
