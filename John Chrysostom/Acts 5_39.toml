Once more he checks them by the impossibility and the inexpediency of the thing, saying, "Lest haply ye be found even to fight against God." And he does not say, If Christ be God; but the work itself declares this. He does not pronounce upon it, either that it is "of men," or that it is "of God;" but he leaves the proof to the future. But what a great thing it was that he ventured to affirm: that it was of God, when in the sequel it received its proof from the events! Great boldness of speech, great freedom from all respect of persons!
