"Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul." Do you mark them, that no sooner do they believe than they bring forth fruit, not only for their own but for those afar off? And Barnabas is sent and Saul, to minister the same. Of this occasion he says to the Galatians, "And James, Cephas, and John gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, only that we should remember the poor."

Again they justified themselves to the Jews, that the Gentiles were receiving the word, even without enjoying so great attention. There is about to be a questioning: therefore the affair of Cornelius forestalled it. Then indeed they say, "That we to the Gentiles, and they to the Circumcision." Observe, henceforth the very stress of the famine introduces the fellowship on the part of the Gentiles, namely, from the alms. For they receive the offerings sent from them.
