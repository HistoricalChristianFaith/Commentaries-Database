This is the reason, he says, for the grandiosity of his creations, the reason for the cold and the heat, the reason for the irregularity of the winds. Was it impossible to produce a harmonious blend? [If God did not do that], it is because he wants to prevent by any means the pride and arrogance of thought. It is “so that everyone may know his own weakness.” “Who can resist,” Scripture says, “before his cold?” The entire universe has been created for this purpose, and everything exists for it. Since [pride] first of all drove away from us our trust in God, for this reason God has organized everything in view of its contrary, either the creation, or the fashioning of our body or the course of our life, so that all this exists for humility in order that we may learn to act with moderation and recognize our own weakness.
