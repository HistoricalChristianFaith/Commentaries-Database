Even if somebody believes rightly in the Father and the Son, as well as in the Holy Spirit, if he does not lead the right kind of life, his faith will not benefit him at all as far as his salvation is concerned. For although Jesus says: “This is eternal life, to know you, the only true God,” we must not think that merely uttering the words is enough to save us. For our life and behavior must be pure as well.
