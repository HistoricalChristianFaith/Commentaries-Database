Observe what they say: "And by what name have ye done this? Then Peter, filled with the Holy Ghost, said unto them." And now, I pray you, call to mind Christ's saying; "When they deliver you up unto the synagogues, take ye no thought how or what thing ye shall speak; for it is the Spirit of your Father which speaketh in you." So that it was a mighty Power they enjoyed. What then says Peter? "Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel." Mark the Christian wisdom of the man; how full of confidence it is: he utters not a word of insult, but says with respect, "Ye rulers of the people, and elders of Israel, if we be this day called to account of the good deed done to the impotent man." He takes them in hand right valiantly; by the opening of his speech he exposes them, and reminds them of the former things: that it is for a work of beneficence they are calling them to account. As if he had said, "In all fairness we ought to have been crowned for this deed, and proclaimed benefactors; but since we are even put upon our trial for a good deed done to an impotent man," not a rich man, not powerful, not noble-and yet who would feel envy in a case like this? It is a most forcible way of putting the case; and he shows that they are piercing their own selves.

"Ye rulers of the people," etc. Observe his wisdom: he does not say outright, "In the Name of Jesus we did it," but how? "In His Name this man"-He does not say, "was made whole by us;" but-"doth stand here before you whole." And again, "If we be examined concerning the good deed done to the impotent man." He hits them hard, that they are always making a crime of such acts, finding fault with works of beneficence done to men: and he reminds them of their former doings, that they run to do murder, and not only so, but make a crime of doing good deeds.
