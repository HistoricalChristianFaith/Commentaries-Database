Here to prevent their saying, that you are deceiving us here with specious reasoning, he calls Hosea to witness, who cries and says, "I will call them My people, who were not My people." [Hosea 2:23] Who then are the not-people? Plainly, the Gentiles. And who the not-beloved? The same again. However, he says, that they shall become at once people, and beloved, and sons of God.
