"Only, whereunto we have attained." What means this? Let us hold fast, he says, that in which we have succeeded; love, concord, and peace: for in this we have succeeded.  "Whereto we have attained: to walk by the same rule, to mind the same thing." "Whereunto we have attained," i.e. in this we have already succeeded. Do you see, that he wills that his precepts should be a rule to us? And a rule admits neither addition, nor subtraction, since that destroys its being a rule. "By the same rule," i.e. by the same faith, within the same limits.
