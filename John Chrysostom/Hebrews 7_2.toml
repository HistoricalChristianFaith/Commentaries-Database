And first from the name. "First" (he says) "being by interpretation King of righteousness": for Sedec means "righteousness"; and Melchi, "King": Melchisedec, "King of righteousness." Seest thou his exactness even in the names? But who is "King of righteousness," save our Lord Jesus Christ? "King of righteousness. And after that also King of Salem," from his city, "that is, King of Peace," which again is characteristic of Christ. For He has made us righteous, and has "made peace" for "things in Heaven and things on earth." What man is "King of Righteousness and of Peace"? None, save only our Lord Jesus Christ.
