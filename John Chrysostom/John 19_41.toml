It is providentially ordered that he should be placed in a new tomb where no one had been placed before, so that his resurrection might not be deemed to be that of someone else who was lying there with him. And, because the place was near, the disciples would easily be able to come and be spectators of what happened. And not they alone, but also his enemies, should be witnesses of his burial. For when they placed seals on the tomb and stationed soldiers to watch it, these were the actions of people testifying to the burial. For Christ earnestly desired that this burial should be confessed no less than the resurrection. This is also why the disciples are very earnest about showing that he died. For all succeeding ages would confirm the resurrection. But Jesusâ€™ death, if at that time it had been partially concealed or not made entirely evident, would be likely to harm the account of the resurrection. Nor was it for these reasons only that he was laid nearby, but also that the story about the stealing might be proved false.
