But Mark says, “As they were able to hear it, he spoke the word to them in parables.” Then pointing out that he is not making a new thing, he also brings in the prophet, proclaiming beforehand this his manner of teaching. And to teach us the purpose of Christ, how he discoursed in this way so that they might not be ignorant but that he might lead them to inquiry, Mark added, “And without a parable he told them nothing.” Yet surely he did say many things without a parable, but then later nothing. And for all this no one asked him questions, whereas we know they were often questioning the prophets. They questioned Ezekiel, for instance, and many others; but of these they did no such thing. Yet surely his sayings were enough to cast them into perplexity and to stir them up to the inquiry; for indeed a very solemn punishment was threatened by those parables. Even so they were not moved.
