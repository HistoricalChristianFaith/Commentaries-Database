Bildad says, “be unjust in his judgments, or will he who has created everything overturn what is just?” Observe what he means: justice accompanies the Creator. However, even though Bildad’s words are not entirely applicable to Job, let us see what he means. Do you not perceive the profound justice that reigns in the creation and its profound order? And how everything is well regulated and settled? Therefore, could he who maintains justice and order among the senseless creatures overturn the rules in your case? Further, why did God create everything? Is it not because of you, the human being? And so he who has created so many things, did he not give you what was right to share? He who has created you out of love and has created so many things for you, if he has shown his benevolence toward the universe, this is also a proof of his power. We often overturn justice because of our powerlessness, but “he has created everything,” he says. Will he, who is so wise, so just, so powerful, be unjust?
