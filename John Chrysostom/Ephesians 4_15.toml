He expresses himself with great obscurity, from his desire to utter everything at once. What he means, however, is this. In the same way as the spirit, or vital principle, which descends from the brain, communicates the sensitive faculty which is conveyed through the nerves, not simply to all the members, but according to the proportion of each member, to that which is capable of receiving more, more, to that which is capable of less, less, (for the spirit is the root or source;) so also is Christ. For the souls of men being dependent upon Him as members, His provident care, and supply of the spiritual gifts according to a due proportion in the measure of every single member, effects their increase. But what is the meaning of this, by the touch of the supply? that is to say, by the sensitive faculty. For that spirit which is supplied to the members from the head, touches, each single member, and thus actuates it. As though one should say, the body receiving the supply according to the proportion of its several members, thus makes the increase; or, in other words, the members receiving the supply according to the proportion of their proper measure, thus make increase; or otherwise again thus, the spirit flowing plenteously from above, and touching all the members, and supplying them as each is capable of receiving it, thus makes increase. But wherefore does he add, in love? Because in no other way is it possible for that Spirit to descend. For as, in case a hand should happen to be torn from the body, the spirit which proceeds from the brain seeks the limb, and if it finds it not, does not leap forth from the body, and fly about and go to the hand, but if it finds it not in its place, does not touch it; so also will it be here, if we be not bound together in love. All these expressions he uses as tending to humility. For what, he seems to say, if this or that man receives more than another? He has received the same Spirit, sent forth from the same Head, effectually working in all alike, communicating itself to all alike.
