Notice how Pharaoh was ashamed to say openly, “None of my sages can interpret the dream.” Instead, what? “I had a dream, and there is no one to interpret it; but I have heard them say of you that once you hear of a dream you interpret it.” Consider in this case too, I ask you, Joseph’s good sense and discretion in the way he replies to Pharaoh: “Don’t suspect,” he says, “that I utter anything of myself or interpret them by human wisdom. There is, in fact, no way of coming to knowledge of them without revelation from on high. So be aware that without God it is not possible for me to give you a reply.” Without God, the text says, Pharaoh will not be given the right solution. So, now that you know that the Lord of all is the one who gives this revelation, don’t look for something from human beings (he is saying) that God alone has it in his power to bring to light.See how through his reply Joseph brings Pharaoh to the realization of the limitations of the sages attending him and the power of the Lord. “Since, then, you have learned from me that these utterances of mine spring not from human wisdom or from my own reasoning, tell me what God has communicated to you.”
