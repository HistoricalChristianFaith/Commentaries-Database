Being about to place Him before Moses in comparison, he led his discourse to the law of the high-priesthood; for they all had a high esteem for Moses: moreover, he is already beforehand casting down the seeds of the superiority. Therefore he begins from the flesh, and goes up to the Godhead, where there was no longer any comparison. He began from the flesh [from His Human nature], by assuming for a time the equality, and says, as also Moses in all His house: nor does he at first show His superiority lest the hearer should start away, and straightway stop his ears. For although they were believers, yet nevertheless they still had strong feeling of conscience as to Moses. Who was faithful, he says, to Him that made Himâ€” made [Him] what? Apostle and High Priest. He is not speaking at all in this place of His Essence, nor of His Godhead; but so far concerning human dignities.
