That is, He whom you baptized; for this they imply when they say, to whom you bore witness, as though they had said, He whom you pointed out as illustrious, and  make remarkable, dares to do the same as thou. Yet they do not say, He whom you baptized baptizes; (for then they would have been obliged to make mention of the Voice that came down from heaven, and of the descent of the Spirit;) but what say they? He that was with you beyond Jordan, to whom you bore witness; that is, He who held the rank of a disciple, who was nothing more than we, this man has separated himself, and baptizes. For they thought to make him jealous,  not only by this, but by asserting that their own reputation was now diminishing. All, say they, come to Him. Whence it is evident, that they did not get the better of the Jew with whom they disputed; but they spoke these words because they were imperfect in disposition, and were not yet clear from a feeling of rivalry. What then does John? He did not rebuke them severely, fearing lest they should separate themselves again from him, and work some other mischief. What are his words?

“He whom you baptized, baptizes,” John’s disciples in effect say, although not in so many words. They add, “To whom you bore witness,” as if to say that the one you showed to the world, the one you made famous now dares to do as you do. They did not say “whom you baptized,” because they did not want to be reminded of the voice from heaven and of the descent of the Spirit. And so, instead they said, “He who was with you …”—that is, the one who held the rank of a disciple and who was nothing more than any of us—he now separates himself from you and baptizes. They thought they would make John jealous, not only by this but by asserting that their own reputation was now diminishing. “All,” they say, “come to him.”
