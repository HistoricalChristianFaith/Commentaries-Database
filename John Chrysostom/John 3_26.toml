“He whom you baptized, baptizes,” John’s disciples in effect say, although not in so many words. They add, “To whom you bore witness,” as if to say that the one you showed to the world, the one you made famous now dares to do as you do. They did not say “whom you baptized,” because they did not want to be reminded of the voice from heaven and of the descent of the Spirit. And so, instead they said, “He who was with you …”—that is, the one who held the rank of a disciple and who was nothing more than any of us—he now separates himself from you and baptizes. They thought they would make John jealous, not only by this but by asserting that their own reputation was now diminishing. “All,” they say, “come to him.”
