Peter then spoke confidently and lifted himself up over the rest, saying, “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.” It may be that in some degree his bravado sprang from jealousy. For at supper they were all talking about which one of them was the greater. This passion for recognition was still troubling them. Therefore Jesus resisted Peter, not compelling him to a future denial—God forbid! But he left him destitute of his help, convicting human nature. The Gospel of Matthew, Homily

What do you say, O Peter? The prophet said, The sheep shall be scattered; Christ has confirmed the saying, and do you say, No? Is not what passed before enough, when Thou said, Far be it from You, Matthew 16:22 and your mouth was stopped? For this then He suffers him to fall, teaching him thereby to believe Christ in all things, and to account His declaration more trustworthy than one's own conscience. And the rest too reaped no small benefit from his denial, having come to know man's weakness, and God?' s truth. For when He foretells anything, we must no longer be subtle, nor lift up ourselves above the common sort. For, your rejoicing, it is said, you shall have in yourself, and not in another. For where he should have prayed, and have said, Help us, that we be not cut off, he is confident in himself, and says, Though all men should be offended in You, yet will I never; though all should undergo this, I shall not undergo it, which led him on little by little to self-confidence. Christ then, out of a desire to put down this, permitted his denial. For since he neither submitted to Him nor the prophet (and yet for this intent He brought in the prophet besides, that they may not gainsay), but nevertheless since he submitted not to His words, he is instructed by deeds.
