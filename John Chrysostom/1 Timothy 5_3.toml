Ver. 3. "Honor widows, that are widows indeed."

Why does he say nothing of virginity, nor command us to honor virgins? Perhaps there were not yet any professing that state, or they might have fallen from it. "For some," he says, "are already turned aside after Satan." [1 Timothy 5:15] For a woman may have lost her husband, and yet not be truly a widow. As in order to be a virgin, it is not enough to be a stranger to marriage, but many other things are necessary, as blamelessness and perseverance; so the loss of a husband does not constitute a widow, but patience, with chastity and separation from all men. Such widows he justly bids us honor, or rather support. For they need support, being left desolate, and having no husband to stand up for them. Their state appears to the multitude despicable and inauspicious. Therefore he wishes them to receive the greater honor from the Priest, and the more so, because they are worthy of it.

In order to be a virgin, it is not enough merely to avoid sex. Many other things are necessary: blamelessness and perseverance. Similarly the loss of a husband does not constitute a true widow, but rather patience, with chastity and distance from all men. Such widows he justly bids us honor, and indeed support. For they need support, being left desolate and having no husband to stand up for them.
