In order to be a virgin, it is not enough merely to avoid sex. Many other things are necessary: blamelessness and perseverance. Similarly the loss of a husband does not constitute a true widow, but rather patience, with chastity and distance from all men. Such widows he justly bids us honor, and indeed support. For they need support, being left desolate and having no husband to stand up for them.
