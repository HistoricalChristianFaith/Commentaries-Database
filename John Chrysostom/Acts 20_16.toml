“For he was hastening,” it says, “to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.” So it was for this reason that [Paul] could not stay. Look at him moved like other people, desiring, hastening and often not obtaining his object. These things take place to prevent us from thinking that he was above human nature. For those great and holy men partake of the same nature as we do, but not of the same will. This is why they attract great grace to themselves. See how many things they dispense on their own. For this reason he said, “So that we put no obstacle in the way of the willing,” and again, “so that no fault may be found with our ministry.” Look, both an irreproachable life and much condescension. This is called planning, to arrive at the summit of both sublime virtue and humble condescension. And hear how he, who went beyond the commandments of Christ, was in turn the humblest of all, “I am made all things to all people,” he says, “that I might gain all.”
