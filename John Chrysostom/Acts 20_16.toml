"For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, because he would not spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him, to be in Jerusalem the day of Pentecost." Why this haste? Not for the sake of the feast, but of the multitude. At the same time, by this he conciliated the Jews, as being one that did honor the feasts, wishing to gain even his adversaries: at the same time also he delivers the word. Accordingly, see what great gain accrued, from all being present.

Wherefore does the writer say where they came, and where they went to? To show in the first place that he was making the voyage more leisurely-and this upon human grounds-and sailing past some: also for the same reason he tells where he made a stay, and what parts he sailed past; namely, "that he might not have to spend the time in Asia." Since had he come there, he could not have sailed by; he did not like to pain those who would have begged him to remain. "For he hasted," it says, "if it were possible for him to keep the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem:" and this was not possible if he stayed.

Observe, how he is also moved like other men. For therefore it is that all this is done, that we may not fancy that he was above human nature: therefore you see him desiring something, and hasting, and in many instances not obtaining his object: for those great and holy men were partakers of the same nature with us; it was in the will and purpose that they differed, and so it was that also they attracted upon themselves the great grace they did.

But that the interests of the people of Ephesus might not be neglected on that account, he managed for this in a different way.
