Look, even after they were rid of the storm, they did not become negligent, and what a lavish welcome they received because of Paul. For three days they stayed there and everyone of them was well-provided with sustenance.… It was for Paul’s sake that all this took place, so that the prisoners, as well as the soldiers and the centurion, should believe. For even if they were made of stone, from the counsel they heard him give, from the predictions they heard him make, from the miracles they saw him accomplish and from the nourishment they enjoyed because of him, they would have thought him great. See how quickly sound judgment, when it is not overtaken by some emotion, delivers right decisions and discerning verdicts.

Behold, again another hospitable man, the rich and wealthy Publius, who had seen nothing but had mercy on them because of their calamity. He received and took care of them.… It is certainly an act of great benevolence to give hospitality to 270 people. Meditate on what a great profit is hospitality: not because there was necessity or because he acted against his will, but because [Publius] considered it a profit, did he give hospitality to them for three days.
