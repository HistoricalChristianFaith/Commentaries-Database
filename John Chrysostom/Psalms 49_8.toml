Just as a parent would not choose a house in preference to his child, just so God would not choose the world in preference to the soul.… Do you want to learn how great the price for our souls? The Only-begotten, intending to redeem us, gave not the world, not a human being, not land, not sea, but his precious blood. Thus Paul too said, “A price has been paid for you; do not become people’s slaves.” Do you see the greatness of the price?… Do you see how elevated the soul’s dignity? Consequently, never despise the soul nor make it captive.
