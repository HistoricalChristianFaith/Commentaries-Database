"For I say not this, that others may be eased, and you distressed."

And yet Christ praised the contrary conduct in the widow's case, that she emptied out all of her living and gave out of her want. [Mark 12:43] But because he was discoursing to Corinthians among whom he chose to suffer hunger; "for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void;" [1 Corinthians 9:15] he therefore uses a tempered exhortation, praising indeed those who had done beyond their power, but not compelling these to do so; not because he did not desire it, but because they were somewhat weak. For wherefore does he praise those, because "in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality:" and because they gave "beyond their power?" is it not very evident that it is as inducing these also to this conduct? So that even if he appears to permit a lower standard; he does so, that by it he may raise them to this. Consider, for instance, how even in what follows he is covertly preparing the way for this.
