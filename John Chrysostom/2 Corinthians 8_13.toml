And yet Christ praised the contrary conduct in the widow's case, that she emptied out all of her living and gave out of her want. But because he was discoursing to Corinthians amongst whom he chose to suffer hunger; "for it were good for me rather to die, than that any man should make my glorying void;" he therefore uses a tempered exhortation, praising indeed those who had done beyond their power, but not compelling these to do so; not because he did not desire it, but because they were somewhat weak. For wherefore doth he praise those, because "in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality:" and because they gave "beyond their power?" is it not very evident that it is as inducing these also to this conduct? So that even if he appears to permit a lower standard; he doth so, that by it he may raise them to this.
