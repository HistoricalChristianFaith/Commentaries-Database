Look! On all occasions they are free of the lust of glory, not only not coveting but even repudiating it when offered, as Peter too said, “Why do you gaze upon us, as though by our own power or holiness we had made him to walk?” These men say the same. And Joseph also said of his dreams, “Is not their interpretation of God?” And Daniel likewise, “And to me also, not through the wisdom that is in me was it revealed.” And Paul always says this, as when he says, “And for these things who is sufficient?” And again, “Not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think [aught] as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God.”

Notice the vehemence with which all this is done by the apostles: “They tore their garments and rushed out among the multitude, crying.” All because their very beings were turning away in horror from what had happened. For truly it was grief, a grief inconsolable—they were about to be called gods and so introduce idolatry, the very thing they came to destroy! This was the devil’s contrivance, but they did not keep quiet. For what do they say? “We are men, of like nature with you.” Immediately, from the very outset, they overthrew the evil. They did not simply say “men” but “with you.” And then, so that they should not seem to honor the gods, “we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.” Notice how they do not mention the prophets at all.… This is because they had learned that one should strive not so much to say something worthy concerning God as something that is of use to one’s listeners.
