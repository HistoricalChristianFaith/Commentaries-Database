If he [the Lord] says, “Those who honor me I will honor, and those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed,” then we should reflect on what he requires of us also. True, it is to the praise of his glory that he saves those who are his enemies, yet those who have become his friends should continue to act as his friends. For if they were to return to their former state of enmity all [that had been borne of their friendship] would be rendered futile and purposeless. There is not another baptism or a second reconciliation but “a certain fearful expectation of judgment which shall devour the adversaries.” If we intend—at the same time—to be at enmity with him and yet claim his forgiveness, we shall never be rid of enmity, wantonness and depravity, and [we will] be blind to the sun of righteousness which has risen.… But once you have tasted the goodness and the honey, if you abandon them and return to your own vomit, what else are you doing but bringing forward evidence of excessive hatred and contempt?

In honoring him, therefore, we do honor to ourselves. He who opens his eyes to gaze on the light of the sun receives delight himself, as he admires the beauty of the star but does no favor to that luminary nor increases its splendor, for it continues [to be] what it was; much more is this true with respect to God. He who admires and honors God does so to his own salvation, and highest benefit; and how? Because he follows after virtue and is honored by him. For “them that honor me,” he says, “I will honor.”
