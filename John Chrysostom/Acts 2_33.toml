The promise, he says; because [promised] before His Passion. Observe how he now makes it all His [He has poured forth this], covertly making a great point. For if it was he poured this out, it is of Him that the Prophet has spoken above, Or [it may be], the promise which He promised to us. He so foreknew it about to be, and has given it to us greater after the resurrection. And, has poured it out, he says; not requiring worthiness: and not simply gave, but with abundance.

“And having received the promise of the Holy Spirit.” This again is important. He speaks of “the promise,” because it was made before his passion. Observe how he now makes it all his, quietly making an important point. For if it was he who poured it out, it is of him that the prophet spoke above, “In the last days I will pour out my Spirit upon my servants, both men and women, and I will show portents in the heaven above.” Observe what Peter secretly inserted!… It also shows that the cross not only did not make him less but rendered him even more illustrious, seeing that formerly God promised it to him but now has given it. Alternatively, “the promise” refers to what he promised to us. He knew beforehand that it will come to pass and gave it to us greater after the resurrection. “He poured it out,” that is, not requiring worthiness, and not simply that, but indeed with abundance.
