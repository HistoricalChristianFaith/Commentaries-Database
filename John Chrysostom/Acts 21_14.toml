"And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done." Ye do me wrong in doing this: for do I grieve? Then they ceased, when he said, "to break my heart." I weep, he says, for you, not on account of my own sufferings: as for those men, I am willing even to die for them. But when they could not persuade him - this was why they wept - then they "held their peace." Do you mark the resignation? do you mark the affection? "They held their peace," it says, "saying, The will of the Lord be done." The Lord, say they, Himself will do that which is pleasing in his sight. For they perceived that it was the will of God. Else Paul would not be so bent upon going - he that on all other occasions delivers himself out of dangers.
