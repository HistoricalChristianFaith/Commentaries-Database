His disciples were clinging to him inseparably. So he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.” For it was usual with him to pray apart from them. He did this to teach us how to pray, how to use silence and solitude to pray for great matters. And taking with him the three, he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.” Why does he not take all of them with him? That they might not be more sorrowful. He took only those who had been spectators of his glory.
