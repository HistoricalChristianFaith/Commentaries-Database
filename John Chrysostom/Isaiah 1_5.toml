It shows utter contempt when, even with retributions, [the Israelites] do not become better. But even this is a kind of benefitâ€”to be chastised. For they would have to admit that God not only condemned and rewarded but was also forgiving sinners. And certainly he was coaxing them with rewards and also chastising them with fear of punishments. - "Commentary on Isaiah 1.3"
