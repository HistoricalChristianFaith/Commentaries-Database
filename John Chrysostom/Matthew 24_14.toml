After this again, what is more grievous than all, they shall not have so much as the consolation from love. Then indicating, that these things will in no degree harm the noble and the firm, He says, Fear not, neither be troubled. For if you show forth the patience that becomes you, the dangers will not prevail over you. And it is a plain proof of this, that the word shall surely be preached everywhere in the world, so much shall you be above the things that alarm you. For, that they may not say, how then shall we live? He said more, You shall both live and preach everywhere. Therefore He added moreover, And this gospel shall be preached in the whole world for a witness to all nations, and then shall the end come, of the downfall of Jerusalem.

For in proof that He meant this, and that before the taking of Jerusalem the gospel was preached, hear what Paul says, Their sound went into all the earth; Romans 10:18 and again, The gospel which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven. Colossians 1:23 And do you see him running from Jerusalem unto Spain? And if one took so large a portion, consider what the rest also wrought. For writing to others also, Paul again says concerning the gospel, that it is bringing forth fruit, and growing up in every creature which is under Heaven.

But what means, For a witness to all nations? Forasmuch as though it was everywhere preached, yet it was not everywhere believed. It was for a witness, He says, to them that were disbelieving, that is, for conviction, for accusation, for a testimony; for they that believed will bear witness against them that believed not, and will condemn them. And for this cause, after the gospel is preached in every part of the world, Jerusalem is destroyed, that they may not have so much as a shadow of an excuse for their perverseness. For they that saw His power shine throughout every place, and in an instant take the world captive, what excuse could they then have for continuing in the same perverseness? For in proof that it was everywhere preached at that time, hear what Paul says, of the gospel which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven. Colossians 1:23

Which also is a very great sign of Christ's power, that in twenty or at most thirty years the word had reached the ends of the world. After this therefore, says He, shall come the end of Jerusalem. For that He intimates this was manifested by what follows.

Or otherwise; The disciples when they heard these things which were spoken of Jerusalem might suppose that they should be beyond reach of harm, as though what they now heard was the sufferings of others, while they themselves should meet with nothing but prosperous times, He therefore announces the grievous things which should befal them, putting them in fear for themselves. First He had bid them be on their guard against the arts of false teachers, He now foretels to them the violence of tyrants. In good season He thus introduces their own woes, as here they will receive consolation from the common calamities; and He held out to them not this comfort only, but also that of the cause for which they should suffer, hewing that it was for His name’s sake, “And ye shall be hated of all men formy name’s sake.”.
Having named two sources of opposition, that from seducers, and that from enemies, He adds a third, that from false brethren; “And then shall many be offended, and shall betray one another, and shall hate one another.” See Paul bewailing these same things, “Without were fightings, within were fears;” .
And He adds, what is still more cruel, that such false Prophets shall have no alleviation in charity; “Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.”.
Then that they should not say, How then shall we live among so many evils? He promises not only that they should live, but that they should teach everywhere. “And this Gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world.”.
That before the taking of Jerusalem the Gospel was preached every where, hear what Paul says, “Their sound is gone out into all the earth;” .And this is the strongest proof of Christ's power, that in thirty years or a little more, the word of the Gospel filled the ends of the world. Though the Gospel was preached every where, yet all did not believe, whence He adds, “For a witness unto all nations,” in accusation, that is, of such as believe not, they who have believed bearing witness against them that believed not, and condemning them.
