"Bless them which persecute you; bless, and curse not."

After teaching them how they ought to be minded towards one another, and after joining the members closely into one, he next proceeds to lead them forth to the battle without, which he makes easier as from this point. For as he who has not managed things well with those of his own side, will find more difficulty in arranging affairs with strangers, so he, that has practised himself duly among these, will with the more ease have the advantage of those without also. Hence then Paul also as he goes on in his journey, after the one places the other, and says, "Bless them that persecute you." He did not say, be not spiteful or revengeful, but required something far better. For that a man that was wise might do, but this is quite an angel's part. And after saying "bless," he proceeds, "and curse not," lest we should do both the one and the ether, and not the former only. For they that persecute us are purveyors of a reward to us. But if you are sober-minded, there will be another reward after that one, which you will gain yourself. For he will yield you that for persecution, but you will yield yourself the one from the blessing of another, in that you bring forth a very great sign of love to Christ. For as he that curses his persecutor, shows that he is not much pleased at suffering this for Christ, thus he that blesses shows the greatness of his love. Do not then abuse him, that you yourself may gain the greater reward, and may teach him that the thing is matter of inclination, not of necessity, of holiday and feast, not of calamity or dejection. For this cause Christ Himself said, "Rejoice when men speak all manner of evil against you falsely." [Matthew 5:11] Hence too it was that the Apostles returned with joy not from having been evil spoken of only, but also at having been scourged. [Acts 5:40-41] For besides what I have mentioned, there will be another gain, and that no small one, that you will make, both the abashing of your adversaries hereby, and instructing of them by your actions that you are travelling to another life; for if he see you joyous, and elevated, (πτερούμενον) from suffering ill, he will see clearly from the actions that you have other hopes greater than those of this life. So that if you dost not so, but weepest and lamentest, how is he to be able to learn from that that you are tarrying for any other life? And besides this, you will compass yet another thing. For provided he see you not vexed at the affronts done you, but even blessing him, he will leave harassing you. See then how much that is good comes from this, both a greater reward for yourself and a less temptation, and he will forbear persecuting you, and God too will be glorified: and to him that is in error your endurance will be instruction in godliness. For this reason it was not those that insult us only, but even those that persecute us and deal despitefully with us, that he bade us requite with the contrary. And now he orders them to bless, but as he goes on, he exhorts them to do them good in deeds also.

Those who persecute us are conveyors of a reward to us. If you are levelheaded, there will be another reward after that one which you will earn yourself. For your enemy will let you get a reward for persecution, but you will earn a further reward by blessing him, because by doing so you will be demonstrating a very great sign of love for Christ. Just as the man who curses his persecutor shows that he is not pleased to be suffering this for Christ’s sake, he who blesses his persecutor shows the greatness of his love.
