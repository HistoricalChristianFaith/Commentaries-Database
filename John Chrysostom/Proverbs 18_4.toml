“The word in the heart of man is a deep water, and a river and fountain of life spring forth.” By “deep water” he [Solomon] means “abundant” water which can often produce many rivers instead of one. Or, he says: it contains it deeply hidden in itself. As water is immeasurable, so the word in the heart of the person who lives according to God is without limit. Therefore, he uses “word” for knowledge. This is the one in whose heart a fountain of water is made when he hears the words of Jesus. He [Solomon] then speaks of it “springing forth,” raining upon or watering the fields which makes them fertile.
