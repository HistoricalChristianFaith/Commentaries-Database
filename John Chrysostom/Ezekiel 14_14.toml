No one may despair, though hitherto he may have been careless, of setting his hopes on nothing else, after God’s mercy, but on his own virtue. For if these were no better for such a kindred, even though they were of the same house and lineage with Christ, until they gave proof of virtue, what favor can we possibly receive, when we plead with righteous kin and brethren, unless we are exceedingly dutiful and have lived in virtue?… But even if it is Ezekiel who does the pleading, he will be told, “though Noah comes, and Job and Daniel, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters.” … For it is true that the prayers of the saints have the greatest power, but only on condition of our repentance and amendment of life.

Considering all these things, let us prepare for our departure from here. For even if the day of general consummation never comes to us, the end of each one is at the doors, whether they are old or young; and it is not possible for people, after they have gone from here, either to buy oil any more or to obtain pardon by prayers, though he who does the pleading be Abraham, or Noah, or Job or Daniel. While we have opportunity, let us store up for ourselves beforehand much confidence, let us gather oil in abundance, let us remove all into heaven, that in the fitting time, and when we most need them, we may enjoy all; by the grace and love toward people.
