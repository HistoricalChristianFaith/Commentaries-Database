God threatens to destroy the city of Nineveh for the very reason that He might not destroy it. When God makes a threat concerning our sins, He makes the threat beforehand so that we may be sobered by fear, so that our repentance will bring about God’s mercy so He will not have to follow through with the threat. (Hom. On Paralytic 3)

If you want, let us also hear this story: “Now the word of the Lord,” it says, “came to Jonah, saying, ‘Rise and go to Nineveh, the great city.’ ” He wanted to put Jonah to shame by sending him to the great city of Nineveh, because he foresaw the prophet’s escape. However, let us also listen to the preaching: “Yet three days, and Nineveh shall be overthrown.” Why do you, God, foretell the sufferings that you will inflict upon Nineveh? “So that I will not do what I announced.” This is why God threatened with hell—so he would not lead anyone away to hell. He says, “Fear that which is spoken to you, and do not be saddened about what has been done.” Why does he establish the appointed time to be only a period of three days? So that you may learn even the virtue of the barbarians—I call the Ninevites barbarians, who were able to annul in three days such anger caused by sin. I want you to marvel at the philanthropy of God, who was satisfied with three days of repentance for so many transgressions. I do not want you to sink into despair, even though you have innumerable sins.
