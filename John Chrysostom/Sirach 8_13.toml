Consider, dearly beloved, those who vouch for someone concerning money, how they have to submit themselves to a greater risk than the one who is responsible for and receives the money. Indeed, if the person who has received the loan shows himself benevolent, he pays back what he owes to the person who has given the guarantee; but if he turns out to be bad, he prepares a much larger disaster for the person who has vouched for him. For this reason a wise man warned, “If you give surety, be concerned as one who must pay.” Now then, if those who vouch for someone concerning money render themselves responsible for everything, how much more do those who vouch for someone relating to spiritual things and on the theme of virtue must demonstrate great vigilance, exhorting, advising, correcting and revealing paternal affection. And they should understand that what is happening should not be taken lightly but that their own reputation is at stake. There will be mutual benefit if through their personal admonition they lead them someone onto the road of virtue, while a grave condemnation will be incumbent on them if they neglect to do so. For this reason, it is customary to call these people spiritual parents, so that they may learn what affection they must demonstrate for them with their own deeds in the teaching of spiritual things. If it is good to push those to embrace virtue with whom we have no relationship, how much more must we carry out this command regarding someone whom we receive whom we call a spiritual son or daughter.
