And if they are clean, why washes He  their feet? That we may learn to be modest.  On which account He came not to any other part of the body, but to that which is considered more dishonorable than the rest. But what is, He that is washed? It is instead of, he that is clean. Were they then clean, who had not  yet been delivered from their sins, nor deemed worthy of the Spirit, since sin still had the mastery, the handwriting of the curse still remaining, the victim not having yet been offered? How then calls He them clean? That you may not deem them clean, as delivered from their sins, He adds,  Behold, you are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you. That is, In this way you are so far  clean; you have received the light, you have been freed from Jewish error. For the Prophet also says, 'Wash you, make you clean, put away the wickedness from your souls' Isaiah 1:16, Septuagint; so that such a one is washed and is clean. Since then these men had cast away all wickedness from their souls, and had companied with Him with a pure mind, therefore He says according to the word of the Prophet, he that is washed is clean already. For in that place also It means not the washing of water, practiced by the Jews; but the cleansing of the conscience. 

3. Be we then also clean; learn we to do well. But what is well? &nbsp;Judge for the fatherless, plead for the widow; and come, let us reason together, says the Lord. Isaiah 1:7 There is frequent mention in the Scriptures of widows and orphans, but we make no account of this. Yet consider how great is the reward. Though, it says, your sins be as scarlet, I will whiten them as snow; though they be red like crimson, I will whiten them as wool. For a widow is an unprotected being, therefore He  takes much care for her. For they, when it is even in their power to contract a second marriage, endure the hardships of widowhood through fear of God. Let us then all, both men and women, stretch forth our hands to them, that we may never undergo the sorrows of widow-hood; or if we should have to undergo them, let us lay up  a great store of kindness for ourselves. Not small is the power of the widow's tears, it is able to open heaven itself. Let us not then trample on them, nor make their calamity worse, but assist them by every means. If so we do, we shall put around  ourselves much safety, both in the present life, and in that which is to come. For not here alone, but there also will they be our defenders, cutting away most of our sins by reason of our beneficence towards them, and causing us to stand boldly before the judgment-seat of Christ. Which  may it come to pass that we all obtain, through the grace and lovingkindness of our Lord Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
