And if they are clean, why does he wash their feet? He does so, so that we may learn to be modest. This is why he came not to any other part of the body, but to that which is considered more dishonorable than the rest. But what is meant by “he that is washed,” which is said instead of “he that is clean”? Were they then clean who had not yet been delivered from their sins or deemed worthy of the Spirit, since sin still had the mastery, the handwriting of the curse still remaining, the victim not having yet been offered? Why then does he call them “clean”? That you may not consider them clean as delivered from their sins, he adds, “You are clean through the word that I have spoken unto you.” That is, “You are clean insofar as you have received the light and have been freed from error.”
