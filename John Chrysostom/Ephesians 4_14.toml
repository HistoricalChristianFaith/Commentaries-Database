That we may be no longer.â€” The word, no longer, shows that they had of old been in this case, and he reckons himself moreover as a subject for correction, and corrects himself. For this cause, he would say, are there so many workmen, that the building may not be shaken, may not be carried about, that the stones may be firmly fixed.

And carried about, says he, with every wind. He comes to this figure of speech, to point out in how great peril doubting souls are. With every wind, says he, by the sleight of men, in craftiness, after the wiles of error. The word sleight means the art of gamesters. Such are the crafty, whenever they lay hold on the simpler sort.
