Ver. 20. "Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord."

Again he has put that, "in the Lord," at once laying down the laws of obedience, and shaming them, and casting them down. For this, says he, is well-pleasing to the Lord. See how he would have us do all not from nature only, but, prior to this, from what is pleasing to God, that we may also have reward.
