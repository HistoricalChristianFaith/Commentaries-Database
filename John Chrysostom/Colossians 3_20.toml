Ver. 20. "Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well-pleasing in the Lord."

Again he has put that, "in the Lord," at once laying down the laws of obedience, and shaming them, and casting them down. For this, says he, is well-pleasing to the Lord. See how he would have us do all not from nature only, but, prior to this, from what is pleasing to God, that we may also have reward.

Again Paul has written, “in the Lord,” at once laying down the laws of obedience, producing shame in them. For this, he says, is wellpleasing to the Lord. See how Paul would have us live not only according to natural principles but, prior to this, according to what is pleasing to God. In this way we also gain a reward.
