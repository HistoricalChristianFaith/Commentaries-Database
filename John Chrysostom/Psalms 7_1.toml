David wrote the psalm, offering songs of thanksgiving to God.… Not in Hushai, nor in human wisdom, nor in that man’s shrewdness nor in my advice but “in you have I hoped.” Let us therefore act likewise: even if some achievement comes to us through human beings, let us give thanks for them to God, both for the benefits that fall to us through our own means as well as through others.… See the wonderful frame of mind with which he speaks, which was customary with him. He did not say, note, “O Lord God,” but “O Lord my God”; and elsewhere, “O God, my God, I look for you at break of day.” … This is the way God acts with righteous people, and being God of everyone equally he says he belongs to righteous people individually. “I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, the God of Jacob.”
