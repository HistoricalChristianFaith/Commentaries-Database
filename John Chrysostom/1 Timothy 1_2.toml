Why is mercy mentioned here, and not in the other Epistles? This is a further mark of his affection. Upon his son he invokes greater blessings, with the anxious apprehension of a parent. For such was his anxiety, that he gives directions to Timothy, which he has done in no other case, to attend to his bodily health; where he says, "Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities" [1 Timothy 5:23] Teachers indeed stand more in need of mercy.

"From God our Father," he says, "and Jesus Christ our Lord."

Here too is consolation. For if God is our Father, He cares for us as sons, as Christ says, "What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?" [Matthew 7:9]

Unto Timothy, my own son in the faith.
This too is encouraging. For if he evinced such faith as to be called peculiarly Paul's own son, he might be confident also with respect to the future. For it is the part of faith not to be cast down or disturbed, though circumstances occur that seem contrary to the promises. But observe he says, my son, and even my own son, and yet he is not of the same substance. But what? Was he of irrational kind? Well, says one, he was not of Paul, so this does not imply 'being of' another. What then? Was he of another substance? Neither was it so, for after saying my own son, he adds, in the faith, to show that he was really his own son, and truly from him. There was no difference. The likeness he bore to him was in respect to his faith, as in human births there is a likeness in respect of substance. The son is like the father in human beings, but with respect to God the proximity is greater. For here a father and a son, though of the same substance, differ in many particulars, as in color, figure, understanding, age, bent of mind, endowments of soul and body, and in many other things they may be like or unlike, but there is no such dissimilarity in the divine Essence. By commandment. This is a stronger expression than called, as we learn from other passages. As he here calls Timothy my own son, in like manner he says to the Corinthians, in Christ Jesus I have begotten you, i.e. in faith; but he adds the word own, to show his particular likeness to himself, as well as his own love and great affection for him. Notice again the in applied to the faith. My own son, he says, in the faith. See what an honorable distinction, in that he calls him not only his son, but his own son.

Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.
