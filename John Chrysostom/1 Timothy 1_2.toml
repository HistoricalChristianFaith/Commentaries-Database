Why is mercy mentioned here, and not in the other Epistles? This is a further mark of his affection. Upon his son he invokes greater blessings, with the anxious apprehension of a parent. For such was his anxiety, that he gives directions to Timothy, which he has done in no other case, to attend to his bodily health; where he says, "Use a little wine for your stomach's sake, and your frequent infirmities" [1 Timothy 5:23] Teachers indeed stand more in need of mercy.

"From God our Father," he says, "and Jesus Christ our Lord."

Here too is consolation. For if God is our Father, He cares for us as sons, as Christ says, "What man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?" [Matthew 7:9]
