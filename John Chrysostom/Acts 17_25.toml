How was he served by human hands when he was among the Jews? No, it was not by their hands but by their thoughts, since he did not seek those things, as though he were in need. “Shall I eat,” he says, “the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats?” Then Paul says, “Nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything.” Even this affirmation by Paul, that he is in need of nothing, is not enough. For although this is a mark of divinity, something else must be added. Paul adds, “He himself gives to all people life and breath and everything.” These are the two proofs of divinity Paul points to, that he is in need of nothing and that he gives to all people everything.
