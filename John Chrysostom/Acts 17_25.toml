These things are better than the former: and what an impeachment both of the atoms and of matter, that (creation) is not partial (work), nor the soul of man either. But this, which those say, is not to be Creator. — But by the mind and understanding He is worshipped.— It is He that gives, etc. He not the partial (μερικοὶ δαίμονες) deities. And all things. It is He, he says.— How man also came into being. — First he showed that He dwells not, etc., and then declared that He is not worshipped as though He had need of anything. If God, He made all: but if He made not, He is not God. Gods that made not heaven and earth, let them perish. He introduces much greater doctrines, though as yet he does not mention the great doctrines; but he discoursed to them as unto children. And these were much greater than those. Creation, Lordship, the having need of naught, authorship of all good— these he has declared. But how is He worshipped? Say. It is not yet the proper time. What equal to this sublimity? Marvellous is this also— of one, to have made so many: but also, having made, Himself sustains them (συγκρατεἵ) in being, giving life and breath and all things. (b) And has determined the times appointed, and the bounds of their habitation, that they should seek God, if haply they might feel after Him and find Him.

How then was He worshipped by men's hands among the Jews? Not by hands, but by the understanding. As though He needed anything: since even those (acts of worship) He did not in this sort seek, as having need. Shall I eat, says He, the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats? Psalm 50:13 Neither is this enough— the having need of naught— which he has affirmed: for though this is Divine, yet a further attribute must be added. Seeing it is He that gives unto all, life and breath and all things. Two proofs of Godhead: Himself to have need of naught, and to supply all things to all men. Produce here Plato (and) all that he has philosophized about God, all that Epicurus has: and all is but trifling to this! Gives, he says, life and breath. Lo, he makes Him the Creator of the soul also, not its begetter. See again how he overthrows the doctrine about matter. And made, he says, of one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth.
