Excessive boasting was evidently a characteristic of the false apostles.

But we will not glory beyond our measure: as they do.

For it is probable that in their boasting they said, 'we have converted the world, we have reached unto the ends of the earth,' and vented many other such like big words. 'But not so we,' he says,

But according to the measure of the province which God apportioned to us as a measure, to reach even unto you. So that his humility is evident on either hand, both in that he boasted nothing more than he had wrought, and that he refers even this itself to God. For, according to the measure of the province, says he, which God apportioned to us, a measure to reach even unto you. Just as if portioning out a vine to husbandmen, even so He meted out unto us. As far then as we have been counted worthy to attain to, so far we boast.
