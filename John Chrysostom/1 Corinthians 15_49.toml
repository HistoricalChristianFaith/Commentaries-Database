"As we have borne the image of the earthy," i.e., as we have done evil, "let us also bear  the image of the heavenly," i.e., let us practise all goodness.

But besides this, I would fain ask you, is it of nature that it is said, "he that is of the earth, earthy," and, "the Lord from heaven?" Â "Yea," says one. What then?
