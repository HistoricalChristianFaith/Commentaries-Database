He left the crowds and went away. Jesus “went into the house.” And not one of the scribes followed him. From this it is clear that they followed him for no other purpose than to seize him. But when they neglected to listen to his teachings, he let them be.

When his disciples came to him “asking him concerning the parable of the tares,” it seemed as though they wished to learn but were afraid to ask. What was the source of their confidence to pursue the matter? They had been told, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.” So they were emboldened. They asked quietly in private, not so as to circumvent the crowd but to observe the Lord’s wishes. For he had said “to these it is not given.”And why may it be that they let pass the parable of the leaven and of the mustard seed and inquire concerning the weeds? They let those pass because they were easier to understand, but they seemed to be attracted to the theme of the weeds. It seemed to be addressing something more that they still desired to learn. This was the second time Jesus had discussed this theme. They recognized how ominous was the danger it implied. He did not resist them but further elaborated his teaching.
And, as I am always saying, the parables must not be explained literally, since many absurdities would follow. This even he himself is teaching us here in thus interpreting this parable.
