Wherefore also He left them and went away. 

And not one of the Scribes follows Him; whence it is clear that for no other purpose did they follow, than to take hold of Him. But when they marked not His sayings, thenceforth He let them be.

And His disciples come unto Him, asking Him concerning the parable of the tares; although at times wishing to learn, and afraid Mark 9:32 to ask. Whence then arose their confidence in this instance? They had been told, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of Heaven; and they were emboldened. Wherefore also they ask in private; not as grudging the multitude, but observing their Master's law. For, To these, says He, it is not given.

And why may it be that they let pass the parable of the leaven, and of the mustard seed, and inquire concerning this? They let those pass, as being plainer; but about this, as having an affinity to that before spoken, and as setting forth something more than it, they are desirous to learn (since He would not have spoken the same to them a second time); for indeed they saw how severe was the threatening therein uttered. Wherefore neither does He blame them, but rather completes His previous statements.

And, as I am always saying, the parables must not be explained throughout word for word, since many absurdities will follow; this even He Himself is teaching us here in thus interpreting this parable. Thus He says not at all who the servants are that came to Him, but, implying that He brought them in, for the sake of some order, and to make up the picture, He omits that part, and interprets those that are most urgent and essential, and for the sake of which the parable was spoken; signifying Himself to be Judge and Lord of all.

He left the crowds and went away. Jesus “went into the house.” And not one of the scribes followed him. From this it is clear that they followed him for no other purpose than to seize him. But when they neglected to listen to his teachings, he let them be.

When his disciples came to him “asking him concerning the parable of the tares,” it seemed as though they wished to learn but were afraid to ask. What was the source of their confidence to pursue the matter? They had been told, “To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven.” So they were emboldened. They asked quietly in private, not so as to circumvent the crowd but to observe the Lord’s wishes. For he had said “to these it is not given.”And why may it be that they let pass the parable of the leaven and of the mustard seed and inquire concerning the weeds? They let those pass because they were easier to understand, but they seemed to be attracted to the theme of the weeds. It seemed to be addressing something more that they still desired to learn. This was the second time Jesus had discussed this theme. They recognized how ominous was the danger it implied. He did not resist them but further elaborated his teaching.
And, as I am always saying, the parables must not be explained literally, since many absurdities would follow. This even he himself is teaching us here in thus interpreting this parable.
