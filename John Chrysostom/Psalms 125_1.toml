Such, however, is not the nature of the righteous person. But what manner of person is he? Hear the same prophet, saying, “They that trust in the Lord are as Mount Zion.” What does the phrase “as Mount Zion” mean? “He shall not be shaken forever,” he says. For whatever engines [instruments of warfare] you bring up, whatever darts you hurl, desiring to overturn a mountain, you will never be able to prevail. For how can you? You will break in pieces all your engines and exhaust your own strength. Such also is the righteous person. Whatever blows he may receive, he suffers no evil therefrom but destroys the power of those who take counsel against him, and not of human beings only but of demons. You have heard often what engines the devil brought up against Job. But not only did he fail to overthrow that mountain but drew back exhausted, his darts broken to pieces and his engines rendered useless, by that assault!
