Ver. 6. "Who gave Himself a ransom for all to be testified  in due time."

Was Christ then a ransom for the Heathen? Undoubtedly Christ died even for Heathen; and you cannot bear to pray for them. Why then, you ask, did they not believe? Because they would not: but His part was done. His suffering was a "Testimony," he says; for He came, it is meant, "to bear witness to the truth" of the Father, and was slain.  Thus not only the Father bore witness to Him, but He to the Father. "For I came," He says, "in my Father's name." [John 5:43] And again, "No man has seen God at any time." [John 1:18] And again, "That they might know You, the only true God." [John 17:3] And, "God is a Spirit," [John 4:24] And He bore witness even to the death. But this, "in due time," means, In the fittest time.
