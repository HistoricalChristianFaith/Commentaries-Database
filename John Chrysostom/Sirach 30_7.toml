“Because the one who would save his life will lose it,” he says, “but the one who loses his life for my sake will find it. Indeed, what advantage would it be to gain the whole world and lose one’s soul? Or what can a person give in exchange for his soul?” This means: I ordain these things, not because I am not concerned for you but because I am very concerned for you. In fact, one who is always helping his child ruins him, while the one who does not always help saves him. A wise man said the same thing: “If you beat your child with the rod, he will not die. Rather, you will free his soul from death.” And, “One who spoils his child will bind up his wounds.” This is also the case in the army. If the general, in his concern for the soldiers, orders that they always stay inside the city, he will cause not only the soldiers to die, but the others in the city as well. So that this would not also happen to you, he says, You must be ready for a continual death. Indeed, even now a difficult battle breaks out. Do not remain inside, therefore, but go out and fight. Even if you fall in battle, you will have lived. If, in earthly wars, one who is ready to be killed is held in more esteem than the others and is more invincible and fearsome to the enemy—even if, after his death, the king for whom he has taken up arms cannot bring him back to life—how much more in these battles, with such a great hope of resurrection, will the one who exposes his life to death find it, first because he will not be taken quickly, and second, because even if he falls, it will bring him to a higher life.
