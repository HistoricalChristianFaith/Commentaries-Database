This is the part of a friend, this the part of a devout person, that where such blessings are concerned, he takes care that his near friends shall be made partakers of all. Of course [his “near” friends], those in whom he had ever full confidence; fearing, with such an interest at stake, to entrust the matter to others. In my opinion, it was by Cornelius himself that both friends and kinsmen had been brought to a better mind.
