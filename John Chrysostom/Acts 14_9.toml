But observe, he gave heed, it says, to the things spoken by Paul. Do you mark the elevation of the man's mind (φιλοσοφίαν)? He was nothing defeated (παρεβλάβη) by his lameness for earnestness of hearing. Who fixing his eyes upon him, and perceiving, it says, that he had faith to be made whole. He was already predisposed in purpose of mind. And yet in the case of the others, it was the reverse: for first receiving healing in their bodies, they were then taken in hand for cure of their souls, but this man not so. It seems to me, that Paul saw into his soul. And he leaped, it says, and walked.
