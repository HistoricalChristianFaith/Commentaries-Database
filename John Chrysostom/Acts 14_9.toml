Look, he paid attention, it says, to Paul’s words. Do you see the elevation of his mind? In no way did his lameness hinder his eagerness to listen. “Paul, looking intently at him and seeing,” it says, “that he had faith to be made well.” He was already predisposed in his purpose and resolution. And yet in the case of the others it was the opposite. Their bodies were healed before their souls. Not so with this man. It seems to me that Paul saw into his soul.
