Despondency and worry deprive the soul of its vitality. They put an immoderate strain upon the soul. For this reason Paul comforts the Philippians, who were in great despondency because they did not know how things stood with Paul. They thought him already dead.… Note that he does not introduce his exhortation immediately, but after having heaped praises on them and expressed his wonder he praises them once again.
