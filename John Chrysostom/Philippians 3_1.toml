Dejection and care, whenever they strain the soul beyond due measure, bereave it of its native force. And therefore Paul relieves the Philippians, who were in great despondency, and they were in despondency because they did not know how matters were with Paul; they were in despondency because they thought that it was already over with him, because of the preaching, because of Epaphroditus. It is in giving them assurance on all these points that he introduces the words, Finally, my brethren, rejoice. You no longer have, he says, cause for despondency. You have Epaphroditus, for whose sake you were grieved; you have Timothy; I am myself coming to you; the Gospel is gaining ground. What is henceforth wanting to you? Rejoice!

Now he calls the Galatians indeed children Galatians 4:19, but these brethren. For when he aims either to correct anything or to show his fondness, he calls them children; but when he addresses them with greater honor, brethren is the title. Finally, my brethren, he says, rejoice in the Lord. He said rightly in the Lord, not after the world. for this is no rejoicing. These tribulations, he says, which are according to Christ bring joy. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe. Beware of the dogs. Do you mark how he forbears to bring in the exhortation at the beginning? But after he had given them much commendation, after he had shown his admiration of them, then he does this, and again repeats his commendation. For this mode of speech seems to bear somewhat hard upon them. Wherefore he overshadows it on every side. But whom does he style dogs? There were at this place some of those, whom he hints at in all his Epistles, base and contemptible Jews, greedy of vile lucre and fond of power, who, desiring to draw aside many of the faithful, preached both Christianity and Judaism at the same time, corrupting the Gospel. As then they were not easily discernible, therefore he says, beware of the dogs: the Jews are no longer children; once the Gentiles were called dogs, but now the Jews. Wherefore? Because as the Gentiles were strangers both to God and to Christ, even so are these become this now. And he shows forth their shamelessness and violence, and their infinite distance from the relation of children, for that the Gentiles were once called dogs, hear what the Canaanitish woman says, Yea, Lord: for even the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table. Matthew 15:27 But that they might not have this advantage, since even dogs are at the table, he adds that, whereby he makes them aliens also, saying, Beware of the evil workers; he admirably expressed himself, beware of the evil workers; they work, he means, but for a bad end, and a work that is much worse than idleness, plucking up what is laid in goodly order.

Despondency and worry deprive the soul of its vitality. They put an immoderate strain upon the soul. For this reason Paul comforts the Philippians, who were in great despondency because they did not know how things stood with Paul. They thought him already dead.â€¦ Note that he does not introduce his exhortation immediately, but after having heaped praises on them and expressed his wonder he praises them once again.
