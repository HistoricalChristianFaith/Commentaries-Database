"Then they also which are fallen asleep in Christ have perished."

"And why speak I of you," says he, "when all those also are perished, who have done all and are no longer subject to the uncertainty of the future?" But by the expression, "in Christ," he means either "in the faith," or "they who died for His sake, who endured many perils, many miseries, who walked in the narrow way."

Where are those foul-mouthed Manichees who say that by the resurrection here means the liberation from sin ? For these compact and continuous syllogisms, holding as they do also conversely, indicate nothing of what they say, but what we affirm. It is true, "rising again" is spoken of one who has fallen: and this is why he keeps on explaining, and says not only that He was raised, but adds this also, "from the dead." And the Corinthians too doubted not of the forgiveness of sins, but of the resurrection of bodies.

But what necessity is there at all, that except mankind be not without sin, neither should Christ Himself be so? Whereas, if He were not to raise men up, it were natural to say, "wherefore came He and took our flesh and rose again?" But on our supposition not so. Yea, and whether men sin or do not sin, there is ever with God an impossibility of sinning, and what happens to us reaches not to Him, nor does one case answer to the other by way of conversion, as in the matter of the resurrection of the body.
