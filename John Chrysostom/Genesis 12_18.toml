Note that the severity of the punishment depressed his thinking, to the extent of leading him to offer an excuse to the just man and show signs of every care for him. And yet had Godâ€™s grace not been active in appeasing his mind and instilling fear into him, the consequence would have been that he would have flown into an even worse temper to the extent of attempting to even the score with his deceiver, the just man, wreaking his vengeance on him and bringing him to the ultimate peril. He did none of this, however. Fear quenched the fire of his anger. His one concern was to show signs of care for the just man. He now knew, you see, that it was impossible that this could be an unimportant man if he enjoyed such marvelous favor from on high.
