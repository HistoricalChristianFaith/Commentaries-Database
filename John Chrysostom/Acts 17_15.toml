"And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timotheus for to come to him with speed, they departed." For though he was a Paul, nevertheless he needed them. And with good reason are they urged by God to go into Macedonia, for there lay Greece moreover bright before them. (ch. xvi. 9.)

So far is it from being the case, that supernatural Grace worked all alike on all occasions: on the contrary, it left them to take their measures upon human judgment, only stirring them up and rousing them out of sleep, and making them to take pains. Thus, observe, it brought them safe only as far as Philippi, but no more after that.
