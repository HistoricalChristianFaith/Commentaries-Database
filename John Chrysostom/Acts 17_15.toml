“And receiving,” it says, “a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.” For even though he was Paul, he still needed them. So with good reason they were urged to go to Macedonia by God; for Greece lay there bright before them.… Notice how much eagerness was shown by the disciples toward their teachers. It is not so among us, separated and divided into great and small. Some of us are exalted, others are envious. They are envious because we are puffed up and cannot bear to be equals with them. The reason why there is harmony in the body is because nothing is puffed up, and there is nothing puffed up because the limbs are by necessity in a state of mutual need. The head needs the feet, and the feet the head.
