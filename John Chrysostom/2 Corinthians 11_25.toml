And what has this to do with the Gospel? Because he went forth on long journeys; and those by sea.

A night and a day I have been in the deep. Some say this means out on the open sea, others, swimming upon it, which is also the truer interpretation. There is nothing wonderful, at least, about the former, nor would he have placed it as greater than his shipwrecks.
