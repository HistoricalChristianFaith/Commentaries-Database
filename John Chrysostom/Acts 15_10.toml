He thoroughly cleansed them first. Then he shows, not that the Law was evil, but themselves weak.â€” But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved even as they.

What means, Tempt ye God? As if He had not power to save by faith. Consequently, it proceeds from a want of faith, this bringing in the Law. Then he shows that they themselves were nothing benefited by it, and he turns the whole (stress of his speech) against the Law, not against them, and (so) cuts short the accusation of them: which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear. But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they.
