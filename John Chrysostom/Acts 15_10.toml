"Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples?" What means, "Tempt ye God?" As if He had not power to save by faith. Consequently, it proceeds from a want of faith, this bringing in the Law. Then he shows that they themselves were nothing benefited by it, and he turns the whole stress of his speech against the Law, not against them, and so cuts short the accusation of them: "which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear." And he did not say, Why do ye disbelieve? which was more harsh, but, "Tempt God," and that when the fact is demonstrated. "Why therefore tempt ye God?" who is become the God of the Gentiles: for this was tempting: whether He is able to save even after the Law. See what he does. He shows that they are in danger.
