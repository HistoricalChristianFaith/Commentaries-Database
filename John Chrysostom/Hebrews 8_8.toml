But inasmuch as they were forever making objections, he says, Behold! The days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. He is not speaking of any old Covenant: for, that they might not assert this, he determined the time also. Thus he did not say simply, according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, lest you should say [it was] the one made with Abraham, or that with Noah: but he declares what [covenant it was], not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers in the Exodus. Wherefore he added also, in the day that I took them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt; because they continued not in My covenant, and I regarded them not, says the Lord. You see that the evils begin first from ourselves (they themselves first, says he, continued not in [the covenant]) and the negligence is from ourselves, but the good things from Him; I mean the [acts] of bounty. He here introduces, as it were, an apology showing the cause why He forsakes them.
