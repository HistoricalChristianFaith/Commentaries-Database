Do you see again that it is He who does it? I, says He, will do it; not, I will ask of the Father, but, that the Father may be glorified in Me. In another place He said, God shall glorify Him in Himself John 13:32, but here, He shall glorify the Father; for when the Son shall appear with great power, He who begot shall be glorified.

Acts 3:6 For all the miracles which they did He wrought in them, and the hand of the Lord was with them. Acts 11:21
