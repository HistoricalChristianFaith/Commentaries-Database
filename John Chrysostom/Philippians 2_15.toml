Do you do something good but grumble? Why? Is there any constraint upon you? “I know,” he says, “that many of your neighbors influence you to complain,” for this is what he hints at when he says “in the midst of a wicked and perverse generation.” But the way to excite wonder is to suffer no such thing even under provocation. For the stars too shine in darkness yet suffer no diminution of their own beauty, but instead they shine all the brighter.
