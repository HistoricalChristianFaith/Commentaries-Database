Observe, the hospitality here spoken of is not merely a friendly reception but one given with zeal and alacrity, with readiness, and going about it as if one were receiving Christ himself.

The title of true widow is not a title of calamity but of honor, even of the greatest honor.… “Heavens,” cried a sophist teacher [of Chrysostom as a young man], “what women there are among the Christians.” So great is the admiration and praise enjoyed by widowhood not only among ourselves but also among those who are outside the church. And being aware of all this, the blessed Paul said, “Let not a widow be enrolled under threescore years of age.” And even after this great qualification of age he does not permit her to be ranked in this sacred society but mentions some additional requisites. She must be “well reported of for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints’ feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.” Heavens! What testing and scrutiny! How much virtue does he demand from the widow, and how precisely does he define it! He would not have done this had he not intended to entrust to her a position of honor and dignity.
