Notice that Paul nowhere mentions the crime, because the time had now come to forgive.

However, be mindful of this: if you become lazy and indifferent, sin will seize you at one time or another. Therefore, show concern, if not for your brother, then at least for yourself. Repel the disease, overpower the decay, and interrupt the spreading of the cancerous sore. Paul spoke of these things and of much more than these. Since he ordered the Christians in Corinth to hand the fornicator among them over to Satan, he said later that “the sinner changed” and became better. “For such a one this punishment by the majority is enough. Therefore, reaffirm your love for him.” Even though Paul made him a common enemy, an adversary to all, expelled him from the fold and cut him off from the body, note how much concern he showed in order to bind him back indissolubly and rejoin him to the church. For he did not say, “simply love him” but “reaffirm your love for him.” In other words, reveal your friendship as certain, unshakable, fervent, ardent and fiery; present your love with the same strength as the previous hatred. “What happened? Tell me, did you not surrender him to Satan?” “Yes,” he said, “but not for him to remain in Satan’s hands, but to be quickly delivered from his tyrannical dominion.” Pay careful attention, however, to the very thing I was saying about how much Paul feared discouragement as a great weapon of the devil. He said, “Reaffirm your love for him,” and then added the reason, “lest such a one should be swallowed up by excessive sorrow.”

"Sufficient to such a one is this punishment which was inflicted by the many."

And he says not "to him that has committed fornication," but here again "to such a one," as also in the former Epistle. Not however for the same reason; but there out of shame, here out of mercy. Wherefore he no where subsequently so much as mentions the crime; for it was time now to excuse.
