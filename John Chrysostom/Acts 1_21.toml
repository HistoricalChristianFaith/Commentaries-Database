So one of the men who have accompanied us: continues Peter. Observe how desirous he is they should be eye-witnesses. It is true indeed that the Spirit would shortly come; and yet great care is shown with regard to this circumstance. Of these men, he says, which have companied with us, all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us. He shows that they had dwelt with Christ, not simply been present as disciples. In fact, from the very beginning there were many that then followed Him.
