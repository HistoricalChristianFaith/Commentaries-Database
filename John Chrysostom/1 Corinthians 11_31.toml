Paul did not say, “if we punished ourselves” but only if we were prepared to recognize our offense, to judge ourselves truly, to condemn our own wrongdoing, then we should be rid of the punishment both in this world and in the next. For the one who condemns himself propitiates God in two ways, first by acknowledging his sins and second by being more careful in the future.
