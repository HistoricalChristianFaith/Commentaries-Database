“For the Lord does not desire to look upon wrongs, for he, the almighty one, observes all those who perform lawless deeds, and he will save me; and do you plead before him, if you can praise him, as it is possible even now.” Not only did the Lord not countenance wrongs, but he did not even wish to see them, as another prophet said: “You who are of purer eyes than to behold evil and cannot look on wrong.” You see, what providence, what protection, what comprehension! Even if he does not take vengeance, he nevertheless abhors actions.
