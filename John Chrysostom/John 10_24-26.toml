Their mode of questioning was full of hatred when they say, “Tell us plainly, are you the Christ?” And yet, he was always at their feasts and had said nothing in secret at those feasts, speaking everything out in the open. They preface their remarks, however, with flattery: “How long do you make us to doubt?” They say this as if they were anxious to know the truth, but they really only meant to provoke him to say something that they might latch on to.
