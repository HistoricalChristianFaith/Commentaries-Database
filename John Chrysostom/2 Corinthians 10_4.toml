By “worldly weapons” he means wealth, glory, power, loquaciousness, cleverness, half-truths, flatteries, hypocrisies and so on. The apostle does not use such weapons but only those which are spiritual.

[[commentary]]

And he said not, 'we are not carnal,' but, "our weapons." For as I said, for the present he discourses of the Preaching, and refers the whole power to God. And he says not, 'spiritual,' although this was the fitting opposite  to "carnal," but "mighty," in this implying the other also, and showing that their  weapons are weak and powerless. And mark the absence of pride in him; for he said not, 'we are mighty,' but, "our weapons are mighty before God." 'We did not make them such, but God Himself.' For because they were scourged, were persecuted, and suffered wrongs incurable  without number, which things were proofs of weakness: to show the strength of God he says, "but they are mighty before God." For this especially shows His strength, that by these things He gains the victory. So that even though we are encompassed with them, yet it is He that wars and works by them. Then he goes through a long eulogium upon them, saying, "To the casting down of strong holds."
