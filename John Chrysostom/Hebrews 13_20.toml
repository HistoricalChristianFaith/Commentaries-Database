Again he bears high testimony to them. For that is made perfect which having a beginning is afterwards completed. And he prays for them which is the act of one who yearns for them. And while in the other Epistles, he prays in the prefaces, here he does it at the end. Working in you, he says, that which is well-pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
