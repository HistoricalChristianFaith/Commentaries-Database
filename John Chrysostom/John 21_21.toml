Why has Peter reminded us of [John’s] reclining? Not without cause or by chance but to show us what boldness Peter had after the denial. For he who then did not dare to question Jesus but turned this task over to another was now entrusted with the chief authority over the brothers. And not only does he not commit to another what relates to himself, but he himself now puts a question to his Master concerning another. John is silent, but Peter speaks. He also shows here the love that he had toward him. For Peter greatly loved John, as is clear from what followed, and their close union is shown both throughout the Gospel and also in the Acts. When therefore Christ had foretold great things of Peter and committed the world to his care and had foretold his martyrdom and testified that his love was greater than that of the others, desiring to have John also to share in this with him, he said, “And what shall this man do? Shall he not travel the same road with us?” On that other occasion, because he is not able himself to ask the question, he put John forward. Similarly, now desiring to return the favor and supposing that John would want to ask about matters pertaining to himself but lacked the courage, he himself undertook the questioning.
