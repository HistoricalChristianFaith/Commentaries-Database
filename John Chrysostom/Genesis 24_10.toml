Do you see how from the outset the servant showed his regard for his master? See him now showing the benefit of the patriarch’s instruction by imitating the good man’s godliness. “The servant took ten camels,” the text relates, “and a selection of all his master’s goods; he set out and traveled into Mesopotamia to the city of Nahor, where he rested the camels outside the city at the well toward evening when the women come out to draw water. He said, ‘Lord, the God of my master Abraham.’ ” See the servant’s dutifulness: he names the Lord of the world after the patriarch, saying, “Lord, the God of my master Abraham,” who has given evidence of so many kindnesses to him. Why are you surprised if the servant calls him the God of Abraham in this way? The God of all shows how he sets great store by the virtue of good people and says, “I am the God of Jacob, the God of Isaac and the God of Abraham.”
