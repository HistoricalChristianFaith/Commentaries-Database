And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest, and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem. He fitly mentions Paul's zeal, and shows that in the very midst of his zeal he is drawn. Yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter, and not yet sated with the murder of Stephen, he was not yet glutted with the persecution of the Church, and the dispersion.

Lo, this was fulfilled which was spoken by Christ, that they which kill you shall think they offer worship to God. He then in this wise did it, not as the Jews: God forbid! For that he did it through zeal, is manifest from his going abroad even to strange cities: whereas they would not have cared even for those in Jerusalem; they were for one thing only, to enjoy honor.

But why went he to Damascus? It was a great city, a royal city: he was afraid lest that should be preoccupied. And observe his strong desire and ardor and, how strictly according to the Law he went to work: he goes not to the governor, but to the priest. That if he found any of this way: for so the believers were called, probably because of their taking the direct way that leads to heaven.

And why did he not receive authority to have them punished there, but brings them to Jerusalem! He did these things here with more authority. And mark on what a peril he casts himself. He was not afraid lest he should take any harm, but yet he took others also with him, that if, it says, he found any of this way, whether they were men or women-Oh, the ruthlessness!-he might bring them bound. By this journey of his, he wished to show them all how he would act: so far were they from being earnest in this matter.
