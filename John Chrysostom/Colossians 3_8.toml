"But now put ye also away all these."

He speaks always both universally and particularly; but this is from earnestness.

"Anger, wrath, malice, railing, shameful speaking out of your mouth. Lie not one to another."

"Shameful speaking," he saith, "out of your mouth," clearly intimating that it pollutes it.

But against others he advanceth his discourse. Under the head of "passion and railing" he means revilings, just as under "wrath" he means wickedness. And in another place, to shame them, he says, "for we are members one of another." He makes them out to be as it were manufacturers of men; casting away this one, and receiving that. He spoke of a man's "members"; here he saith, "all." He spoke of his heart, wrath, mouth, blasphemy, eyes, fornication, covetousness, hands and feet, lying, the understanding itself, and the old mind.
