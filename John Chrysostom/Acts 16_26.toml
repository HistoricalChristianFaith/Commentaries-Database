The prison shook to disrupt the mindset of the faithless, to set the prison guard free and to proclaim the word of God.… You see how the nature of shackles destroys the shackles, for just as the death of the Lord put death to death, so also the shackles of Paul set the captives free, shook the prison, opened the doors. And yet this is not the nature of shackles, but they do the opposite—they hold the prisoner in security, they do not open up the walls for him. But while the simple nature of shackles is not this, the nature of these shackles is such because of Christ.
