And why did no other miracle take place? Because this especially was enough to convert him and make him believe, since he himself would have been in danger, if this had not happened. For it is not so much miracles that convince us as things that come to our salvation. Lest the earthquake should seem to have occurred of its own accord, this12 follows and bears witness to it. And it appeared at night; for the apostles did not work for display but for people’s salvation.

The prison shook to disrupt the mindset of the faithless, to set the prison guard free and to proclaim the word of God.… You see how the nature of shackles destroys the shackles, for just as the death of the Lord put death to death, so also the shackles of Paul set the captives free, shook the prison, opened the doors. And yet this is not the nature of shackles, but they do the opposite—they hold the prisoner in security, they do not open up the walls for him. But while the simple nature of shackles is not this, the nature of these shackles is such because of Christ.
