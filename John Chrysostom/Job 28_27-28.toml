Nothing has more value than that art, nothing is more powerful than that wisdom. “The fear of the Lord, that is the beginning of wisdom, and all those who practice it have good understanding.” That is the greatest of all goods. Supreme wisdom is to worship God, not to take trouble to make useless notices, and especially to enquire about events. Do not believe that you may find a different wisdom.
