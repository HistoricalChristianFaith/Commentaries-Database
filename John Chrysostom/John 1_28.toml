John, who had no concern for the crowd’s opinion or anyone else’s opinion, which he would rather trample underfoot, proclaimed to all with an attractive kind of freedom the things about Christ. And therefore the Evangelist marks the very place, to show the boldness of the outspoken herald. For it was not in a house, not in a corner, not in the wilderness, but in the middle of the multitude. This was after he had made his presence known at the Jordan when all that were baptized by him were present (for the Jews came upon him as he was baptizing). It was here that he proclaimed aloud that wonderful confession concerning Christ, full of those sublime and great and mysterious doctrines. It was here that he said he was not worthy to unloose the latchet of his shoe. This is why the Evangelist reports that “these things were done in Bethany,” or, as all the more correct copies have it, “in Bethabara.” For Bethany was not “beyond Jordan” or bordering on the wilderness, but somewhere near Jerusalem.He marks the places also for another reason. Since he was not about to relate matters that were out of date, but rather those that had happened just a little before, he makes those who were present and had seen everything witnesses of his words and supplies proof from the places themselves. Confident that nothing was added by himself to what was said, but that he simply and with truth described things as they were, he draws a testimony from the places which, as I said, would be no common demonstration of his veracity.
