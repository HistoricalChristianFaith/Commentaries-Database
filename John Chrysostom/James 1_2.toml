Suffering is a real bond, an encouragement to greater love, and the basis of spiritual perfection and godliness. Listen to the one who says: “If you want to serve the Lord, prepare your soul for temptation.” And again Christ said: “In the world you will have tribulation, but take courage.” And again: “straight and narrow is the way.” Everywhere you see suffering being praised, everywhere it is accepted as necessary for us. For in the world there is no one who wins a trophy without suffering, who has not strengthened himself with labors and dieting and exercise and vigils and many other things like that. How much more is that true in this battle!
