Paul mixes the lowly things with the lofty, ever imitating his Master, so that the lowly become the path to the lofty, and through the former we are led to the latter, and when we are amid the great things we learn that these [lowly ones] were a condescension. This accordingly he does here also. After declaring that He offered up Himself, and showing Him to be a High Priest, what does he say? Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: we have such an High Priest who is set down on the right hand of the throne of the majesty. And yet this is not [the office] of a Priest, but of Him whom the Priest should serve.
