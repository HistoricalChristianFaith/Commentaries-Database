Where people were not falsely accused, the Scripture mentions nothing of this sort. But in this case since it was false accusation, naturally it is rectified by God. He accomplishes this by the very look of the man. For the apostles were not falsely accused but were forbidden. But this man is falsely accused, and so above all his face pleads for him. This even put the priest to shame.
