For they had learnt that one should study not so much to say somewhat worthy of God, as to say what is profitable for the hearers. What then? if He be Maker of all things, why does He not also attend to these things by His Providence? "Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways"-but wherefore He suffered them, this he does not say, for at present he keeps to the matter of immediate importance, nowhere bringing in the name of Christ. Observe, he does not wish to swell the accusation against them, but rather that they themselves should refer all to God.

"Who in times past," etc. He names as witnesses even the years in their courses.
