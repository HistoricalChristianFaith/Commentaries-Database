The death of the righteous, therefore, deserves not tears but joy. If they rejoice, one should rejoice with them. “But we long for their company,” you say.… If you were going to remain here, you speak reasonably; but in a little while you are going to recover the departed one. What sort of company is it that you desire?… “I suffer nothing terrible,” he says, “but rather rejoice because I am departing to be with Christ. And do you not rejoice? Rejoice with me.”
