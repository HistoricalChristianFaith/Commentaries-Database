All this, however, happened as a type of the cross. Hence Christ too said to the Jews, “Your father Abraham rejoiced in anticipation of seeing my day; he saw it and was delighted.” How did he see it if he lived so long before? In type, in shadow. Just as in our text the sheep was offered in place of Isaac, so here the rational Lamb was offered for the world. You see, it was necessary that the truth be sketched out ahead of time in shadow. Notice, I ask you, dearly beloved, how everything was prefigured in shadow: an only-begotten son in that case, an only-begotten in this; dearly loved in that case, dearly loved in this. “This is my beloved Son,” Scripture says, in fact, “in whom I have found satisfaction.” The former was offered as a burnt offering by his father, and the latter his Father surrendered. Paul too shouts aloud in the words “He who in fact did not spare his own Son but handed him over for the sake of us all—how will he not also grant us every gift along with him?” Up to this point there is shadow, but now the truth of things is shown to be more excellent. This rational Lamb, you see, was offered for the whole world; he purified the whole world; he freed human beings from error and led them forward to the truth; he made earth into heaven, not by altering the nature of the elements but by transferring life in heaven to human beings on earth. Through him all worship of demons is made pointless; through him people no longer worship stone and wood. Nor do those endowed with reason bend the knee to material things—instead, all error has been abolished, and the light of truth has shone brightly on the world. Do you see the superiority of the truth? Do you see what shadow is, on the one hand, and truth, on the other?
