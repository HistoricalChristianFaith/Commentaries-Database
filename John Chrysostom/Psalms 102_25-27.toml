But, if you think the word through implies inferiority, listen to [the prophet] saying, “In the beginning you did establish the earth, and heaven is the work of your hands.” What is said of the Father as Creator is meant also of the Son; he would not have said it if he had not the same opinion of him as Creator, and as not inferior to anyone. And if the words “through him” are used here, they are employed with no other view than that no one may subscribe to the idea that the Son is unbegotten.
