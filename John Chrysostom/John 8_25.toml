They ask, “Who are you?” Such a lack of understanding! After such a long time with all of his signs and teaching they still ask, “Who are you?” What then does Christ say? “The same that I told you from the beginning.” What he is saying is: You are not worthy to hear my words at all, much less to learn who I am. For everything you say is an attempt to tempt me. But you have not even listened to one of the things I have said. And all these things I am now able to prove against you.
