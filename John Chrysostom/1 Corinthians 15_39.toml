"All flesh is not the same flesh." For why speak I, says he, in respect of seeds? In respect of bodies let us agitate this point, concerning which we are discoursing now. Wherefore also he adds, and says,

"But there is one flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of birds, and another of fishes."
