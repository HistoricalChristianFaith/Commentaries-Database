They set them apart from the multitude. The people themselves drew them to the ordination, and the apostles did not lead. Notice how he does nothing excessive. He does not say how it was done but only that they were ordained through prayer. For this is the meaning of “ordination” (in Greek, “stretching out the hand”): the hand that is laid upon the head belongs to a person, but God effects it all, and it is his hand that touches the head of the ordained one, if he is duly ordained.
