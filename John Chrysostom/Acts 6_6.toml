"Whom they set before the Apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them." They separated them from the multitude, and it is the people that draw them, not the Apostles that lead them. Observe how he avoids all that is superfluous: he does not tell in what way it was done, but that they were ordained with prayer: for this is the meaning of "laying on of hands," or ordination: the hand of the man is laid upon the person, but the whole work is of God, and it is His hand which toucheth the head of the one ordained, if he be duly ordained. And this business was not simply handed over to them without further ceremony, but the Apostles prayed over them, that power might be given to them.
