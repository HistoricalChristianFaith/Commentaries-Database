Since the argument was about the law, Paul develops another highly controversial argument, bringing Abraham to the fore, and most effectively.… “For the power of faith,” he says, “is shown by the miracles that occurred among you; but if you wish I shall also try to convince you from the ancient records.… There was no law then,” he says, “and now too there is no law.… Just as in Abraham’s time the law was not yet given, so now, having been given, it has ceased.” And since they thought it a great thing to be descended from Abraham and were afraid that if they abandoned the law they would be deprived of their kinship, Paul turns this argument on its head and dissolves fear by showing that it is faith above all that produces affinity with Abraham.
