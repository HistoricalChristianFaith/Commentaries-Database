“By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, having received the spies, but she directed their departure by another road.” And pay attention to how much wisdom she blended with her prudence. When those sent by the king came and requested the spies, they ask her, “Did men enter in here and come near you?” She answers them, “Yes, they entered in.” First she builds the truth, and then she applies the lie on top. For no lie like this becomes believable unless it first reveals the truth. For this reason all who tell lies probably to be believed, first speak of truths and reveal confessions and later add the lies and things which are questionable. “Spies entered in here and came near you?” “Yes,” she says. If she had said “no” from the beginning, she would have challenged the messengers to investigate. However, “they entered in,” she says, “and they came out and escaped by such and such a road. Pursue them and you will capture them.” O this good lie! O this good fraud, which does not betray the divine but safeguards the sacred! When the mouths of saints preach the repentance that made Rahab worthy of such salvation, for example, Joshua the son of Nun, who shouts in the desert, “Let Rahab the prostitute live”; and Paul, who says, “By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient,” will we not receive salvation even more so when we offer to God our repentance? - "Homilies on Repentance and Almsgiving 7.5.17"
