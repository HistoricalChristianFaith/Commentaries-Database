“He withdrew from them, taking the disciples with him.” That is, [Paul] put a stop to their evil speaking. This he did and withdrew, since he did not wish to kindle their envy or to lead them to greater strife.… From this let us learn not to meet the evil-speaking people but to withdraw from them. He did not speak evil, though he himself was spoken ill of. Instead, “he argued daily” and gained many friends especially because of this, that he neither turned away nor separated himself though he was spoken ill of.… Thus by withdrawing from them, he defeats those who maligned and spoke evil of the doctrine (for this is what he called the Way). He himself withdrew so as not to force the disciples to go back or to rouse their anger, thereby revealing his opponents to be pushing away salvation on every occasion. Here he does not even defend his actions before them, since the Gentiles everywhere have believed.

Fittingly do they call this “the way,” as it truly was the way that leads to the kingdom of heaven. Or the Scripture is saying that Christ is the way, as he is called the way, or it is speaking of the true faith, that which is proclaimed through Paul, by which any wayfarer arrives at the kingdom of heaven.
