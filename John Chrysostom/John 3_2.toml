This man [Nicodemus] appears also in the middle of the Gospel defending Christ when he says, “Our law judges no man before it hears him.” The Jews in anger replied to him, “Search and look, for out of Galilee arises no prophet.” Again after the crucifixion he bestowed great care upon the burial of the Lord’s body: “And there came also Nicodemus,” says the Evangelist, “who first came to the Lord by night and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pound weight.” And even now he was disposed toward Christ, but not as he should have been, nor did he yet have a proper regard for Jesus, being still entangled in Jewish misunderstanding. This is why he came by night, because he feared to do so by day. Yet our merciful God did not reject or rebuke him for this, or deprive him of his instruction. Rather, with much kindness Jesus talked with him and disclosed to him rather enigmatically some highly exalted doctrines indeed—nevertheless, Jesus still disclosed them.
