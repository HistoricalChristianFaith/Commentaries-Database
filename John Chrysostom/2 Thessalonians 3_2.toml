"And that we may be delivered from unreasonable and evil men; for all have not faith."

This is the manner of one showing also his dangers as to which especially he besought them. "From unreasonable and evil men," he says, "for all have not faith." Thus he is speaking of those who contradict the Preaching, who oppose and contend against the doctrines. For this he has intimated by saying, "For all men have not faith." And here he seems to me not to glance at dangers, but at the men who contradicted and hindered his word, as did Alexander the coppersmith. For he says, "he greatly withstood our words." That is, there are some to whom it is given. As if he were speaking of a paternal inheritance, that "it is not for all to serve in the Palace." And at the same time he also excites them, as already having such ground of confidence as to be able both to deliver their Teacher from dangers, and to facilitate his preaching.
