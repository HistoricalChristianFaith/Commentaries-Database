At that time, of course meaning the time immediately following: for this is the custom of Scripture. And he well says that Herod the king (did this): this was not he of Christ's time. Lo, a different sort of trial— and mark what I said in the beginning, how things are blended, how rest and trouble alternate in the whole texture of the history— not now the Jews, nor the Sanhedrin, but the king. Greater the power, the warfare more severe, the more it was done to obtain favor with the Jews. And, it says, he slew James the brother of John with the sword: (taking him) at random and without selection. But, should any raise a question, why God permitted this, we shall say, that it was for the sake of these (Jews) themselves: thereby, first, convincing them, that even when slain (the Apostles) prevail, just as it was in the case of Stephen: secondly, giving them opportunity, after satiating their rage, to recover from their madness; thirdly, showing them that it was by His permission this was done. And when he saw, it says, that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to seize Peter also. O excessive wickedness! On whose behalf was it, that he gratified them by doing murders thus without plan or reason? And it was the day of unleavened bread. Again, the idle preciseness of the Jews: to kill indeed they forbade not, but at such a time they did such things! Whom having arrested, he put in ward, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers.

For there was also another James, the brother of the Lord: therefore to distinguish him, he says, The brother of John. Do you mark that the sum of affairs rested in these three, especially Peter and James? (a) And how was it he did not kill Peter immediately? It mentions the reason: it was the day of unleavened bread: and he wished rather to make a display (ἐ κπομπεὕσαι) with the killing of him. And when he saw it pleased the Jews.

“And,” it says, “he killed James the brother of John with the sword”; simply that, as if it happened by chance. If someone should ask why God permitted this, we would answer that it was for the sake of the Jews themselves. First of all, [God] thereby persuades them that even when being put to death, the apostles triumph, which also happened in the case of Stephen. Second, [God] gives them an opportunity, after satiating their anger, to return from their madness. Third, he shows that it was with his consent that this happened.
