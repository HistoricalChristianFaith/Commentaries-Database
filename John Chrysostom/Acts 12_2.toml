“And,” it says, “he killed James the brother of John with the sword”; simply that, as if it happened by chance. If someone should ask why God permitted this, we would answer that it was for the sake of the Jews themselves. First of all, [God] thereby persuades them that even when being put to death, the apostles triumph, which also happened in the case of Stephen. Second, [God] gives them an opportunity, after satiating their anger, to return from their madness. Third, he shows that it was with his consent that this happened.
