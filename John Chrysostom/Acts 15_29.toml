For these things the New Testament did not enjoin: we nowhere find that Christ discoursed about these matters; but these things they take from the Law. From things strangled, it says, and from blood. Here it prohibits murder. cf. Genesis 9:5 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch: and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle: which when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
