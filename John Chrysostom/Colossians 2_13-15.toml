"Having forgiven us," he says, "all our trespasses," those which produced that deadness. What then? Did He allow them to remain? No, He even wiped them out; He did not scratch them out merely; so that they could not be seen. "In doctrines"  [ordinances], he says. What doctrines? The Faith. It is enough to believe. He has not set works against works, but works against faith. And what next? Blotting out is an advance upon remission; again he says, "And has taken it out of the way." Nor yet even so did He preserve it, but rent it even in sunder, "by nailing it to His Cross." "Having put off from himself the principalities and the powers, He made a show of them openly, triumphing over them in it." Nowhere has he spoken in so lofty a strain.

Do you see how great His earnestness that the bond should be done away? To wit, we all were under sin and punishment. He Himself, through suffering punishment, did away with both the sin and the punishment, and He was punished on the Cross. To the Cross then He affixed it; as having power, He tore it asunder. What bond? He means either that which they said to Moses, namely, "All that God has said will we do, and be obedient" [Exodus 24:3], or, if not that, this, that we owe to God obedience; or if not this, he means that the devil held possession of it, the bond which God made for Adam, saying, "In the day you eat of the tree, you shall die." [Genesis 2:17] This bond then the devil held in his possession. And Christ did not give it to us, but Himself tore it in two, the action of one who remits joyfully.

"Having put off from himself the principalities and the powers." He means the diabolical powers; because human nature had arrayed itself in these, or because they had,  as it were, a hold, when He became Man He put away from Himself that hold. What is the meaning of "He made a show of them"? And well said he so; never yet was the devil in so shameful a plight. For while expecting to have Him, he lost even those he had; and when That Body was nailed to the Cross, the dead arose. There death received his wound, having met his death-stroke from a dead body. And as an athlete, when he thinks he has hit his adversary, himself is caught in a fatal grasp; so truly does Christ also show, that to die with confidence  is the devil's shame.

For he would have done everything to persuade men that He did not die, had he had the power. For seeing that of His Resurrection indeed all succeeding time was proof demonstrative; while of His death, no other time save that whereat it happened could ever furnish proof; therefore it was, that He died publicly in the sight of all men, but He arose not publicly, knowing that the aftertime would bear witness to the truth. For, that while the world was looking on, the serpent should be slain on high upon the Cross, herein is the marvel. For what did not the devil do, that He might die in secret? Hear Pilate saying, "Take ye Him away, and crucify Him, for I find no fault in Him" [John 19:6], and withstanding them in a thousand ways. And again the Jews said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, come down from the Cross." [Matthew 27:40] Then further, when He had received a mortal wound, and He came not down, for this reason He was also committed to burial; for it was in His power to have risen immediately: but He did not, that the fact might be believed. And yet in cases of private death indeed, it is possible to impute them to a swoon, but here, it is not possible to do this either. For even the soldiers broke not His legs, like those of the others, that it might be made manifest that He was dead. And those who buried The Body are known; and therefore too the Jews themselves seal the stone along with the soldiers. For, what was most of all attended to, was this very thing, that it should not be in obscurity. And the witnesses to it are from enemies, from the Jews. Hear them saying to Pilate, "That deceiver said, while he was yet alive, After three days I rise again. Command therefore that the sepulchre"  [Matthew 26:63-64] be guarded by the soldiers. This was accordingly done, themselves also sealing it. Hear them further saying even afterwards to the Apostles, "You intend to bring this Man's blood upon us." [Acts 5:28] He suffered not the very fashion of His Cross to be put to shame. For since the Angels have suffered nothing like it, He therefore does everything for this, showing that His death achieved a mighty work. There was, as it were, a single combat. Death wounded Christ: but Christ, being wounded, did afterwards kill death. He that seemed to be immortal, was destroyed by a mortal body; and this the whole world saw. And what is truly wonderful is, that He committed not this thing to another. But there was made again a second bond of another kind than the former.

Beware then lest we be condemned by this, after saying, I renounce Satan, and array myself with You, O Christ. Rather however this should not be called "a bond," but a covenant. For that is "a bond," whereby one is held accountable for debts: but this is a covenant. It has no penalty, nor says it, If this be done or if this be not done: what Moses said when he sprinkled the blood of the covenant, by this God also promised everlasting life. All this is a covenant. There, it was slave with master, here it is friend with friend: there, it is said, "In the day that you eat thereof you shall die" [Genesis 2:17]; an immediate threatening; but here is nothing of the kind. God arrives, and here is nakedness, and there was nakedness; there, however, one that had sinned was made naked, because he sinned, but here, one is made naked, that he may be set free. Then, man put off the glory which he had; now, he puts off the old man; and before going up (to the contest), puts him off as easily, as it were his garments.  He is anointed,  as wrestlers about to enter the lists. For he is born at once; and as that first man was, not little by little, but immediately. (He is anointed,) not as the priests of old time, on the head alone, but rather in more abundant measure. For he indeed was anointed on the head, the right ear, the hand [Leviticus 8:23-24]; to excite him to obedience, and to good works; but this one, all over. For he comes not to be instructed merely; but to wrestle, and to be exercised; he is advanced to another creation. For when one confesses (his belief) in the life everlasting,  he has confessed a second creation. He took dust from the earth, and formed man [Genesis 2:7]: but now, dust no longer, but the Holy Spirit; with This he is formed, with this harmonized, even as Himself was in the womb of the Virgin. He said not in Paradise, but "in Heaven." For deem not that, because the subject is earth, it is done on earth; he is  removed there, to Heaven, there these things are transacted, in the midst of Angels: God takes up your soul above, above He harmonizes it anew, He places you near to the Kingly Throne. He is formed in the water, he receives spirit instead of a soul.  And after he is formed, He brings to him, not beasts, but demons, and their prince, and says, "Tread upon serpents and scorpions." [Luke 10:19] He says not, "Let Us make man in our image, and after our likeness" [Genesis 1:26], but what? "He gives them to become the sons of God; but of God," he says, "they were born." [John 1:12-13] Then that thou give no ear to the serpent, straightway he teaches you to say, "I renounce you," that is, "whatsoever you say, I will not hear you." Then, that he destroy you not by means of others, it is said,  "and your pomp, and your service, and your angels." He has set him no more to keep Paradise, but to have his citizenship in heaven. For straightway when he comes up he pronounces these words, "Our Father, Which art in Heaven,...Your will be done, as in Heaven, so on earth." The plain falls not on your sight,  you see not tree, nor fountain, but straightway you take into you the Lord Himself, you are mingled with His Body, you are intermixed with that Body that lies above, whither the devil cannot approach. No woman is there, for him to approach, and deceive as the weaker; for it is said, "There is neither female, nor male." [Galatians 3:28] If you go not down to him, he will not have power to come up where you are; for you are in Heaven, and Heaven is unapproachable by the devil. It has no tree with knowledge of good and evil, but the Tree of Life only. No more shall woman be formed from your side, but we all are one from the side of Christ. For if they who have been anointed of men take no harm by serpents, neither will you take any harm at all, so long as you are anointed; that you may be able to grasp the Serpent and choke him, "to tread upon serpents and scorpions." [Luke 10:19] But as the gifts are great, so is the punishment great also. It is not possible for him that has fallen from Paradise,  to dwell "in front of Paradise"  [Genesis 3:24], nor to reascend there from whence we have fallen. But what after this? Hell, and the worm undying. But far be it that any of us should become amenable to this punishment! But living virtuously, let us earnestly strive to do throughout His will. Let us become well-pleasing to God, that we may be able both to escape the punishment, and to obtain the good things eternal, of which may we all be counted worthy, through the grace and love toward man, etc.
