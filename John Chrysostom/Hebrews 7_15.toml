And it is yet far more evident, if after the similitude of Melchisedec there arises another priest. What is evident? The interval between the two priesthoods, the difference; how much superior He is who was made not according to the law of a carnal commandment. (Who? Melchisedec? Nay; but Christ.) But according to the power of an endless life. For He testifies, You are a Priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec; that is, not for a time, nor having any limit, but according to the power of an endless life, that is, by means of power, by means of endless life.
