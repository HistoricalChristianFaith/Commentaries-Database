Notice their piety: they do not pronounce judgment in haste but are perplexed. The reckless ones, on the other hand, pronounce at once, saying, “They are filled with new wine.” Now it was in order that they might comply with the law and appear three times each year in the temple that they lived there, the “devout men from all nations.” Notice that the writer does not flatter them: he does not say that they did not pronounce judgment. What does he say? “And at this sound the crowd gathered and was bewildered.” This is quite likely, since they thought that things were coming to a head for them because of the outrage committed against Christ.
