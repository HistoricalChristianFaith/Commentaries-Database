He shows that they neither know the law nor do the law, for if the law commands to kill no one without first hearing him, and they before hearing were eager to do this, they were transgressors of the law. And because they said, “None of the rulers has believed on him,” therefore the Evangelist informs us that Nicodemus was “one of them,” to show that even rulers believed on him. For although they were not all that bold yet, still they were becoming attached to Christ.
