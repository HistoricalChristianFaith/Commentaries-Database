Do you see his extreme folly? Why, if you say these things in sincerity, wherefore do you inquire privily? But if intending to plot against Him, how is it you do not perceive, that from the fact of their being asked secretly the wise men will be able to perceive your craft? But as I have already said, a soul taken captive by any wickedness becomes more utterly senseless than any thing.

And he said not, go and learn concerning the King, but concerning the young Child; for he could not even endure to call Him by the name of His dominion.

4. But the wise men perceive nothing of this, by reason of their exceeding reverence (for they never could have expected that he could have gone on to so great wickedness, and would have attempted to form plots against a dispensation so marvellous): and they depart suspecting none of these things, but from what was in themselves auguring all that would be in the rest of mankind.

The attempt to murder the child just born was not only an act of madness but also of extreme folly, since what had been said and done was enough to hold him back from any such attempt. For these were not merely natural or human occurrences.… Nevertheless nothing restrained Herod. This is how wickedness works—it stumbles over its own greed, always attempting vain objectives. What utter folly. So on either premise his craftiness was bizarre. It was also folly for him to think that the wise men would take him more seriously than the child whom they had come so far to see, whose identity had been confirmed by prophecy. How could Herod hope to persuade the wise men to betray this child to him, even before they had seen the One for whom they had so long hoped?Nevertheless, as many as were the good reasons to hold him back, Herod persisted with his evil attempt.… He must have imagined that the Jews would be so anxious to protect the child that they would never be willing to give up their national Deliverer and Savior. With all these miscalculations, he called in the wise men privately and sought to discern the timing of the star. The object of his pursuit was far more than a star. For the star, I think, must have appeared and been visible a long time before, because it took a long time for the wise men to come on their journey to find him in swaddling clothes. If the star appeared at the moment of Jesus’ birth in Palestine, it would have already been seen by many in the distant east. The trip to Jerusalem would have taken quite some time.
As to Herod’s murder of the children “who were two years old and under,” this shows the extent of his irrational wrath and dread in trying to prevent even one from escaping.…
But the wise men perceive nothing of this, by reason of their exceeding awe. They would never have expected that Herod could have persisted toward such great wickedness as to attempt to form plots against a dispensation so marvelous.
