"And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou Me? And I answered, Who are Thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, Whom thou persecutest." Well is the name of the city (Nazareth) also added, that they might recognize the Person: moreover, the Apostles also spoke thus. And Himself bore witness, that they were persecuting Him.
