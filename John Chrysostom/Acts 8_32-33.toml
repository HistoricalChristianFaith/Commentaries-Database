And Philip ran thither to him, and heard him reading; even the fact of his running, showed that he wished to say something. And the place of the Scripture which he read was this: As a sheep He was led to the slaughter. And this circumstance, also, is a token of his elevated mind, that he had in hand this prophet, who is more sublime than all others. Philip does not relate matters to him just as it might happen, but quietly: nay, does not say anything until he is questioned.

He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened He not His mouth: in His humiliation His judgment was taken away: and who shall declare His generation? for His life is taken from the earth. Observe how it is Providentially ordered. First he reads and does not understand; then he reads the very text in which was the Passion and the Resurrection and the Gift.
