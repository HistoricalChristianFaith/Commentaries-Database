(Hom. lxv. 1) They sought before to kill Him; now their resolution was confirmed.

(Hom. lxv. 2) How must it have troubled the disciples to see Him save Himself by merely human means? Whileall were rejoicing and keeping the feast, they remained hid, and in danger. Yet they continued with Him; as we read in Luke, Ye are they which have continued with Me in My temptations. (Luke 22:28)

(Hom. lxv) They lay in wait for Him at the passover, and made the feast time the time of His death.
