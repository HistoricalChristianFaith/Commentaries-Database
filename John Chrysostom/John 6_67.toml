Had he praised them, they would naturally, as people do, have thought that they were conferring a favor on Christ by not leaving him. By showing, as he did, that he did not need their company, he made them stick all the more closely to him. He does not say, however, “Go away,” as this would have been to cast them off. Rather, he asks whether they wanted to go away. In this way, he prevented them from staying with him out of any feeling of shame or compulsion.
