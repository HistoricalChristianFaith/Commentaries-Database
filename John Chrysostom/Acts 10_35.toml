That is, God calls and attracts him to the truth. Can you see Paul? He was more vehement than any one in warring and persecuting. Yet because he led an irreproachable life and did these things not through human passion, he was both received and reached a mark beyond all.

"But in every nation he that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, is acceptable to him." What then? It may be asked, is the man yonder in Persia acceptable to Him? If he be worthy, in this regard he is acceptable, that it should be granted him to be brought unto faith. The Eunuch from Ethiopia He overlooked not. "What shall one say then of the religious men who have been overlooked?" It is not the case, that any such ever was overlooked. But what he says is to this effect, that God rejects no man. "In every nation, he that feareth God and worketh righteousness:" by righteousness he means, all virtue. Mark, how he subdues all elation of mind in him.

"Every one," as he saith, "that feareth Him, and worketh righteousness, would be acceptable to Him." As when Paul saith, "For when the Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things of the Law." "That feareth God and worketh righteousness:" he assumes both doctrine and manner of life: is "accepted with Him;" for, if He did not overlook the Magi, nor the Ethiopian, nor the thief, nor the harlot, much more them that work righteousness, and are willing, shall He in anywise not overlook. "What say you then to this, that there are likely persons, men of mild disposition, and yet they will not believe?" Lo, you have yourself named the cause: they will not. But besides the likely person he here speaks of is not this sort of man, but the man "that worketh righteousness:" that is, the man who in all points is virtuous and irreproachable, when he has the fear of God as he ought to have it. But whether a person be such, God only knows. See how this man was acceptable: see how, as soon as he heard, he was persuaded.
