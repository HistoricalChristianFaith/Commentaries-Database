“He that digs a pit for his neighbor shall fall into it.” And this happened even then. For they wished to destroy [Jesus] in order to suppress his preaching, but just the opposite took place. His preaching flourished by the grace of Christ, whereas all their schemes have been snuffed out and have perished. Further, they have lost their homeland, and freedom, and security and worship, and have been deprived of all honor and glory, and become slaves and captives.Accordingly, since we know these things, let us never plot against others, because we have learned that by so doing we are sharpening the sword against ourselves and wounding ourselves more deeply than others.
