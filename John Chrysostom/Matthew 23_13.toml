But if to profit no one be a charge against a man, even to hurt and hinder, what plea has that? But what means, them that are entering in? Them that are fit for it. For when they were to lay injunctions on others, they used to make the burdens intolerable, but when they themselves were to do any of the things required, on the contrary, so far from doing anything, they went much beyond this in wickedness, they even used to corrupt others. These are they that are called pests, who make their employment the ruin of others, standing right contrary to teachers. For if it be the part of a teacher to save that which is perishing, to destroy that which is on the point of being saved is that of a destroyer.

By “the kingdom of heaven” is meant the Scriptures, because in them the kingdom of heaven is lodged; the understanding of these is the door. Or “the kingdom of heaven” is the blessedness of heaven, and the door thereof Christ, by Whom men enter in. Thedoor-keepers are the Priests, to whom is committed the word of teaching or interpreting Scripture, by which the door of truth is opened to men. The opening of this door is right interpretation. And observe that He said not, "Woe unto you,” for ye open, but, “for ye shut up;” the Scriptures then are not shut up, though they are obscure.
