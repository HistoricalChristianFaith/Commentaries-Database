There are two kinds of consolation, apparently opposed to one another but yet contributing great strength each to the other, both of which the apostle has here put forward. The one is when we say that persons have suffered much. For the soul is refreshed when it has many witnesses of its own sufferings, and this he introduced above, saying, “Recall the former days, when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings.”The other is when we say, “You have suffered no great thing.” The former, when the soul has been exhausted, refreshes it and makes it recover breath; the latter, when it has become indolent and supine, turns it again and pulls down pride. Thus, so that no pride may spring up in them from that testimony, see what he does. “In your struggle against sin,” he says, “you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.” … This he says also in writing to the Corinthians, “No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man,” that is, small. For this is enough to arouse and set right the soul, when it considers that it has not risen to the whole trial and encourages itself from what has already befallen it.
