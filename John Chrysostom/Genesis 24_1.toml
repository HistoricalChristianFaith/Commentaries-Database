So let us listen to sacred Scripture’s account to us: “Abraham was old, advanced in years. The Lord had blessed Abraham in every respect.” Why did it mention this to us? Since he was about to give good care and attention to Isaac, to the point of bringing him a bride, accordingly it mentioned to us the patriarch’s age.
