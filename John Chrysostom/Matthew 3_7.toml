They did not continue to follow John. This is what Christ meant when he later refused to disclose his own authority to the Pharisees. When they refused to receive the very One of whom John was preaching, this was hardly a convincing expression of their faith. The Pharisees imagined that they had the highest regard for the prophets and Moses. But Jesus said they had disregarded Moses because they had not received the one foretold by him: “If you believed Moses, you would believe me.” Then he confronted them: “I also will ask you a question: now tell me, Was the baptism of John from heaven or from men?” They debated: “If we say, from heaven, he will say, why did you not believe him?” From all this it was clear that they came indeed and were baptized by John, but they did not continue faithfully in the preaching of John. John’s Gospel also points out their corruptness, reporting how they sent representatives to the Baptist asking, “Are you Elijah? Are you Christ?” This is why it was added: “Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.”
