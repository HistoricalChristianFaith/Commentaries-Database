"Then comes the end."

For when these shall have risen again, all things shall have an end, not as now when after Christ's resurrection things abide yet in suspense. Wherefore he added, "at His coming," that you may learn that he is speaking of that time, "when He shall have delivered up the kingdom to God even the Father; when He shall have abolished all rule and all authority and power."

6. Here, give heed to me carefully, and see that no part escape you of what I say. For our contest is with enemies : wherefore we first must practice the reductio ad absurdum which also Paul often does. Since in this way shall we find what they say most easy of detection. Let us ask them then first, what is the meaning of the saying, "When he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father?" For if we take this just as it stands and not in a sense becoming Deity, He will not after this retain it. For he that has delivered up to another, ceases any longer to retain a thing himself. And not only will there be this absurdity, but that also the other person who receives it will be found not to be possessor of it before he has so received it. Therefore according to them, neither was the Father a King before, governing our affairs: nor will it seem that the Son after these things will be a King. How then, first of all, concerning the Father does the Son Himself say, "My Father works hitherto, and I work:" [John 5:17] and of Him Daniel, "That His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, which shall not pass away?" [Daniel 7:14] Do you see how many absurdities are produced, and repugnant to the Scriptures, when one takes the thing spoken after the manner of men?

But what "rule," then does he here say, that Christ "puts down?" That of the angels? Far from it. That of the faithful? Neither is it this. What rule then? That of the devils, concerning which he says, "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against the principalities, against the powers, against the world rulers of this darkness:" [Ephesians 6:12] For now it is not as yet "put down" perfectly, they working in many places, but then shall they cease.

What rule and power will Christ destroy? That of the angels? Of course not! That of the faithful? No. What rule is it then? That of the devils, about which he says that our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the principalities, the powers and the forces of darkness in this present age.
