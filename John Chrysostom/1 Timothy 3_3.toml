Not given to wine: here he does not so much mean intemperate, as insolent and impudent. No striker: this too does not mean a striker with the hands. What means then no striker? Because there are some who unseasonably smite the consciences of their brethren, it seems to be said with reference to them. Not greedy of filthy lucre, but patient: not a brawler, not covetous; one that rules well his own house, having his children in subjection with all gravity. If then he who is married cares for the things of the world 1 Corinthians 7:33, and a Bishop ought not to care for the things of the world, why does he say the husband of one wife? Some indeed think that he says this with reference to one who remains free from a wife. But if otherwise, he that has a wife may be as though he had none. 1 Corinthians 7:29 For that liberty was then properly granted, as suited to the nature of the circumstances then existing. And it is very possible, if a man will, so to regulate his conduct. For as riches make it difficult to enter into the kingdom of Heaven, yet rich men have often entered in, so it is with marriage. But why does he say, speaking of a Bishop, that he should be not given to wine, hospitable, when he should name greater things? Why said he not that he should be an Angel, not subject to human passions? Where are those great qualities of which Christ speaks, which even those under their rule ought to possess? To be crucified to the world, to be always ready to lay down their lives, as Christ said. The good Shepherd gives his life for the sheep John 10:11; and again, He that takes not his cross and follows after me, is not worthy of me. Matthew 10:38 But not given to wine, he says; a good prospect indeed, if such are the things of which a Bishop is to be admonished! Why has he not said that he ought to be already raised above the world? But do you demand less of the Bishop, than even of those in the world? For to these he says, Mortify your members which are upon the earth Colossians 3:5, and He that is dead, is freed from sin. Romans 6:7 They that are Christ's have crucified the flesh; and Christ again says, Whosoever forsakes not all that he has, he is not worthy of Me. Luke 15:33 Why are not these things required by Paul? Plainly because few could be found of such a character, and there was need of many Bishops, that one might preside in every city.
