Paul was the guest he welcomed. Perhaps one of you will say, “If Paul was given to me as a guest to welcome, I would receive him readily and with great enthusiasm.” But look, it is possible for you to welcome Paul’s master as your guest, and you refuse. “For he who welcomes,” says he, “the least among you welcomes me.” Inasmuch as the brother is “the least,” so much the more is Christ present through him. For he who welcomes the mighty often does so for the sake of vainglory, but he who welcomes the lowly does so honestly, for the sake of Christ. It is even possible for you to welcome the father of Christ, and you refuse. “For I was a stranger, and you invited me in.” “Whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers who believe in me, you did for me.” Even if he is not Paul but a brother who believes and even if he is the least, Christ is present through him. Open your house, take him in. “Anyone who receives a prophet will receive a prophet’s reward.” So likewise he who receives Christ will receive the reward due to one who welcomes Christ.
