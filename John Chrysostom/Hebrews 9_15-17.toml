How did he become mediator? He brought words from God and brought them to us, conveying what came from the Father and adding his own death. We had offended; we ought to have died. He died for us and made us worthy of the covenant. By this is the covenant secure, in that henceforward it is not made for the unworthy.

It was probable that many of those who were weaker would especially distrust the promises of Christ because he had died. Paul, accordingly, out of a superabundance introduced this illustration, deriving it from common custom. Of what kind is it? He says, “Indeed, on this very account we ought to be of good courage.” On what account? Because covenants are established and obtain their force when those who have made them are not living but dead. “Therefore,” he says, “he is the mediator of a new covenant.” A covenant is made toward the last day, the day of death.And a covenant is of this character: it makes some heirs and some disinherited. So in this case also. “I desire that they also,” Christ says, “may be with me where I am.” And again of the disinherited, hear him saying, “I do not pray for” all, “but for those who believe in me through their word.” Again, a covenant has relation both to the testator and to the legatees; so that they have some things to receive, and some to do. So also in this case, for, after having made promises innumerable, he demands also something from them, saying, “A new commandment I give to you.” Again, a covenant ought to have witnesses. Hear him again saying, “I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me.” And again, “he will bear witness to me,” speaking of the Spirit. The twelve apostles too he sent, saying, “Bear witness before God.”
