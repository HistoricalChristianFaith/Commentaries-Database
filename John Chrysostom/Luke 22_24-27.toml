(Hom. 65. in Matt.) He mentions the Gentiles, to show thereby how faulty it was. For it is of the Gentiles to seek after precedence.

As if He says, Think not that thy disciple needs you, but that you do not need him. For I who need no one whom all things in heaven and earth need, have condescended to the degree of a servant.
