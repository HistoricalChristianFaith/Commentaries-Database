"Even when we were dead through our trespasses He quickened us together with Christ." Again is Christ introduced, and it is a matter well worthy of our belief, because if the Firstfruits live, so do we also. He hath quickened both Him, and us. Seest thou that all this is said of Christ incarnate? Beholdest thou "the exceeding greatness of His power to us-ward who believe?" Them that were dead, them that were children of wrath, them hath he quickened. Beholdest thou "the hope of his calling?"
