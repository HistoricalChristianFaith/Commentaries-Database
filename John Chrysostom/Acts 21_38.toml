This Egyptian was a deceiving sorcerer, and the devil expected to triumph through him and implicate Christ and his apostles in charges leveled at these sorcerers. But he did not succeed. The truth became still more brilliant, having suffered no harm through the devil’s machinations but shining all the brighter.… Therefore let us not grieve that heresies exist where false Christs wished to attack Christ, both before and after this, to throw him into obscurity. For we find the truth shining through on every occasion. This is also what happened with the prophets. There were false prophets, by contrast with whom the true prophets shone all the more. For sickness shows off health clearly, darkness light, and stormy weather calm.
