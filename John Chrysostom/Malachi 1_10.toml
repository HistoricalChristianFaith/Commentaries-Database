The Jews did return from Babylon, they did recover the city, they did rebuild the temple, and they did offer sacrifices. But it was only after all this that Malachi predicted the coming of the present desolation and the abolition of Jewish sacrifices. This is what he said speaking in God’s behalf: “ ‘Shall I for your sakes accept your persons?’ says the Lord God almighty. ‘For from the rising of the sun, even to its setting, my name is glorified among the nations; and everywhere they bring incense to my name, and a pure offering. But you have profaned it.’ ”

After their captivity in Babylon the Jews did rebuild their temple and restored the place where they were allowed to observe all the rituals according to the law. But now the power of Christ, the power that founded the church, has also destroyed their restored temple. And their prophets foretold this and showed that God would reject Judaism and introduce a new way of worship.

Scripture did not pass over in silence the rejection of the Jews. Notice how the prophet Malachi foretold this too. “Behold, among you the doors will be shut, and fire will not be kindled on my altar for anything.” He also foretold who would now pay God worship. “From the rising of the sun to its going down, my name has been glorified among the nations.” And again he said, “And in every place incense is offered to me and a pure sacrifice.” Do you see how he made clear the nobility of worship? How he showed that the new worship had a special honor and differed from the old? Worship will not be confined to a place or a way of sacrifice, nor will it consist in savor or smoke or omens; it will be a different ritual.
