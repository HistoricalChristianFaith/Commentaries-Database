Truly, as Paul says in Romans, “where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.” He intimates this here also, in the very beginning of his epistle to the Hebrews, for it was likely that they [the recipients of the law] were afflicted and worn out by evils, and, judging things from that perspective, they would think themselves worse off than all other people. He shows here that they had rather been made partakers of a greater, even very exceeding, grace. Thus, with these words he arouses the hearer at the very opening of his discourse, saying, “God … in these last days … has spoken to us by a Son.”

The apostle did well to begin, “In many and various ways,” for he points out that not even the prophets themselves saw God. Nevertheless, the Son saw him. For the expression “in many and various ways” is the same as “in various ways.” “It was I,” says he, “who multiplied visions and through the prophets gave parables.” The excellence consists not in this alone, that to them prophets were sent, while to us was sent the Son. Rather, the excellence consists in that none of them saw God, but the only begotten Son saw God. The apostle does not at once assert this, but by what he says afterwards he establishes it, when he says, concerning Christ’s human nature, “For to what angel did God ever say, ‘You are my Son,’ ” and, “Sit at my right hand?”
