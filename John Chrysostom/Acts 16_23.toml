"And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison" - great was their wrath - "charging the jailer to keep them safely": "And the magistrates," charging the jailer to keep them safely: that they may be the means of a greater miracle. The stricter the custody, the greater the miracle. It was probably from the wish to cut short the disturbance, that the magistrates did these things; because they saw the crowd urgent, and wished to stay their passion at the instant, therefore they inflicted the stripes: at the same time it was their wish to hear the matter, and that was why they cast them into prison and gave charge "to keep them safely."
