If then you hold to my testimony—and you even now produce it when you say “to whom you bore witness”—not only is he undiminished by receiving my witness, but he is increased by it. Besides, the testimony was not mine. It was God’s. And so, if you think I am trustworthy, I said this among the other things, that “I am sent before him.” See how he shows little by little that the voice was divine? For he is saying, in effect, “I am a servant speaking the words of the one who sent me. I did not give the testimony as a gift; I spoke what I was sent to speak. Do not think I am someone great just because of this. In actuality he is the great one. He is the Lord of all.”
