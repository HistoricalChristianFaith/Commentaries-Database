"He reasoned therefore in the synagogue," etc. Observe him again reasoning with Jews. By "devout persons" he means the proselytes. For the Jews were dispersed everywhere before Christ's coming, the Law indeed being henceforth, so to say, in process of dissolution, but at the same time the dispersed Jews teaching men religion. But those prevailed nothing, save only that they got witnesses of their own calamities.
