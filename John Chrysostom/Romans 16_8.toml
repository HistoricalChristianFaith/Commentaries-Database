Here again he passes encomiums upon his person by his love. For the love of Paul was for God, carrying countless blessings with it. For if being loved by the king is a great thing, what a great encomium must it be to be beloved by Paul? For if he had not acquired great virtue, he would not have attracted his love? Since as for those who live in vice and transgressions he is accustomed (οἶδε]) not only to abstain from loving them, but even to anathematize them. As when he says, "If any man love not the Lord Jesus, let him be accursed" [1 Corinthians 16:22]; and, "If any man preach any other gospel unto you than that you have received, let him be accursed." [Galatians 1:8]

Think what an honor it was to be loved by the apostle Paul. If Ampliatus had not been worthy of this, he would not have attracted Paul’s love.
