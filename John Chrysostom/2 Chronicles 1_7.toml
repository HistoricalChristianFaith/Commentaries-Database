You also therefore should ask nothing worldly, but all things spiritual, and you will surely receive. For so Solomon, because he asked what he ought, behold, how quickly he received. Two things now, you see, should be in one who prays: asking earnestly and asking what he ought, “since you too,” said he, “though you are parents, wait for your children to ask; and if they should ask of you anything inexpedient, you refuse the gifts; just as, if it be expedient, you consent and bestow it.” Do you too, considering these things, not withdraw until you receive; until you have found, do not retire; do not relax your diligence until the door is opened. For if you approach with this mind and say, “Except I receive, I will not depart,” you will surely receive, provided you ask such things as are both suitable for him of whom you asked to give and expedient for you the petitioner. But what are these? To seek the things spiritual, all of them; to forgive them who have trespassed, and so to draw near asking forgiveness; “to lift up holy hands without wrath and doubting.” If we thus ask, we shall receive. As it is, surely our asking is a mockery and the act of drunken rather than of sober people.“What then,” said one, “if I ask even spiritual things, and do not receive?” You did not surely knock with earnestness; or you made yourself unworthy to receive; or did quickly stop asking.
“And wherefore,” it may be inquired, “did he not say, what things we ought to ask”? No, truly, he has mentioned them all in what precedes and has signified for what things we ought to draw near. Do not say, then, “I drew near and did not receive.” For in no case is it owing to God that we receive not, God who loves us so much as to surpass even parents, to surpass them as far as goodness does this evil nature.
