[The words of God, the prophet says,] are “desirable above gold and a very precious stone, and sweeter than honey and the honeycomb,” but they are so only to those in sound health. Therefore he added, “For your servant keeps them.” And elsewhere again, after saying that they are sweet, he added, “to my palate.” “How sweet to my palate,” he says, “are your promises.” And he goes on to insist on their excellence by the words “sweeter than honey and the honeycomb to my mouth,” because he was in very sound health. Well, then, let us not on our part approach these words in ill health, but let us receive nourishment from them, after having restored our souls to health.
