Paul needs to see that the Corinthians are as obedient in restoring the sinner as they had been in punishing him. For the punishment might have proceeded in part from envy and malice, but if they now proceed to restore him in love, that will show that their obedience is pure. This is the test of true disciples: if they obey not only when ordered to do something but on their own as well.

"For to this end also did I write to you , that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things;" not only in cutting off but also in reuniting. Do you see how here again he brings the danger to their doors. For as when he sinned, he alarmed their minds, except they should cut him off, saying, "A little leaven leavens the whole lump," [1 Corinthians 5:6] and several other things; so here too again he confronts them with the fear of disobedience, as good as saying, 'As then ye had to consult not for him, but for yourselves too, so now must ye not less for yourselves than for him; lest ye seem to be of such as love contention and have not human sensibilities, and not to be in all things obedient. And hence he says, "For to this end also did I write to you, that I might know the proof of you, whether you are obedient in all things."

For the former instance might have seemed to proceed even of envy and malice, but this shows very especially the obedience to be pure, and whether you are apt unto loving kindness. For this is the test of right minded disciples; if they obey not only when ordered to do certain things, but when the contrary also. Therefore he said, "in all things," showing that if they disobey, they disgrace not him  so much as themselves, earning the character of lovers of contention; and he does this that hence also he may drive them to obey. Whence also he says, "For to this end did I write to you;" and yet he wrote not for this end, but he says so in order to win them. For the leading object was the salvation of that person. But where it does no harm, he also gratifies them. And by saying, "In all things," he again praises them, recalling to memory and bringing forth to view their former obedience.
