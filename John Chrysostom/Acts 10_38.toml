Then again the proof— how does that appear?— from the good that He did. Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: and the greatness of the power shown when He overcomes the devil; and the cause, Because God was with Him. Therefore also the Jews spoke thus: We know that You are a teacher come from God: for none can do these miracles except God be with him. John 3:2 Then, when he has shown that He was sent from God, he next speaks of this, that He was slain: that you may not imagine anything absurd. Do you see how far they are from hiding the Cross out of view, nay, that together with the other circumstances they put also the manner? Whom also, it says, they slew by hanging on a tree. And gave Him, it is added, to be made manifest not to all the people, but to witnesses before ordained of God, even unto us: and yet it was (Christ) Himself that elected them; but this also he refers to God. To the before-ordained, he says, even to us, who ate and drank with Him after that He was risen from the dead.

He does not mean, You know Jesus, for they did not know Him, but he speaks of the things done by Him: Who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil: by this he shows that many cases of lost senses or paralyzed limbs are the devil's work, and a wrench given to the body by him: as also Christ said. For God was with Him. Again, lowly terms. And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem
