First he discourses of Jesus’ being Lord and in exceeding elevated terms, seeing he had to deal with a soul more than commonly elevated and that took all in with ardor. Then he proves how he was Lord of all, from the things that he achieved “throughout all Judea.” For, he says, you know “the word that was proclaimed throughout all Judea,” and, what is the wonderful part of it, “beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John preached: how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; how he went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. First he speaks of his success, and then again [Peter] says concerning him, “Jesus of Nazareth.” Why, what a stumbling block, this birthplace! “How God anointed him with the Holy Spirit and with power.” Then again the proof—how does that appear?—from the good that he did. “Who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed of the devil,” and the greatness of the power shown when he overcomes the devil; and the cause, “Because God was with him.”
