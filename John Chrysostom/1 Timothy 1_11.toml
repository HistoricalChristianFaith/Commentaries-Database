"According to the glorious Gospel of the blessed God, which was committed to my trust."

Thus the Law is still necessary for the confirmation of the Gospel, yet to those who obey it is unnecessary. And he calls the Gospel "glorious." There were some who were ashamed of its persecutions, and of the sufferings of Christ, and so for the sake of these, as well as for others, he has called it "the glorious Gospel," thus showing that the sufferings of Christ are our glory. And perhaps he glances too at the future. For if our present state is exposed to shame and reproach, it will not be so hereafter; and it is to things future, and not to things present, that the Gospel belongs. Why then did the Angel say, "Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, for unto you is born a Saviour"? (Luke ii. 10.) Because He was born to be their Saviour, though His miracles did not commence from His birth. "According to the Gospel," he saith, "of the blessed God." The glory he means is either that of the service of God, or, in that if present things are filled with its glory, yet much more will things future be so; when "His enemies shall be put under His feet" (1 Cor. xv. 25), when there shall be nothing opposed, when the just shall behold all those blessed things, which "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, and which hath not entered into the heart of man." (1 Cor. ii. 9.) "For I will" says our Saviour, "that they also may be with Me, where I am, that they may behold My glory, which Thou hast given Me." (John xvii. 24.)
