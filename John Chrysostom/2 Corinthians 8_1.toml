Having encouraged the Corinthians with these praises, Paul now turns to exhortation once more. He wants to encourage them to give alms, but instead of saying so directly, he prepares the ground by talking about the highest things first.

How that in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy.

Do you see his wisdom? For he says not first, that which he wishes; but another thing before it, that he may not seem to do this of set purpose , but to arrive at it by a different connection. In much proof of affliction. This was what he said in his Epistle to the Macedonians themselves, You became imitators of the Lord, having received the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Ghost; and again, From you sounded forth the word of the Lord, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place, your faith to God-ward is gone forth. 1 Thessalonians 1:6-8 But what is, in much proof of affliction the abundance of their joy? Both, he says, happened to them in excess; both the affliction and the joy. Wherefore also the strangeness was great that so great an excess of pleasure sprang up to them out of affliction. For in truth the affliction not only was not the parent of grief, but it even became unto them an occasion of gladness; and this too, though it was great. Now this he said, to prepare them to be noble and firm in their trials. For they were not merely afflicted, but so as also to have become approved by their patience: yea rather, he says not by their patience, but what was more than patience, joy. And neither said he joy simply, but abundance of joy, for it sprang up in them, great and unspeakable.

3. And their deep poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.

Again, both these with excessiveness. For as their great affliction gave birth to great joy, yea, abundance of joy, so their great poverty gave birth to great riches of alms. For this he showed, saying, abounded unto the riches of their liberality. For munificence is determined not by the measure of what is given, but by the mind of those that bestow it.

Wherefore he nowhere says, 'the richness of the gifts,' but the riches of their liberality. Now what he says is to this effect; 'their poverty not only was no impediment to their being bountiful, but was even an occasion to them of abounding, just as affliction was of feeling joy. For the poorer they were, the more munificent they were and contributed the more readily.' Wherefore also he admires them exceedingly, for that in the midst of so great poverty they had displayed so great munificence. For their deep, that is, 'their great and unspeakable,' poverty, showed their liberality. But he said not 'showed,' but abounded; and he said not liberality, but riches of liberality; that is, an equipoise to the greatness of their poverty, or rather much outweighing it, was the bountifulness they displayed. Then he even explains this more clearly,

Having encouraged them with these encomiums, he again tries exhortation. For on this account he mingled these praises with his rebuke, that he might not by proceeding from rebuke to exhortation make what he had to say ill received; but having soothed their ears, might by this means pave the way for his exhortation. For he purposes to discourse of almsgiving; wherefore also he says beforehand, I rejoice that in everything I am of good courage concerning you; by their past good works, making them the more ready to this duty also. And he said not at once, 'Therefore give alms,' but observe his wisdom, how he draws from a distance and from on high the preparation for his discourse. For he says, I make known to you the grace of God which has been given in the Churches of Macedonia. For that they might not be uplifted he calls what they did grace; and while relating what others did he works greater zeal in them by his encomiums on others. And he mentions together two praises of the Macedonians, or rather three; namely, that they bear trials nobly; and that they know how to pity; and that, though poor, they had displayed profuseness in almsgiving, for their property had been also plundered. And when he wrote his Epistle to them, it was as signifying this that he said, For you became imitators of the Churches of God which are in Jud√¶a, for you also suffered the same things of your own countrymen, even as they did of the Jews. 1 Thessalonians 2:14 Hear what he said afterwards in writing to the Hebrews, For you took joyfully the spoiling of your possessions. Hebrews 10:34 But He calls what they did grace, not in order to keep them humble merely; but both to provoke them to emulation and to prevent what he said from proving invidious. Wherefore he also added the name of brethren so as to undermine all envious feeling; for he is about to praise them in high-flown terms. Listen, at least, to his praises. For having said, I make known to you the grace of God, he said not 'which has been given in this or that city,' but praises the entire nation, saying, in the Churches of Macedonia. Then he details also this same grace.
