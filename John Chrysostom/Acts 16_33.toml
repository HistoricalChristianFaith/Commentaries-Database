Let us remember the jailer throughout, not the miracle. What do the Gentiles say? How did he, a prisoner, persuade his jailer? And the man who had to be persuaded, what was he but defiled, wretched, of no understanding, full of ten thousand ills and easily led? Still more, the Gentiles claim this as well. For who, except a tanner, a seller of purple, a eunuch, a jailer, slaves and women, believed? What will they be able to say when we produce also men of rank and station, the centurion, the proconsul, those from that time to the present, the rulers themselves, the emperors? But for my part, I speak of something else, something greater than this. Let us take a look at these lowly people. “And what is the wonder?” you ask. It is this. For if someone is persuaded of any old thing, it is no wonder. But when he speaks to lowly people about resurrection, about the kingdom of heaven and about a life of devotion, and he persuades them, it is more wonderful than if he persuades wise people. For if there is no danger and someone persuades them, it is justifiable to point to a lack of understanding. But when he speaks to the slave, “If you are persuaded by me, you do so at your own peril. You will have all people for enemies; you must die and suffer ten thousand wrongs,” if even so he wins that person’s soul, it is no longer due to a lack of understanding. For if the doctrines had contained pleasure, it would be possible to say so. But if, what the philosophers would not have chosen to learn, this the slave learns, greater is the wonder. If you please, let us bring before us the tanner himself and review the words Peter spoke to him. Or, if you would rather, let us look at this jailer. What did Paul say to him? “Christ is risen,” “there is a resurrection of the dead,” “there is a kingdom.” And he easily persuaded one who was easily led. What then? Did he speak nothing of life, that he must be temperate, that he must be superior to money, that he must not be cruel, that he must give his goods to others? Indeed, being persuaded of these things was not indicative of a deficit in understanding but of a truly great soul. Let it be that, as far as the doctrines are concerned, it is because of their lack of understanding that they are more apt to accept them. But to accept such a life of true devotion, what sort of a deficit in understanding is that?
