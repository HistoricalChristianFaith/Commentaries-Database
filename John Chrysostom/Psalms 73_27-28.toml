Indeed, when we are abandoned by God, we are given over to the devil. When we have been given over to the devil, we are afflicted with countless terrible consequences. Well, then, in order to frighten his hearers the sacred writer said, “He has hardened” and “He has given up.” Listen to what he was really saying, when he said that he himself not only does not give us up but does not abandon us, either, unless we wish it: “Have not your iniquities caused a division between me and you?” And again, “They who withdraw from you perish.” Furthermore, Hosea declared, “You have forgotten the law of your God; I also will forget you.” And he himself said in the Gospels, “How often would I have gathered your children together, but you would not!” Isaiah, also, in another place said, “I came, and there was no one: I called, and there was no one that would hear.”
