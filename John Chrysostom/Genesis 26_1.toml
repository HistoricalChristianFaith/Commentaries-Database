In case you might think he was talking about that previous famine, accordingly he added, “besides the famine in the patriarch’s time,” that is to say, another similar famine beset the land in Isaac’s time as in his father’s time. The scarcity of the necessities of life threw everyone into great apprehension, compelled them to leave their own home and travel to those places where it was possible to find an abundance of resources.Hence this good man too, on seeing the famine, “took the journey,” the text says, “to visit Abimelech in Gerar.” This was where Abraham came too, you remember, after his return from Egypt.
