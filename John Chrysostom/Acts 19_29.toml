"And cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. And the whole city was filled with confusion: and rushed with one accord into the theatre." Such is the way with vulgar minds, any trivial occasion shall hurry them away and inflame their passions. Therefore it behooves to do things with strict examination. But see how contemptible they were, to be so exposed to all excitements! "Having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul's companions in travel, they dragged them:" here again recklessly, just as did the Jews in the case of Jason; and everywhere they set upon them.
