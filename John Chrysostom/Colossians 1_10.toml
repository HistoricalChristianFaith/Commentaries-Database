Here he speaks of life and its works, for so he does also everywhere: with faith Paul always couples conductâ€¦. Summarily, Paul states, we pray that you may lead a life of virtue, worthy of your citizenship, and may stand firmly, being strengthened as it is reasonable to be strengthened by God. For this reason Paul does not yet focus upon doctrines, but dwells upon life.
