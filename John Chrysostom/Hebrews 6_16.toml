Well, who then is He that swore unto Abraham? Is it not the Son? No, one says. Certainly indeed it was He: however, I shall not dispute [thereon]. So when He [the Son] swears the same oath, Verily, verily, I say unto you, is it not plain that it was because He could not swear by any greater? For as the Father swore, so also the Son swears by Himself, saying, Verily, verily, I say unto you. He here reminds them also of the oaths of Christ, which He was constantly uttering. Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that believes in Me shall never die. John 11:26
