Then also another consolation. "And when they had appointed for them elders in every Church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed." Do you mark Paul's ardor?-Then other consolation: "Commended them," it says, "to the Lord."

"And when they had appointed for them," etc. Again the ordinations accompanied with fastings: and again fasting, that purifying of our souls. "And having prayed," it says, "with fastings, they commended them unto the Lord:" they taught them to fast also in their trials. Why did they not make elders in Cyprus nor in Samaria? Because the latter was near to Jerusalem, the former to Antioch, and the word was strong there; whereas in those parts they needed much consolation, especially they of the Gentiles, who behooved to have much instruction.
