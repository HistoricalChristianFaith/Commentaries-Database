Again, as if to remind his betrayer, Jesus alludes to his burial. But the reproof does not reach him, nor does the expression soften him, although it should have been sufficient to inspire him with pity—almost as if Jesus had said, “I am a burden, and I know I cause a lot of trouble for you, but wait a little while, and I will leave.”
