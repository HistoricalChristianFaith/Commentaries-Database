"Then Returned They," it is said: namely, when they had heard. For they could not have borne it, if the angel had not referred them to another Coming. It seems to me, that it was also on a sabbath-day that these things took place; for he would not thus have specified the distance, saying, "from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day's journey," unless they were then going on the sabbath-day a certain definite distance.

So that there was no long way to go, to be a cause of alarm to them while yet trembling and fearful.
