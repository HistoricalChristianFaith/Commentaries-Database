What happened once in the case of Moses happens continually in the case of the law. What is said is not an accusation of the law, nor does it reflect on Moses, who veiled himself, but only on the narrow Jewish legalists. For the law has its proper glory, but they were unable to see it. Why should we be surprised that the Jews do not believe in Christ, since they did not believe in the law either?
