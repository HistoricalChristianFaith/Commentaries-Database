(Hom. lxxxi) Having said, I have finished My work, He shows what kind of work it was, viz. that He should make known the name of God: I have manifested Thy name unto the men which Thou gavest Me out of the world.

(Hom. lxxxi) That He was the Son of the Father, Christ had already manifested to them by words and deeds.

(Hom. lxxxi) And whence have they learned? From My words, wherein I taught them that I came forth from Thee. For this was what He has been labouring to show throughout the whole of the Gospel: For I have given unto them the words which Thou gavest Me, and they have received them.
