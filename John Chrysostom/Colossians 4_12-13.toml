"Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, salutes you, always striving for you in his prayers, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. For I bear him witness, that he has much zeal  for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis."

In the commencement of this Epistle also, he commended this man for his love; for even to praise is a sign of love; thus in the beginning he said, "Who also declared unto us your love in the Spirit." [Colossians 1:8] To pray for one is also a sign of love, and causes love again. He commends him moreover in order to open a door to his teachings, for reverendness in the teacher is the disciples' advantage; and so again is his saying,  "one of you," in order that they might pride themselves upon the man, as producing such men. And he says, "always striving for you in prayers." He said not simply "praying," but "striving," trembling and fearing. "For I bear him witness," he says, "that he has much zeal for you." A trustworthy witness. "That he has," he says, "much zeal for you," that is, that he loves you exceedingly; and burns with passionate affection for you. "And them in Laodicea, and them in Hierapolis." He commends him to those also. But whence were they to know this? They would assuredly have heard; however, they would also learn it when the Epistle was read. For he said, "Cause that it be read also in the church of the Laodiceans." "That ye may stand perfect," he says. At once he both accuses them, and without offensiveness gives them advice and counsel. For it is possible both to be perfect, and withal not to stand, as if one were to know all, and still be wavering; it is possible also not to be perfect, and yet to stand, as if one were to know a part, and stand [not ] firmly. But this man prays for both: "That ye may stand perfect," he says. See how again he has reminded them of what he said about the Angels, and about life. "And fully assured," he says, "in all the will of God." It is not enough, simply to do His will. He that is "filled," suffers not any other will to be within him, for if so, he is not wholly filled. "For I bear him witness," he says, "that he has much zeal." Both "zeal," and "great"; both are intensitive. As he says himself, when writing to the Corinthians, "For I am jealous  over you with a godly jealousy." [2 Corinthians 11:2]
