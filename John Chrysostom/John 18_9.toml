(Hom. lxxxiii) The Evangelist, to show that it was not their design to do this, but that His power did it, adds, That the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of them which Thou hast given Me, have I lost none. He had said this with reference not to temporal, but to eternal death: the Evangelist however understands the word of temporal death also.

"That the saying might be fulfilled which He spake, Of those which Thou gavest Me have I lost none." By "loss" He doth not here mean that which is of death, but that which is eternal; though the Evangelist in the present case includes the former also.
