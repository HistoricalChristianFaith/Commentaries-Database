Jeremiah, having borne many temptations, gave in on these, and when he was rebuked, said, “I will not prophesy, neither will I name the name of the Lord.” And David, too, in many places complains of rebuke. Isaiah also, after many things, admonishes concerning this, saying, “Do not fear the reproach of people, neither be overcome by their reviling.” And again, Christ also to his disciples: “When they shall speak all manner of evil against you falsely, rejoice and be exceeding glad, for great is your reward in heaven.”
