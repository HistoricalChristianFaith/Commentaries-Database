For when a man is neither to be softened by goodness nor to be turned back by fear, what can be harder than such an one? For after that he had showed the goodness of God towards men, he then shows His vengeance that it is unbearable for him who does not even so return to repentance. And observe with what propriety he uses the words! "You treasure up unto yourself wrath," he says, so making it plain what is certainly laid up, and showing that it is not He that judges, but he that is condemned, who is the author of this. For he says, "you store up for yourself," not God for you. For He did all, whatsoever things were fitting, and created you with a power to discern between good and what was not so, and showed long-suffering over you, and called you to repentance, and threatened a fearful day, so by every means drawing you to repentance. But if you should continue unyielding, "you store up unto yourself wrath against the day of wrath and revelation and (so all manuscripts but two) the righteous judgment of God." For lest on hearing of wrath you should think of any passion, he adds, "the righteous judgment of God." And he said "revelation" with good reason, for then is this revealed when each man receives his desert. For here many men often annoy and practise harm to one without justice. But hereafter it is not so.

When a man is neither softened by goodness nor turned back by fear, what can be harder than he is?… The true originator of wrath is the one who has stored it up, not the one who judged, as Paul makes plain. For he says “you are storing up wrath for yourself,” not “God is storing up wrath for you.”
