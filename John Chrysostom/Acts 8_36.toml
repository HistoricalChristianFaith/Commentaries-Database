Again, of his own accord he requests, saying, What does hinder me to be baptized? And see again his modesty: he does not say, Baptize me, neither does he hold his peace; but he utters somewhat midway between strong desire and reverent fear, saying, What does hinder me? Do you observe that he has the doctrines (of faith) perfect? For indeed the Prophet had the whole, Incarnation, Passion, Resurrection, Ascension, Judgment to come. And if he shows exceeding earnestness of desire, do not marvel. Be ashamed, all you as many as are unbaptized. And, it says, he commanded the chariot to stand still.

Mark the eager desire, mark the exact knowledge. And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him. And when they had come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more: and he went on his way rejoicing. (v. 38, 39.) But why did the Spirit of the Lord bear him away? (Hereby) the occurrence was shown to be more wonderful. Even then, the eunuch did not know him. Consequently this was done, that Philip might afterwards be a subject of wonder to him. For, it says, he went on his way rejoicing. But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached in all the cities, till he came to Cæsarea.

And notice again his modesty. He does not say, “Baptize me,” or keep quiet, but he utters something halfway between eagerness and reverent fear, saying, “What is to prevent me?” Do you see that he has learned the doctrines [of faith] perfectly? For the prophet indeed had the entirety: incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension, judgment to come. If he shows great eagerness, do not wonder. Be ashamed, those of you who are unbaptized! “And he commanded the chariot to stop.” He spoke and gave the order before he heard [Philip’s answer]. “And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip.” This was to show that what had happened was divine, that he should not think that it was only a man.
