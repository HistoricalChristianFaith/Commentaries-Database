And notice again his modesty. He does not say, “Baptize me,” or keep quiet, but he utters something halfway between eagerness and reverent fear, saying, “What is to prevent me?” Do you see that he has learned the doctrines [of faith] perfectly? For the prophet indeed had the entirety: incarnation, passion, resurrection, ascension, judgment to come. If he shows great eagerness, do not wonder. Be ashamed, those of you who are unbaptized! “And he commanded the chariot to stop.” He spoke and gave the order before he heard [Philip’s answer]. “And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip.” This was to show that what had happened was divine, that he should not think that it was only a man.
