You see Job taking refuge again in his nature, because it is impossible, he says, to be pure. [He implores God] not only because of our weakness or our ephemeral nature or the disheartening that fills our life, but because it is also impossible to be pure. “Stay away from me, so that I may be peaceful and satisfied about my life like a laborer.” Job expresses again the ephemeral, miserable and unhappy character of life. “And since I am overwhelmed and unhappy, I ask only to be left in peace.” Then Job demonstrates that human beings are the unhappiest of all, more than trees, rivers and the sea.
