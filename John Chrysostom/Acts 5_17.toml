Look how their life is woven. First there was dejection because Christ was taken from them; then came joy through the descent of the Spirit; then dejection again because of the scoffers; then joy because of the believers and the sign; then dejection again because of the imprisonment, followed by joy in the result of their defense. And here again both dejection and joy: joy because they were well-known and God made revelations to them, dejection because they made away with some of them. Again, joy from their success and dejection because of the high priest. And the same pattern could be seen throughout.
