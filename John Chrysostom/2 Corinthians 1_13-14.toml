"For we write none other things unto you, than what ye read or even acknowledge."

For since he spoke great things of himself and seemed to be bearing witness to himself, an odious thing, he again appeals to them as witnesses of what he says. For, he saith, let no one think that what I say is a boastful flourish of writing; for we declare unto you what yourselves know; and that we lie not ye more than all others can bear us witness. For, when ye read, ye acknowledge that what ye know that we perform in our actions, this we say also in our writings, and your testimony doth not contradict our epistles; but the knowledge which ye had before of us is in harmony with your reading.

"As also ye did acknowledge us in part."

For your knowledge of us, he saith, is not from hearsay but from actual experience. The words "in part" he added from humility. For this is his wont, when necessity constraineth him to say any high-sounding thing, (for he never doth so otherwise,) as desiring quickly to repress again the elation arising from what he had said.

"And I hope ye will acknowledge even to the end."

Seest thou again how from the past he draws pledges for the future; and not from the past only, but also from the power of God? For he affirmed not absolutely, but cast the whole upon God and his hope in Him.

"That we are your glorying, even as ye also are ours, in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ."

Here he cuts at the root of the envy that his speech might occasion, by making them sharers and partners in the glory of his good works. "For these stick not with us, but pass over unto you also, and again from you to us." For seeing he had extolled himself, and produced proof of the past and given security for the future; lest his hearers should reflect on him for talking proudly, or be hurried to enviousness, he makes the rejoicing a common one and declares that this crown of praises is theirs.
