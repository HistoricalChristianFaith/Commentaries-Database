Now this, He ascended, what is it but that He also descended?

This strikes at Paul of Samosata and his school.
He that descended, is the same also that ascended far above all the Heavens, that He might fill all things.

He descended, says he, into the lower parts of the earth, beyond which there are none other: and He ascended up far above all things, to that place, beyond which there is none other. This is to show His divine energy, and supreme dominion. For indeed even of old had all things been filled.
