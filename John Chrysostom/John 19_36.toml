For even if this was said with reference to the lamb of the Jews, still it was for the sake of the reality that the type preceded and was fulfilled in this event. On this account the Evangelist brought forward the prophet. For John would have cast doubt on himself if he continually produced only himself as a witness. Therefore, he brings Moses to help him and says that this did not happen without purpose but was written about long ago. And this is the meaning of the words “a bone of him shall not be broken.” Again he confirms the prophet’s words by his own witness. These things, he says, I have told you so that you might learn the close relationship between the type and its reality. He goes to great lengths to create faith in what might otherwise be a matter of reproach and shame.… Let no one then be unbelieving, [John is saying], or through shame do injury to our cause. For the things that appear to be most shameful are the very venerable records42 of our good things.
