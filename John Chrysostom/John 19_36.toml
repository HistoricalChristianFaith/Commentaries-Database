For even if this was said with reference to the lamb of the Jews, still it was for the sake of the reality that the type preceded, and in Him the prophecy was more fully accomplished. On this account the Evangelist brought forward the Prophet. For since by continually producing himself as witness he would have seemed unworthy of credit, he brings Moses to help him, and says, that neither did this come to pass without a purpose, but was written before of old. And this is the meaning of the words, A bone of Him shall not be broken. Again he confirms the Prophet's words by his own witness. These things, says he, I have told you, that you might learn that great is the connection of the type with the reality. Do you see what pains he takes to make that believed which seemed to be matter of reproach, and bringing shame? For that the soldier should insult even the dead body, was far worse than being crucified. But still, even these things, he says, I have told, and told with much earnestness, 'that you might believe.' John 19:35 Let none then be unbelieving, nor through shame injure our cause. For the things which appear to be most shameful, are the very venerable records  of our good things.
