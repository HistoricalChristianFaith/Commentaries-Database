3. Then again [he argues] from the general custom. Do you see how he brings up arguments from all quarters, from facts in the Scripture, from its words, from our own notions, from examples in ordinary life? [Hebrews 12:8] "But if you be without chastisement" [&c.]. Do you see that he said what I just mentioned, that it is not possible to be a son without being chastened? For as in families, fathers care not for bastards, though they learn nothing, though they be not distinguished, but fear for their legitimate sons lest they should be indolent, [so here.]. If then not to be chastised is [a mark] of bastards, we ought to rejoice at chastisement, if this be [a sign] of legitimacy. "God deals with you as with sons"; for this very cause.
