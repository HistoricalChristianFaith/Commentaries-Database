Then again he argues from the general custom. Seest thou how he brings up arguments from all quarters, from facts in the Scripture, from its words, from our own notions, from examples in ordinary life? "But if ye be without chastisement" and so on. Seest thou that he said what I just mentioned, that it is not possible to be a son without being chastened? For as in families, fathers care not for bastards, though they learn nothing, though they be not distinguished, but fear for their legitimate sons lest they should be indolent, so here. If then not to be chastised is a mark of bastards, we ought to rejoice at chastisement, if this be a sign of legitimacy. "God dealeth with you as with sons"; for this very cause.
