It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory, [for] I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord.

What is this? Does he who has spoken such great things say, [It is not expedient] "doubtless to glory?" as if he had said nothing? No; not as if he had said nothing: but because he is going to pass to another species of boasting, which is not intended indeed by so great a reward, but which to the many (though not to careful examiners) seems to set him off in brighter colors , he says, "It is not expedient for me doubtless to glory."
