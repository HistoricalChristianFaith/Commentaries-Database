Again he discourses simply as man, and he does not on all occasions alike enjoy the benefit of supernatural aid. I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee: both in this, and in what comes after it, he wished to divide the multitude, which had an evil unanimity against him. And he does not speak a falsehood here either: for he was a Pharisee by descent from his ancestors. Of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question. For since they would not say for what reason they arraigned him, he is compelled therefore to declare it himself. But the Pharisees, it says, confess both. And yet there are three things: how then does he say both? Spirit and Angel is put as one. When he is on their side, then they plead for him. And there arose a great cry: and the scribes that were of the Pharisees' part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man: but (what) if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel?

The Sadducees know of nothing incorporeal, perhaps not even God, so thick-headed are they. Consequently, they are also unwilling to believe that there is a resurrection.
