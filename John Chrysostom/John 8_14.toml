What He had before said,  these men bring forward as if it had been specially  asserted. What then does Christ? To refute this, and to show that He used those expressions as suitable to them and to their suspicions, who supposed Him to be a mere man, He says, Though I bear record of Myself, My record is true, for I know whence I come. What is this? I am of God, am God, the Son of God, and God Himself is a faithful witness unto Himself, but you know Him not; ye willingly err,  knowing ye pretend not to know, but say all that you say according to mere human imagination, choosing to understand nothing beyond what is seen.
