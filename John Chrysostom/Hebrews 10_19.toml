Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which He has consecrated for us. Having shown the difference of the High Priest, and of the sacrifices, and of the tabernacle, and of the Covenant, and of the promise, and that the difference is great, since those are temporal, but these eternal, those near to vanishing away, these permanent, those powerless, these perfect, those figures, these reality, for (he says) not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life. Hebrews 7:16 And You are a Priest for ever. Hebrews 5:6 Behold the continuance of the Priest. And concerning the Covenant, That (he says) is old (for that which decays and waxes old is ready to vanish away Hebrews 8:13), but this is new; and has remission of sins, while that [has] nothing of the kind: for (he says) the Law made nothing perfect. Hebrews 7:19 And again, sacrifice and offering You would not. Hebrews 10:5 That is made with hands, while this is not made with hands Hebrews 9:11: that has the blood of goats Hebrews 9:12, this of the Lord; that has the Priest standing, this sitting. Since therefore all those are inferior and these greater, therefore he says, Having therefore, brethren, boldness.

Boldness: from whence? As sins (he means) produce shame, so the having all things forgiven us, and being made fellow-heirs, and enjoying so great Love, [produces] boldness.

For the entrance into the holiest. What does he mean here by entrance? Heaven, and the access to spiritual things.

Which he has inaugurated, that is, which He prepared, and which He began; for the beginning of using is thenceforth called the inaugurating; which He prepared (he means) and by which He Himself passed.
