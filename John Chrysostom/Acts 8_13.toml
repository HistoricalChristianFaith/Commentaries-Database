How did he come to baptize also Simon? In the same way that Christ also chose Judas. And “seeing” the “signs” that [Philip] worked, since the others did not receive the signs, [Simon] dared not ask for it. How was it then that they did not put him to death, as they did Ananias and Sapphira? The ancient saying is that he who gathered sticks was put to death as a warning to others. No one else suffered this same fate.
