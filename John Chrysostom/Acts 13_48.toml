"And hearing this the Gentiles" - this, while it was more cheering to them, seeing the case was this, that whereas those were of right to hear first, they themselves enjoy the blessing, was at the same time more stinging to those - "and the Gentiles," it says, "hearing this were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and believed, as many as were ordained unto eternal life": i.e., set apart for God. Observe how he shows the speediness of the benefit.

"As many as were ordained unto eternal life": this is also a proof, that their having received these Gentiles was agreeable with the mind of God. But "ordained," not in regard of necessity: "whom He foreknew," saith the Apostle, "He did predestinate."
