The soldiers parted the garments but not the coat. See how the prophecies in every instance are fulfilled by their wickedness. This also had been predicted of old. And yet, there were three crucified, but the matters of the prophecies were fulfilled only in Christ. For why didn’t they do this in the case of the others also? Consider too, I pray you, the exactness of the prophecy. For the prophet says not only that they “parted” but that they “did not part.” The rest therefore they divided, the coat they did not divide, but instead they committed the matter to a decision by lot. And “woven from the top” is not mentioned without purpose. Some say that a figurative assertion is declared by it: that the Crucified was not simply man but had also the divinity from above. Others say that the Evangelist describes the very form of the coat. For since in Palestine they put together two strips of cloth and so weave their garments, John, to show that the coat was of this kind, says “woven from the top.” And to me he seems to say this, alluding to the poorness of the garments, and that as in all other things, so in dress also, he followed a simple fashion.
