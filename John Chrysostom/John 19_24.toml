But He on the Cross, commits His mother to the disciple,  teaching us even to our last breath to show every care for our parents. When indeed she unseasonably troubled Him, He said, Woman, what have I to do with you? John 2:4 And, Who is My mother? Matthew 12:48 But here He shows much loving affection, and commits her to the disciple whom He loved. Again John conceals himself, in modesty; for had he desired to boast, he would have also put in the cause for which he was loved, since probably it was some great and wonderful one. But wherefore does He converse on nothing else with John, nor comfort him when desponding? Because it was no time for comforting by words; besides, it was no little thing for him to be honored with such honor, and to receive the reward of steadfastness. But do thou consider, I pray, how even on the cross He did everything without being troubled, speaking with the disciple concerning His mother, fulfilling -->prophecies-->, holding forth good hopes to the thief. Yet before He was crucified He appears sweating, agonized, fearing. &nbsp;What then can this mean? Nothing difficult, nothing doubtful. There indeed the weakness of nature had been shown, here was being shown the excess of Power. Besides, by these two things He teaches us, even if before things terrible we be troubled, not on that account to shrink from things terrible, but when we have embarked in the contest to deem all things  possible and easy. Let us then not tremble at death. Our soul has by nature the love of life, but it lies with us either to loose the bands of nature, and make this desire weak; or else to tighten them, and make the desire more tyrannous. For as we have the desire of sexual intercourse, but when we practice true wisdom we render the desire weak, so also it falls out in the case of life; and as God has annexed carnal desire to the generation of children, to maintain a succession among us, without however forbidding us from traveling the higher road of continence; so also He has implanted in us the love of life, forbidding us from destroying ourselves, but not hindering our despising the present life. And it behooves us, knowing this, to observe due measure, and neither to go at any time to death of our own accord, even though ten thousand terrible things possess us; nor yet when dragged to it, for the sake of what is pleasing to God, to shrink back from and fear it, but boldly to strip for it, preferring the future to the present life.

But the women stood by the Cross, and the weaker sex then appeared the manlier John 19:25; so entirely henceforth were all things transformed.

The soldiers parted the garments but not the coat. See how the prophecies in every instance are fulfilled by their wickedness. This also had been predicted of old. And yet, there were three crucified, but the matters of the prophecies were fulfilled only in Christ. For why didn’t they do this in the case of the others also? Consider too, I pray you, the exactness of the prophecy. For the prophet says not only that they “parted” but that they “did not part.” The rest therefore they divided, the coat they did not divide, but instead they committed the matter to a decision by lot. And “woven from the top” is not mentioned without purpose. Some say that a figurative assertion is declared by it: that the Crucified was not simply man but had also the divinity from above. Others say that the Evangelist describes the very form of the coat. For since in Palestine they put together two strips of cloth and so weave their garments, John, to show that the coat was of this kind, says “woven from the top.” And to me he seems to say this, alluding to the poorness of the garments, and that as in all other things, so in dress also, he followed a simple fashion.
