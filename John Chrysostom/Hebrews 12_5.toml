And you have forgotten the exhortation. That is, And you have slackened your hands, you have become faint. You have not yet, he said, resisted unto blood, striving against sin. Here he indicates that sin is both very vigorous, and is itself armed. For the [expression] You have resisted [stood firm against], is used with reference to those who stand firm.

Which (he says) speaks unto you as unto sons, My son, despise not thou the chastening of the Lord, nor faint when you are rebuked of Him. He has drawn his encouragement from the facts themselves; over and above he adds also that which is drawn from arguments, from this testimony.

Faint not (he says) when you are rebuked of Him. It follows that these things are of God. For this too is no small matter of consolation, when we learn that it is God's work that such things have power, He allowing [them]; even as also Paul says; He said unto me, My grace is sufficient for you: for My strength is made perfect in weakness. 2 Corinthians 12:9 He it is who allows [them].
