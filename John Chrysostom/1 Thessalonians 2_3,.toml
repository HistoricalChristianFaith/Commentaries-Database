For Paul’s work found its source in power, mighty power, power that surpassed mere human diligence. For Paul brought three qualifications to the preaching of the word: a fervent and adventurous zeal, a soul ready to undergo any possible hardship and the combination of knowledge and wisdom. Even with Paul’s love of the difficult task, his blameless life would have accomplished little had he not also received the power of the Spirit. Examine the matter from Paul’s own words: “That our ministry not be blamed.” And again, “For our exhortation is not founded on error, nor uncleanness, nor guile nor hidden under a cloke of covetousness.” Thus you have seen his blamelessness. And again, “For we aim at what is honorable, not only in the sight of the Lord but also in the sight of men.” … Without this, Paul’s work would have been impossible. People were not converted because of Paul’s miracles; no, it was not the miracles that produced faith, nor did Paul base his high calling upon the miraculous but upon other grounds: a man must be irreproachable in conduct, prudent and discreet in his dealings with others, regardless of the dangers involved, and apt to teach. These were the qualifications that enabled Paul to reach his goal.
