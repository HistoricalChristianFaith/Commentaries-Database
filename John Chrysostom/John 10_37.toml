Do you see how He proves what I said, that He is in nothing inferior to the Father, but in every way equal to Him? For since it was impossible to see His Essence, from the equality and sameness of the works He affords a proof of unvaryingness as to Power. And what, tell me, shall we believe?

3. That I am in the Father, and the Father in Me. 

For I am nothing other than what the Father is, yet still Son; He nothing other than what I am, yet still Father. And if any man know Me, he knows the Father, and if he knows the Father,  he has learned also the Son. Now were the power inferior, then also what relates to the knowledge would be false, for it is not possible to become acquainted with one substance or power by means of another.

We should consider this as a speech of humility made to conciliate people. But afterwards he leads them to higher things: “If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.” … See how he proves that he is not inferior to the Father. Since they could not see his substance, he directs them to his works, as being similar and equal to the Father’s. The equality of their works proved the equality of their power.
