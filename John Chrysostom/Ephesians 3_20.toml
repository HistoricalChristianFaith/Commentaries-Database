That God has done "abundantly above all that we ask or think," is evident from what the Apostle himself has written. For I indeed, says he, pray, but He of Himself, even without any prayer of mine, will do works greater than all we ask, not simply "greater," nor "abundantly greater," but "exceeding abundantly." And this is evident from "the power, that works in us:" for neither did we ever ask these things, nor did we expect them.
