This course is at least preferable to the other. They ought indeed to be concerned for the things of God, they ought to preserve their faith. But since they do not this, it is better to avoid a worse course. God is not dishonored by their marrying again, and they do not fall into those practices, which have been censured. From such a widowhood, no good could arise, but good may come out of this marriage. Hence the women will be able to correct that indolence and vanity of mind.

It is likely that many widows at that time had lived more recklessly and arrogantly after the death of their husbands, as if freed from some constraining tyranny of their husbands over them; and so some earn a bad reputation for themselves because of their audacity. Drawing them away from this ruinous freedom, Paul leads them back to their former yoke. He says that if a widow intends to secretly cheapen and dishonor herself, it is much better to marry and “give our enemies no occasion to speak ill of us.” Thus, because he did not want to furnish opportunities for rebuke or want the widow to live the wanton life of a harlot, he permitted second marriages.
