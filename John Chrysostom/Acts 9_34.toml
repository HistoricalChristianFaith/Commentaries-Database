But before discourse, before exhortations, he says to the lame man himself, Jesus Christ makes you whole. This word he believed in any wise, and was made whole. Observe how unassuming he is: for he said not, In the Name, but rather as a sign he narrates the miracle itself, and speaks as its Evangelist. And having seen him, it says, all that dwelt in Lydda, and Saron, turned unto the Lord.â€” Now there was at Joppa, etc.

And why did he not wait for the man's faith, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.
