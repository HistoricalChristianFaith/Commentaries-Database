But before discourse, before exhortations, he says to the lame man himself, Jesus Christ makes you whole. This word he believed in any wise, and was made whole. Observe how unassuming he is: for he said not, In the Name, but rather as a sign he narrates the miracle itself, and speaks as its Evangelist. And having seen him, it says, all that dwelt in Lydda, and Saron, turned unto the Lord.— Now there was at Joppa, etc.

And why did he not wait for the man's faith, and ask if he wished to be healed? In the first place, the miracle served for exhortation to many: hear then how great the gain. And all that dwelt at Lydda and Saron saw him, and turned to the Lord.

Peter does well to give a proof of the miracle. For they not only released people from their diseases but also provided health, as well as strength. Moreover, at that time they had not yet offered proof of their own power, and so it was unreasonable to demand faith from the man (nor had they done so in the earlier case of the lame man). Therefore, just as Christ in the beginning of his miracles did not demand faith, neither did these. For it was in Jerusalem, naturally, that their faith was first shown, “at least the shadow of Peter,” it says, “might fall across some of them as he went past.” Many miracles had been performed there, but here in Lydda and Sharon this is the first. For some of the miracles were performed to draw people to faith, and others to comfort the believers.
