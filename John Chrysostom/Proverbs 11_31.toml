“If the righteous are saved with difficulty, where will the impious and sinners appear?” Consider that life is long, a lasting residence with many dangers. And he [Solomon] does not say these words about those who lived righteously. But if by any chance he said something about them, he would speak in the best of terms. Indeed if God has bestowed something upon us, what we have done with it will be examined, and who will be justified except the one who is purer than the sun? By “righteous” he [Solomon] means the one who organizes his life in righteousness. The one who hates God is “impious.” The “sinner” is the one who acts wickedly.
