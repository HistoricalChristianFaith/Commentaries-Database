(Hom. 82. in Matt.) Now He said not, 'I have granted,' but I have prayed. For He speaks humbly as approaching unto His Passion, and that He may manifest His human nature. For He who had spoken not in supplication, but by authority, Upon this rock I will build my Church, and I will give thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven, (Matt. 16:18.) how should He have need of prayer that He might stay one agitated soul? He does not say, "I have prayed that thou deny not," but that thou do not abandon thy faith.
