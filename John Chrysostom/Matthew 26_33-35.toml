Peter then spoke confidently and lifted himself up over the rest, saying, “Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away.” It may be that in some degree his bravado sprang from jealousy. For at supper they were all talking about which one of them was the greater. This passion for recognition was still troubling them. Therefore Jesus resisted Peter, not compelling him to a future denial—God forbid! But he left him destitute of his help, convicting human nature.
