Hear, at least, what God says to the Jews, “As my child Isaiah walked, naked and barefoot, so shall the children of Israel walk into captivity naked and barefoot.” He wishes, therefore, to remind you by your appearance that the devil held sway over you, and he brings you to the recollection of how lowly born you were before regeneration. Hence, you stand not only naked and unshod, but you even stand with upturned hands to confess God’s future sovereignty to which you draw near. You are all the spoils and booty of war. Isaiah mentioned these spoils long ago, before our release from troubles, when he prophesied as follows, “He shall divide the spoils of the strong.”
