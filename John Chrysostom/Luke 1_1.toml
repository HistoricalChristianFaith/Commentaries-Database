The Evangelist was so far from being content with his single testimony, that he refers the whole to the Apostles, seeking from them a confirmation of his words; and therefore he adds, as they handed them down to us, who were themselves from the beginning eyewitnesses.
He says, were eyewitnesses, because this is our chief ground for believing in a thing, that we derive it from those who were actually eyewitnesses.
Or it may be, &#8220;That you might feel certain and satisfied as to the truth of those things which you have heard, now that you behold the same in writing.&#8221;
