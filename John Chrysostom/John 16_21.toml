And He has used a comparison which the Prophets also use continually, likening despondencies to the exceeding pains of childbirth. But what He says is of this kind: Travail pains shall lay hold on you, but the pang of childbirth is the cause of joy; both confirming His words relative to the Resurrection, and showing that the departing hence is like passing from the womb into the light of day. As though He had said, Marvel not that I bring you to your advantage through such sorrow, since even a mother to become a mother, passes in like manner through pain. Here also He implies something mystical, that He has loosened the travail pangs of death, and caused a new man to be born of them.  And He said not, that the pain shall pass away only, but, she does not even remember it, so great is the joy which succeeds; so also shall it be with the Saints. And yet the woman does not rejoice because a man has come into the world, but because a son has been born to her; since, had this been the case, nothing would have hindered the barren from rejoicing over another who bears.  Why then spoke He thus? Because He introduced this example for this purpose only, to show that sorrow is for a season, but joy lasting: and to show that (death) is a translation unto life; and to show the great profit of their pangs. He said not, a child has been born, but, A man. For to my mind He here alludes to His own Resurrection, and that He should be born not unto that death which bare the birth-pang, but unto the Kingdom. Therefore He said not, a child has been born unto her, but, A man has been born into the world.
