and observe, this is not abuse, but accusation: for so ought forward, impudent people to be rebuked thou enemy of all righteousness; here he lays bare what was in the thoughts of the man, while under pretext of saving he was ruining the proconsul: will you not cease, he says, to pervert the ways of the Lord? (He says it) both confidently (αξιοπίστως), It is not with us you are warring, nor are you fighting (with us), but the ways of the Lord you are perverting, and with praise (of these, he adds) the right ways. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind.

(full of all,) he says: nothing wanting to the full measure: and he well says, of all deceit, for the man was playing the part of a hypocrite.— Child of the devil, because he was doing his work: enemy of all righteousness, since this (which they preached) was the whole of righteousness (though at the same time): I suppose in these words he reproves his manner of life. His words were not prompted by anger, and to show this, the writer premises, filled with the Holy Ghost, that is, with His operation. And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon you.

Why didn’t Paul perform another miracle? Because there was none equal to this—the capture of the enemy. And notice how he first makes his indictment and shows that the man suffers justly by saying, “O full of all deceit.” Nothing [Paul] said was lacking, and he said it well. “Of all deceit,” because the man was playing the part of a hypocrite. “Son of the devil,” because he was doing his work. “Enemy of righteousness,” because this [which they preached] was the whole of righteousness. It seems to me that he is also reproving his manner of life. It was not out of anger that he spoke, and to show this, the writer begins with, “filled with the Holy Spirit,” that is, with his operation.“And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon you.” It was not vengeance, then, but healing. For it is as though he had said, “It is not I but the hand of God.” Look how unassuming it is! No “light,” as in the case of Paul, “shone round about him.” “Thou shall be blind,” he says, “not seeing the sun for a season,” so that he may give him a chance for repentance. Never did they wish to become conspicuous by their sternness, even in the case of enemies. But in respect to their own people, they were stern; in the case of others, no, lest [the obedience of faith] be thought a matter of compulsion and fear.
