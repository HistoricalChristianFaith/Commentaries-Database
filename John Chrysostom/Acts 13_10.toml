(He says it) both confidently (αξιοπίστως), It is not with us you are warring, nor are you fighting (with us), but the ways of the Lord you are perverting, and with praise (of these, he adds) the right ways. And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind.

(full of all,) he says: nothing wanting to the full measure: and he well says, of all deceit, for the man was playing the part of a hypocrite.— Child of the devil, because he was doing his work: enemy of all righteousness, since this (which they preached) was the whole of righteousness (though at the same time): I suppose in these words he reproves his manner of life. His words were not prompted by anger, and to show this, the writer premises, filled with the Holy Ghost, that is, with His operation. And now behold the hand of the Lord is upon you.
