Do you mark? Lest, having heard that saying, I go bound in the Spirit Acts 20:22, you should imagine it a matter of necessity, or that he fell into it ignorantly, therefore these things are foretold. But they wept, and he comforted them, grieving at their tears. For, what mean ye, he says, to weep and to break my heart? Nothing could be more affectionate: because he saw them weeping, he grieved, he that felt no pain at his own trials. For I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done. (v. 13, 14.) You do me wrong in doing this: for do I grieve? Then they ceased, when he said, to break my heart. I weep, he says, for you, not on account of my own sufferings: as for those (men), I am willing even to die for them. But let us look over again what has been said.
