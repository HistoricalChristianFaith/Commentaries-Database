But what is the meaning of “you have given him power over all flesh”? I will ask the heretics, “When did he receive this power? Was it before he formed them, or after?” He himself says that it was after he had been crucified and had risen again. At least it was then that he said, “All power is given unto me. Therefore go and make disciples of all nations.” What then? Didn’t he have authority over his own works? Did he make them and yet not have authority over them after having made them? Yet he is seen doing everything in times of old, punishing some as sinners … and honoring others as righteous. Is it that he had the power at that time but now had lost it, but was going to receive it again? What devil could assert this? But if his power was the same both then and now—for he says, “as the Father raises up the dead and gives them life, even so the Son gives life to whom he will”—what is the meaning of the words? The answer lies in the fact that he was about to send them to the Gentiles. In order therefore that they might not think that this was an innovation, because he had said, “I am not sent, except unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel,” he shows that this seemed good to the Father also.…But what does he mean by “of all flesh”? For certainly not all believed. Yet, as far as his mission was concerned, all could have believed. And if some did not listen to his words, the fault was not in the teacher but in those who did not receive his words.
