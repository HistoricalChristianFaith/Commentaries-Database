After this plucking up immediately the root of the evils, 1 Timothy 6:10

He said not, take them not with you, but, even if you can obtain them from another, flee the evil disease. And you see that hereby He was answering many good purposes; first setting His disciples above suspicion; secondly, freeing them from all care, so that they might give all their leisure to the word; thirdly, teaching them His own power. Of this accordingly He quite speaks out to them afterwards, Lacked ye anything, when I sent you naked and unshod?

He did not at once say, Provide not, but when He had said, Cleanse the lepers, cast out devils, then He said, Provide nothing; freely you have received, freely give; by His way of ordering things consulting at once for their interest, their credit, and their ability.
