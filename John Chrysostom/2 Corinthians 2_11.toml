Satan can destroy even under the show of piety. For he can destroy not only by leading into fornication but even by the opposite, the immoderate sorrow which can follow on repentance for it. To take us by sin is his proper work, but to ensnare us in our repentance is an even more subtle disgrace, because that is our weapon, not his.
