For indeed he has demonstrated boldness in the face of danger, sympathy with those over whom he ruled, teaching with boldness, humility and poverty. But this is even greater than poverty. For he says in the Gospel, “If you wish to be perfect, sell what you have.” But when, in addition to taking nothing, [Paul] also feeds others, what can equal this? The first step is to cast off one’s own possessions; the second, to be sufficient for oneself; the third, to provide for others as well; the fourth, for him who is preaching and therefore has a right to take or not to take. Therefore, Paul is far better than those who have merely given up their possessions.
