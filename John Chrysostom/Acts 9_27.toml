Barnabas was called “son of encouragement”; accordingly, he was accessible to Paul. His exceeding kindness is revealed both in the present instance and in the case of John (Mark). Why was Barnabas not afraid? (For Paul was a man whose very look inspired fear.) It is likely that Barnabas, also at Damascus, had heard all about him.
