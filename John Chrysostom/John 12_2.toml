“And Martha served” makes it clear that the meal was in her house, for they received Jesus as loving and beloved. Some, however, say that it took place in the house of another. Mary did not serve because she was a disciple. Here again she acted in the more spiritual manner. For she did not serve as though invited, nor did she offer her service to all alike. Rather she directed the honor to him alone and approached him not as a man but as God.

This was a proof of the genuineness of Lazarus’s resurrection, that after many days he both lived and ate.
