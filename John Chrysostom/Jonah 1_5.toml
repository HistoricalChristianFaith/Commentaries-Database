“They threw overboard the wares that were in the ship into the sea; but the ship was not getting any lighter,” because the entire cargo still remained within it, the body of the prophet, the heavy cargo, not according to the nature of the body but from the weight of sin. For nothing is so heavy and onerous to bear as sin and disobedience.
