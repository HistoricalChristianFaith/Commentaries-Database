John [the Evangelist] … joins his own testimony to that of the Baptist, for the expression “of his fullness have we all received” belongs not to the forerunner but to the disciple; and its meaning is something like this: Do not think, he says, that we, who accompanied him for so long and ate of his food and sat at table with him—that we bear witness to him because we are favored.… All we—the Twelve, the three hundred, the three thousand, the five thousand, the many myriads of Jews, all the fullness of the faithful who then were and now are and hereafter shall be—“have received of his fullness.”

He does not possess, he says, the gift by participation but is himself the very fountain and root of all good, the very life and light and truth, not retaining within himself the riches of his good things but overflowing with them into all others. And after the overflowing, he still remains full and undiminished, in spite of supplying others. On the contrary, he remains perfect as always, streaming forth as much as ever and imparting to others a share of these blessings. What I possess, on the other hand, is by participation (for I received it from another) and is only a small portion of the whole.
