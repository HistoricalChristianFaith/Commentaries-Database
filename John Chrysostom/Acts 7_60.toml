To clear himself, and show that neither were his former words prompted by passion, he says, Lord lay not this sin to their charge: wishing also even in this way to win them over. For to show that he forgave their wrath and rage in murdering him, and that his own soul was free from all passion, was the way to make his saying to be favorably received.
