"And he knelt down, and cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge." To clear himself, and show that neither were his former words prompted by passion, he says, "Lord, lay not this sin to their charge": wishing also even in this way to win them over. For to show that he forgave their wrath and rage in murdering him, and that his own soul was free from all passion, was the way to make his saying to be favorably received.

And this blessed man does not simply pray, but does it with earnestness: "having kneeled down." Mark his divine death! So long only the Lord permitted the soul to remain in him. "And having said this, he fell asleep."
