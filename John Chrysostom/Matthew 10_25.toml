What Christ is saying to the faithful is, I am now already sharing with you the same stigma you are presently suffering. That is sufficient for your encouragement. I, your Master and Lord, have felt the same grief you now feel. And if that distresses you further, remember this: that even from this foreboding you will soon be freed. For why do you now grieve? Are you troubled that someone is calling you a deceiver or a liar? So what? Wait a little while. In time you will be seen as benefactors of the world and champions of faith. For time reveals whatever is concealed. Time will refute their false accusations and make your good intent known. For as historic events unfold, a larger design will be recognized. Everyone will finally grasp the real state of the case and not merely the frail words used to describe it. Then your adversaries will be revealed as false accusers, liars and slanderers. With time lengthening to reveal and proclaim your innocence, you will shine brighter than the sun. Your voice will in time be heard more clearly than a trumpet. Your good intent will be attested by all. So do not let what is now being said demoralize you. Rather, let the hope of the good things to come raise you up. For the true story of your testimony cannot be suppressed forever.

Observe how he reveals that he is the Lord and God and Creator of all things. What does it mean that “a disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master”? As long as one is a disciple or a servant, one is not ready to receive honor. So do not speak to me of what is lacking in the Master. Learn your arguments from all that is sufficient about him. Jesus does not say “how much more will they malign his servants?” but instead “how much more will they malign those of his household?” This demonstrates his close relationship with them. In another place Christ says, “I no longer call you my slaves; you are my friends.” Moreover, he does not say “if they are insolent to the master of the house and accuse him.” Instead, he includes the exact form their insolence took, namely, that they called him Beelzebul.
