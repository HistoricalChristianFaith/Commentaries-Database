Paul wishing to show the difference between the New and Old [Covenant], scatters it everywhere; and shoots from afar, and noises it abroad, and prepares beforehand. For at once even from the introduction, he laid down this saying, that to them indeed He spoke by prophets, but to us by the Son c. i. 1, 2, and to them at sundry times and in various manners, but to us through the Son. Afterwards, having discoursed concerning the Son, who He was and what He had wrought, and given an exhortation to obey Him, lest we should suffer the same things as the Jews; and having said that He is High Priest after the order of Melchisedec Hebrews 6:20, and having oftentimes wished to enter into [the subject of] this difference, and having used much preparatory management; and having rebuked them as weak, and again soothed and restored them to confidence; then at last he introduces the discussion on the difference [of the two dispensations] to ears in their full vigor. For he who is depressed in spirits would not be a ready hearer. And that you may understand this, hear the Scripture saying, They hearkened not to Moses for anguish of spirit. Exodus 6:9 Therefore having first cleared away their despondency by many considerations, some fearful, some more gentle, he then from this point enters upon the discussion of the difference [of the dispensations].

2. And what does he say? For this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the Most High God. And, what is especially noteworthy, he shows the difference to be great by the Type itself. For as I said, he continually confirms the truth from the Type, from things past, on account of the weakness of the hearers. For (he says) this Melchisedec, King of Salem, Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the Kings, and blessed him, to whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all. Having concisely set down the whole narrative, he looked at it mystically.

And first from the name. First (he says) being by interpretation King of righteousness: for Sedec means righteousness; and Melchi, King: Melchisedec, King of righteousness. Do you see his exactness even in the names? But who is King of righteousness, save our Lord Jesus Christ? King of righteousness. And after that also King of Salem, from his city, that is, King of Peace, which again is [characteristic] of Christ. For He has made us righteous, and has made peace for things in Heaven and things on earth. Colossians 1:20 What man is King of Righteousness and of Peace? None, save only our Lord Jesus Christ.
