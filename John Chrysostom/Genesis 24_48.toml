“Seeing now God’s providence so manifestly in action, I asked whose daughter she was. Learning from what she said that she belonged not to alien people but to the household of Nahor, my master’s brother, I was bold enough to ‘put earrings and bracelets on her. In my satisfaction I prayed to the Lord and praised the God of my master Abraham for bringing my journey to a successful conclusion so as to take the daughter of my master’s brother.’ God’s hand in this has been so manifestly active; as you can see, the prayers offered by my master have been granted. Now you, for your part, if you are to give evidence of your dispositions, ‘show steadfast kindness toward my master; if not, let me know it.’3 Tell me the truth now, I ask you, so that I may be in a position to know what I must do. But if the answer is no, tell me so that I may travel in another direction, ‘going left or right.’ ”
