Then, since God was conducting everything in the wake of the patriarch’s prayers, the maiden’s father and brother said to him, “This thing has come from the Lord; we cannot deny you, for good or ill.” Your account shows the whole thing has happened by God’s arrangement. So don’t think we oppose the decisions of God; after all, it is beyond our powers to do it. Here, the maid is in your hands; “take her, and be on your way, and she will be wife to your master’s son, as the Lord has said.”
