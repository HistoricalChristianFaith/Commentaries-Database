(Hom. xviii. [al. xvii.] 1) Many not having attended to John's words at first, he rouses them a second time: Again the next day after John stood, and two of his disciples.

(Hom. xviii. [al. xvii.] c. 2) But wherefore went he not all about, preaching in every place of Judæa; instead of standing near the river, waiting for His coming, that he might point Him out? Because he wished this to be done by the works of Christ Himself. And observe how much greater an effort was produced; He struck a small spark, and suddenly it rose into a flame. Again, if John had gone about and preached, it would have seemed like human partiality, and great suspicion would have been excited. Now the Prophets and Apostles all preached Christ absent; the former before His appearance in the flesh, the latter after His assumption. But He was to be pointed out by the eye, not by the voice only; and therefore it follows: And looking upon Jesus us He walked, he saith, Behold the Lamb of God!

(Hom. xviii. 1. in Joan) He makes not a long discourse, having only one object before him, to bring them and join them to Christ; knowing that they would not any further need his witness. (c. 2.). John does not however speak to his disciples alone, but publicly in the presence of all. And so, undertaking to follow Christ, through this instruction common to all, they remained thenceforth firm, following Christ for their own advantage, not as an act of favour to their masterx. John does not exhort: he simply gazes in admiration on Christ, pointing out the gifty He came to bestow, the cleansing from sin: and the mode in which this would be accomplished: both of which the word Lamb testifies to. Lamb has the article affixed to it, as a sign of preeminence.

“Again,” says the Evangelist, “John stood and said, ‘Behold, the Lamb of God.’ ” Christ says nothing; his messenger says it all. This is how it is with a bridegroom. He says nothing for awhile to the bride but remains there in silence while someone shows him to the bride and others give her into his hands. She merely appears, and he only takes her for himself when he has received her from another who gives her to him. And when he receives her given to him in this way he treats her in such a way that she no longer remembers those who betrothed her. So it was with Christ. He came to join to himself the church. He said nothing but merely came. It was his friend, John [the Baptist], who put into his hand the bride’s right hand when by his teaching he gave the souls of men and women into his hand. And after Christ received them, he treated them in such a way that they no longer left to see John, who had committed them to him.And there is something further here as well. Just like in a marriage, the bride does not go to the bridegroom; rather, he hurries to her, even if he is a king’s son and is about to marry some poor and abject person or even a servant. This is what was happening here. Human nature did not go up but, contemptible and poor as it was, [Christ] came to our human nature. And when the marriage had taken place, he no longer endured waiting. Instead, once he had taken [the bride] to himself, he then took her to the house of his Father.

Not by voice alone but with his eyes also [John] bore witness to and expressed his esteem and praise of Christ. At this point he addresses no word of exhortation to his followers either. Instead he only shows wonder and astonishment at the one who was present. John declares to everyone the gift that this one came to give. He also declares the manner of purification. For “the Lamb” declares both of these things. Notice also he did not say “who shall take” or “who has taken” but “who takes away the sins of the world,” because this is what he continually does. He took them not only then when he suffered, but from that time even to the present he takes them away. He is not repeatedly crucified (for he offered one sacrifice for sins) but by that one sacrifice continually purges them. As then the Word shows us his preeminence and the Son his superiority in comparison with others, so the lamb, the Christ, that prophet, the true light, the good shepherd and whatever other names are applied to him with the addition of the article, mark a great difference. For there were many “lambs” and “prophets” and “christs” and “sons.” But John separates [Christ] from all of these by a wide margin. He secured this not only by the article but by the addition of “only begotten,” since he had nothing in common with the creation.
