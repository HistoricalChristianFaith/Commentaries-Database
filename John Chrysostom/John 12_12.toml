Wealth is just as liable as power to destroy those who are not careful. The first leads into covetousness; the second, into pride. See, for instance, how the multitude of the Jews is sound while their rulers are corrupt. For the first of these believed Christ, as the Evangelists continually assert, saying that “many of the multitude believed on him,” but those who were of the ruling party did not believe.… But how is it that he now enters openly into Jerusalem whereas before he had not walked openly among the Jews and had withdrawn into the wilderness? Having quenched their anger by withdrawing, he comes to them now when they are calmer. Moreover, the multitude that went before him and then followed after him was enough to throw them into an agony of fear. For no miracle so attracted the people as that of Lazarus. And another Evangelist says that they threw their garments under his feet and that “the whole city was moved.” This is the kind of honor he had when he entered the city.
