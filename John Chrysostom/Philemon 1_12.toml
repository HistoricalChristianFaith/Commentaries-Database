Ver. 12. "Thou therefore receive him, that is my own bowels."

And again he has not given the bare name, but uses with it a word that might move him, which is more affectionate than son. He has said, "son," he has said, "I have begotten" him,  so that it was probable  he would love him much, because he begot him in his trials. For it is manifest that we are most inflamed with affection for those children, who have been born to us in dangers which we have escaped, as when the Scripture says, "Woe, Barochabel!"  and again when Rachel names Benjamin, "the son of my sorrow." [Genesis 35:18]

"Thou therefore," he says, "receive him, that is my own bowels." He shows the greatness of his affection. He has not said, Take him back,  he has not said, Be not angry,  but "receive him"; that is, he is worthy not only of pardon, but of honor. Why? Because he has become the son of Paul.
