The “honor” of which he here speaks is attention to them and the supply of their necessities.… But what is double support? Double that of the widows, or of the deacons, or simply liberal support.

Preaching really entails hard work. This fact Paul made plain when he said, “Let the presbyters who rule well be held worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.” But you are responsible for making this toil light or heavy. If you despise my words or, though you do not despise them, do not embody them in your deeds, my toil will be heavy, because I am laboring fruitlessly and in vain. But if you pay attention and make my words manifest in your deeds, I shall not even be aware of the perspiration, for the fruit produced by my work will not permit me to feel the laboriousness of the toil.

For this is the ultimate aim of their teaching: to lead their disciples, both by what they do and what they say, into the way of that blessed life which Christ commanded. Example alone is not sufficient instruction. And this statement is not mine but the Savior’s. For he says, “Whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great.” Now if to do were the same as to teach, the second word would be superfluous. It would have been enough to say, “Whosoever shall do.” But in fact by distinguishing these two he shows that example is one thing and instruction another. Each requires the other for perfect edification.
