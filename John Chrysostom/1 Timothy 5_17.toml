The honor of which he here speaks is attention to them, and the supply of their necessities, as is shown by his adding, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain Deuteronomy 25:4; and, The laborer is worthy of his reward. Luke 10:7 So when he says, Honor widows, he means, support them in all that is necessary. Thus he says, That it may relieve those that are widows indeed; and again, Honor widows that are widows indeed, that is, who are in poverty, for the greater their poverty, the more truly are they widows. He alleges the Law, he alleges the words of Christ, both agreeing herein. For the Law says, You shall not muzzle the ox that treads out the grain. See how he would have the teacher labor! For there is not, indeed there is not, any other labor such as his. But this is from the Law. But how does he quote from Christ? The laborer is worthy of his reward. Let us not then look only to the reward, but to the terms of the commandment. The laborer, he says, is worthy of his reward. So that if any one lives in sloth and luxury, he is unworthy of it. Unless he is as the ox treading out the grain, and bearing the yoke, in spite of heat and thorns, and ceases not till he has carried the grain into the granary, he is not worthy. Therefore to teachers should be granted a supply of their necessities without grudging, that they may not faint nor be discouraged, nor by attention to inferior things deprive themselves of greater; that they may labor for spiritual things, paying no regard to worldly things. It was thus with the Levites; they had no worldly concerns, because the laity took care to provide for them, and their revenues were appointed by the law, as tythes, offerings of gold, first-fruits, vows, and many other things. And the law properly assigned these things to them, as seeking things present. But I shall say no more than that those who preside ought to have food and raiment, that they may not be distracted by care for these things. But what is double support? Double that of the widows, or of the deacons, or simply, liberal support. Let us not then think only of the double maintenance granted them, but of what is added, Those who rule well. And what is it to rule well? Let us hear Christ, Who says, The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep. John 10:11 Thus to rule well is, from our concern for them, never to spare ourselves.

Especially those who labor in the word and doctrine. Where then are those who say that there is no occasion for the word and doctrine? Whereas he says to Timothy, Meditate upon these things; give yourself wholly to them; and, Give attendance to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine; for in doing this you shall save both yourself, and them that hear you. 1 Timothy 4:15-16 These are the men whom he wishes to be honored most of all, and he adds the reason, for they sustain great labor. For when one is neither watchful, nor diligent, but merely sits in his stall easy and unconcerned, while another wears himself out with anxiety and exertion, especially if he is ignorant of profane literature, ought not the latter to be honored above all others, who more than others gives himself up to such labors? For he is exposed to numberless tongues. One censures him, another praises him, a third mocks him, another finds fault with his memory and his composition, and it requires great strength of mind to endure all this. It is an important point, and contributes much to the edification of the Church, that the rulers of it should be apt to teach. If this be wanting, many things in the Church go to ruin. Therefore in addition to the qualifications of hospitality, moderation, and a blameless life, he enumerates this also, saying, Apt to teach. For why else indeed is he called a teacher? Some say that he may teach philosophy by the example of his life, so that all else is superfluous, and there is no need of verbal instruction in order to proficiency. But why then does Paul say, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine? For when doctrines are concerned, what life will answer the purpose? And of what word is he speaking? Not of pompous language, nor of discourse set off with external decorations, but that which possesses the mighty power of the Spirit, and abounds with wisdom and understanding. It needs not set phrases, but thoughts to give it utterance, not skill in composition, but power of mind.

Preaching really entails hard work. This fact Paul made plain when he said, “Let the presbyters who rule well be held worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.” But you are responsible for making this toil light or heavy. If you despise my words or, though you do not despise them, do not embody them in your deeds, my toil will be heavy, because I am laboring fruitlessly and in vain. But if you pay attention and make my words manifest in your deeds, I shall not even be aware of the perspiration, for the fruit produced by my work will not permit me to feel the laboriousness of the toil.

For this is the ultimate aim of their teaching: to lead their disciples, both by what they do and what they say, into the way of that blessed life which Christ commanded. Example alone is not sufficient instruction. And this statement is not mine but the Savior’s. For he says, “Whoever shall do and teach, he shall be called great.” Now if to do were the same as to teach, the second word would be superfluous. It would have been enough to say, “Whosoever shall do.” But in fact by distinguishing these two he shows that example is one thing and instruction another. Each requires the other for perfect edification.
