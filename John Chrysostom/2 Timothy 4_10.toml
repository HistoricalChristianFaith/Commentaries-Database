Demas, having loved his own ease and security away from danger, has chosen rather to live luxuriously at home, rather than suffer hardships with Paul and share his present dangers. Paul has indeed blamed him, but only in order to confirm us, that we may not sink to self-indulgent weakness in declining toils and dangers, for this would amount to “having loved this present world.”
