For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world. He does not say, That I may see you before I depart this life, which would have grieved him, but because I am alone, he says, and have no one to help or support me.

For Demas has forsaken me, having loved this present world, and is departed to Thessalonica; that is, having loved his own ease and security from danger, he has chosen rather to live luxuriously at home, than to suffer hardships with me, and share my present danger. He has blamed him alone, not for the sake of blaming him, but to confirm us, that we may not be effeminate in declining toils and dangers, for this is, having loved this present world. At the same time he wishes to draw his disciple to him.

Crescens to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.

These he does not censure. For Titus was one of the most admirable men, so that to him he entrusted the affairs of the island, no small island, I mean, but that great one of Crete.

Demas, having loved his own ease and security away from danger, has chosen rather to live luxuriously at home, rather than suffer hardships with Paul and share his present dangers. Paul has indeed blamed him, but only in order to confirm us, that we may not sink to selfindulgent weakness in declining toils and dangers, for this would amount to “having loved this present world.”
