All this, in fact, blessed Paul had in mind, that fervent lover of Christ, who like a winged bird traversed the whole world.… See his uprightness, see the extraordinary degree of his virtue, see his fervent love. “The love of Christ,” he says, “constrains us,” that is, urges, impels, coerces us. Then, wishing to explain what had been said by him, he says, “convinced of this, that if one person [died] indeed for all, then all have died, he did die for all so that the living might live no longer for themselves but for the one who died and rose for them.” Do you see how appropriate it was for him to say, “The love of Christ constrains us”? He is saying, you see, if he died for the sake of us all, he died for the purpose that we the living might live no longer for ourselves but for him who died and rose for us. Accordingly, let us heed the apostolic exhortation, not living for ourselves but for him who died and rose for us.

"For the love of God  constrains us, because we thus judge."

'For not the fear of things to come only,' he says, 'but also those which have already happened allow us not to be slothful nor to slumber; but stir us up and impel us to these our labors on your behalf.' And what are those things which have already happened?

"That if one died for all, then all died." 'Surely then it was because all were lost,' says he. For except all were dead, He had not died for all.  For here the opportunities  of salvation exist; but there are found no longer. Therefore, he says, "The love of God constrains us," and allows us not to be at rest. For it comes of extreme wretchedness and is worse than hell itself, that when He has set forth an act so mighty, any should be found after so great an instance of His provident care reaping no benefit. For great was the excess of that love, both to die for a world of such extent , and dying for it when in such a state.
