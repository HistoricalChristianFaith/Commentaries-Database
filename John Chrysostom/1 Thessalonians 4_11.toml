He shows of how many evils idleness is the cause, and of how many benefits industry. And this he makes manifest from things which happen among us, as he often does, and that wisely. For by these things the majority are led on more than by spiritual things. For it is a mark of love to our neighbors not to receive from them, but to impart to them. And observe. Being about to exhort and admonish, he places in the middle their good conduct, both that they may recover even from the preceding admonition, and from the threat, when he said, He therefore that rejects, rejects not man, but God, and that they may not be restive at this. And this is the effect of working, that one does not receive of others, nor live idly, but by working imparts to others. For it is said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. Acts 20:35 And to work, he says, with your hands. Where are those, who look out for work that is spiritual? Do you see how he takes from them every excuse, saying, with your hands? But does one practice fasting with his hands? Or watchings all night? Or lyings on the ground? This no one can say. But he is speaking of spiritual work. For it is truly spiritual, that one should by working impart to others, and there is nothing equal to this. That ye may walk, he says, becomingly. Do you see whence he touches them? He has not said, that you may not be shamed by begging. But he has indeed insinuated the same, yet he puts it in a milder way, so as both to strike and not to do this severely. For if those who are among us are offended at these things, much more those who are without, finding numberless accusations and handles, when they see a man who is in good health and able to support himself, begging and asking help of others. Wherefore also they call us Christ-mongers. On this account, he means, the name of God is blasphemed. Romans 2:24 But none of these things has he stated; but that which was able to touch them most nearly, the disgracefulness of the thing.
