"Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace: for I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee: for I have much people in this city." See by how many reasons He persuades him, and how He puts last the reason which of all others most prevailed with him, "I have much people in this city." Now even the number of the "much people" persuaded him, but Christ's claiming them for His own moved him more. Yet He says also, "Fear not": for the danger was become greater now, both because more believed, and also the ruler of the synagogue. This was enough to rouse him. Not that he was reproved as fearing; but that he should not suffer aught; "I am with thee, and none shall set upon thee to hurt thee." For He did not always permit them to suffer evil, that they might not become too weak. For nothing so grieved Paul, as men's unbelief and setting themselves against the Truth: this was worse than the dangers. Therefore it is that Christ appears to him now.
