By “purity” Paul means either chastity, or general purity, or lack of corruption or even his free preaching of the gospel. By “knowledge” he means the wisdom given by God, which is the only true knowledge. When he unexpectedly mentions the Holy Spirit in this list, Paul means more than just that he does everything in the power of the Spirit. He is saying here that the Spirit himself has been given to him and that it is because of this indwelling presence that he has received the spiritual gifts. “Genuine love” was the motivating power of all these good things. It is that which made Paul what he was. It was also love which caused the Spirit to abide with him, with whose help he did everything in the right way.
