But why does he say, “God gives not the Spirit by measure”? He wants to demonstrate that we all have received the operation of the Spirit by measure (for in this place, by “Spirit” he means the operation of the Spirit, for this is what is divided). And yet, Christ has all its operation without measure and complete. Now if his operations are without measure, his essence is even more so. Do you not see that the Spirit is infinite? How then can he who has received all the operation of the Spirit, who knows the things of God, who says, “We speak what we have heard, and testify what we have seen”—how can anyone suspect anything he says? He says nothing that is not “of God” or that is not of “the Spirit.” And, for a while, he utters nothing concerning God the Word but makes all his doctrine credible by reference to the Father and the Spirit.
