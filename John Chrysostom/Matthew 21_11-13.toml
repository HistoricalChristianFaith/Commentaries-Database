John’s Gospel also reported this, but at the beginning of his narrative. But now in Matthew we are coming to the end of the narrative. Thus it is probable that this was done twice and on different occasions. That there was a first cleansing of the temple and then a second is evident from many evidences. In John’s Gospel he came at the time of the Passover. Here it was before Passover. In John the Jews said, “What miraculous sign can you show us to prove your authority to do all this?” In Matthew they hold their peace, though reproved, because he was not marveled at among all the population.If this happened on two different occasions, this becomes a heavier charge against the Jewish leadership. He did it not only once but a second time, and still they continued their buying and selling and called him an adversary of God. They should have learned from the first cleansing to honor his Father and his own power. They could see his works agreeing with his words, and they could behold his miracles. They could hear the prophet pointing to him. They could see the children attesting him in a manner beyond their age. But all this did not persuade them. Instead, “they were indignant.” So he brings in Isaiah as their accuser when he says, “My house shall be called a house of prayer.”
