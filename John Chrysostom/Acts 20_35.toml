"I have showed you all things, how that so laboring, ye ought to support the weak." Observe him employed in work and not simply that, but toiling. "These hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me:" so as to put them to shame. And see how worthily of them. For he says not, Ye ought to show yourselves superior to money, but what? "to support the weak" - not all indiscriminately - "and to hear the word of the Lord which He spake, It is more blessed to give than to receive." For lest any one should think that it was spoken with reference to them, and that he gave himself for an ensample, as he elsewhere says, "giving an ensample to you," he added the declaration of Christ, Who said, "It is more blessed to give than to receive."

And he does not say, that to receive is bad, but that not to receive is better. For, "remember," he says, "the words of the Lord which he spake: It is more blessed to give than to receive." And where said He this? Perhaps the Apostles delivered it by unwritten tradition; or else it is plain from recorded sayings, from which one could infer it. For in fact here he has shown both boldness in meeting dangers, sympathy with those over whom he ruled, teaching with unshrinking boldness, humility, voluntary poverty: but, what we have here is even more than that poverty. For if He says there in the Gospel, "If thou wilt be perfect, sell what thou hast and give to the poor," when, besides receiving nothing himself, he provides sustenance for others also, what could equal this? It is one degree to fling away one's possessions; a second, to be sufficient for the supply of one's own necessities: a third, to provide for others also; a fourth, for one to do all this who preaches and has a right to receive. So that here is a man far better than those who merely forego possessions.
