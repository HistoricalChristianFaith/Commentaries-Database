Whatsoever things are of the Father, these he says are of the Son also, and that with more of intensity, because that He both became dead for, and united Himself to us. He said, Firstfruits, as of fruits. He said not Resurrection, but Firstfruits, showing that He has sanctified us all, and offered us, as it were, a sacrifice. The term fullness some use of the Godhead, like as John said, Of His fullness have all we received. That is, whatever was the Son, the whole Son dwelt there, not a sort of energy, but a Substance.
