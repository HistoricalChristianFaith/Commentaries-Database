What then, tell me, did not the Prophets  know it? How then does Christ say, that Moses and the Prophets wrote "these things concerning Me?" And again, "If you believed Moses, you would believe Me." [John 5:46] And again, "You search the Scriptures, because ye think that in them you have eternal life, and these are they which bear witness of me." [John 5:39] His meaning is this, either that it was not revealed unto all men, for he adds, "which in other generations was not made known unto the sons of men, as it has now been revealed;" or else, that it was not thus made known by the very facts and realities themselves, "as it has now been revealed unto His holy Apostles and Prophets in the Spirit." For reflect. Peter, had he not been instructed by the Spirit, never would have gone to the Gentiles. For hear what he says, "Then has God given unto them the Holy Ghost, as well as unto us." [Acts 10:47] That it was by the Spirit that God chose that they should receive the grace. The Prophets then spoke, yet they knew it not thus perfectly; so far from it, that not even did the Apostles, after they had heard it. So far did it surpass all human calculation, and the common expectation.
