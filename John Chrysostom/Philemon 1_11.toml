Ver. 11. "Which in time past was to you unprofitable."

See how great is his prudence, how he confesses the man's faults, and thereby extinguishes his anger. I know, he says, that he was unprofitable.

"But now" he will be "profitable to you and to me."

He has not said he will be useful to you, lest he should contradict it, but he has introduced his own person, that his hopes may seem worthy of credit, "But now," he says, "profitable to you and to me." For if he was profitable to Paul, who required so great strictness, much more would he be so to his master.

See how great is Paul’s prudence, how he confesses the man’s faults and thereby extinguishes Philemon’s anger.… He has not said Onesimus will be useful to you, lest Philemon should refute this argument, but he has introduced his own person, that his hopes may seem worthy of trust. “But now,” he says, “profitable to you and to me.” For if Onesimus was profitable to Paul, who was quite strict, how more would he be so to his master.
