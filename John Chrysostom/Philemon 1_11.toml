Ver. 11. "Which in time past was to you unprofitable."

See how great is his prudence, how he confesses the man's faults, and thereby extinguishes his anger. I know, he says, that he was unprofitable.

"But now" he will be "profitable to you and to me."

He has not said he will be useful to you, lest he should contradict it, but he has introduced his own person, that his hopes may seem worthy of credit, "But now," he says, "profitable to you and to me." For if he was profitable to Paul, who required so great strictness, much more would he be so to his master.
