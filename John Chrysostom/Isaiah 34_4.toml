Daniel said, “I beheld in the night a vision, and saw one coming with the clouds of heaven as the Son of man, and he came on to the Ancient of Days and was brought near to him. To him was given the dominion and the honor and the kingdom. And all people, tribes and tongues will serve him. His dominion is an eternal dominion, which shall not pass away. And his kingdom shall not be destroyed.” … Then all the gates of heaven will be opened, or rather the heaven itself is taken away. For we read, “The heaven shall be rolled up like a scroll,” wrapped up to the middle like the skin and covering of some tent, so as to be made into a more useful shape.
