The writer is now about to relate the affair of Ananias and Sapphira, and in order to show that the man's sin was of the worst description, he first mentions him who performed the virtuous deed; that, there being so great a multitude all doing the same, so great grace, so great miracles, he, taught by none of these, but blinded by covetousness, brought destruction upon his own head. "Having land," meaning that this was all he possessed, "sold it, and brought the money, and laid it at the Apostles' feet."

"And Joses, who by the Apostles was surnamed Barnabas, which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation." I do not think that this is the same with the companion of Matthias; for that person was also called Justus and Barsabas, but this, Joses and "Barnabas" ["son of consolation"]. I suppose he also received the name from his virtue, as being qualified and suited for this duty. "A Levite, and of the country of Cyprus by birth." Observe on all occasions how the writer indicates the breaking up of the Law. But how was he also a "Cyprian by birth?" Because they then even removed to other countries, and still were called Levites. "Having land, sold it, and brought the price, and laid it at the Apostles' feet."
