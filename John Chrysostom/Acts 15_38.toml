Luke has already described the apostles’ character to us, showing that one was more tender and forgiving and the other more strict and austere. For the gifts bestowed on them were different. That this is indeed a gift is clear. One befits one set and the other another set of characters. And if they should make an exchange, harm would result.… Likewise in the prophets we find different opinions and different characters. Elias, for example, is austere, while Moses is meek. Thus here Paul is more vehement. But notice even so his gentleness. “He thought best,” it says, “not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia.” … Although there appears to be a sharp contention, in fact it was part of the divine plan that each man should receive his proper place. Besides, it was necessary that not everyone have the same honor but that one should lead and the other be led.
