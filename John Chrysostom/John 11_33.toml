He comes then to the tomb and again curbed his emotions. Why does the Evangelist carefully mention in several places that “he wept” and that “he groaned”? He mentions these so that you may learn that he had truly put on our nature. For while this Evangelist is remarkable for the great things he says about Christ more than the others in matters relating to the body, [at the passion] he also speaks much more humbly than they. For instance, he says nothing about Jesus’ sorrow concerning his death, while the other Evangelists declare that he was exceedingly sorrowful, that he was in fact in an agony. But John, on the contrary, says that he even threw the officers backwards. The result is that [John] here has made up for what is omitted there by mentioning his grief.
