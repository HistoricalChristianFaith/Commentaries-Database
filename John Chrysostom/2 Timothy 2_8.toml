Why is this mentioned? It is directed chiefly against the heretics, at the same time to encourage Timothy, by underscoring the divine blessings accompanying sufferings, since Christ, our Master, himself overcame death by suffering.… For upon this point many had already begun to subvert God’s providence, being ashamed at the immensity of God’s love for humanity. For of such a nature are the benefits which God has conferred upon us that we were embarrassed to ascribe them to God and could not believe he had so far condescended.
