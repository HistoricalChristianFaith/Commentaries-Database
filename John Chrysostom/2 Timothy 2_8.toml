On what account is this mentioned? It is directed chiefly against the heretics, at the same time to encourage Timothy, by showing the advantage of sufferings, since Christ, our Master, Himself overcame death by suffering. Remember this, he says, and you will have sufficient comfort. Remember that Jesus Christ, of the seed of David, was raised from the dead. For upon that point many had already begun to subvert the dispensation, being ashamed at the immensity of God's love to mankind. For of such a nature are the benefits which God has conferred upon us, that men were ashamed to ascribe them to God, and could not believe He had so far condescended. According to my Gospel. Thus he everywhere speaks in his Epistles, saying according to my Gospel, either because they were bound to believe him, or because there were some who preached another Gospel. Galatians 1:6

Why is this mentioned? It is directed chiefly against the heretics, at the same time to encourage Timothy, by underscoring the divine blessings accompanying sufferings, since Christ, our Master, himself overcame death by suffering.… For upon this point many had already begun to subvert God’s providence, being ashamed at the immensity of God’s love for humanity. For of such a nature are the benefits which God has conferred upon us that we were embarrassed to ascribe them to God and could not believe he had so far condescended.
