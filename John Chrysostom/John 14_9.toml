In the Old Testament it says, “No one shall see my face and live.” What does Christ say? Very reprovingly he says, “Have I been with you for so long, and have you not known me, Philip?” He did not say “have you not seen” but “have you not known me.” “Why,” Philip might say, “would I want to learn anything concerning you? At present I want to see your Father, and you say to me, ‘Have you not known me?’ ” What connection then does this have with the question? Surely a very close one. For if he is that which the Father is, yet continues to be a Son, there is a definite reason for showing in himself the one who begat him. Then to distinguish the persons he says, “He who has seen me has seen the Father,” in case anyone should assert that the same person is Father and Son. For had he been the Father, he would not have said, “He who has seen me has seen him.”
