Do you wish that I should speak of the ways of repentance? They are many and various and different, and all lead to heaven … a fourth way is almsgiving. For Daniel said to Nebuchadnezzar, when he had come to all kinds of evil and had entered on all impiety, “O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you.” … What could be compared with this act of compassion? After countless sins, after so many transgressions, he is promised that he will be reconciled with him whom he has had conflict with if only he will show kindness to his own fellow servants.… So we have shown you five ways to repentance: first the condemnation of sins, next the forgiveness of our neighbor’s sins, third that which comes of prayer, fourth that which comes of almsgiving, fifth that which comes of humility. Do not then be lazy, but walk in this day by day.

Do you not see that when the prophet [Daniel] gave that excellent advice to Nebuchadnezzar, he did not merely consider the poor; but what?… Give up your wealth not that others may be fed but that you may escape punishment. And Christ says, “Go and sell what you possess, and give it to the poor … and come follow me.” … Virginity and fasting and lying on the ground are more difficult than this, but nothing is so strong and powerful to extinguish the fire of our sins as almsgiving. It is greater than all other virtues. It places the lover of it by the side of the king, and justly.… Almsgiving extends to all and embraces the members of Christ, and actions that extend their effects to many are far greater than those that are confined to one. Almsgiving is the mother of love, of that love which is the characteristic of Christianity, which is greater than all miracles by which the disciples of Christ are made plain. It is the medicine of our sins, the cleansing of the filth of our souls, the ladder fixed to heaven; it binds together the body of Christ.
