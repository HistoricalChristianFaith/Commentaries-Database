Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc. Tyre and Sidon were places of the Canaanites, therefore the Lord comes to them, not as to His own, but as to men, who had nothing in common with the fathers to whom the promise was made. And therefore He comes in such a way, that His coming should not be known to the Tyrians and Sidonians.Wherefore it continues: “and entered into ahouse, and would have no man know it.” For the time had not come for His dwelling with the Gentiles and bringing them to the faith, for this was not tobe, till after His cross and resurrection.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Now by this the Lord wished to show His disciples that He opened the door of faith even to the Gentiles, wherefore also the nation of the woman is described when it is added, “The woman was a Gentile, a Syrophenician by nation,” that is, from Syria and Phaenice.It goes on: “and she besought Him that He would cast forth the devil out of her daughter. "It continues: “But He said unto her, Letthe children be first filled.”.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: These words He uttered not that there is in Him a deficiency of virtue, to prevent His ministering to all, but because His benefit, if ministered to both Jews and Gentiles who had no communication with each other, might be a cause of jealousy.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: In like manner also to show the Jews that He did not confer healing on foreigners in the same degree as to them, and that by the discovery of the woman's faith, the unfaithfulness of the Jews might be the more laid bare. Forthe woman did not take it ill, but with much reverence assented to what the Lord had said. Wherefore it goes on, “And she answered and said unto Him, Truth, Lord, but the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.”.
Vict. Ant. e Cat. in Marc.: Her placing herself therefore in the rank of dogs is a mark of her reverence; as if she said, I hold it as a favour to be even in the position of a dog, and to eat not from another table, but from that of the Master himself.
