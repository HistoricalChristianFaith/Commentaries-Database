Here is a twofold accusation against the damsel, that she danced, and that she chose to ask an execution as her reward. Observe how Herod is at once cruel and yielding; he obliges himself by an oath, and leaves her free to choose her request. Yet when he knew what evil was resulting from her request, he was grieved, “And the king was sorry,” for virtue gains praise and admiration even among the bad. This dissembler of his own inclinations, this contriver of a murder displayed sorrow in his face, when he had joy in his mind. “For his oath’s sake, and them which sat with him at meat, he command edit to be given. "He excuses his crime by his oath, that his wickedness might be done under a pretence of piety. That he adds, “and them that sat at meat with him,” he would have them all sharers in his crime, that abloody dish might be brought in, in a luxurious feast.
If he was afraid to have so many witnesses of his perjury, how much more ought he to have feared so many witnesses of a murder?.
Hom., xlix: Observe how John’s disciples are henceforth more attached to Jesus; they it is who told Him what was done concerning John; “And they came and told Jesus.” For leaving all they take refuge with Him, and so by degrees after their calamity, and the answer given by Christ, they are set right.
