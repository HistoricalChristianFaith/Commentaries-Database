“When he was in Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover, many believed in his name, seeing the signs that he was working. But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them.” For those disciples were more dependable who came to him not only by reason of miracles but also because of his teaching. Miracles, indeed, attracted the more slow-witted, but prophecies and teaching, the more intelligent. And those who were won over by teaching were, in truth, more steadfast than those won by miracles. Christ has even called them blessed, saying, “Blessed are they who have not seen and yet have believed.” That the others were not of his true disciples the next words show, for the Evangelist added, “Jesus did not trust himself to them.” Why? In that he knew all people and because he had no need that anyone should bear witness concerning humankind, for he himself knew what was in humanity. What this means is as follows: He who dwells in the very hearts of people and enters into their minds did not give heed to outward words. Knowing clearly that the fervor of these people was transient, he did not feel confidence in them as full-fledged disciples, nor did he entrust all his teachings to them as if they were already firm believers. Now to know what is in the hearts of people belongs to him who “has fashioned the heart of each of them,” that is, to God, for “you only,” Scripture says, “know what is in every human heart.” He did not, then, need witness in order to know the minds of his own creatures; therefore, he did not have confidence in them by reason of their inconstant faith. People who know neither the present nor the future often both say and confide everything without hesitation to those who treacherously approach them and who will presently forsake them, but not so Christ, for he clearly knows all secrets.
