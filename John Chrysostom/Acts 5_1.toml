See, my beloved brethren, how instead of leaving the Apostles to sell, they themselves sold, and presented the prices to them.

The aggravating circumstance was, that the sin was concerted, and none other saw what was done. How came it into the mind of this hapless wretch to commit this crime? But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost, and to keep back part of the price of the land?

The writer is now about to relate the affair of Ananias and Sapphira, and in order to show that the manâ€™s sin was of the worst description, he first mentions him who performed the virtuous deed (Barnabas in 4:36-37); that, there being so great a multitude all doing the same, so great grace, so great miracles, he, taught by none of these, but blinded by covetousness, brought destruction upon his own head.
