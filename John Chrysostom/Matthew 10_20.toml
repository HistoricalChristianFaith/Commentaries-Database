For lest they should say, How shall we be able to persuade men, when such things are taking place? He bids them be confident as to their defense also. And elsewhere indeed He says, I will give you a mouth and wisdom; Luke 21:15 but here, It is the Spirit of your Father that speaks in you, advancing them unto the dignity of the prophets. Therefore, when He had spoken of the power that was given, then He added also the terrors, the murders, and the slaughters.

To the foregoing topics of consolation, He adds another not a little one; that they should not say, How shall we be able to persuade such men as these, when they shall persecute us? He bids them be of good courage respecting their answer, saying, “When they shall deliver you up, take no thought how or what yes hall speak.”.
Thus He raises them to the dignity of the Prophets, who have spoken by the Spirit of God. He who says here, “Take no thought what ye shall speak,” has said in another place, “Be ye always ready to give an answer to him thatdemandeth a reason of the hope that is in you.” When it is a dispute among friends, we are commanded to “be ready;” but before the awful judgment, and the raging people, aid is ministered by Christ, that they may speak boldly and notbe dismayed.
