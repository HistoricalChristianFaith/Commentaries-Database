Why then, you ask, being so humble did Daniel not repel either the adoration that was paid him by the king or the offerings? This I will not say, for it is sufficient for me simply to mention the question, and the rest I leave to you, that at least in this way I may stir up your thoughts.… For that [Daniel] did not do this out of arrogance is evident from his saying, “your gifts be to yourself.”
