See how He is again instructing them not to be self-confident, but contrite in mind, and to be humble, and to refer all to God.

And at one time He addresses Himself to Peter, at another to all in common. And to him He says, Simon, Simon, Satan has desired to have you, that he may sift you as wheat; but I have prayed for you; and to all in common, Pray that you enter not into temptation; every way plucking up their self-will, and making them earnest-minded. Then, that He might not seem to make His language altogether condemnatory, He says, The spirit indeed is ready, but the flesh is weak. For even although thou dost desire to despise death, yet you will not be able, until God stretch forth His hand, for the carnal mind draws down.
