The enmity that God had both against Jews and Gentiles was, as it were, a middle wall. And this wall, while the law existed, was not only not abolished but rather was strengthened.

But punishments lead us back to God.… Suppose anyone has a wound, which is the more deserving of fear—gangrene or the surgeon’s knife? The steel or the devouring progress of the ulcer? Sin is gangrene; punishment is the surgeon’s knife. As then he who has a gangrene, although he is not lanced, has to sustain the malady and is then in the worse condition when he is not lanced, so also the sinner, though he is not punished, is the most wretched of people and is then especially wretched when he has no punishment and is suffering no distress.

Inasmuch, then, as this is the cause that puts us far from God, let us remove this obnoxious barrier that prevents any near approach being made.But now hear how this has actually occurred in real instances. Among the Corinthians some man of mark committed a sin such as was not named even among the Gentiles. This man was a believer and belonged to the household for Christ; and some say that he was actually a member of the priesthood. What then? Did Paul cut him off from the communion of those who were in the way of salvation? By no means, for he himself it is who rebukes the Corinthians countless times, backwards and forwards, because they did not bring the man to a state of repentance; he desired to prove to us that there is no sin that cannot be healed.
