Again they haste past the small cities, and press on to the greater ones, since from those the word was to flow as from a fountain into the neighboring cities. And Paul, as his manner was, went into the synagogue of the Jews. Although he had said, We turn to the Gentiles Acts 13:46, he did not leave these alone: such was the longing affection he had towards them. For hear him saying, Brethren, my heart's desire and prayer to God for Israel is, that they might be saved Romans 10:1: and, I wished myself accursed from Christ for my brethren. Romans 9:3 But he did this because of God's promise and the glory: and this, that it might not be a cause of offense to the Gentiles. Opening, it says, from the Scriptures, he reasoned with them for three sabbaths, putting before them that the Christ must suffer. Do thou mark how before all other things he preaches the Passion: so little were they ashamed of it, knowing it to be the cause of salvation. And some of them believed, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.

But the Jews which believed not took unto them certain of the baser sort, and set all the city on an uproar
