Ver. 21. "Tell me," he says, "you that desire to be under the Law, do you not hear the Law?"

He says rightly, "you that desire," for the matter was not one of a proper and orderly succession of things but of their own unseasonable contentiousness. It is the Book of Creation which he here calls the Law, which name he often gives to the whole Old Testament.
