3. "Remember them which have the rule over you." This he was laboring to say above: therefore "Follow peace with all men." [Hebrews 12:14] He gave this exhortation also to the Thessalonians, to "hold them in honor exceedingly." [1 Thessalonians 5:13]

"Remember" (he says) "them which have the rule over you,  who have spoken unto you the word of God, whose faith follow, considering the end of their conversation." What kind of following is this? Truly the best: for he says, beholding their life, "follow their faith." For from a pure life [comes] faith.

Or else by "faith," he means steadfastness. How so? Because they believe in the things to come. For they would not have shown forth a pure life, if they had questioned about the things to come, if they had doubted. So that here also he is applying a remedy to the same [evil].
