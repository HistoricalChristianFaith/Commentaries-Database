When we discard our present body, we shall receive in heaven the same body in an incorruptible form. It is however possible to be clothed in this body and yet still be found naked, that is, without glory or security. The resurrection is common to all, but the glory is not. Some will rise to honor and others to dishonor, some to a kingdom and others to punishment.

That is, even if we have put off the body, we shall not be presented there without a body, but even with the same one made incorruptible. But some read, and it deserves very much to be adopted, If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked. For lest all should be confident because of the Resurrection, he says, If so be that being clothed, that is, having obtained incorruption and an incorruptible body, we shall not be found naked of glory and safety. As he also said in the former Epistle; We shall all be raised; but each in his own order. And, There are celestial bodies, and bodies terrestial. 1 Corinthians 15:22-23 (ib. 40.) For the Resurrection indeed is common to all, but the glory is not common; but some shall rise in honor and others in dishonor, and some to a kingdom but others to punishment. This surely he signified here also, when he said; If so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.
