In the case of Ahab, God said, “Who shall deceive Ahab for me?” In addition, there is also the fact that he always made himself available for comparison with the pagan gods, and all this is below the dignity of God. However, viewed in another way, it becomes worthy of him. I say this for he is so merciful that for the sake of our salvation he foregoes being spoken of in terms befitting his dignity.
