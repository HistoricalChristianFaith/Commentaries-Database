It is, after all, the practice of the prophets and the just to grieve not only for themselves but also for the rest of humankind. If you’re inclined to check that, you will find them all giving evidence of this compassion—for example, you can listen to Jeremiah, “Who will pour water on my head, and provide a fountain of tears for my eyes?” or Ezekiel, “Alas, Lord, you will destroy what remains of Israel?” or Daniel lamenting in these words, “You have made us few in number by comparison with the Gentiles,” or Amos, “Think better of this, Lord.”
