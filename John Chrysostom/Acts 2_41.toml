"Then they that gladly received his word were baptized; and the same day there were added unto them about three thousand souls." Think you not this cheered the Apostles more than the miracle?

They heard, and were forthwith baptized. They did not speak those cold words which we do now, nor did they contrive delays; and yet they had heard all the requirements: but that word, "Save yourselves from this generation," made them to be not sluggish; rather they welcomed the exhortation; and that they did welcome it, they proved by their deeds, they showed what manner of men they were. They entered at once the lists, and took off the coat; whereas we do enter, but we intend to fight with our coat on. This is the cause that our antagonist has so little trouble, for we get entangled in our own movements, and are continually thrown down.

Once there were three thousand - there were five thousand - and yet they had all one soul: but now each knows not his brother, and is not ashamed to lay the blame on the number, because it is so great! Yet he that has many friends is invincible against all men: stronger he than any tyrant.
