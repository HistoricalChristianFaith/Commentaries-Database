“Place,” he said, “in these twelve baskets all the fragments that remain.” Thousands at that feast reclining, with abundance had been fed On the five loaves they had eaten and two fishes multiplied. You, our bread, our true refection, neverfailing sweetness are. He can nevermore know hunger, who is at your banquet fed, Nourishing not our fleshly nature, but imparting lasting life. -.

God has broken five loaves and two fishes and fed the five thousand With these foods that satisfy to the fullest their hunger. Then twice six baskets are filled with the fragments that are left over: Such is the bounty dispensed from the heavenly table forever.
