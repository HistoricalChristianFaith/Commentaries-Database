"For you have proved us, O God; You have fired us as silver is fired" [Psalm 66:10]. Have not fired us like hay, but like silver: by applying to us fire, You have not turned us into ashes, but You have washed off uncleanness, "You have fired us, as silver is fired." And see in what manner God is angry against them, whose Soul He has set unto life. "You have led us into a trap:" not that we might be caught and die, but that we might be tried and delivered from it. "You have laid tribulations upon our back." For having been to ill purpose lifted up, proud we were: having been to ill purpose lifted up, we were bowed down, in order that being bowed down, we should be lifted up for good.
