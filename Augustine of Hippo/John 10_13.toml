Suppose someone has sinned—grievously sinned. He ought to be rebuked, excommunicated. However, if he is excommunicated, he will become an enemy and will plot and do as much harm as he can. And so, for the time being, the pastor who seeks his own and not what is Christ’s keeps quiet and does not reprove the person so that he will not have to put up with the annoyances of their attacks or lose what he truly follows after—the advantage of human friendship. But look! The wolf has caught a sheep by the throat; the devil has enticed a believer into adultery. And yet, you are silent—you do not censure. As a hireling, you have seen the wolf coming, and you fled. Perhaps you answer and say, “See, I am here: I have not fled.” You have fled because you have been silent; you have been silent because you are afraid.

Many that seek temporal advantages in the church preach Christ, and through them Christ’s voice is heard. But the sheep are not following the hireling but the voice of the Shepherd speaking through the hireling.
