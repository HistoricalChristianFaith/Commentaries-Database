"I have laboured, crying, hoarse have become my jaws" [Psalm 69:3]. Where was this? When was this? Let us question the Gospel. For the Passion of our Lord in this Psalm we perceive. And, indeed, that He suffered we know; that there came in waters even unto His Soul, because peoples prevailed even unto His death, we read, we believe; in the tempest that He was sunk down, because tumult prevailed to His killing, we acknowledge: but that He laboured in crying, and that His jaws were made hoarse, not only we read not, but even on the contrary we read, that He answered not to them a word, in order that there might be fulfilled that which in another Psalm has been said, "I have become as it were a man not hearing, and having not in his mouth reproofs."  And that which in Isaiah has been prophesied, "like a sheep to be sacrificed He was led, and like a lamb before one shearing Him, so He opened not His mouth." [Isaiah 53:7] If He became like a man not hearing, and having not in His mouth reproofs, how did He labour crying, and how were His jaws made hoarse? Is it that He was even then silent, because He was hoarse with having cried so much in vain? And this indeed we know to have been His voice on the Cross out of a certain Psalm: "O God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"  But how great was that voice, or of how long duration, that in it His jaws should have become hoarse? Long while He cried, "Woe unto you, Scribes and Pharisees:"  long while He cried, "Woe unto the world because of offenses." [Matthew 18:7] And truly hoarse in a manner He cried, and therefore was not understood, when the Jews said, What is this that He says? "Hard is this saying, who is able to hear it?"  We know not what He says. He said all these words: but hoarse were His jaws to them that understood not His words. "My eyes have failed from hoping in My God." Far be it that this should be taken of the person of the Head: far be it that His eyes should have failed from  hoping in His God: in whom rather there was God reconciling the world to Himself, [2 Corinthians 5:19] and Who was the Word made flesh and dwelled in us, so that not only God was in Him, but also He was Himself God. Not so then: the eyes of Himself, our Head, failed not from hoping in His God: but the eyes of Him have failed in His Body, that is, in His members. This voice is of the members, this voice is of the Body, not of the Head. How then do we find it in His Body and members?...
