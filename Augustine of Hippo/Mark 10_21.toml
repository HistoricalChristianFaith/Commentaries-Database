I who write this have greatly loved the total devotion of which the Lord spoke when he once said to the rich young man: “Go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and come, follow me.” I have so loved it that I have indeed acted upon it myself, not by my own strength but by his assisting grace. The apostles were the first to follow in the practice of this complete selfgiving. One who gives up bothwhat one owns and what one desires to own, gives up the whole world. Letter , To Hilarius.
