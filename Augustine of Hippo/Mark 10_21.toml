I who write this have greatly loved the total devotion of which the Lord spoke when he once said to the rich young man: “Go, sell what you have and give to the poor, and come, follow me.” I have so loved it that I have indeed acted upon it myself, not by my own strength but by his assisting grace. The apostles were the first to follow in the practice of this complete self-giving. One who gives up both what one owns and what one desires to own, gives up the whole world.
