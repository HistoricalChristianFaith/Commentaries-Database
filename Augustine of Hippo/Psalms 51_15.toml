"O Lord, my lips You shall open, and my mouth shall tell of Your praise" [Psalm 51:15]. "Your praise," because  I have been created: "Your praise," because sinning I have not been forsaken: "Your praise," because I have been admonished to confess: "Your praise," because in order that I might be secured I have been cleansed.
