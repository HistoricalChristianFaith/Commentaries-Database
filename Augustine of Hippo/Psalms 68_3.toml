Lastly, there follows, "And let just men be joyous, and exult in the sight of God, let them delight in gladness" [Psalm 68:3]. For then shall they hear, "Come, you blessed of My Father, receive ye the kingdom."  "Let them be joyous," therefore, that have toiled, "and exult in the sight of God." For there will not be in this exultation, as though it were before men, any empty boasting; but (it will be) in the sight of Him who unerringly looks into that which He has granted. "Let them delight in gladness:" no longer exulting with trembling,  as in this world, so long as "human life is a trial upon earth."
