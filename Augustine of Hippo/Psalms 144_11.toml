"From" this "sword deliver me" [Psalm 144:11]. "And take me out of the hand of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity:" just as before. And that which follows, "their right hand is a right hand of iniquity," the same he had set down before also, when he called them "many waters." For lest you should think that the "many waters" were good waters, he explained them by the "sword of ill intent."

"Lord, deliver me from the hand of the sons of foreigners, whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity." And he explains what kind of vanity he means, and what kind of right hand. What he calls the right hand of iniquity is the prosperity of this world. Not because it is never to be found with good people, but because when good people have it they hold it in the left hand, not in the right. They hold everlasting felicity in their right hand, temporal happiness they hold in their left. Greed for eternal things and eternal felicity ought not to be mixed with greed for temporal things, that is to say, for present and temporal felicity. And that is the meaning of "Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing." So then, "their right hand is a right hand of iniquity."
