"And the Lord abides for ever" [Psalm 9:7]. "Wherefore" then "have the heathen raged, and the people imagined vain things against the Lord, and against His anointed:"  for "the Lord abides for ever. He has prepared His seat in judgment, and He shall judge the world in equity." He prepared His seat when He was judged. For by that patience Man purchased heaven, and God in Man profited believers. And this is the Son's hidden judgment. But seeing He is also to come openly and in the sight of all to judge the quick and the dead, He has prepared His seat in the hidden judgment: and He shall also openly "judge the world in equity:" that is, He shall distribute gifts proportioned to desert, setting the sheep on His right hand, and the goats on His left. [Matthew 25:33] "He shall judge the people with justice" [Psalm 9:8]. This is the same as was said above, "He shall judge the world in equity." Not as men judge who see not the heart, by whom very often worse men are acquitted than are condemned: but "in equity" and "with justice" shall the Lord judge, "conscience bearing witness, and thoughts accusing, or else excusing." [Romans 2:15]
