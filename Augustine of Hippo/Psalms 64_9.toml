"And every man feared" [Psalm 64:9]. They that feared not, were not even men. "Every man feared;" that is, every one using reason to perceive the things which were done. Whence they that feared not, must rather be called cattle, rather beasts savage and cruel. A lion ramping and roaring is that people as yet. But in truth every man feared: that is, they that would believe, that trembled at the judgment to come. "And every man feared: and they declared the works of God."..."And every man has feared: and they have declared the works of God, and His doings they have perceived." What is, "His doings they have perceived"? Was it, O Lord Jesus Christ, that You were silent, and like a sheep for a victim wast being led, and did not open before the shearer Your mouth, [Isaiah 53:7] and we thought You to be set in smiting and in grief, [Isaiah 53:4] and knowing how to bear weakness? [Isaiah 53:3] Was it that You were hiding Your beauty, O Thou beautiful in form before the sons of men?  Was it that You did not seem to have beauty nor grace? [Isaiah 53:2]  You bore on the Cross men reviling and saying, "If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross." [Matthew 27:40] ...This thing they, that would have had Him come down from the Cross, perceived not: but when He rose again, and being glorified ascended into Heaven, they perceived the works of God.
