If you lack earthly riches, do not seek them in the world by evil deeds. If they fall to your lot, let them be stored up in heaven by good works. A manly Christian soul should neither be overjoyed at acquiring them nor cast down when they are gone. Let us instead reflect on what the Lord says: “Where thy treasure is, there your heart will be also.” Surely when we hear that we should lift up our hearts, the familiar answer that we make should not be a lie.
