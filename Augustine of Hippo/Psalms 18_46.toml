"The Lord lives, and blessed be my God." "But to be carnally minded is death:" [RomansÂ 8:6] for "the Lord lives, and blessed be my God. And let the God of my salvation be exalted" [Psalm 18:46]. And let me not think after an earthly fashion of the God of my salvation; nor look from Him for this earthly salvation, but that on high.
