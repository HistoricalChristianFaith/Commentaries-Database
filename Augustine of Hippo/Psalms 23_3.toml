"He has converted my soul: He has led me forth in the paths of righteousness, for His Name's sake" [Psalm 23:3]. He has brought me forth in the narrow ways, wherein few walk, of His righteousness; not for my merit's sake, but for His Name's sake.

“He has converted my soul.” This is a confession rightly to boast about.… You will make it truly … and with an unalterable conscience, if you say it, not on account of your merits but for the sake of his name.
