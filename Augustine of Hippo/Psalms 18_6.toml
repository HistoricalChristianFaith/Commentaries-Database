"And in Mine oppression I called upon the Lord, and cried unto My God. And He heard My voice from His holy temple" [Psalm 18:6]. He heard from My heart, wherein He dwells, My voice. "And My cry in His sight entered into His ears;" and My cry, which I utter, not in the ears of men, but inwardly before Him Himself, "entered into His ears."
