"O worship the Lord in His holy court" [Psalm 96:9]: in the Catholic Church; this is His holy court. Let no man say, "Lo, here is Christ, or there. For there shall arise false prophets." [Matthew 24:23-24] Say this unto them,  "There shall not be left here one stone upon another, that shall not be thrown down." You are calling me to the whited wall; I adore my God in His holy court. "Let the whole earth be moved before His face."
