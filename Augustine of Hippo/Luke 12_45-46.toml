Many people abuse for their own impious purposes his tardiness in coming. The bad slave says, "My master is taking his time." He starts beating his fellow slaves and getting drunk with the bad ones. His master will come on a day he does not know, and at an hour he is unaware of, and will cut him off. You see, it is the body of ministers and prelates who give their fellow slaves their food in due season. "He will separate him off," it says. He has good ones and bad ones. "He separates the good from the bad." "He will assign his portion with the hypocrites." He will not do this to the whole ministry, because in it too there are those who are longing for the Lord to come. In its ranks are also to be found the group of which it is said, "Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, finds so doing." "He will come and separate him."
