"What time as they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people" [Psalm 105:13]. This is a repetition of what he had said, "from one nation to another." "He suffered no man to do them harm: but reproved even kings for their sakes" [Psalm 105:14]. "Touch not," He said, "Mine anointed, and do My prophets no harm" [Psalm 105:15]. He declares the words of God chiding or reproving kings, that they might not harm the holy fathers, while they were small in number, very few, and they strangers in the land of Canaan. Although these words be not read in the books of that history, yet they are to be understood as either secretly spoken, as God speaks in the hearts of men by unseen and true visions, or even as announced through an Angel. For both the king of Gerar and the king of the Egyptians were warned from Heaven not to harm Abraham,  and another king not to harm Isaac, [GenesisÂ 26:8-11] and others not to harm Jacob;  while they were very few, and strangers, before he went over into Egypt to sojourn with his sons: which is understood to be herein mentioned. But since it occurred to ask, before they passed over and multiplied in Egypt, how so few in number, and those strangers in a foreign land, could maintain themselves: he next adds, "He suffered no man to do them wrong," etc.
