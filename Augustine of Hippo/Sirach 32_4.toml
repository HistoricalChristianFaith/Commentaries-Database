“May it be exalted” means nothing other than that the thing in question be raised on high. When this expression is used in a bad sense, it usually means pride, as when the Scripture says, “Do not exalt yourself in your wisdom,” whereas if it is understood in a good sense, the expression supposes a greater honor, as if the thing really were raised on high. In this sense it is written, “In the nights, lift your hands toward the holy, and bless the Lord.”
