Here he shows that his natural death was not the consequence of sin in him but of his own simple will, which was the why, the when and the how [of his death]. For because the Word of God is so commingled [with the flesh] as to be one with it, he says, “I have power to lay it down.”

So take a look at Christ: “I have authority to lay down my life, and I have authority to take it up again; nobody takes it away from me.” “I myself went to sleep”; that, you see, is what he says in the psalm: “I myself went to sleep.” As though to say, “Why are they so excited, why so exultant? Why are the Jews waving their arms with joy, as though they themselves had done anything?” “I myself went to sleep. I,” he says, “who have authority to lay down my life, by laying it down ‘I myself went to sleep, and took my rest.’ ” And since he had the authority to take it up again, he added, “I rose again,” but to give the glory to the Father, “since the Lord took me up.” Do not let these words, where he says, “Since the Lord took me up …” strike your minds as meaning that Christ himself did not raise up his own body. The Father raised him up, and he also raised himself up. How shall we prove to you that he raised himself up? Call to mind what he said to the Jews: “Pull down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
