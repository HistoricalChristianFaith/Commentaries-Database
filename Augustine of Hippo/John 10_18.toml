Here he shows that his natural death was not the consequence of sin in him but of his own simple will, which was the why, the when and the how [of his death]. For because the Word of God is so commingled [with the flesh] as to be one with it, he says, “I have power to lay it down.”

So take a look at Christ: “I have authority to lay down my life, and I have authority to take it up again; nobody takes it away from me.” “I myself went to sleep”; that, you see, is what he says in the psalm: “I myself went to sleep.” As though to say, “Why are they so excited, why so exultant? Why are the Jews waving their arms with joy, as though they themselves had done anything?” “I myself went to sleep. I,” he says, “who have authority to lay down my life, by laying it down ‘I myself went to sleep, and took my rest.’ ” And since he had the authority to take it up again, he added, “I rose again,” but to give the glory to the Father, “since the Lord took me up.” Do not let these words, where he says, “Since the Lord took me up …” strike your minds as meaning that Christ himself did not raise up his own body. The Father raised him up, and he also raised himself up. How shall we prove to you that he raised himself up? Call to mind what he said to the Jews: “Pull down this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”

(Tr. xlvii. 7) i. e. Because I die, to rise again. There is great force in, I lay down. Let not the Jews, He says, boast; rage they may, but if I should not choose to lay down My life, what will they do by raging?

(iv. de Trin. c. xiii.) Wherein He showed that His natural death was not the consequence of sin in Him, but of His own simple will, which was the why, the when, and the how: I have power to lay it down.

(Tr. xlvii) How doth our Lord lay down His own life? Christ is the Word, and man, i. e. in soul and body. Doth the Word lay down His life, and take it again; or doth the human soul, or doth the flesh? If it was the Word of God that laid down His soul and took it again, that soul was at one time separated from the Word. But, though death separated the soul and body, death could not separate the Word and the soul. It is still more absurd to say that the soul laid down itself; if it could not be separated from the Word, how could it be from itself? The flesh therefore layeth down its life and taketh it again, not by its own power, but by the power of the Word which dwelleth in it. This refutes the Apollinarians, who say that Christ had not a human, rational soul.
