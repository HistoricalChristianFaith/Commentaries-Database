"Show the light of Your countenance on Your servant, and teach me your statutes" [Psalm 119:135]: that is, manifest Your presence, by succouring and aiding me. "And teach me Your righteousnesses." Teach me to work them: as it is more plainly expressed elsewhere, "Teach me to do Your will."  For they who hear, although they retain in their memories what they hear, are by no means to be considered to have learned, unless they do. For it is the word of Truth: "Every man that has heard and has learned of the Father, comes unto Me." [JohnÂ 6:45] He therefore who obeys not in deed, that is, who comes not, has not learned.
