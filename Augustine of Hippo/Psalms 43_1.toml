"Judge me, O Lord, and separate my cause from the ungodly nation" [Psalm 43:1]. I do not dread Your judgment, because I know Your mercy. "Judge me, O God," he cries. Now, meanwhile, in this state of pilgrimage, Thou dost not yet separate my place, because I am to live together with the "tares" even to the time of the "harvest:" Thou dost not as yet separate my rain from theirs; my light from theirs: "separate my cause." Let a difference be made between him who believes in You, and him who believes not in You. Our infirmity is the same; but our consciences not the same: our sufferings the same; but our longings not the same. "The desire of the ungodly shall perish,"  but as to the desire of the righteous, we might well doubt, if He were not "sure" who promised. The object of our desires is He Himself, who promises: He will give us Himself, because He has already given Himself to us; He will give Himself in His immortality to us then immortal, even because He gave Himself in His mortality to us when mortal....

Some one, perchance, hears a person saying, “Judge me, O God,” and he is amazed. For one usually says, “May God pardon me; spare me, O God.” Who is there who says, “Judge me, O God”? And sometimes in the psalm this very verse is placed at a pause point, that it may be proffered by the reader and answered by the people. Is there perhaps anyone whose heart is not deeply affected and who is not afraid to sing to God and say, “Judge me, O God”? And yet the people sing it, believing, and do not think that they wrongly desire what they have learned from the divinely inspired text; and if they little understand.… For it continued and showed in the words coming next what kind of judgment it meant, that it is not [the judgment] of damnation but of discerning. For the psalm says, “Judge me, O God.” What does it mean, “Judge me, O God”? “And discern my cause from an unholy nation.” … According to that mode whereby judgment is called distinction, “All of us must be revealed before the judgment seat of Christ so that there” a person “may receive what he has done through the body, whether good or evil”; for it is distinction that good things be distributed to the good, evil things to the evil. For if judgment were received always in regard to evilness, the psalm would not say, “Judge me, O God.”
