But why is there no fear of uttering an indirect lie? We do not deny that free will is healed by the grace of God, but we believe that we make progress through the daily grace of God, and we trust in its help. And people say, “It is in my own power to do good.” If only people did do good! O empty boasting of wretchedness! Every day they disclaim sin, and in their boasting they attribute to themselves unaided free will, not scrutinizing their conscience, which cannot be healed but by grace, so as to say, “Be merciful to me, heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.” What would those do who boast of their own free will—which is not denied so long as it is helped by the grace of God—if death had now been swallowed up in victory, if our mortal were putting on immortality and our corruptible were putting on incorruption? Behold, their wounds fester, and they seek a remedy in pride. They do not say with the just person, “Unless the Lord had been my helper, my soul had almost dwelled in hell.” They do not say with the saint, “Except the Lord guards the city, he watches in vain that guards it.”

The one who arranged the contest helps the contestant. God, you see, does not watch you in the ring in the same way as the populace watch a charioteer; they know how to shout, they do not know how to help. God does not watch you battling in the ring in the same way as the president at the games watches an athlete and prepares a crown of leaves for the winner; he does not know how to give strength to the man struggling in the arena, and he cannot do it anyhow; after all he is a man, not God. And perhaps while he is watching, he endures more weariness sitting there than the other does as he wrestles. God, you see, when he watches his champions, helps them when they call on him. I mean, it is the voice of his athlete in the psalm, “If I said, my foot is slipping, your mercy, Lord, came to my help.” So, my brothers and sisters, do not let us be slow about it; let us ask, let us seek, let us knock. “For everyone who asks receives, and who seeks will find, and who knocks will have the door opened.”

All the same, you must not think that you are in every respect or immediately going to be strong or … going to fail utterly by despairing. After all, that alternation of failure and of strength in the arms of God’s servant Moses was, perhaps, your alternation. Sometimes, you see, you fail in your trials and temptations, but do not totally succumb to them. Moses let his arms droop a little but did not collapse altogether. “If I were to say, my foot has slipped, behold, your mercy, Lord, would come to my help.” So do not be afraid; the one is present on the journey to help you along, who was not absent in Egypt to set you free. Do not be afraid, step out along the road, be confident and throw care to the winds. Sometimes he lowered his arms, sometimes he lifted them up; anyway, Amalek was defeated. They were able to wage war, they were not able to win.

So, to conclude this sermon where we began it, let us pray and put all our trust in God; let us live as he commands us, and when we stumble and stagger in this life, let us call on him as the disciples called upon him when they said, “Lord, increase our faith.” Peter too was full of confidence and staggered; yet he was not ignored and allowed to drown but given a helping hand and set on his feet. Just what, after all, did he place his confidence in? It was not in himself, it was in the Lord. How is that? “Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you over the water.” The Lord, you remember, was walking over the waters. “If it is you, bid me come to you over the water.” I know, you see, that if it is you, you have only to command, and it will happen. And he said, “Come.” Peter got down from the boat at his command; he began to tremble at his own weakness. And yet when he grew afraid Peter cried out to him: “Lord, deliver me,” he said. Then the Lord took him by the hand and said, “Little faith, why did you doubt?” It was Jesus that invited him, he that delivered him when Peter tottered and staggered. “This fulfilled what was said in the psalm, “If I said, My foot has slipped, your mercy, Lord, would come to my help.”
