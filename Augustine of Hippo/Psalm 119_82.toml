"My eyes," he says, "have failed for Your word, saying, O when will You comfort me?" [Psalm 119:82]. Behold that praiseworthy and blessed failing, in the eyes again, but his inner eyes, not arising from infirmity of mind, but from the strength of his longing for the promise of God: for this he says, "for Your word." But in what sense can such eyes say, "When will You comfort me?" save when we pray and groan with such earnestness and ardent expectation? For the tongue, not the eyes, is wont to speak: but in some sense the voice of the eyes is the longing of prayer. But in the words, "When will You comfort me?" he shows that he endures as it were delay. Whence is this also, "How long, Lord, will You punish me?"  And this is done either that the happiness may be the sweeter when deferred, or this is the sentiment of those who long, since the space of time, which may be short to Him who comes to their aid, is tedious to the loving. But God knows what He does and when, for He "has ordered all things in measure and number and weight." [WisdomÂ 11:18]
