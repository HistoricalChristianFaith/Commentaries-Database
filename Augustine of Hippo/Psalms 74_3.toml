"Lift up Your hand upon their pride at the end" [Psalm 74:3]. As You repelled us at the end, so "lift up Your hand upon the pride of them at the end." The pride of whom? Of those by whom Jerusalem was overthrown. But by whom was it, but by the kings of the Gentiles? Well was the hand of Him lifted up upon the pride of them at the end: for they too have now known Christ. "For the end of the Law is Christ for righteousness to every one believing." [Romans 10:4] How well does he wish for them! As if angry he is speaking, and he is seeming to speak evil:  and O that there would come to pass the evil which he speaks: nay now in the name of Christ that it is coming to pass let us rejoice. Now they holding the sceptre are being made subject to the Word of the Cross: now is coming to pass that which was foretold, "there shall adore Him all the kings of the earth, all nations shall serve Him."  Now on the brows of kings more precious is the sign of the Cross, than the jewel of a crown. "Lift up Your hand upon the pride of them at the end. How great things has the enemy of malice wrought in Your holy places!" In those which were Your holy places, that is, in the temple, in the priesthood, in all those sacraments which were at that time. In good truth the enemy at that time wrought. For the Gentiles at that time who did this, were worshipping false Gods, were adoring idols, were serving demons: nevertheless they wrought many evil things on the Saints of God. When could they if they had not been permitted? But when would they have been permitted, unless those holy things, at first promised, were no longer necessary, when He that had promised was Himself holden? Therefore, "how great things has the enemy of malice wrought in Your holy places!"
