"Nevertheless, God shall redeem my soul" [Psalm 49:15]. Behold the voice of one hoping in the future: "Nevertheless, God shall redeem my soul."  Perhaps it is the voice of one still wishing to be relieved from oppression. Some one is in prison, he says, "God shall redeem my soul:" some one is in bond, "God shall redeem my soul:" some one is suffering peril by sea, is being tossed by waves and raging tempests, what says he? "God shall redeem my soul." They would be delivered for the sake of this life. Not such is the voice of this man. Hear what follows: "God shall redeem my soul from the hand of hell, when He shall have received me." He is speaking of this redemption, which Christ now shows in Himself. For He has descended into hell, and has ascended into heaven. What we have seen in the Head we have found in the Body. For what we have believed in the Head, they that have seen, have themselves told us, and by themselves we have seen: "For we are" all "one body." [Romans 12:5] But are they better that hear, we worse to whom it has been told? Not so says The Life Itself, Our Shepherd Himself. For He rebukes a certain disciple of His, doubting and desiring to handle His scars, and when he had handled the scars and had cried out, saying, "My Lord and my God," [John 20:28] seeing His disciple doubting, and looking to the whole world about to believe, "Because you have seen Me," He says, "you have believed: blessed are they that see not, and believe." "But God shall redeem my soul from the land of hell, when He has received me." Here then what? Labour, oppression, tribulation, temptation: expect nothing else. Where joy? In future hope....
