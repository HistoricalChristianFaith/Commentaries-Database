But what is it that follows: "My zeal has caused me to pine" [Psalm 119:139]; or, as other copies read, Your zeal? Others have also, "The zeal of Your house:" and, "has eaten me up," instead of, "has caused me to pine." This, as it seems to me, has been considered as an emendation to be introduced from another Psalm, where it is written, "The zeal of Your house has eaten me up:"  a text quoted also, as we know, in the Gospel. The two words, however, "has caused me to pine," and "has eaten me up," are somewhat like. But the words, "my zeal," which most of the copies read, occasion no dispute: for what wonder is it if every man pines away from his own zeal? The words read in other copies, "Your zeal," signify a man zealous for God, not for himself: but there is no difficulty in using "my" in the same sense...The Psalmist's jealousy is therefore also to be understood in a good sense: for he adds the cause, and says, "Because mine enemies have forgotten Your words."...
