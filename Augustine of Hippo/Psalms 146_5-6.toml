There can be no doubt, of course, that the poor man being God-fearing, while trapped in his temporal miseries, was thinking how this life must end sometime and how eternal rest is to be gained. They both died, but that poor man's thoughts did not perish on that day. You see, it happened that the beggar died and was taken away by the angels to Abraham's bosom. On that day all his thoughts were healed. And because Lazarus translated into English means "Helped"—if you are called Lazarus in Hebrew, you are called "Helped" in English—this psalm has rightly advised us, "Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob." When his spirit goes out and his flesh returns to its earth, his thoughts will not perish, because "his hope is in the Lord his God." This is the lesson learned in the school of Christ the teacher, this is what is hoped for by the heart of the faithful hearer, this is the reward of the only true savior."
