Paul could be fulfilling the open works of the law, either by fear of man or God, and yet have evil affections within himself.… Knowing himself to be such in his internal affections, before the grace of God which is in Jesus Christ our Lord, the apostle elsewhere confesses this very plainly.… “For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish and unbelieving, erring, serving various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and holding one another in hatred.” Such was Saul even when he says that he was touching the righteousness which is in the law, without reproach.
