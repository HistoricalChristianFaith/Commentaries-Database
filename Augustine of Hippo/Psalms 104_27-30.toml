Let us all therefore fix our gaze on him, that he may feed our hungry souls; he himself was hungry for our sake, seeing that “he became poor though he was rich, in order that by his poverty we might be enriched.” How appropriate that we sang to him just now, “All things look to you to give them their food at the proper time.” If all things, then all people; if all people, then us too. So if I am going to give you anything good in this sermon, it is not I who shall be giving it but he from whom we all receive because we all look to him. It is time for him to give, but we must do what he said if he is to give, namely, we must look to him. Let us gaze on him with our minds, because just as the eyes and ears of your bodies are turned to me, so the eyes and ears of your minds should be turned to him.

Don’t we see such things every day in human affairs—a kind of hard and inexorable mercy? How many things sick people ask the doctors for, counter to their health, and how many things the doctors, in mercy, refuse them! They refuse them and so spare them; if they grant them, they are being cruel. The doctor knows this; and doesn’t God? The one who was created like you knows how to deal with you in this way; and doesn’t the one who created you both know how to deal with you both? Accordingly, dearly beloved, in all your troubles, all your fears, all your joys, beg God to grant you, of temporal goods, what he knows is best for you. As for eternal things, though, such as “hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, your will be done as in heaven also on earth,” and others of that sort, ask for them without a qualm or qualification; they cannot possibly be to your disadvantage.Choose, cherish, gather; he opens his hand, after all, and fills every soul with blessing. “And when you give,” it says, “they gather.” None of us should have any doubts about heavenly good things; even if they are deferred, they will be given. The reward is not being refused, but desire is being whetted. We must go on desiring day after day, because it is a great thing we are going to receive. We must go on thirsting day after day, because it is the fountain of life we shall be drinking from. All the same, dearly beloved, there is something it is not an impudence for us to ask for, because the apostle taught us; let us ask that “we may spend a quiet and tranquil life, and with all piety and charity.”
