The Lord Jesus Christ said, “Elijah has come already, and he is John the Baptist.” John, however, when asked, proclaimed that he was not Elijah, just as [he proclaimed] that neither was he the Christ. And, indeed, just as he truly proclaimed that he was not the Christ, so he truly proclaimed that neither was he Elijah.How then shall we compare the words of the herald with the words of the judge? Far be it from the herald to lie, for he says what he hears from the judge. Why then did he say, “I am not Elijah” and the Lord said, “He is Elijah”? Because in him the Lord Jesus Christ wished to prefigure his future coming and to say that John was in the spirit of Elijah. And what John was to the first coming, this will Elijah be to the second coming.… When John was conceived, or rather when he was born, the Holy Spirit prophesied that this was to be fulfilled with regard to that man. “And he will be,” he said, “the forerunner of the most high, in the spirit and power of Elijah.” Not then Elijah but “in the spirit and power of Elijah.” What is “in the spirit and power of Elijah”? It means in the same Holy Spirit in place of Elijah. Why in place of Elijah? Because what Elijah is to the second coming, this John was to the first.
