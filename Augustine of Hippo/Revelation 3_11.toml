I have said all this about those who have been predestined to the kingdom of God, whose number is so fixed that not one can be added to it or taken from it. I have not been speaking of those who, although he had declared and spoken, have been called but not chosen, because they were not called according to his purpose. The fact that the number of the elect is fixed, not to be increased or diminished, is suggested even by John the Baptist, where he says, “Bring forth therefore fruit befitting repentance. And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our father.’ For I say to you that God is able out of these stones to raise up children to Abraham.” The words show that those who do not bring forth fruit are to be cut off, in such a way, however, that the number [of children] promised to Abraham will not fall short. However, it is more openly declared in the Apocalypse: “Hold fast what you have, that no one receive your crown.” For if another is not to receive a crown, unless someone first lose it, the number is fixed.
