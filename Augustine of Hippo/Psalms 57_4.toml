"And has drawn out," he says, "my soul from the midst of the lions' whelps" [Psalm 57:4]. Why do you say, "And has drawn out my soul"? For what had you suffered, that your soul should be drawn out? "I have slept troubled." Christ has intimated His death....

But if, after all these preceding actions of yours, you also shouted, "Crucify, crucify," hear what the prophet also shouts against you, "The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, their tongue a sharpened sword." See with what weapons, with what arrows, with what sword you have put to death a just man when you said that it was not lawful for you to put anyone to death. So it is that, although the chief priests had not come themselves but had sent others to arrest Jesus, the Evangelist Luke in the same place in his narrative said, "But Jesus said to those who had come to him," namely, "the chief priests and the magistrates of the temple and the elders, 'Have you come out, as it were, against a thief?' " and so on. Since, therefore, the chief priests [came] not themselves but in those whom they have sent for arresting Jesus, what else does it mean than that they themselves came in their power of giving the order? So all who shouted with ungodly voices for him to be crucified, they themselves killed him, not indeed by themselves but yet by him who was driven to this sacrilegious crime by their shouting.

See the kind of murder, brothers. The devil is called a murderer, not armed with a sword, not girded with a weapon; he came to humankind, he planted an evil word, and he killed him. Do not, then, think that you are not a murderer when you persuade your brother to do evils; if you persuade your brother to do evils, you kill him. And, that you may know that you kill him, hear the psalm: "The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, their tongue a sharp sword."
