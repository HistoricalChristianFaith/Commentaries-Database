"And you have given mine enemies the back to me" [Psalm 18:40]. And you have turned mine enemies, and hast made them to be a back to me, that is, to follow me. "And You have destroyed them that hate me." But such other of them as have persisted in hatred, You have destroyed.

41. "And thou hast given mine enemies the back to me" (ver. 40). And thou hast turned mine enemies, and hast made them to be a back to me, that is, to follow me. "And Thou hast destroyed them that hate me." But such other of them as have persisted in hatred, Thou hast destroyed.
