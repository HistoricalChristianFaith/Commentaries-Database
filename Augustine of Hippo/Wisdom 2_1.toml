“They are corrupt, they do abominable things, no one does what is right.” Listen to these corrupt people. They in fact “have spoken among themselves, reasoning unsoundly.” Corruption begins with bad faith. From there it passes to depraved habits, later leading to the most violent injustice. This is, in general, the ladder one climbs. What, then, did they say among themselves, thinking badly, “our life is short and sorrowful”? From this mistaken conviction proceeds what the apostle also spoke of: “Let us eat and drink, because tomorrow we die.” But in the book of Wisdom this wantonness is described more thoroughly: “Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither. Let us leave signs of our enjoyment.” And after this more thorough description of wantonness, what do we read? “Let us kill the poor, just person,” which is as much as to say, “God does not exist.”

When you say to yourself, “The happiness of this world is false,” though you dare not express it, I nevertheless see in your heart that perhaps you wrinkle up your nose, mockingly, and say to yourself, “Maybe it will go well for me here! What comes after, I don’t know.” And it is not a small thing that you at least say that you do not know, so as to not perhaps also say, “Our life is short and sorrowful, and there is no remedy when a person dies. No one has been known to return from Hades.” At least you say, “I don’t know.” Recognizing one’s ignorance is a step toward knowledge. I speak to you, therefore, as if you were to say to me, “I don’t know what there could be after death. I simply don’t know whether the righteous will be blessed and sinners unhappy, or if both will cease to exist.” Even not knowing, you would nevertheless not have the audacity to say that after death sinners will be blessed and the righteous unhappy. You cannot say, even if you suppose that both will no longer exist, that after death the godless will enjoy a better state and the righteous will suffer. Not even your ignorance can lead you to speak like that. Say, therefore, “I don’t know if after death it will go well for the righteous and badly for the godless, or if both the one and the other will exist insensibly.”
