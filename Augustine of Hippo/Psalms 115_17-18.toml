...But nevertheless since they derive the truth and richness of wisdom, not from man nor through man, but through God Himself, they have received little ones who shall be heaven, that they may know that they are heaven of heaven; as yet however earth, unto which they say, "I have planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the increase." [1 Corinthians 3:6] For to those very sons of men whom He made heaven, He who knows how to provide for the earth through heaven, has given earth upon which they work. May they therefore abide, heaven and earth, in their God, who made them, and let them live from Him, confessing unto Him, and praising Him; for if they choose to live from themselves, they shall die, as it is written, "From the dead, as though he were not, confession ceases." [Sirach 17:26] But, "The dead praise not You, O Lord, neither all they that go down into silence" [Psalm 115:17]. For the Scripture in another passage proclaims, "The sinner, when he comes into the abyss of wickednesses, scorns."  "But we, who live, will praise the Lord, from this time forth for evermore" [Psalm 115:18].
