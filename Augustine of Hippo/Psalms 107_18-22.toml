"Their soul abhorred all manner of meat" [Psalm 107:18]. Now they suffer satiety. They are sick of satiety. They are in danger from satiety. Unless perchance you think they could be killed with famine, but cannot with satiety. See what follows. When he had said, "Their soul abhorred all manner of meat," lest you should think them, as it were, safe of their fullness, and not rather see that they would die of satiety: "And they came near," he says, "even unto the gates of death." What then remains? That even when the word of God delights you, thou account it not to yourself; nor for this be puffed up with any sort of arrogance, and having an appetite for food, proudly spurn at those who are in danger from satiety. "And they cried out unto the Lord when they were in trouble, and He delivered them out of their distresses" [Psalm 107:19]. And because it was a sickness not to be pleased, "He sent His Word, and healed them" [Psalm 107:20]. See what evil there is in satiety; see whence He delivers, to whom he cries that loathes his food. "He sent His Word, and healed them, and snatched them," from whence? Not from wandering, not from hunger, not from the difficulty of overcoming sins, but "from their corruption." It is a sort of corruption of the mind to loathe what is sweet. Therefore also of this benefit, as of the others before, "Let them confess to the Lord His mercies, and His wonders unto the sons of men" [Psalm 107:21]. "And sacrifice the sacrifice of praise" [Psalm 107:22]. For now that He may be praised, the Lord is sweet, "and let them tell out His works with gladness." Not with weariness, not with sadness, not with anxiety, not with loathing, but "with gladness."
