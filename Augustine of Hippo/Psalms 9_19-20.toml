"Arise, O Lord, let not man prevail" [Psalm 9:19]. The future judgment is prayed for: but before it come, "Let the heathen," says he, "be judged in Your sight:" that is, in secret; which is called in God's sight, with the knowledge of a few holy and righteous ones. "Place a lawgiver over them, O Lord." [Psalm 9:20]. He seems to me to point out Antichrist: of whom the Apostle says, "When the man of sin shall be revealed." [2 Thessalonians 2:3] "Let the heathen know that they are men." That they who will be set free by the Son of God, and belong to the Son of Man, and be sons of men, that is, new men, may serve man, that is, the old man the sinner, "for that they are men."
