And what are we saying, brothers? Aren’t there any good shepherds? Doesn’t it say in another passage of the Scriptures, “I will set up for them shepherds after my own heart, and they shall feed them with instruction.” So how can he fail to give the sheep he takes from the bad shepherds to good ones, and say, as though there were absolutely no good ones left anywhere at all, “I will feed them”? He said to Peter, “Feed my sheep.” So what are we to make of it? When the sheep are entrusted to Peter, the Lord does not say on that occasion, “I will feed my sheep, don’t you do it,” but, “Peter, do you love me? Feed my sheep.”
