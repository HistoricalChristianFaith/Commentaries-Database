Accordingly, as the Scripture says, “And by the command of the Lord the good counsel of Ahithophel was defeated, that the Lord might bring evil upon Absalom.” The counsel of Ahithophel was called “good” because it served his purpose for the time, since it favored Absalom over his father whom he had risen up against in rebellion. And it might well have destroyed him if the Lord had not frustrated Ahithophel’s counsel by influencing the heart of Absalom to reject this counsel and to choose another which was not to his advantage.
