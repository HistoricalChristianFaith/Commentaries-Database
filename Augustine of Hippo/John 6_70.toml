In “Have I not chosen you twelve,” … twelve seems to be a sacred number used in the case of those who were to spread the doctrine of the Trinity through the four quarters of the world. That is the reason of the three times four [which equals twelve]. Judas, then, only cut himself off. He did not profane the number twelve. He abandoned his teacher, for God appointed a successor to take his place.

Evil people make evil use of all the good creations of God. Good people, on the other hand, make good use of the evil actions of the wicked. And who is as good as the one and only God? … For as the wicked turn the good works of God to an evil use, so inversely God turns the evil works of human beings to good. What can be worse than what Judas did? He was chosen as the treasurer among the Twelve who would dispense gifts to the poor. But instead of being thankful for so great an honor and favor, he took the money and lost righteousness. Being dead, he betrayed life. The one he followed as a disciple he betrayed as an enemy. Yet our Lord made a good use of his wickedness, allowing himself to be betrayed so that he might redeem us.… If God employs the evil works of the devil himself for good, whatever the evil person does by making bad use of God’s good gifts only hurts himself. It in no way contradicts the goodness of God.
