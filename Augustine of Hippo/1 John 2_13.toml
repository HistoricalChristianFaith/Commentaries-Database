I write unto you, fathers. 1 John 2:13 Why first sons? Because your sins are forgiven you through His name, and you are regenerated into a new life, therefore sons. Why fathers? Because you have known Him that is from the beginning: for the beginning has relation unto fatherhood. Christ new in flesh, but ancient in Godhead. How ancient think we? How many years old? Think we, of greater age than His mother? Assuredly of greater age than His mother, for all things were made by Him. John 1:3 If all things, then did the Ancient make the very mother of whom the New should be born. Was He, think we, before His mother only? Yea, and before His mother's ancestors is His antiquity. The ancestor of His mother was Abraham; and the Lord says, Before Abraham I am. John 8:58 Before Abraham, say we? The heaven and earth, ere man was, were made. Before these was the Lord, nay rather also is. For right well He says, not, Before Abraham I was, but, Before Abraham I Am . For that of which one says, was, is not; and that of which one says, will be, is not yet: He knows not other than to be. As God, He knows to be: was, and will be, He knows not. It is one day there, but a day that is for ever and ever. That day yesterday and tomorrow do not set in the midst between them: for when the 'yesterday' is ended, the 'today' begins, to be finished by the coming 'tomorrow.' That one day there is a day without darkness, without night, without spaces, without measure, without hours. Call it what you will: if you will, it is a day; if you will, a year; if you will, years. For it is said of this same, And your years shall not fail. But when is it called a day? When it is said to the Lord, Today have I begotten You. From the eternal Father begotten, from eternity begotten, in eternity begotten: with no beginning, no bound, no space of breadth; because He is what is, because Himself is He that Is. This His name He told to Moses: You shall say unto them, He that Is has sent me unto you. Exodus 3:14 Why speak then of before Abraham? Why, before Noe? Why, before Adam? Hear the Scripture: Before the day-star have I begotten You. In fine, before heaven and earth. Wherefore? Because all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made. John 1:3 By this you know the fathers: for they become fathers by acknowledging That which is from the beginning.

I write unto you, young men. There are sons, are fathers, are young men: sons, because begotten; fathers, because they acknowledge the Beginning; why young men? Because you have overcome the wicked one. In the sons, birth: in the fathers, antiquity: in the young men, strength. If the wicked one is overcome by the young men, he fights with us. Fights, but not conquers. Wherefore? Because we are strong, or because He is strong in us who in the hands of the persecutors was found weak? He has made us strong, who resisted not His persecutors. For He was crucified of weakness, but He lives by the power of God. 2 Corinthians 13:4

I write unto you, children. 1 John ii.13 Whence children? Because you have known the Father. I write unto you fathers: he enforces this, and repeats, Because you have known Him that is from the beginning. Remember that you are fathers: if you forget Him that is from the beginning, you have lost your fatherhood. I write unto you, young men. Again and again consider that you are young men: fight, that you may overcome: overcome, that you may be crowned: be lowly, that you fall not in the fight. I write unto you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked one.
