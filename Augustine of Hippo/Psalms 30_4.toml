"Sing to the Lord, O you saints of His." The prophet seeing these future things, rejoices, and says, "Sing to the Lord, O you saints of His. And make confession of the remembrance of His holiness" [Psalm 30:4]. And make confession to Him, that He has not forgotten the sanctification, wherewith He has sanctified you, although all this intermediate period belong to your desires.
