What too would fear profit, unless "the gracious and merciful Lord" gave "meat unto them that fear Him"? [Psalm 111:5]; meat that does not spoil, "bread that comes down from heaven," which He gave to no deservings of ours. For "Christ died for the ungodly." [Romans 5:6] No one then would give such food, save a gracious and merciful Lord. But if He gave so much to this life, if the sinner who was to be justified received the Word made flesh; what shall he receive when glorified in a future world? For, "He shall ever be mindful of His covenant." Nor has He who has given a pledge, given the whole.
