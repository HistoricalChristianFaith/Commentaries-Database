What does he promise believers? “And you shall know the truth.” Why is that? Hadn’t they come to such knowledge when the Lord was speaking? If they had not, how did they believe? They believed, not because they knew but so that they might come to know. For we believe in order that we may know. We do not know in order that we may believe. For what we shall yet know, “neither eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor has it entered the heart of man [humankind].” For what is faith, but believing what you do not see? Faith then is to believe what you do not see. Truth is seeing what you have believed, as Christ himself says in a certain place. … But isn’t what you [Christ] have been speaking the truth? It is the truth, but as yet it is only believed, not seen. If you abide in what is believed, you shall attain to what is seen.

We are God’s money: we have wandered away as coin from the treasury. The impression that was stamped on us has been rubbed out by our wandering. He has come to mint us again, for he is the one who minted us in the first place, and he himself is asking for his money, as Caesar asks for his. Therefore he says, “Render unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s and unto God the things that are God’s,” to Caesar his money, to God yourselves. And then shall the truth be reproduced in us.

Someone might say, And what does it profit me to know the truth? “And the truth shall set you free.” If the truth does not appeal to you, then let freedom have its charms. In the Latin we use the word free chiefly in the sense of escape from danger, relief from care. But the proper signification of “to be free” is “to be made free,” just as “to be saved” is “to be made safe.” … This is plainer in the Greek.

Our freedom comes when we subject ourselves to the truth. And this truth is our God who frees us from death, that is, from the condition of sin. For he himself spoke of this truth as a man among people when he spoke to those who believed: “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” For the soul enjoys nothing in freedom unless it enjoys it in peace.

From what shall the truth free us except from death, corruption and changeableness, since truth itself remains immortal, incorrupt and unchangeable? But true immortality, true incorruptibility, true unchangeableness is eternity itself.
