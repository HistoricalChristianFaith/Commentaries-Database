Someone might say, And what does it profit me to know the truth? “And the truth shall set you free.” If the truth does not appeal to you, then let freedom have its charms. In the Latin we use the word free chiefly in the sense of escape from danger, relief from care. But the proper signification of “to be free” is “to be made free,” just as “to be saved” is “to be made safe.” … This is plainer in the Greek.

Our freedom comes when we subject ourselves to the truth. And this truth is our God who frees us from death, that is, from the condition of sin. For he himself spoke of this truth as a man among people when he spoke to those who believed: “If you remain in my word, then you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.” For the soul enjoys nothing in freedom unless it enjoys it in peace.

From what shall the truth free us except from death, corruption and changeableness, since truth itself remains immortal, incorrupt and unchangeable? But true immortality, true incorruptibility, true unchangeableness is eternity itself.
