At the time David spoke in this way: “Since if you had wanted a sacrifice I would certainly have given one; in burnt offerings you will not delight.” [However,] those sacrifices that were still offered to God are no longer offered now. He was prophesying, therefore, when he said this: he was rejecting current customs and foreseeing future ones. “In burnt offerings,” he says, “you will not delight. When you [the congregation] stop delighting in burnt offerings, will you be left without any sacrifice? Certainly not.” “A sacrifice to God is a contrite spirit: a contrite and humbled heart God does not despise.” Therefore you do have something to offer. Don’t look around the flock, don’t fit out ships and travel to far distant regions to bring back incense. Look in your own heart for what may be acceptable to God. The heart has to be crushed. Why be afraid it will be destroyed if you crush it? There you have the answer: “Create a clean heart in me, O God.” For a clean heart to be created, let the unclean heart be crushed.

So this lad had already crushed his heart in a region afflicted with famine; I mean, he had returned to his heart to pound his heart; he had previously left his heart in pride; he had now returned to his heart in anger. He was angry with himself, ready to punish not himself but his wrongdoing; he had returned, ready to earn his father’s right response. He spoke in anger, according to the text, “Be angry, and do not sin.” Repentance, you see, always means being angry with yourself, seeing that because you are angry, you punish yourself. That is the source of all those gestures in penitents who are truly repentant, truly sorry; the source of tearing the hair, of wrapping oneself in sackcloth, of beating the breast. Surely these are all indications of being savage with oneself, being angry with oneself. What the hand does outwardly, the conscience does inwardly; it lashes itself in its thoughts, it beats itself, indeed, to speak more truly, it slays itself. It is by slaying itself, you see, that it offers itself “a sacrifice to God, a crushed spirit; a contrite and humbled heart God does not reject.” Just so, then, this lad by pounding, humbling, beating his heart, slew his heart.

No matter how great our crimes, forgiveness of them should never be despised in the holy church for those who truly repent, each according to the measure of his sin. And, in the act of repentance, where a crime has been committed of such gravity as also to cut off the sinner from the body of Christ, we should not consider the amount of time as much as the degree of sorrow. For “a contrite and humbled heart God will not despise.”
