The garment that is required is in the heart, not on the body, for if it had been put on externally, it could not have been concealed even from the servants. But what is the wedding garment that must be put on? We learn it from these words, “May your priests be clothed with righteousness.” It is of that garment of righteousness that the apostle speaks when he says, “Because when we are clothed, we are not found naked.” In this way the unprepared man was discovered by the Lord of the feast, interrogated, bound and thrown out, one from among the many.
