"And blessed be the name of His glory  for everlasting, and for age of age" [Psalm 72:19]. For what else should the Latin interpreters have said, who could not have said for everlasting, and for everlasting of everlasting? For it sounds as if one thing were meant in the expression "for everlasting," and another thing in the expression "for age:" but the Greek has eis ton aiona, kai eis ton aiona tou aionos, which perchance more meetly might have been rendered by, "for age, and for age of age:" so that by "for age," might have been understood as long as this age  endures; but "for age of age," that which after the end of this is promised to be. "And there shall be fulfilled with the glory of Him every land: so be it, so be it." You have commanded, O Lord, so it is coming to pass: so it is coming to pass, until that which began with the river, may attain fully even unto the ends of the round world.
