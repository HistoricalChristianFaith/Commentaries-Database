"For by You shall I be delivered from temptation" [Psalm 18:29]. For not by myself, but by You, shall I be delivered from temptation. "And in my God shall I leap over the wall." And not in myself, but in my God shall I leap over the wall, which sin has raised between men and the heavenly Jerusalem.
