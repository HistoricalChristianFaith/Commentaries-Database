"Hope ye in Him all the council of the people" [Psalm 62:8]. Imitate ye Idithun, leap over your enemies; men fighting against you, stopping up your way, men hating you, leap ye over: "Hope in Him all the council of the people: pour out before Him your hearts:"...By imploring, by confessing, by hoping. Do not keep back your hearts within your hearts: "Pour out before Him your hearts." That perishes not which you pour out. For He is my Taker up. If He takes up, why do you fear to pour out? "Cast upon the Lord your care, and hope in Him."  What fear ye amid whisperers, slanderers hateful to God, [Romans 1:29-30] where they are able openly assailing, where they are unable secretly lying in wait, falsely praising, truly at enmity, amid them what do you fear? "God is our Helper." Do they anywise equal God? Are they anywise stronger than He? "God is our Helper," be ye without care. "If God is for us, who is against us?" [Romans 8:31] "Pour out before Him your hearts," by leaping over unto Him, by lifting up your souls: "God is our helper."..."Nevertheless, vain are the sons of men, and liars are the sons of men in the balances, in order that they may deceive, being at one because of vanity" [Psalm 62:9]. Certainly many men there are: behold there is that one man, that one man that was cast forth from the multitude of guests. [Matthew 22:11] They conspire, they all seek things temporal, and they that are carnal things carnal, and for the future they hope them, whosoever do hope: even if because of variety of opinions they are in division, nevertheless because of vanity they are at one. Divers indeed are errors and of many forms, and the kingdom against itself divided shall not stand: [Matthew 12:25] but alike in all is the will vain and lying, belonging to one king, with whom into fire everlasting it is to be thrown headlong [Matthew 25:41] — "these men because of vanity are at one." And for them see how He thirsts, see how He runs in thirst.
