“There is no authority but God’s.” Jesus also taught that someone is a greater sinner who maliciously delivers up the innocent to be killed by such an authority than the authority itself, if that authority kills him through fear of another authority that is greater still. This was the kind of authority that God had given to Pilate, since Pilate was under the authority of Caesar.
