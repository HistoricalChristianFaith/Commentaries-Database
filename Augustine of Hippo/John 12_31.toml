The judgment that is looked for in the end will be the judging of the living and the dead, the awarding of eternal rewards and punishment. But what kind of judgment, then, [takes place] now?… There is a judgment spoken of [now] that is not condemnation but discernment.… This is what he calls judgment here, that is, this righteous separation, this expulsion of the devil from Christ’s own redeemed.… The Lord, therefore, was foretelling what he already knew, that after his own passion and glorification, many nations throughout the whole world, in whose hearts the devil lived as an inmate, would become believers, and the devil when thus renounced by faith would be cast out.But someone might ask: Wasn’t the devil cast out of the hearts of the patriarchs and prophets and the righteous people of old? Certainly he was. How then can it be said that now he shall be cast out? Then it was done in the case of a few individuals, but now it is foretold that it will take place rapidly and among many people and mighty nations.… But someone might further ask: Since the devil is cast out of the hearts of believers, does he now stop tempting the faithful? No, he has not stopped tempting. But it is one thing to reign within and another to lay siege from without.
