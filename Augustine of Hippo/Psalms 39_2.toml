"I became deaf, and was humbled, I held my peace from good" [Psalm 39:2]. For this person, who is "leaping beyond," suffers some difficulty in a certain stage to which he has already attained; and he desires to advance beyond, even from thence, to avoid this difficulty. I was afraid of committing a sin; so that I spoke not; that I imposed on myself the necessity of silence: for I had spoken thus, "I will take heed to my ways, that I may not sin with my tongue." Whilst I was too much afraid of saying anything wrong, I kept silence from all that is good. For whence could I say good things, except that I heard them? "It is Thou that shall make me to hear of joy and gladness."  And the "friend of the bridegroom stands and hears Him, and rejoices on account of the bridegroom's voice," [John 3:29] not his own. That he may speak true things, he hears what he is to say. For it is he that "speaks a lie," that "speaks of his own." [John 8:44] ...When therefore I had "put a bridle," as it were, "on my lips;" and constrained myself to silence, because I saw that everywhere speech was dangerous, then, says he, that came to pass upon me, which I did not wish, "I became deaf, and was humbled;" not humbled myself, but was humbled; "and I held my peace even from good." Whilst afraid of saying any evil, I began to refrain from speaking what is good: and I condemned my determination; for "I was holding my peace even from what is good."
