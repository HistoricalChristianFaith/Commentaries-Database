“What about the prohibition, ‘You shall not kill,’ which is also there? If killing is evil in every respect, how will the just who, in obedience to a law, have killed many, be excused from this charge?” The answer to this question is that he does not kill who is the executor of a just command.

It is significant that in Holy Scripture no passage can be found enjoining or permitting suicide either in order to hasten our entry into immortality or to void or avoid temporal evils. God’s command, “You shall not kill,” is to be taken as forbidding self-destruction, especially as it does not add “your neighbor,” as it does when it forbids false witness, “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.”
