In the meantime, while they were waiting to know who this [judge] was, he went on to add, “The word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him at the last day.” He makes it sufficiently clear that he himself will judge at the last day. For the word that he speaks is himself. He speaks himself, announces himself and sets himself as the gate where he enters as the Shepherd to his sheep. We gather too from these words that those who have not heard will be judged differently from those who have heard and despised it.
