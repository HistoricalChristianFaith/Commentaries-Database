“And then, lest Adam stretch forth his hand to the tree of life and live forever, God dismissed him from paradise.” It is well put, “he dismissed,” and not “he excluded,” so that he might seem to be drawn down by the weight of his own sins to a place that suits him. A bad man generally experiences this when he begins to live among good men, if he is unwilling to change for the better. He is driven from the company of good men by the weight of his bad habit, and they do not exclude him against his will but dismiss him in accordance with his will.
