We ask first, whom did the angel wish to kill? Was it Moses, because Scripture says, “The angel approached him and sought to kill him”? For whom will he be thought to have approached except him who was in charge of his entire people and by whom the others were led? Or did the angel seek to kill the boy, whom his mother aided by circumcising him? Then one would understand that the reason why God wished to kill the child was that he was not circumcised and thus sanctioned the precept of circumcision by the severity of the punishment. If this is the case, it is unclear of whom it was said previously, “he sought to kill him,” because we do not know who it was until we discover it from what follows. It is a remarkable and unusual expression to say “he approached him and sought to kill him” about someone who had not been mentioned before. But there is such a usage in a psalm: “Its foundations are on the holy mountains; the Lord loves the gates of Zion.” For the psalm begins at that point and had not said anything about the Lord or about that city whose foundations were meant to be understood when the psalm said, “Its foundations are on the holy mountains.” But because of what follows, “the Lord loves the gates of Zion,” the foundations, either those of the Lord or of Zion—“of Zion” yields the better sense—are understood as the foundation of a city. But the gender of this pronoun, “its,” is ambiguous, for it can be masculine, feminine or neuter. In Greek, however, the feminine is autēs, whereas the masculine and neuter are autou, and the Greek text has autou, so we must understand that the foundations are those not of Zion but of the Lord. That is, [they are] the foundations that the Lord constitutes, of which Scripture has said, “the Lord building Jerusalem.” But when the psalm said, “Its foundations are on the holy mountains,” it had not previously mentioned either Zion or the Lord. Here too it is said, “He met him and sought to kill him,” although the child had not yet been named, so that we do not know of whom he was speaking in the words that follow. But still, if someone wants to hold that Moses is meant, he should not be strongly opposed. We should rather understand what follows, if we can, what it means when the text says that the angel refrained from killing any of them because the woman said, “The blood of the infant’s circumcision has stopped flowing.” She does not say that “he drew back from him” because she circumcised the infant but that “the blood of circumcision stopped.” Not that it flowed but that it stopped—in a great mystery, if I am not wrong.
