We should understand that this sentence does not signify joy as if over an unexpected good but an approval of the work. For what is said more fittingly of God—insofar as it can be humanly said—than when Scripture puts it this way: “he spoke,” and “it was made,” “it pleased him.” Thus we understand in “he spoke” his sovereignty, in “it was made” his power and in “it pleased him” his goodness. These ineffable things had to be said in this way by a man to men so that they might profit all.

“God saw that the light was good,” and these words do not mean that God found before him a good that he had not known but that he was pleased by one that was finished.
