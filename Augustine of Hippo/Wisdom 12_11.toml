Why would it have been written, "Their offspring was accursed from the beginning"? In fact, it was not said in the same sense in which we read, "offspring of Canaan and not of Judah," where it was shown to what persons they had become similar and from what persons they had degenerated. Rather, it called accursed the offspring of those very people whom it wanted us to understand to be naturally evil, as are all of the children of Adam. From among these, by grace, children of God are made. - "Unfinished Tractate Against Julian 3.11"
