Consider then what follows: "O how sweet are Your words unto my throat!" [Psalm 119:103]. Or, as it is more literally rendered from the Greek, "Your utterances, above honey and the honeycomb unto my mouth." This is that sweetness which the Lord gives, "So that the earth yield her increase:"  that we do good truly in a good spirit, that is, not from the dread of carnal evil, but from the gladness of spiritual good. Some copies indeed do not read "honeycomb:" but the majority do. Now the open teaching of wisdom is like honey; but that is like the comb which is squeezed from the more recondite mysteries, as if from cells of wax, by the mouth of the teacher, as if he were chewing it: but it is sweet to the mouth of the heart, not to the mouth of the flesh.
