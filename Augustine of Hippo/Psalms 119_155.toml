"Health," he says, "is far from the ungodly: for they regard not Your righteousnesses" [Psalm 119:155]. This separates you, that what they have not done, you have done, that is, you have regarded the righteousnesses of God. But "what have you that you have not received?" [1 Corinthians 4:7] Are you not he who a little before said, "I will keep Your righteousnesses"? Thou therefore hast received from Him, unto whom you called, the power to keep them. He therefore does Himself separate you from those from whom health is far, because they have not regarded the righteousnesses of God.
