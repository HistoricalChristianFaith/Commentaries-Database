"He that saith he abideth in Him, ought himself also so to walk, even as He walked." How, brethren, what doth he advise us? "He that saith he abideth in Him," that is, in Christ, "ought himself also so to walk even as He walked." Haply the advice is this, that we should walk on the sea? That be far from us! It is this then, that we walk in the way of righteousness. In what way? I have already mentioned it. He was fixed upon the cross, and yet was He walking in this very way: this way is the way of charity, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." If, therefore, thou have learned to pray for thine enemy, thou walkest in the way of the Lord.
