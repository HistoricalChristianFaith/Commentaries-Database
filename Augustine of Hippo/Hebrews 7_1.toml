On receiving this promise Abraham moved on and stayed in another place in the same land, Hebron, near the Oak of Mamre.… But he received at the same time a public blessing from Melchizedek, who was “a priest of the Most High God.” Many important things are written about Melchizedek in the epistle entitled “To the Hebrews,” which the majority attribute to the apostle Paul, though many deny the attribution. Here we certainly see the first manifestation of the sacrifice which is now offered to God by Christians in the whole world, in which is fulfilled what was said in prophecy, long after this event, to Christ who was yet to come in the flesh: “you are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek.” Not, it is observed, in the line of Aaron, for that line was to be abolished when the events prefigured by these shadows came to the light of day.
