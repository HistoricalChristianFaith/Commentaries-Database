Now, brothers, you see the saints armed. Observe the slaughter, observe their glorious battles.… What have these done who had in their hands swords sharpened on both sides? “To do vengeance on the nations.” See whether vengeance has not been done on the nations. Daily is it done; we do it ourselves by speaking. Observe how the nations of Babylon are slain. She is repaid twofold.… How is she repaid double? The saints wage war, they draw their “swords twice sharpened.” From there come defeats, slaughters, severances. How is she repaid double? When she had the power to persecute the Christians, she slew the flesh indeed, but she crushed not God. Now she is repaid double, for the pagans are extinguished and the idols are broken.… And lest you should think that people are really smitten with the sword, blood really shed, wounds made in the flesh, he goes on and explains “chastisements on the peoples.” What is “chastisements”? Reproof. Let the two-edged sword go forth from you. Do not delay. Say to your friend, if you have yet a friend [among the pagans] left to whom to say it, “What kind of man are you, who have abandoned him by whom you were made, and worship what he made? Better is the workman than that which he makes.” When he begins to blush, when he begins to feel compunction, you have made a wound with your sword, it has reached his heart, he is about to die that he may live.
