"If you saw a thief, you consented unto him, and with adulterers you made your portion" [Psalm 50:18]. Lest perchance you should say, I have not committed theft, I have not committed adultery. What if he pleased you that has committed? Have you not with the very pleasing consented? Have you not by approval made your portion with him that has committed? For this is, brethren, to consent with a thief, and to make with an adulterer your portion: for even if you commit not, and approvest what is committed, you are an accessory in the deed: for "the sinner is praised in the longings of his soul, and he that does iniquity shall be blessed."  You do not do evil things, you praise evil-doers. For is this a small evil? "Thou made your portion with adulterers."
