"They have defiled Your holy Temple, they have made Jerusalem for a keeping of apples." "They have made the dead bodies of Your servants morsels for the fowls of heaven, the fleshes of Your saints for the beasts of the earth" [Psalm 79:2]. "They have poured forth their blood like water in the circuit of Jerusalem, and there was no one to bury them" [Psalm 79:3]. If in this prophecy any one of us shall have thought that there must be understood that laying waste of Jerusalem, which was made by Titus the Roman Emperor, when already the Lord Jesus Christ, after His Resurrection and Ascension, was being preached among the Gentiles, it does not occur to me how that people could now have been called the inheritance of God, as not holding to Christ, whom having rejected and slain, that people became reprobate, which not even after His Resurrection would believe in Him, and even killed His Martyrs. For out of that people Israel whosoever have believed in Christ; to whom the offer of Christ was made, and in a manner the healthful and fruitful fulfilment of the promise; concerning whom even the Lord Himself says, "I am not sent but to the sheep which have been lost of the house of Israel," [Matthew 15:24] the same are they that out of them are the sons of promise; the same are counted for a seed; [Romans 9:8] the same do belong to the inheritance of God. From hence are Joseph that just man, and the Virgin Mary who bore Christ: [Matthew 1:16] hence John Baptist the friend of the Bridegroom, and his parents Zacharias and Elisabeth: [Luke 1:5] hence Symeon the old, [Luke 2:25] and Anna the widow, who heard not Christ speaking by the sense of the body; but while yet an infant not speaking, by the Spirit perceived Him: hence the blessed Apostles: hence Nathanael, in whom guile was not: [John 1:47] hence the other Joseph, who himself too looked for the kingdom of God:  hence that so great multitude who went before and followed after His beast, saying, "Blessed is He that comes in the name of the Lord:" [Matthew 21:9] among whom was also that company of children, in whom He declared to have been fulfilled, "Out of the mouth of infants and sucklings You have perfected praise."  Hence also were those after His resurrection, of whom on one day three and on another five thousand were baptized,  welded into one soul and one heart by the fire of love; of whom no one spoke of anything as his own, but to them all things were common. [Acts 4:32] Hence the holy deacons, of whom Stephen was crowned with martyrdom before the Apostles. [Acts 7:59] Hence so many Churches of Judæa, which were in Christ, unto whom Paul was unknown by face, [Galatians 1:22] but known for an infamous ferocity, and more known for Christ's most merciful grace. Hence even he, according to the prophecy sent before concerning him, "a wolf ravening, in the morning carrying off, and in the evening dividing morsels;" [Genesis 49:27] that is, first as persecutor carrying off unto death, afterwards as a preacher feeding unto life. These are they that are out of that people the inheritance of God....So then even at this time a remnant through election of Grace have been saved. This remnant out of that nation does belong to the inheritance  of God: not those concerning whom a little below he says, "But the rest have been blinded." For thus he says. "What then? That which Israel sought, this he has not obtained: but the election has obtained it: but the rest have been blinded." [Romans 11:7] This election then, this remnant, that people of God, which God has not cast off, is called His inheritance. But in that Israel, which has not obtained this, in the rest that were blinded, there was no longer an inheritance of God, in reference to whom it is possible that there should be spoken, after the glorification of Christ in the Heavens, in the time of Titus the Emperor, "O God, there have come the Gentiles unto Your inheritance," and the other things which in this Psalm seem to have been foretold concerning the destruction of both the temple and city belonging to that people.
