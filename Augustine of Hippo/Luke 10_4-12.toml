Our Lord said to his disciples, “Whatever house you enter, first say, ‘Peace to this house!’ And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest on him; but, if not, it will return to you.” …Since we do not know who is a son of peace, it is our part to leave no one out, to set no one aside, but to desire that all to whom we preach this peace be saved. We are not to fear that we lose our peace if he to whom we preach it is not a son of peace, and we are ignorant of the fact. Our peace will return to us. That means our preaching will profit us, not him. If the peace we preach rests upon him, it will profit both him and us.
