As we were singing of the Lord, we asked him to turn his face away from our sins and to blot out all our misdeeds. But you can also take note, brothers, of what we heard in the same psalm: “Since I myself acknowledge my misdeed, and my sin is always before me.” Now somewhere else he says to God, “Do not turn your face away from me,” while here we have just said to him, “Turn your face away from my sins.” So since man17 and sinner are one person, the man says, “Do not turn your face away from me,” while the sinner says, “Turn your face away from my sins.” So what it amounts to is: “Do not turn your face away from what you have done; turn your face away from what I have done. Let your eye,” he says, “distinguish between them, or else the nature may perish because of the flaw. You have done something, I too have done something. What you have done is called nature; what I have done is called a flaw. May the flaw be remedied and thus the nature preserved.”
