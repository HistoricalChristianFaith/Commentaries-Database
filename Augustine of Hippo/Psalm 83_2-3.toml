"For lo Your enemies have sounded, and they that hate You have lifted up the head" [Psalm 83:2]. He seems to me to signify the last days, when these things that are now repressed by fear are to break forth into free utterance, but quite irrational, so that it should rather be called a "sound," than speech or discourse. They will not, therefore, then begin to hate, but "they that hate You" will then "lift up the head." And not "heads," but "head;" since they are to come even to that point, that they shall have that head, which "is lifted up above all that is called God, and that is worshipped;" [2 Thessalonians 2:4] so that in him especially is to be fulfilled, "He that exalts himself shall be abased;" [Luke 14:11] and when He to whom it is said, "Keep not silence, nor grow mild, O God," shall "slay him with the breath of His mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of His coming." [2 Thessalonians 2:8] "Upon Your people they have malignantly taken counsel" [Psalm 83:3]. Or, as other copies have it, "They have cunningly devised counsel, and have devised against Your saints." In scorn this is said. For how should they be able to hurt the nation or people of God, or His saints, who know how to say, "If God be for us, who shall be against us?" [Romans 8:31]
