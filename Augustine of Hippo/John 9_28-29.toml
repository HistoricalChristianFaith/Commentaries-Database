May such an “evil thing” be said of us and on our children! In other words, it was an evil thing [to say he was a disciple] from their point of view, but not if you think about the words themselves. They say, “But we are disciples of Moses. We know that God spoke to Moses. But we have no idea where this person comes from.” But if you [Pharisees] knew that God spoke to Moses, then you should have also known that God preached about our Lord through Moses after hearing what he said, “If you had believed Moses, you would have believed me, for he wrote of me.” Do you then follow a servant and turn your back on the Lord? But you do not even follow the servant, for he would guide you to the Lord.
