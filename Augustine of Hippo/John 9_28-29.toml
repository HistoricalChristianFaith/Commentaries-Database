"They reviled him, and said, Be thou his disciple: we are Moses' disciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not whence he is." "We know that God spake unto Moses." And whence know ye that? Because Moses wrote of Me, as the Lord Himself said; and Moses, did I believe, ye would believe Me also: for Moses wrote of me. Thus, then, the servant was believed, the Lord despised; and yet, in truth, the Lord was believed from whom this same servant was believed.
