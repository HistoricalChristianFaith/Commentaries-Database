"My soul has wandered much" [Psalm 120:6]. Lest you should understand bodily wandering, he has said that the soul wandered. The body wanders in places, the soul wanders in its affections. If you love the earth, you wander from God: if you love God, you rise unto God. Let us be exercised in the love of God, and of our neighbour, that we may return unto charity. If we fall towards the earth, we wither and decay. But one descended unto this one who had fallen, in order that he might arise. Speaking of the time of his wandering, he said that he wandered in the tents of Kedar. Wherefore? Because "my soul has wandered much." He wanders there where he ascends. He wanders not in the body, he rises not in the body. But wherein does he ascend? "The ascent," he says, "is in the heart."
