"Deliver me from bloods, O God, God of my health" [Psalm 51:14]. The Latin translator has expressed, though by a word not Latin, yet an accuracy from the Greek.  For we all know that in Latin, sanguines (bloods) are not spoken of, nor yet sanguina (bloods in the neuter), nevertheless because the Greek translator has thus used the plural number, not without reason, but because he found this in the original language the Hebrew, a godly translator has preferred to use a word not Latin, rather than one not exact. Wherefore then has he said in the plural number, "From bloods"? In many bloods, as in the origin of the sinful flesh, many sins he would have to be understood. The Apostle having regard to the very sins which come of the corruption of flesh and blood, says, "Flesh and blood shall not possess the kingdom of God." [1 Corinthians 15:50] For doubtless, after the true faith of the same Apostle, that flesh shall rise again and shall itself gain incorruption, as He says Himself, "This corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal put on immortality." [1 Corinthians 15:53] Because then this corruption is of sin, by the name thereof sins are called. In like manner as both that morsel of flesh and member which plays in the mouth when we articulate words is called a tongue, and that is called a tongue which by the tongue is made, so we call one tongue the Greek, another the Latin; for the flesh is not diverse, but the sound. In the same manner, then, as the speech which is made by the tongue is called a tongue; so also the iniquity which is made by blood is called blood. Heeding, then, his many iniquities, as  in the expression above,  "And all my iniquities blot out," and ascribing them to the corruption of flesh and blood, "Free me," he says, "from bloods:" that is, free me from iniquities, cleanse me from all corruption....Not yet is the substance, but certain hope. "And my tongue shall exult of Your righteousness."
