[They refer to him as] “Jesus, the son of Joseph.” He was called the son of the man to whom his mother had been espoused. For all Christians know well from the Gospel that he was conceived and born while she was still a virgin. But this is what Philip said to Nathanael, and he added the place, “from Nazareth.” And Nathanael said to him, “From Nazareth something good can come.” What is the meaning here, brothers? Not as some read, for it could be read, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth?” For the words of Philip follow, who says, “Come and see.” But the words of Philip can suitably follow both readings, whether you read it as a confirmation, that is, “from Nazareth something good can come,” to which Philip replies, “come and see”; or whether you read it as doubting, making the whole thing into a question, “Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Come and see.”
