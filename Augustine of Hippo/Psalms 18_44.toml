"You shall make Me the head of the Gentiles. A people whom I have not known have served Me." The people of the Gentiles, whom in bodily presence I have not visited, have served Me. "At the hearing of the ear they have obeyed Me" [Psalm 18:44]. They have not seen Me with the eye: but, receiving my preachers, at the hearing of the ear they have obeyed Me.
