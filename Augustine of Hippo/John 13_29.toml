Our Lord then had a money box in which he kept the offerings of the faithful to supply either the wants of his own followers or the poor. This is where the custom of the church having money was first introduced. Our Lord shows that his commandment not to think about tomorrow does not mean that the saints should never save money but that they should not neglect the service of God for it or let the fear of want tempt them to injustice.
