"And it shall please God:" that I shall praise Him, shall please: "above a new calf, bearing horns and hoofs." More grateful to Him shall be the sacrifice of praise than the sacrifice of a calf. "The sacrifice of praise shall glorify me."  "Immolate to God the sacrifice of praise."  So then His praise going forth from my mouth shall please God more than a great victim led up to His altar....Therefore above this calf my praising shall please You, such as hereafter will be, after poverty and sorrow, in the eternal society of Angels, where neither adversary there shall be in battle to be tossed, nor sluggard from earth to be stirred up. "Let the needy see and rejoice" [Psalm 69:32]. Let them believe, and in hope be glad. Let them be more needy, in order that they may deserve to be filled: lest while they belch out pride's satiety, there be denied them the bread whereon they may healthily live. "Seek the Lord," ye needy, hunger ye and thirst; [Matthew 5:6] for He is Himself the living bread that came down from Heaven. [John 6:33, 51] "Seek the Lord, and your soul shall live." You seek bread, that your flesh may live: the Lord seek ye, that your soul may live. [Isaiah 55:3]
