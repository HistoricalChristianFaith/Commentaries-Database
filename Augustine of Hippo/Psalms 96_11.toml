"Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad" [Psalm 96:11]. Let the heavens, which declare the glory of God, rejoice; let the heavens rejoice, which the Lord made; let the earth be glad, which the heavens rain upon. For the heavens are the preachers, the earth the listeners. "Let the sea be stirred up, and the fullness thereof." What sea? The world. The sea has been stirred up, and the fullness thereof: the whole world was roused up against the Church, while it was being extended and built over all the earth. Concerning this stirring up, you have heard in the Gospel, "They shall deliver you up to councils." [MarkÂ 13:9] The sea was stirred up: but how should the sea ever conquer Him who made it?
