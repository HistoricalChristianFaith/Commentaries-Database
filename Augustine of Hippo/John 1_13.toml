And how do they become children of God? “Who are born not of blood, nor of the will of a man nor of the will of the flesh, but of God.” Pay close attention: these here have been born of God, having received power to become children of God. They have been born of God, not of blood, such as is the case with the first birth, the case with the birth in misery coming from miserable parents. But those who have been born of God, what was it that they were first born of? From a mixing of blood, from the blood of male and female, from a mingling of the flesh of male and female, that is what they were born of. But now, how is it they are born of God? The first birth was from male and female; the second birth is from God and the church.

These, then, “were born not of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.” But that human beings might be born of God, God was first born of them. For Christ is God, and Christ was born of men. It was only a mother, indeed, that he sought on earth because he already had a father in heaven. He by whom we were to be created was born of God, and he by whom we were to be recreated was born of a woman. Do not be amazed then that you are made a son or daughter by grace, do not be amazed that you are born of God according to his Word. The Word himself first chose to be born of man so that you might be born of God unto salvation. You can say to yourself, “God had a reason for wanting to be born of man, because he considered me as someone important, someone that he might make immortal, someone like me who was born as a mortal.” When, therefore, he said, “born of God,” in case we should, as it were, be filled with amazement and trembling at such grace—at grace so great as to exceed belief that people are born of God—as if assuring you, he says, “And the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us.” Why, then, do you marvel that people are born of God? Consider God himself born of men.
