The Church says also what follows, "My eyes have prevented the morning watch, that I might meditate on Your words" [Psalm 119:148]. Let us suppose the morning to mean the season when "a light arose for them that sat in the shadow of death;" [IsaiahÂ 9:2] did not the eyes of the Church prevent this morning watch, in those Saints who before were on earth, because they foresaw beforehand that this would come to pass, so that they meditated on the words of God, which then were, and announced these things to be destined in the Law and the Prophets?
