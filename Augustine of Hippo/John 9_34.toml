(Tr. xliv. 14) What meaneth altogether? That he was quite blind. Yet He who opened his eyes, also saves him altogether.

(Tr. xliv. 14) It was they themselves who had made him teacher; themselves, who had asked him so many questions; and now they ungratefully cast him out for teaching.

"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out." What was their casting him out but driving him from their society? What cared he for that? They who expelled him could make him no consul: they expelled him; Christ received him. In fact, then, brethren, it was their anger to which his blessing was due.
