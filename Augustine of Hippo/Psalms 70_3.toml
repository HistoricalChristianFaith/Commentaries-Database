What follows? "Let them be turned away immediately blushing, that say to me, Well, well" [Psalm 70:3]. Two are the kinds of persecutors, revilers and flatterers. The tongue of the flatterer does more persecute than the hand of the slayer: for this also the Scripture has called a furnace. Truly when the Scripture was speaking of persecution, it said, "Like gold in a furnace it has proved them" (speaking of Martyrs being slain), "and as the holocaust's victim it has received them." [Wisdom 3:6] Hear how even the tongue of flatterers is of such sort: "The proving," he says, "of silver and of gold is fire; but a man is proved by the tongue of men praising him."

Who can be compared with you? How well you have overcome!" The holy soul must answer him, "Let them be put to confusion and shame, those who say to me, Well done, well done!" So when do you overcome, if not when you say, "It is in the Lord that my soul shall be praised; let the gentle hear and rejoice"?
