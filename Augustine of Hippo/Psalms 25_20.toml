"Keep my soul, and deliver me." Keep my soul, that I turn not aside to imitate them; and draw me out from the confusion wherein they are mingled with me. "Let me not be confounded, for I have put my trust in You" [Psalm 25:20]. Let me not be confounded, if haply they rise up against me: for not in myself, but in You have I put my trust.
