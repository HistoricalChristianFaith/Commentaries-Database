we did not love Him first: for to this end loved He us, that we may love Him: And sent His Son to be the Atoner for our sins:  litatorem, i.e. one that sacrifices. He sacrificed for our sins. Where did He find the sacrifice? Where did He find the victim which he would offer pure? Other He found none; His own self He offered.
