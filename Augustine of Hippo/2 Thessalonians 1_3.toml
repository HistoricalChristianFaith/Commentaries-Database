There could be no merit in men’s choice of Christ, if it were not that God’s grace precedes any faith or action on their part in his choosing them. This is why the apostle Paul pronounces to the Thessalonians this benediction, “The Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another, and toward all men.” This benediction to love one another he gave us, who had also given us a law that we should love one another. Then, in the salutation addressed to the same church where some of its members possessed the disposition which he had wished them to cultivate, Paul says, “We are bound to thank God always for you, brothers. This is quite fitting, because your faith grows robustly, and your mutual charity abounds.”
