But when spiritual desires burn, carnal desires without doubt cool: on this account follows, "Since I have become like a bottle in the frost, I do not forget Your righteousnesses" [Psalm 119:83]. Truly he desires this mortal flesh to be understood by the bottle, the heavenly blessing by the frost, whereby the lusts of the flesh as it were by the binding of the frost become sluggish; and hence it arises that the righteousnesses of God do not slip from the memory, as long as we do not meditate apart from them; since what the Apostle says is brought to pass: "Make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof." [RomansÂ 13:14] "And I do not forget Your righteousness:" that is, I forget them not, because I have become such. For the fervour of lust has cooled, that the memory of love might glow.
