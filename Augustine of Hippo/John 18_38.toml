You are righteous, O Lord, but we have sinned and committed iniquity and have done wickedly. Your hand has grown heavy on us, and it is only right that we are handed over to that ancient sinner, the governor of death. For he has persuaded our wills to be like his will because he does not remain in your truth. What will wretched people like us do? “Who shall deliver us from the body of this death?” It is only your grace through Jesus Christ our Lord, who was begotten co-eternal by you and was created in the beginning of your ways. The prince of this world found nothing worthy of death in him. Yet he killed him, and the handwriting of the decree against us was blotted out.

I believe when Pilate said, “What is truth?” there immediately occurred to his mind the custom of the Jews of releasing one prisoner at the Passover. Therefore he did not wait to hear Jesus’ answer to his question, “What is truth?” in order to avoid delay on the chance that Jesus might be released to them during the Passover—something he clearly desired.
