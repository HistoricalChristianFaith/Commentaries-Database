Pay attention to what comes next: “Without love, a measure of money is sufficient for present needs,” because he himself said, “ ‘I will not forsake you, I will not desert you.’ You were afraid of I don’t know what evils, for that reason you were saving up money; count me as your guarantor.” That’s what God says to you. It isn’t a man, not your equal or you yourself, but God who says to you, “I will not forsake you, I will not desert you.” If a man made such a promise, you would trust him; God makes it, and you hesitate? He made the promise, put it in writing, made out the bond; you needn’t worry at all. Read what you’ve got in your hand, you’re holding God’s bond; as your debtor you hold the one whom you have asked to cancel your debts.
