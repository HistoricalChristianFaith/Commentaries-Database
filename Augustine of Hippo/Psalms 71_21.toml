But this was discipline; admonition, not desertion. Lastly, giving thanks, he says what? "And being turned You have made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again You have brought me back." But when before? What is this "again"? You have fallen from a high place, O man, disobedient slave, O thou proud against your Lord, you have fallen. There hast come to pass in you, "every one that exalts himself shall be humbled:" may there come to pass in you, "every one that humbles himself shall be exalted." [Luke 14:11] Return thou from the deep. I return, he says, I return, I acknowledge; "O God, who is like You? How great troubles have You shown to me, many and evil! And being turned You have made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again You have brought me back." "We perceive," I hear. You have brought us back from the bottomless places of the earth, hast brought us back from the depth and drowning of sin. But why "again"? When had it already been done? Let us go on, if perchance the latter parts of the Psalm itself do not explain to us the thing which here we do not yet perceive, namely, why he has said "again." Therefore let us hear: "How great troubles You have shown to me, many and evil! And being turned You have made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again You have brought me back." What then? "You have multiplied Your righteousness, and being turned You have comforted me, and from the bottomless places of the earth again You have brought me back" [Psalm 71:21]. Behold a second "again"! If we labour to unravel this "again" when written once, who will be able to unravel it when doubled? Now "again" itself is a redoubling, and once more there is written "again." May He be with us from whom is grace, may there be with us the arm also which we are telling forth to every generation that is to come: may He be with us Himself, and as with the key of His Cross open to us the mystery that is locked up. For it was not to no purpose that when He was crucified the veil of the temple was rent in the midst, but to show that through His Passion the secret things of all mysteries were opened. [Matthew 27:51] May He then Himself be with men passing over unto Him, be the veil taken away: [2 Corinthians 3:16] may our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ tell us why such a voice of the Prophet has been sent before, "You have shown to me troubles many and evil: and being turned You have made me alive, and from the bottomless places of the earth again You have brought me back." Behold this is the first "again" which has been written. Let us see what this is, and we shall see why there is a second "again."
