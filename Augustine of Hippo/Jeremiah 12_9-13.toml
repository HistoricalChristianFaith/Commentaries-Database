“Pray that you do not enter into temptation”—that you enter not again into “contentions, envying, animosities, dissension, detractions, seditions, whispering.” For we have not planted and watered the Lord’s garden in you only to reap these thorns from you. But if your weakness still stirs up a storm, pray that you may be delivered from temptation. Those among you who trouble you, whoever they may be, will incur judgment unless they amend their lives.
