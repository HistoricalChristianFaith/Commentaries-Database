"The Lord fulfil all Your petitions." The Lord fulfil not only the petitions which You made on earth, but those also whereby Thou intercedest for us in heaven. "Now have I known that the Lord has saved his Christ" [Psalm 20:6]. Now has it been shown to me in prophecy, that the Lord will raise up His Christ again. "He will hear Him from His holy heaven." He will hear Him not from earth only, where He prayed to be glorified; [John 17:1] but from heaven also, where interceding for us at the Right Hand of the Father, [Hebrews 7:25] He has from thence shed abroad the Holy Spirit on them that believe in Him. "In strength is the safety of His right hand." Our strength is in the safety of His favour, when even out of tribulation He gives help, that "when we are weak, then we may be strong." [2 Corinthians 12:10] "For vain is" that "safety of man,"  which comes not of His right hand but of His left: for thereby are they lifted up to great pride, whosoever in their sins have secured a temporal safety.

Sometimes people run off to a mountain to pray, as though God will be able to hear them better from there. Do you want to make contact with God in your prayer? Humble yourself. But again, just because I have said, “Do you want to make contact with God? Humble yourself,” do not take it literally and materialistically and go off down to underground vaults and there start beseeching God. Do not go seeking either caverns or mountains. Have lowliness in your heart, and God will give you all the high altitude you want. He will come to you and be with you in your bedroom.
