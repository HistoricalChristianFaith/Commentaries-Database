“Give us today our daily bread.” It can be taken quite simply that we pour out this prayer for our daily sustenance, that we may have plenty of it; and if we don’t have plenty, that we may not lack it entirely. He called it “daily,” “for as long as it is called ‘today.’ ” Daily we live, daily we get up, daily we take our fill, daily we get hungry. May he give us our daily bread.
