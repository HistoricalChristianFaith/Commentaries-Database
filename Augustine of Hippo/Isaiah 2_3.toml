The first law, the Old Testament, had come out of Mount Sinai by the lips of Moses; but it was foretold of the law Christ came to give: “The law shall come forth from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.” This explains why Christ ordered repentance to be preached in his name among all peoples but beginning in Jerusalem.
