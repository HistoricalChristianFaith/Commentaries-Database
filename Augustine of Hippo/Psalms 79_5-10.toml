There, at last, gaze on “In the beginning was the Word.” The Word was not, you see, made at some time or other; but it just was in the beginning. Not like creation, of which it is said, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth.” As for the Word that was in the beginning, there was no time when it was not. So this that “was in the beginning, and was the Word with God, and the Word itself was God; and all things were made through him, and without him was nothing made”; and in him “what was made is life.” This Word came to us. To whom? To us as worthy? Perish the thought! No, but to us as unworthy. After all, “Christ died for the ungodly,” and the unworthy, while being worthy himself. We were unworthy, you see, for him to have pity on; but he was worthy to take pity on us, to be told, “Because of your pity, Lord, deliver us.” Not because of any previous merits of ours, but “because of your pity, Lord, deliver us; and be lenient with our sins, because of your name,” not because of our merit. Obviously, not because of the merit of our sins, but “because of your name.” I mean, the merit of our sins, of course, is not reward but revenge. So therefore, “because of your name.”

As for those who insult over them in their trials, and when ills befall them say, “Where is thy God?” we may ask them where their gods are when they suffer the very calamities for the sake of avoiding which they worship their gods, or maintain they ought to be worshipped; for the family of Christ is furnished with its reply: our God is everywhere present, wholly everywhere; not confined to any place. He can be present unperceived, and be absent without moving; when he exposes us to adversities, it is either to prove our perfections or correct our imperfections; and in return for our patient endurance of the sufferings of time, he reserves for us an everlasting reward. But who are you, that we should deign to speak with you even about your own gods, much less about our God, who is “to be feared above all gods? For all the gods of the nations are idols; but the Lord made the heavens.”
