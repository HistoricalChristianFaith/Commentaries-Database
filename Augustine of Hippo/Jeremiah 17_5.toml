“What is your own opinion? What people do you call happy?” He [the psalmist] would not say, “Happy is the people whose strength is in their own mind.” If he had said this, he would, it is true, distinguish that people from the former that made happiness consist in that visible and bodily good fortune, but he would not yet have passed beyond all the vanities and lying follies, for the same Scriptures teach elsewhere: “Cursed be everyone that places his hope in humankind.” Therefore, he ought not to place it in himself, because he himself is human. Thus, in order to pass beyond the boundaries of all vanities and lying follies and to place happiness where it truly exists, he says, “Happy is the people whose God is the Lord.”

The Stoics, when questioned about where they place the efficient cause of the happy life that is the thing in people that makes life happy, answer that it is not bodily pleasure but a virtuous mind. What says the apostle? Does he agree? If he agrees, let us agree, too. But he does not agree, because Scripture reproves those who trust in their own virtue. And so the Epicurean who places a person’s supreme good in the body is placing his hopes in himself. But after all, the Stoic who places a person’s supreme good in the mind has indeed placed it in a person’s better part. But even he has placed it in himself. Now the Stoic is a human just as much as the Epicurean. Cursed therefore is everyone who places his hope in humankind. So what now? Here we have three people set before our eyes: an Epicurean, a Stoic, a Christian. Let us question them one by one. “Tell us, Epicurean, what thing makes one blessed?” “Bodily pleasure,” he replies. “Tell us, Stoic.” “A virtuous mind.” “Tell us, Christian.” “The gift of God.”

But of these matters, all of which are true objects of faith, those only pertain to hope that are embraced in the Lord’s Prayer. For “cursed is the one that trusts in humankind” is the testimony of Holy Scripture. Consequently, this curse attaches also to the person who trusts in himself. Therefore, we ought to ask for nothing that we either hope to do well or hope to obtain as a reward for our good works except from God the Lord.

Out of that confession of faith that is briefly contained in the creed and that, pondered according to the flesh, is the milk of babes but spiritually considered and studied is the food of the strong, arises the good hope of believers, which holy charity accompanies. But of all those things that are to be believed by faith, only those pertain to hope that are contained in the Lord’s Prayer. For “cursed is everyone who puts hope in humankind,” as the divine Scriptures testify; and, consequently, one who puts hope in himself is also ensnared in the chain of this curse. Therefore, we ought to make petition only of the Lord God, whatever it is that we hope to do well or to obtain as a reward for good works.

Blessed are all who trust in God. If the blessed are those who trust in him, then the wretched are those who trust in themselves. Cursed, you see, is everyone who puts his hopes in humankind, so do not put them even in yourself, because you too are human. If you put your hopes in another person, that is the wrong kind of humility. But if you put your hopes in yourself, that is dangerous pride. What is the difference, anyway? Each is pernicious, neither is to be chosen. Humble in the wrong way, you cannot lift yourself up; dangerously proud, you are heading for a fall.

Take care not to let trust in your own strength steal on you, for you are human, and “cursed is everyone who puts his hope in humankind.” But put your trust fully and with your whole heart in God, and he will be your strength. Trust him lovingly and gratefully and say to him humbly and faithfully, “Trust in the Lord with your whole heart; he will be your strength.”

People who despise being in need before God, lest they receive true perseverance from him, glory in their own false endurance and seek to “confound the counsel of the poor, because the Lord is his hope.” Nor do they regard, seeing they are human and attribute so much to their own, that is, to the human will, that they run into that which is written, “Cursed is everyone who puts his hope in humankind.”
