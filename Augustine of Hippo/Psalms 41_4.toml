But why this? Because He "scourges every son whom He receives." [Hebrews 12:6] Why this? Because to men sinning was it said, "In the sweat of your face shall you eat bread."

He indeed without sin was scourged; but I say, "I have sinned against You."...

He indeed without sin was scourged; but I say, "I have sinned against Thee." ...
