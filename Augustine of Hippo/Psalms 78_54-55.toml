In the next place there follows, "And He led them into the mountain of His sanctification" [Psalm 78:54]. How much better into Holy Church! "The mountain which His right hand has gotten." How much higher is the Church which Christ has gotten, concerning whom has been said, "And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" [Isaiah 53:1] [Psalm 78:55]. "And He cast forth from the face of them the nations." And  from the face of His faithful. For nations in a manner are the evil spirits of Gentile errors. "And by lot He divided unto them the land in the cord of distribution." And in us "all things one and the same Spirit does work, dividing severally to every one as He wills." [1 Corinthians 12:11]
