And how many more they have joined, by being given birth to by [the church]? How many members have adhered to the head and are adhering now? And these have been baptized, and others will be baptized, and after us will come others. Then, I say, at the end of the world the stones will attach themselves to the foundation, living stones, holy stones, so that at the end the whole building may be built up out of that church; indeed out of this very church, which is now singing the new song, while the house is being built. That, you see, is what this psalm says, “when the house was being built after the captivity.” What does it say? “Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth.” What a great house it is! But when does it sing the new song? While it is being built? When is it dedicated? At the end of time? Its foundation has already been dedicated, because he has ascended into heaven and dies no more. When we too have risen again, so as never to die anymore, that is when we too will be dedicated.

As a door leads into a house, so the title of a psalm leads into understanding. Now this one has a heading as follows: “When the house was being built after the captivity.” You ask what house; the psalm shows you straightaway: “Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord, all the earth.” There you are, that is what house it is. When the whole earth sings a new song, it is the house of God. It is built by singing, its foundations are believing, it is erected by hoping, it is completed by loving. So it is being built now, but it is dedicated at the end of the world. Let the living stones, then, come flocking together to the new song, come flocking all together and be fitted together into the fabric of God’s temple. Let them recognize their Savior and receive him as their occupant.

The rebaptizing Donatists should not think they belong to the new song. They cannot sing the new song, seeing that with insufferable impiety they have cut themselves off from the church that God willed to exist in every land. After all, the same prophet says somewhere else, “Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord every land.” So anyone who refuses to sing with every land and does not withdraw from the old man, does not sing the new song and does not play on the ten-stringed harp, because he is an enemy of charity, which alone is the fullness of the law and which we say is contained in the ten commandments that pertain to love of God and of neighbor.

The baptized have, then, something to do in themselves, that is, in the temple of God that is first built and dedicated at the end. It is built after the captivity, as the title of the psalm indicates: when the enemy who had taken them captive has been expelled. There is something noteworthy in the order of the psalms. The psalm of the dedication of the house precedes in order of numbering the psalm of the building of the house. The psalm of the dedication comes first, because the psalmist is singing of the house of which its Architect says, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” The later psalm, when the house was being built after the captivity, foretold the church. Moreover, its opening words are “Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord all the earth.” Let no one foolishly think that a baptized person is already perfect, therefore, merely because it has been said, “For holy is the temple of God, and this temple you are,” and, “Do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God?”

We have said what house it is; now we must say after what captivity. The psalm shows you this19 too. Carry on a little: “Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, bless his name, proclaim from day to day the gospel of his salvation. Proclaim among the nations his wonders, in all peoples his glory. Since all the gods of the nations are demons.” There you are again, that is under whom the house was held in captivity. From the first transgression of the first human being, the whole human race, being born in the shackles of sin, was the property of the devil who had conquered it. After all, if we had not been held in captivity, we would not have needed a redeemer.

Rightly, then, are we stirred by the voice of the psalmist as by the sound of a heavenly trumpet, when we hear, “Sing to the Lord a new canticle; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord and bless his name.” Let us recognize, then, and proclaim the “Day born of the day” who became incarnate on this day. The Day is the Son born of the Father, the eternal Day, God of God, Light of Light; he is our salvation, of whom the psalmist says elsewhere, “May God have mercy on us and bless us: may he cause the light of his countenance to shine on us. That we may know your way on earth; your salvation in all nations.” The idea expressed in “on the earth” he expanded to “in all nations” and the significance of “your way” he repeated in “your salvation.” We recall that the Lord said, “I am the way.” And only recently, when the Gospel was read, we heard that the thrice-blessed old man, Simeon, had received a divine promise that he would not experience death until he had seen Christ the Lord and that, when he had taken the infant Christ into his hands and had recognized the mighty little One, he said, “Now dismiss your servant, O Lord, according to your word, in peace, because my eyes have seen your salvation.” Gladly, then, let us announce his salvation, this Day born of the eternal Day, let us declare “his glory among the Gentiles, his wonders among all people.” He lies in a manger, but he holds the world in his hand; he is nourished at the breast, but he feeds the angels; he is wrapped in swaddling clothes, but he clothes us with immortality; he is suckled but is adored; he does not find room in the inn, but he makes a temple for himself in the hearts of believers. For Strength took on weakness that weakness might become strong. Therefore, let us marvel at rather than despise his human birth; from it let us learn the lowliness that such loftiness assumed for our sake. Then let us enkindle our love so that we may come to his eternal day.
