Therefore, he said, “I came that they may have life,” that is, faith that works by love. By this faith they enter the fold so that they may live, for the just lives by faith. And not only may those who endure to the end have life, but “they may have it more abundantly,” as they pass through this same door, that is, by the faith of Christ. For as true believers they die, and they will have life more abundantly when they come to the place where the Shepherd has preceded them—a place where they shall die no more. Although there is no want of pasture even here in the fold—for we may understand the words “and shall find pasture” as referring to both, that is, both to their going in and their going out—yet only there will they find the true pasture where they shall be filled who hunger and thirst after righteousness. This is the pasture that was found by the one who heard, “Today you will be with me in paradise.”
