"Command, O God, Your Virtue" [Psalm 68:28]. For one is our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, [1 Corinthians 8:6] and we in Him, of whom we read that He is "the Virtue of God and the Wisdom of God." [1 Corinthians 1:24] But how does God command His Christ, save while He commends Him? For "God commends His love in us, in that while yet we were sinners, for us Christ died." [Romans 5:8] "How has He not also with Him given to us all things?" [Romans 8:32] "Command, O God, Your Virtue: confirm, O God, that which You have wrought in us." Command by teaching, confirm by aiding.
