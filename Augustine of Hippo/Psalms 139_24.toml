"And see," says he, "if there be any way of wickedness in me, and lead me in the way everlasting" [Psalm 139:24]. "Search," he says, "my paths," that is, my counsels and thoughts. What else says he, but "lead me in Christ"? For who is "the way everlasting," save He that is the life everlasting? For everlasting is He who said, "I am the Way, and the Truth, and the Life." [John 14:6] If then you find anything in my way which displeases Your eyes, since my way is mortal, do Thou "lead me in the way everlasting," wherein is no iniquity; for even "if any man sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and He is the propitiation for our sins;" [1 John 2:1-2] He is "the Way everlasting" without sin; He is the Life everlasting without punishment.
