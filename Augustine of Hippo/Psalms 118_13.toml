"I have been driven on like a heap of sand, so that I was falling, but the Lord upheld me" [Psalm 118:13]. For though there were a great multitude of believers, that might be compared to the countless sand, and brought into one communion as into one heap; yet "what is man, save Thou be mindful of Him?"  He said not, the multitude of the Gentiles could not surpass the abundance of my host, but, "the Lord," he says, "has upheld me." The persecution of the Gentiles succeeded not in pushing forward, to its overthrow, the host of the faithful dwelling together in the unity of the faith.
