(de Con. Ev. l. iii. c. 1.) When our Lord had given the cup to His disciples, He again spoke of His betrayer, saying, But, behold, the hand of him that betrayeth me, &c.

Some who read carelessly ask if Judas received Christ’s body. Understand that the Lord had already distributed the sacrament of his body and blood to all of them when Judas himself also was there, as holy Luke most clearly tells us. After that came this event where, according to John’s narrative, the Lord most openly exposes his traitor through the morsel dipped and offered, perhaps signifying through the dipping of the bread that man’s pretense. Not everything that is dipped is washed, but some are dipped to be dyed. If the dipping here signifies something good, then damnation rightly followed the one ungrateful for this good.When the bread entered the stomach, the enemy entered the mind of the ungrateful man. Judas was not possessed by the Lord but by the devil. The full effect of so great an evil already conceived in the heart still awaited completion; the damnable intention to do it had already been effected.
