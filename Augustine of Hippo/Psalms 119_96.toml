Lastly, he next says, "I have seen an end of all consummation: but Your commandment is exceeding broad" [Psalm 119:96]. For he had entered into the sanctuary of God, and had understood the end.  Now "all consummation" appears to me in this place to signify, the striving even unto death for the truth, [Sirach 4:28] and the endurance of every evil for the true and chief good: the end of which consummation is to excel in the kingdom of Christ, which has no end; and there to have without death, without pain, and with great honour, life, acquired by the death of this life, and by sorrows and reproaches. But in what he has added, "Your commandment is exceeding broad;" I understand only love. For what would it have profited him, whatever death impended over him, in the midst of whatsoever torment, to confess those testimonies, if love were not in the confessor?...Broad therefore is the commandment of charity, that twofold commandment, whereby we are enjoined to love God and our neighbour. But what is broader than that, "on" which "hang all the Law and the Prophets"? [Matthew 22:37-40]
