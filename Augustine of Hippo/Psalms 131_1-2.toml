"Lord, my heart was not lifted up, neither were my eyes raised on high" [Psalm 131:1]; "I have not exercised myself in great matters, nor in wonderful things which are too high for me" [Psalm 131:2]. Let this be more plainly spoken and heard. I have not been proud: I have not wished to be known among men as for wondrous powers; nor have I sought anything beyond my strength, whereby I might boast myself among the ignorant. As that Simon the sorcerer wished to advance into wonders above himself, on that account the power of the Apostles more pleased him, than the righteousness of Christians....What is above my strength, he says, I have not sought; I have not stretched myself out there, I have not chosen to be magnified there. How deeply this self-exaltation in the abundance of graces is to be feared, that no man may pride himself in the gift of God, but may rather preserve humility, and may do what is written: "The greater you are, the more humble yourself, and you shall find favour before the Lord:" [SirachÂ 3:18] how deeply pride in God's gift should be feared, we must again and again impress upon you....
