..."I believed," says he, "and therefore did I speak. But I was sorely brought down" [Psalm 116:10]. For he suffered many tribulations, for the sake of the word which he faithfully held, faithfully preached; and he was sorely brought down; as they feared who loved the praise of men better than that of God. But what means, "But I"? He should rather say, I believed, and therefore I have spoken, and I was sorely brought down: why did he add, "But I," save because a man may be sorely brought down by those who oppose the truth, the truth itself cannot, which he believes and speaks? Whence also the Apostle, when he was speaking of his chain, says, "the word of God is not bound." [2 Timothy 2:9] So this man also, since there is one person of the holy witnesses, that is, of the Martyrs of God, says, "I believed, and therefore will I speak." "But I;" not that which I believed, not the word which I have delivered; "but I was sorely brought down."
