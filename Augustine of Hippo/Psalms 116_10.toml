..."I believed," says he, "and therefore did I speak. But I was sorely brought down" [Psalm 116:10]. For he suffered many tribulations, for the sake of the word which he faithfully held, faithfully preached; and he was sorely brought down; as they feared who loved the praise of men better than that of God. But what means, "But I"? He should rather say, I believed, and therefore I have spoken, and I was sorely brought down: why did he add, "But I," save because a man may be sorely brought down by those who oppose the truth, the truth itself cannot, which he believes and speaks? Whence also the Apostle, when he was speaking of his chain, says, "the word of God is not bound." [2 Timothy 2:9] So this man also, since there is one person of the holy witnesses, that is, of the Martyrs of God, says, "I believed, and therefore will I speak." "But I;" not that which I believed, not the word which I have delivered; "but I was sorely brought down."

We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, came in the flesh, suffered, arose, ascended into heaven; we now believe that all of this has been fulfilled, as you hear words of past time. With us in the company of this faith are also those ancestors who believed that he would be born of a virgin, would suffer, would arise, would ascend into heaven. For the apostle pointed to them when he said, "But having the same spirit of faith, as has been written, 'I have believed and because of this I have spoken,' we also believe, and because of this we also speak." The prophet said, "I have believed, and because of this I have spoken." The apostle says, "We also believe, and because of this we also speak." But, that you may know that the faith is one, hear him saying, "Having the same spirit of faith, we also believe."

The same angel comes to Mary, announces to her that Christ is going to be born of her in the flesh, and Mary says something of the same kind. Zachariah, you see, had said, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years." And he is told, "Behold, you shall be dumb, and you will not be able to speak until the day when these things are fulfilled, because you have not believed my words." And he was given the punishment of dumbness, earned by his unbelief. What had the prophet said about John? "The voice of one crying in the desert." Zachariah is dumb, and he is going to beget the voice. It was because he did not believe that he was made speechless; rightly was he struck dumb, until the voice should be born. After all, if it rightly says, or rather because it certainly does rightly say in the holy psalm "I have believed, therefore have I spoken"; then because Zachariah did not believe, he very properly did not speak.

So it was the same Lord Christ, not only as Word but also as "mediator between God and humanity the man Christ Jesus," in whom the ancient fathers believed. They also handed on this same faith to us by their proclamation of it and by their prophesying. That is why the apostle says, "Since we have the same spirit of faith, of which it was written: I have believed, therefore have I spoken." So, "having the same spirit of faith," he says, of which it was written by the ancients, "I have believed, therefore have I spoken," "we too believe, therefore we too speak."
