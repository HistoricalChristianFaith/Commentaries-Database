"As for iniquity, I hate and abhor it; but Your law have I loved" [Psalm 119:163]. That awe, therefore, of His word did not create hatred of those words, but maintained his love unimpaired. For the words of God are no other than the law of God. Far be it therefore that love perish through fear, where fear is chaste. Thus fathers are at once feared and loved by affectionate sons; thus does the chaste wife at once fear her husband, lest she be forsaken by him, and loves him, that she may enjoy his love. If then the human father and the human husband desire at once to be feared and loved; much more does our Father who is in heaven, [Matthew 6:9] and that Bridegroom, "beautiful beyond the sons of men,"  not in the flesh, but in goodness. For by whom is the law of God loved, save by those by whom God is loved? And what that is severe has the father's law to good sons? [Hebrews 12:6] Let the Father's judgments therefore be praised even in the scourge, if His promises be loved in the reward.
