"For the King has greatly desired your beauty" [Psalm 45:11]. What "beauty" is that, save that which is His own work? "Greatly desired the beauty"— Of whom? Of her the sinner, the unrighteous, the ungodly, such as she was with her "father," the devil, and among her own "people"? No, but hers of whom it is said, "Who is this that comes up made white?"  She was not white then at the first, but was "made" white afterwards. For "though your sins shall be as scarlet, I will make them white as snow." [Isaiah 1:18] "The king has greatly desired your beauty." What King is this? "For He is the Lord your God."  Now consider whether you ought not to forego that your father, and your own people, and to come to this King, who is your God? Your God is "your King," your "King" is also your Bridegroom. Thou weddest to your King, who is your God: being endowed by Him, being adorned by Him; redeemed by Him, and healed by Him. Whatever you have, wherewith to be pleasing to Him, you have from Him.
