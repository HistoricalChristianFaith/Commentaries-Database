It appears to me that those who have taken the lion to point to Matthew, the man to Mark, the ox to Luke and the eagle to John have made a more reasonable application of the figures than those who have assigned the man to Matthew, the eagle to Mark and the lion to John. For in forming their particular idea of the matter, they have chosen to keep in view simply the beginnings of the book, and not the full design of the several Evangelists in its completeness, which was the matter that should, above all, have been thoroughly examined. For surely it is with much greater propriety that the Evangelist who has brought to our attention most particularly the kingly character of Christ should be taken as being represented by the lion.… That Luke is intended under the figure of the calf, in reference to the sacrifice made by the priest, has been doubted by neither of the two sets of interpreters.… In this way it further follows that Mark, who has set himself neither to give account of the royal lineage nor to expound anything distinctive of the priesthood … appears to be indicated simply under the figure of the man among those four living creatures.
