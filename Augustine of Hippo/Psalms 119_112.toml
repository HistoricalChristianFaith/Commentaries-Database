He then adds: "I have applied my heart to fulfil Your righteousness for ever, for my reward" [Psalm 119:112]. He who says, "I have applied my heart," had before said, "Incline my heart unto Your testimonies:"  so that we may understand that it is at once a divine gift, and an act of free will. But are we to fulfil the righteousnesses of God for ever? Those works which we perform in regard to the need of our neighbours, cannot be everlasting, any more than their need; but if we do not do them from love, there is no righteousness; if we do them from love, that love is everlasting, and an everlasting reward is in store for it.

111. He then addeth: "I have applied my heart to fulfil Thy righteousness for ever, for my reward" (ver. 112). He who saith, "I have applied my heart," had before said, "Incline my heart unto Thy testimonies:" so that we may understand that it is at once a divine gift, and an act of free will. But are we to fulfil the righteousnesses of God for ever? Those works which we perform in regard to the need of our neighbours, cannot be everlasting, any more than their need; but if we do not do them from love, there is no righteousness; if we do them from love, that love is everlasting, and an everlasting reward is in store for it.
