What else does the Lord’s passion present us with in our head Christ Jesus, but supremely the tests and trials of this life? That is why, as the time of his death drew near, Christ said to Peter, “Satan has asked for you all to sift you like wheat. And I have prayed, Peter, for you, that your faith should not fail. Go and strengthen your brothers.” He certainly has strengthened us by his apostolate, martyrdom and letters. In them he also warned us to fear the night I am speaking of and instructed us to be carefully vigilant, having the consolation of prophecy like a light in the night. “We have,” he said, “the more certain prophetic word, to which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns, and the morning star rises in your hearts.”

Now what is here said concerning the foregoing denial of Peter is contained in all the Evangelists, but they do not all happen to relate it upon the same occasion in the discourse. Matthew and Mark subjoin it after our Lord had departed from the house where He had eaten the Passover but Luke and John before He went out from thence. But we may easily understand either that the two former used these words, recapitulating them, or the two others anticipating them: only it rather moves us, that not only the words but even the sentences ofour Lord, in which Peter being troubled used that boast of dying either for or with our Lord, are given so differently, as rather to compel us to believe that he thrice uttered his boast at different parts of our Lord's discourse, and that he was thrice answered by our Lord, that before the cock crowed he should deny Him thrice.
