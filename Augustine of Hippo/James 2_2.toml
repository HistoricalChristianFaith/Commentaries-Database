Far from me is the notion that in your tabernacle, Lord, the rich should be more highly regarded than the poor, or the noble than the less wellborn. You have chosen the weak things of this world to put the strong to shame, and you have chosen things which are dishonorable, despised and of no account, in order to bring to nothing the things which are.
