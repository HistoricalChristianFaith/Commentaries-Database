That is why, when the Pharisees who were listening to what he was saying, themselves said, “We are not blind too, are we?” They were obviously like the one who had gone up to the temple and was telling God, “I thank you, because I am not like other people, unjust, adulterers, rapacious,” as though to say, “I thank you that I am not blind but can see, unlike other people of the same sort as this tax collector.” What did those ones say? “We are not blind too, are we?” And the Lord answered them, “If you were blind, you would not have any sin. Now however, because you say ‘We can see,’ your sins remain.” He did not say “your sin occurs” but remains. You see, it was already there; because when you do not confess it, it is not taken away but “remains.”

"And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into this world." But didst not Thou say, Lord, "I judge no man;" and, "I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world"? We are making inquiry about Thy words: Thou saidst Thyself, "I judge no man;" Thou saidst Thyself, "I am not come to judge the world, but to save the world;" and now we hear, "For judgment I am come into this world." Distinguish the senses; do not confound the words. Judgment for condemnation is one kind; judgment for examination, another. Attending, therefore, to the nature of His coming, in what sense is it that He says, "For judgment I am come into this world"? He explains what He says: "That they which see not might see; and that they which see might be made blind." On Him, therefore, who came to enlighten, it is the duty of him who lies in darkness to fix his eyes, in order that he may see. And such as are not humbly in subjection to Him whom they behold not, in order to be healed to beholding, think that they see by themselves, and from this presumption of their own sight are made blind.

"And some of the Pharisees who were with Him heard these words, and said unto Him, Are we also blind?" And what said the Lord? "If ye were blind, ye would have no sin." Why? Because ye would come to the physician, and apply for a remedy. But now, since ye say, "We see," your sin remaineth. Why? Because, in saying, "We see," ye seek not the physician, and remain in your blindness.

This, as best I was able, I have explained, in speaking now to those who have already been enlightened, and remember what they were, and are not ungrateful to Him who hath enlightened them. For where were they who have been enlightened, but in their sins-in their blindness? But the Enlightener was beside them. Let them hear and believe; let them draw near to Him and be enlightened.
