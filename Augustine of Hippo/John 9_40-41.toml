That is why, when the Pharisees who were listening to what he was saying, themselves said, “We are not blind too, are we?” They were obviously like the one who had gone up to the temple and was telling God, “I thank you, because I am not like other people, unjust, adulterers, rapacious,” as though to say, “I thank you that I am not blind but can see, unlike other people of the same sort as this tax collector.” What did those ones say? “We are not blind too, are we?” And the Lord answered them, “If you were blind, you would not have any sin. Now however, because you say ‘We can see,’ your sins remain.” He did not say “your sin occurs” but remains. You see, it was already there; because when you do not confess it, it is not taken away but “remains.”
