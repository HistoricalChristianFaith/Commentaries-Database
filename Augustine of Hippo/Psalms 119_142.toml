It is no wonder that they have forgotten the words of God, who have chosen to set up their own righteousness, ignorant of the righteousness of God; [Romans 10:3] but he, the younger, has not forgotten, for he has not wished to have a righteousness of his own, but that of God, of which he now also says, "Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your law is the truth" [Psalm 119:142]. For how is not the law truth, through which came the knowledge of sin, and that which gives testimony of the righteousness of God? For thus the Apostle says: "The righteousness of God is manifested, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets." [Romans 3:20-21]
