We have two lines of succession, one descending from Cain and the other from the son who was born to Adam in order to be the heir of Abel who was killed and to whom Adam gave the name of Seth. He is referred to in the words “God has given me another seed, for Abel whom Cain slew.” Thus it is that the two series of generations that are kept so distinct, the one from Seth and the other from Cain, symbolize the two cities with which I am dealing in this work, the heavenly city in exile on earth and the earthly city, whose only search and satisfaction are for and in the joys of earth.

Seth means “resurrection,” and the name of his son Enosh means “man.” The name Adam also means “man,” but in Hebrew it can be used for any human person, either male or female; as one can see from the text: “He created them male and female; and blessed them and called their name Adam.” This text leaves no doubt that Eve was given her proper name, whereas the common noun “adam,” or “human being,” applied to both Adam and Eve. It was different with the name Enosh. This means “man,” Hebrew scholars tell us, in the sense of a man as distinguished from a woman. Thus Enosh was a “son” of “resurrection.”
