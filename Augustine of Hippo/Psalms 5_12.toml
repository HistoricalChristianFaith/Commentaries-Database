"For You will bless the just man" [Psalm 5:12]. This is blessing, to glory in God, and to be inhabited by God. Such sanctification is given to the just. But that they may be justified, a calling goes before: which is not of merit, but of the grace of God. "For all have sinned, and want the glory of God." [Romans 3:23] "For whom He called, them He also justified; and whom He justified, them He also glorified." [Romans 8:30] Since then calling is not of our merit, but of the goodness and mercy of God, he went on to say, "O Lord, as with the shield of Your good will You have crowned us." For God's good will goes before our good will, to call sinners to repentance. And these are the arms whereby the enemy is overcome, against whom it is said, "Who will bring accusation against God's elect?" Again, "if God be for us, who can be against us? Who spared not His Only Son, but delivered Him up for us all."  "For if, when we were enemies, Christ died for us; much more being reconciled shall we be saved from wrath through Him." [Romans 5:10] This is that unconquerable shield, whereby the enemy is driven back, when he suggests despair of our salvation through the multitude of tribulations and temptations.
