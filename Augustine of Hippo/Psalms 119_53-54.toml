"Weariness has held me; for the ungodly that forsake Your law" [Psalm 119:53]. "Your statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage" [Psalm 119:54]. This is the low estate, in the house of mortality, of the man who sojourns away from Paradise and the Jerusalem above, whence one going down to Jericho fell among robbers; but, in consequence of the deed of mercy which was done him by that Samaritan, [Luke 10:30, 37] the statutes of God became his song in the house of his pilgrimage; although he was weary for the ungodly that forsook the law of God, since he was compelled to converse with them for a season in this life, until the floor be threshed. But these two verses may be adapted to the two clauses of the preceding verse, respectively.
