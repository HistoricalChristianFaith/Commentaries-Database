Christ rose again from the seed of David, as the son of David, because he had emptied himself. How did he empty himself? By taking what he was not, not by losing what he was. He emptied himself; he humbled himself. Though he was God, he made himself known as a man. He was despised as he walked the earth, though he made the sky. He was despised as a mere man, as though he had no power. Not only despised, but on top of that also killed. He was a stone lying flat; the Jews stumbled over him and were shaken. But what does he say about that himself? “Whoever stumbles over this stone will be shaken; but as for anyone upon whom this stone comes, it will crush him.” First he lay flat, and they stumbled; he will come from above and crush them, after they have been shaken.
