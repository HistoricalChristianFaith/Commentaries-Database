But after he had said, "And pity me according to Your law;" he mentions some of those blessings which he has already obtained, that he may ask others that he has not yet gained. For he says, "I have chosen the way of truth: and Your judgments I have not forgotten" [Psalm 119:30]. "I have stuck unto Your testimonies: O Lord, confound me not" [Psalm 119:31]: may I persevere in striving toward the point whereunto I am running: may I arrive whither I am running! So then "it is not of him that wills, nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy." [RomansÂ 9:16] He next says, "I will run the way of Your commandments, when You have widened my heart" [Psalm 119:32]. I could not run had Thou not widened my heart. The sense of the words, "I have chosen the way of truth, and Your judgments I have not forgotten: I have stuck unto Your testimonies," is clearly explained in this verse. For this running is along the way of the commandments of God. And because he does allege unto the Lord rather His blessings than his own deservings; as if it were said unto him, How have you run that way, by choosing, and by not forgetting the judgments of God, and by sticking to His testimonies? Couldest thou do these things by yourself? I could not, he replies. It is not therefore through my own will, as though it needed no aid of Yours; but because "You have widened my heart." The widening of the heart is the delight we take in righteousness. This is the gift of God, the effect of which is, that we are not straitened in His commandments through the fear of punishment, but widened through love, and the delight we have in righteousness....
