"For Thou, Lord, art my hope" [Psalm 91:9]. He has now come to the power Which rescues him from falling by the "downfall and the devil of the noon-day." "For Thou, Lord, art my hope: You have set Your house of defence very high." What do the words "very high" mean? For many make their house of defence in God a mere refuge from temporal persecution; but the defence of God is on high, and very secret, whither you may fly from the wrath to come. Within "You have set your house of defence very high. There shall no evil happen unto You: neither shall any plague come near Your dwelling" [Psalm 91:10].
