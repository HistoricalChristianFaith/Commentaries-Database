"Mine enemies revile me all day, and they that praised me are sworn together against me" [Psalm 102:8]. With their mouth they praised, in their heart they were laying snares for me. Hear their praise: "Master, we know that You are true, and teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest Thou for any man. Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?" [Matthew 22:16-17] And whence this evil repute, except because I came to make sinners my members, that by repentance they may be in my body? Thence is all the calumny, thence the persecution. "Why eats your Master with publicans and sinners? They that be whole need not a physician, but they that be sick." [Matthew 9:11-12] Would that you were aware of your sickness, that you might seek a physician; ye would not slay Him, and through your infatuated pride perish in a false health.
