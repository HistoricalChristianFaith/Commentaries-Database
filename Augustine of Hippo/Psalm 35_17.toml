"Lord, when will You look on? Rescue My Soul from their deceits, My Darling from the lions" [Psalm 35:17]. For to us the time is slow; and in our person is this said, "When will You look on?" that is, when shall we see vengeance upon those who insult us? When shall the Judge, overcome by weariness, hear the widow? [LukeÂ 18:3] But our Judge, not from weariness, but from love, delays our salvation; from reason, not from need; not that He could not even now succour us, but that the number of us all may be filled up even to the end. And yet out of our desire, what do we say? "Lord, when will You look on? Rescue My Soul from their deceits, My Darling from the lions:" that is, My Church from raging powers.
