What then is “grace for grace”? By faith we first win God’s favor; and we who were not worthy to have our sins forgiven, from the very fact that, though unworthy, we received so great a gift, it is called grace.…But having acquired this grace of faith, you will be justified by faith. “For the just person lives by faith.” And you will first win God’s favor from living by faith. When you have won God’s favor from living by faith, you will receive as a reward immortality and eternal life. And that is grace. Now for what merit do you receive eternal life? For grace. For if faith is grace, and if eternal life is, as it were, a reward for faith, God, indeed, seems to pay back eternal life as if it were owed—owed to whom? Owed to the person of faith because he won it by faith—always recalling that faith comes only by grace, and eternal life is a grace for grace.
