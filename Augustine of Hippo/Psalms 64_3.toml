"For they have whet like a sword their tongues" [Psalm 64:3]. Which says another Psalm also, "Sons of men; their teeth are arms and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword."  Let not the Jews say, we have not killed Christ. For to this end they gave Him to Pilate the judge, in order that they themselves might seem as it were guiltless of His death....But if he is guilty because he did it though unwillingly, are they innocent who compelled him to do it? By no means. But he gave sentence against Him, and commanded Him to be crucified: and in a manner himself killed Him; ye also, O you Jews, killed Him. Whence did ye kill Him? With the sword of the tongue: for you did whet your tongues. And when did ye smite, except when you cried out, "Crucify, Crucify"? [Luke 23:21]
