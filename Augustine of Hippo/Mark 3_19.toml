De Con. Evan. ii, 17: But letno one suppose that Simon now received his name and was called Peter, for thushe would make Mark contrary to John, who relates that it had been long before said unto him, “Thou shalt be called Cephas.” But Mark gives this account by way of recapitulation; for as he wished to give the names of the twelve Apostles, and was obliged to call him, Peter, his object was to intimate briefly, that he wasnot called this originally, but that the Lord gave him that name.
