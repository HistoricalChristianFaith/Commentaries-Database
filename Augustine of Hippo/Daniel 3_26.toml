Let faith be yours, and God will be with you in your trouble. There are waves on the sea, and you are tossed about in your cabin, because Christ sleeps.… If you allow faith to sleep in your heart, Christ is, you might say, sleeping with you in your ship. Because Christ dwells in you through faith, when you begin to be tossed about, awake Christ from his sleep. Awaken your faith, and you shall be assured he will not desert you. You may think that you are forsaken, because he does not rescue you at the very moment you desire. But did he not deliver the three children from the fire?

The flame could not approach or hurt the innocent and righteous children praising God, and he delivered them out of the fire. Some might say, “Truly, those who are righteous are those that are heard,” as it is written, “The righteous cried, and the Lord heard them and delivered them out of their troubles.” But I have cried, and he does not deliver me; either I am not righteous, or I do not do the things that he commands me to do or perhaps he just does not see me. Fear not: do what he commands you, and if he does not deliver you in bodily form, he will deliver you spiritually.… He delivered Peter when the angel came to him when he was in prison and said, “Arise, and go forth,” and suddenly his chains were released, and he followed the angel, and he delivered him. Had Peter, then, lost his righteousness when he did not deliver him from the cross? Did he not deliver him then? Even then God delivered him.… When God first delivered Peter, how many times did he suffer afterwards? So in the end, God sent him where he could suffer no evil.
