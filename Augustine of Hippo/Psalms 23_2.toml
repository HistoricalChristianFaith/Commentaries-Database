"In a place of pasture there has He placed me" [Psalm 23:2]. In a place of fresh pasture, leading me to faith,  there has He placed me to be nourished. "By the water of refreshing has He brought me up." By the water of baptism, whereby they are refreshed who have lost health and strength, has He brought me up.
