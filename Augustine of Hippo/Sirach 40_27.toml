The church, for the faithful servants of God who live in temperance, justice and love for God, is rightly called paradise, rich as it is with abundant graces and chaste delights. Even in tribulation, such a servant glories in his patience and is filled with great joy because the consolations of God gladden his soul in proportion to the many sufferings he experiences in his heart.
