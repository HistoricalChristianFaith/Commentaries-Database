He who came to seek that which was lost, sought the lost one. This was what they marveled at: they marveled at His goodness; they did not suspect evil.
Hydria answers to our word aquarium; hydor being Greek for water.
The circumstance of the womanâ€™s leaving her water pot on going away, must not be overlooked. For the water pot signifies the love of this world,) concupiscence, by which men from the dark depth, of which the well is the image, i.e. from an earthly conversation, draw up pleasure. It was right then for one who believed in Christ to renounce the world, and, by leaving her water pot, to show that she had parted with worldly desires.
She cast away therefore concupiscence, and hastened to proclaim the truth. Let those who wish to preach the Gospel, learn, that they should first leave their water pots at the well.
