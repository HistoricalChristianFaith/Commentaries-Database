Asaph has understood, because on the Title of the Psalm there is, "understanding of Asaph." And what says he? "But God, our King before the worlds, has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth" [Psalm 74:12]. On the one hand we cry, "No longer is there prophet, and us He will not know as yet:"  but on the other hand, "our God, our King, who is before the worlds" (for He is Himself in the beginning of the Word [JohnÂ 1:1] by whom were made the worlds), "has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth." "God therefore, our King before the worlds," has done what? "has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth:" and I am yet crying as if forsaken!...Now the Gentiles are awake, and we are snoring, and as though God has forsaken us, in dreams we are delirious. "He has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth."
