Asaph has understood, because on the Title of the Psalm there is, "understanding of Asaph." And what says he? "But God, our King before the worlds, has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth" [Psalm 74:12]. On the one hand we cry, "No longer is there prophet, and us He will not know as yet:"  but on the other hand, "our God, our King, who is before the worlds" (for He is Himself in the beginning of the Word [John 1:1] by whom were made the worlds), "has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth." "God therefore, our King before the worlds," has done what? "has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth:" and I am yet crying as if forsaken!...Now the Gentiles are awake, and we are snoring, and as though God has forsaken us, in dreams we are delirious. "He has wrought Salvation in the midst of the earth."

In the same way we may suitably understand what we read in the psalm, “But God, our King before the worlds, hath wrought salvation in the midst of the earth;” so that the Lord Jesus may be understood to be our God who is before the worlds, because by him the worlds were made, working our salvation in the midst of the earth, for the Word was made flesh and dwelt in an earthly body.
