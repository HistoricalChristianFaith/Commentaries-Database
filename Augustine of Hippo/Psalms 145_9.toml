quote = "The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all his works."
content = '''"Sweet is the Lord to all, and His compassions reach into all His works." Hear the Scripture: "I will not the death of a sinner, but rather that he should turn, and live." By these words of God, he is brought back to hope; but there is another snare to be feared, lest through this very hope he sin the more. What then did you also say, thou who through hope sinnest yet more? "Whenever I turn, God will forgive me all; I will do whatsoever I will." Say not then, "Tomorrow I will turn, tomorrow I will please God; and all today's and yesterday's deeds shall be forgiven me." You say true: God has promised pardon to your conversion; He has not promised a tomorrow to your delay.'''
