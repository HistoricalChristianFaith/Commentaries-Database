"They were initiated also unto Baalpeor;" that is, were consecrated to the Gentile idol; "and ate the offerings of the dead" [Psalm 106:28]. "Thus they provoked Him to anger with their own inventions; and destruction was multiplied among them" [Psalm 106:29]. As if He had deferred the lifting up of His hand which was to cast them down in the desert, and to cast out their seed among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands; as the Apostle says: "And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge,  God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient." [RomansÂ 1:28] "'Destruction,' therefore, 'was multiplied among them,' when they were heavily punished for their heavy sins."
