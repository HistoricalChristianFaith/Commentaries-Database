Then, a little further on in the same book [Genesis], one could just as easily have noticed the verse “Everything on the dry land in whose nostrils was the breath of life died.” This means that everything that lived on the earth perished in the flood. Thus we find that Holy Scripture is accustomed to use both phrases—“living soul” and “the breath of life”—in regard even to beasts, and in the verse “All things wherein there is the breath of life” the Greek text does not use the word pneuma but pnoē.
