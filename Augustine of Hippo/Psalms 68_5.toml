"Exult ye in the sight of Him," O you to whom has been said, "Sing ye to God, psalm ye to the name of Him, a way make ye to Him that has ascended above the setting," also "exult in the sight of Him:" as if "sorrowful, yet always rejoicing." [2 Corinthians 6:10] For while you make a way to Him, while you prepare a way whereby He may come and possess the nations, you are to suffer in the sight of men many sorrowful things. But not only faint not, but even exult, not in the sight of men, but in the sight of God. "In hope rejoicing, in tribulation enduring:" [Romans 12:12] "exult ye in the sight of Him." For they that in the sight of men trouble you, "shall be troubled by the face of Him, the Father of orphans and Judge of widows" [Psalm 68:5]. For desolate they suppose them to be, from whom ofttimes by the sword of the Word of God [Matthew 10:34] both parents from sons, and husbands from wives, are severed: but persons destitute and widowed have the consolation "of the Father of orphans and Judge of widows:" they have the consolation of Him that say to Him, "For my father and my mother have forsaken me, but the Lord has taken up me:"  and they that have hoped in the Lord, continuing in prayers by night and by day: [1 Timothy 5:5] by whose face those men shall be troubled when they shall have seen themselves prevail nothing, for that the whole world has gone away after Him. [John 12:19] For out of those orphans and widows, that is, persons destitute of partnership in this world's hope, the Lord for Himself does build a Temple: whereof in continuation he says, "The Lord is in His holy place."
