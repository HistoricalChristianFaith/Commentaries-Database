Finally he adds, "Intimate to me the way of Your righteousness" [Psalm 119:27]; or, as some copies have it, "instruct me;" which is expressed more closely from the Greek, "Make me to understand the way of Your righteousnesses; so shall I be exercised in Your wondrous things." These higher commandments, which he desires to understand by edification, he calls the wondrous things of God. There are then some righteousnesses of God so wondrous, that human weakness may be believed incapable of fulfilling them by those who have not tried. Whence the Psalmist, struggling and wearied with the difficulty of obeying them, says, "My soul has slumbered for very heaviness: O establish Thou me with Your word!" [Psalm 119:28]. What means, has slumbered? save that he has cooled in the hope which he had entertained of being able to reach them. But, he adds, "Stablish Thou me with Your word:" that I may not by slumbering fall away from those duties which I feel that I have already attained: establish Thou me therefore in those words of Yours that I already hold, that I may be able to reach unto others through edification.
