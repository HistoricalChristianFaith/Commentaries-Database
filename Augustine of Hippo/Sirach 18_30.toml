The perfection of the good consists in being totally free from lust because the elimination of evil consists in this. This is what the apostle asserts: "The perfect performance of good is not in my power." It was not in his power not to feel lust. It was in his power to refrain from lust, however, in order not to give in to it and to refuse to offer his members to the service of lust. "To perfect that which is good is not in my power," since it is impossible for me to fulfill the commandment: "You shall not lust." What is therefore necessary? That you put into practice, "Do not follow after your lusts." This is what you do so long as illicit lusts are present in your flesh: "Do not follow after your lusts." Remain faithful to the service of God, in the liberty of Christ. Serve the law of God with your mind. Do not yield to your lusts, because when you follow them, you add to their strength. By giving them strength, how can you hope to conquer them when you are nourishing these very enemies on your own strength? - "Tractates on the Gospel of John 41.12"
