"Forget not the voice of them that implore You" [Psalm 74:23]. While they groan for and expect now that which You have promised from the New Testament, and walk by that same Faith, "do Thou not forget the voice of them imploring You." But those still say, "Where is Your God? Let the pride of them that hate You come up always to You." Do not forget even their pride. Nor does He forget: no doubt He does either punish or amend.

23. "Forget not the voice of them that implore Thee" (ver. 23). While they groan for and expect now that which Thou hast promised from the New Testament, and walk by that same Faith, "do Thou not forget the voice of them imploring Thee." But those still say, "Where is Thy God? Let the pride of them that hate Thee come up always to Thee." Do not forget even their pride. Nor doth He forget: no doubt He doth either punish or amend.
