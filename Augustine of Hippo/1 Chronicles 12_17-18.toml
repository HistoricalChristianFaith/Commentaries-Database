“The Lord shall give the Word to them that preach good tidings, with great power.” Of you, also, I venture to make this prayer, that, in this struggle of ours, truth may prevail. For you are not seeking your own glory but Christ’s, and when you win the victory, I also shall win it if I recognize my own error, and, contrarily, you prevail when I win, “for neither ought the children to lay up for the parents, but the parents for the children.” And in the book of Paralipomenon we read that the sons of Israel went out to fight with peaceful heart, in the very midst of swords and blood shedding and the bodies of the slain, because they were thinking of the victory of peace, not their own.
