The time when our external enemy the devil will be under our feet is when the internal enemy, covetousness, has been healed, and we shall be living in peace. What sort of peace? The sort that “eye has not seen nor ear heard.” What sort of peace? The sort that no imagination can conceive and no quarreling intrude on. What sort of peace? The sort about which the apostle said, “And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts.” About this peace the prophet Isaiah says, “O Lord our God, give us peace, for you have given us everything you promised.” You promised Christ; you have given him to us. You promised his cross and the shedding of his blood for the forgiveness of sins; you have given them to us. You promised his ascension and the sending of the Holy Spirit from heaven; you have given them to us. You promised us a church spread throughout the world; you have given it. You promised there would be heretics to try us and put us through our paces, and the church would triumph over their errors; you have given this. You promised the abolition of the idols of the heathen; you have given it.

What’s the meaning of “Where, death, is your sting?” It means, “Where is sin?” You ask, and it is nowhere. “For the sting of death is sin.” They are the apostle’s words, not mine. That is when we will be able to say, “Where, death, is your sting?” Sin will be nowhere, neither to take you captive, nor to assault you nor to tickle your consciousness. That is when we will not say, “Forgive us our debts.” But what will we say? “Lord our God, give us peace, for you have given us everything.”
