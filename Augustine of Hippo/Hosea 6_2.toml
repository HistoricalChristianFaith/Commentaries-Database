Further on, Hosea foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day, but in the mysterious way that is proper to prophecy. He says, “He shall heal us after two days, and on the third day we shall rise again.” This is the idea underlying the words of Paul [when he says], “Therefore if you have risen in Christ, seek the things that are above.”
