Let us believe in Christ crucified; but in him as the one who rose again on the third day. That’s the faith that distinguishes us from them, distinguishes us from the pagans, distinguishes us from the Jews—the faith by which we believe that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead. The apostle says to Timothy, “Remember that Jesus Christ has risen from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel.” And again the same apostle, “Because if you believe in your heart,” he says, “that Jesus is Lord, and confess with your lips that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.” This is the salvation, the wellbeing, the safety and the soundness, which I discussed yesterday. Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved. I know that you believe; you will be saved. Hold firmly in your hearts, profess it with your lips, that Christ has risen from the dead.
