We listen to the voice of the cornerstone.… Did he think of himself as glorified because the Gentiles wished to see? No. But he saw that after his passion and resurrection, the Gentiles in all lands would believe in him … and took occasion from this request of some Gentiles to see him to announce the approaching fullness of the Gentiles. For the Gentiles would believe that the hour of his being glorified was now at hand and that after he was glorified in the heavens the Gentiles would believe, as it is written in the psalm, “Set yourself up, O God, above the heavens, … and your glory above all the earth.” … But it was necessary that his exaltation and glory should be preceded by the humiliation of his passion.
