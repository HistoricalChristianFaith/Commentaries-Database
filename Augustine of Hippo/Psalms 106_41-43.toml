"Insomuch that He abhorred His own inheritance; and He gave them over into the hand of the heathen: and they that hated them were lords over them" [Psalm 106:41]: "and their enemies oppressed them, and they were brought low under their hands" [Psalm 106:42]. Since he has called them the inheritance of God, it is clear that He abhorred them, and gave them over into their enemies' hands, not in order to their perdition, but for their discipline. Lastly, he says, "Many a time did He deliver them." "But they provoked Him with their own counsels" [Psalm 106:43]. This is what he said above, "They did not abide His counsel." Now a man's counsel is pernicious to himself, when he seeks those things which are his own only, not those which are God's. [Philippians 2:21] In whose inheritance, which inheritance He Himself is to us, when He deigns His presence for our enjoyment, being with the Saints, we shall suffer no straitening from the society, by our love of anything as our own possession. For that most glorious city, when it has gained the promised inheritance, in which none shall die, none shall be born, will not contain citizens who shall individually rejoice in their own, for "God shall be all in all." [1 Corinthians 15:28] And whoever in this pilgrimage faithfully and earnestly does long for this society, does accustom himself to prefer common to private interests, by seeking not his own things, but Jesus Christ's: lest, by being wise and vigilant in his own affairs, he provoke God with his own counsel; but, hoping for what he sees not, let him not hasten to be blessed with things visible; and, patiently waiting for that everlasting happiness which he sees not, follow His counsel in His promises, whose aid he prays for in his prayers. Thus he will also become humble in his confessions; so as not to be like those, of whom it is said, "They were brought down in their wickedness."
