Rightly does God through the prophet reproach the sinful soul that goes whoring away from him and say, “You thought, if you withdrew from me, you would have more?” But like that younger son, why, you have ended up feeding pigs; why, you have lost all things;11 why, you have remained in want and left it very late before you grew tired and came back. Now at last realize that what the Father gave you, he could keep for you more safely.… O sinful soul, filled with harlotries, turned foul and faded, turned unclean, and still loved like that! So go back to the beautiful one, in order to return to beauty; go back and speak to him who alone suffices you.… So lift your heart up, do not leave it on the ground, or in those beggarly treasures or in a place to rot. In Adam, too, the root of all evils was avarice. You see, he wanted more than he had received, because God had not been enough for him.
