Certainly, if the Pharisees’ knowledge that our Lord was making more disciples and baptizing more than John had been such as to lead them wholeheartedly to follow him and desire baptism by him, he would not have left Judea; rather, he would have remained for their sake. But seeing, as he did that this knowledge about him was coupled with envy, making them persecutors instead of followers, he left. He also could have stayed among them, if he had wanted to, and escaped their hands.… But he wanted to provide himself as an example for believers in time to come, that it was no sin for a servant of God to seek refuge from the fury of persecutors.… He did it like a good teacher, not out of fear for himself but for our instruction.

It may perhaps surprise you that it is said, “Jesus baptized more than John,” and after this was added, “although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples did.” What then? Was the statement made false, and then corrected by this addition? … Or are both true, that is, that Jesus both did and also did not baptize? He did in fact baptize, because it was he who cleansed. And he also did not baptize, because it was not he who touched. The disciples supplied the ministry of the body; he afforded the aid of his majesty. Now, when could he cease from baptizing, so long as he did not cease from cleansing? In fact, John the Baptist said about him, “This is he that baptizes.” Jesus, therefore, is still baptizing. And so long as we continue to be baptized, Jesus baptizes. Let a person come without fear to the minister below, for he has a master above.
