There is no doubt that human wills cannot resist the will of God, “who has done whatsoever he pleased in heaven and on earth,” and who has even “formed the things that are to come.” Nor can the human will prevent [God] from doing what he wills, seeing that even with human wills, he does what he wills, when he wills to do it.
