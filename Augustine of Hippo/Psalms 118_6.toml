text = '''But are men, then, the only enemies that the Church has? What is a man devoted to flesh and blood, save flesh and blood? But the Apostle says, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against," he says, "spiritual wickedness in high places;" that is, the devil and his angels; that devil whom elsewhere he calls "the prince of the power of the air."'''
