We are commanded to do good when it says: “Decline from evil and do good,” but we pray to do good when it says: “We cease not to pray for you, asking,” and among other things that Paul asks he mentions: “That you may walk worthy of God in all things pleasing, in every good work and good word.” As then we acknowledge the part played by the will when these commands are given, so let him acknowledge the part played by grace when these petitions are offered. .
