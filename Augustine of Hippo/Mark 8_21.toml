De Con. Evan., 2, 51: Now in Matthew we read that He entered into the parts of Magdala .But we cannot doubt that it is the same place under another name; for several manuscripts even of St. Mark have only Magdala.It goes on, “And the Pharisees came forth, and began to question with Him, seeking of Him a sign from heaven, tempting Him.”.
Let no one, however, be perplexed that the answer which Mark says was given to them, when they sought asign from heaven, is not the same as that which Matthew relates, namely, that concerning Jonah. He says that the Lord’s answer was, that no sign should be given to it; by which we must understand such an one as they asked for, that is, one from heaven; but he has omitted to say, what Matthew has related.
