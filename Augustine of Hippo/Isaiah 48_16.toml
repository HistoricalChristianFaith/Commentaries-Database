Furthermore, he could not be sent by the Father without the Holy Spirit. On principle, when the Father sent him, that is made him of woman, he cannot be supposed to have done it without the Spirit.… There is even a prophecy of Isaiah in which Christ himself is understood as saying about his future coming, “And now the Lord and his Spirit has sent me.” - "On the Trinity 2.2.8"

Now it is Jesus Christ who is speaking here as the “Lord God”; yet this would not have been obvious if he had not added the final words, “And now the Lord God has sent me and his Spirit.” These words were spoken by Christ in his “form” as a “servant.” He used a verb in the past tense to indicate a future event. - "City of God 20.30"
