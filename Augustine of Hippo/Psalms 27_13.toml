"I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living" [Psalm 27:13]. And since my Lord has first suffered these things, if I too despise the tongues of the dying ("for the mouth that lies slays the soul" [Wisdom 1:11]), I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living, where there is no place for falsity.
