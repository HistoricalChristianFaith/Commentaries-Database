"I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living" [Psalm 27:13]. And since my Lord has first suffered these things, if I too despise the tongues of the dying ("for the mouth that lies slays the soul" [WisdomÂ 1:11]), I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living, where there is no place for falsity.

13. "I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living" (ver. 13). And since my Lord hath first suffered these things, if I too despise the tongues of the dying ("for the mouth that lieth slayeth the soul" ), I believe to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living, where there is no place for falsity.
