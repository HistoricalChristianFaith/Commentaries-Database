"Wherefore have You repelled us, O God, unto the end?" [Psalm 74:1]. "Have repelled unto the end," in the person of the congregation which is properly called Synagogue. "Wherefore have You repelled us, O God, unto the end?" He censures not, but inquires "wherefore," for what purpose, because of what have You done this? What have You done? "You have repelled us unto the end." What is, "unto the end"? Perchance even unto the end of the world. Have You repelled us unto Christ, who is the End to every one believing? [RomansÂ 10:4] For, "Wherefore have You repelled us, O God, unto the end?" "Your spirit  has been angry at the sheep of Your flock." Wherefore were You angry at the sheep of Your flock, but because to things earthly we were cleaving, and the Shepherd we knew not?
