The Samaritan woman at the well found the Lord thirsting, and by him thirsting, she was filled. She first found him thirsting in order that he might drink from her faith. And when he was on the cross, he said, “I thirst,” although they did not give him that for which he was thirsting. For he was thirsting for them.

Jesus said, “I thirst,” as if he were saying, There is one thing still you have failed to do, that is, to give me what you are. For the Jews were themselves the vinegar, degenerated as they were from the wine of the patriarchs and prophets and filled like a full vessel with the wickedness of this world, with hearts like a sponge, deceitful in the formation of its cavernous and tortuous recesses. But the hyssop, on which they placed the sponge filled with vinegar, being a lowly herb and purging the heart, we rightly take for the humility of Christ himself. This humility is what they enclosed and imagined that they had completely ensnared. And so we have it said in the psalm, “You shall purge me with hyssop, and I shall be cleansed.” For it is by Christ’s humility that we are cleansed because, if he had not humbled himself and became obedient unto the death of the cross, his blood certainly would not have been shed for the remission of sins or, in other words, for our cleansing.
