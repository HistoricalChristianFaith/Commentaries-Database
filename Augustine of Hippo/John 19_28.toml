The Samaritan woman at the well found the Lord thirsting, and by him thirsting, she was filled. She first found him thirsting in order that he might drink from her faith. And when he was on the cross, he said, “I thirst,” although they did not give him that for which he was thirsting. For he was thirsting for them.
