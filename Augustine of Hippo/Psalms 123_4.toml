"Our soul is filled exceedingly; a reproach to the wealthy, and a contempt to the proud" [Psalm 123:4]. We were asking who were "the wealthy:" he has expounded to you, in that he has said, "the proud." "Reproach" and "contempt" are the same: and "wealthy" is the same with "proud." It is a repetition of the sentence, "a reproach to the wealthy, and a contempt to the proud." Why are the proud wealthy? Because they wish to be happy here. Why? Since they themselves too are miserable, are they wealthy? But perhaps when they are miserable, they do not mock us. Listen, my beloved. Then perchance they mock when they are happy, when they boast themselves in the pomp of their riches! When they boast themselves in the inflated state of false honours: then they mock us, and seem to say, Behold, it is well with me: I enjoy the good things before me: let those who promise what they cannot show depart from me: what I see, I hold; what I see, I enjoy; may I fare well in this life. Be thou more secure; for Christ has risen again, and has taught you what He will give in another life: be assured that He gives it. But that man mocks you, because he holds what he has. Bear with his mockeries, and you will laugh at his groans: for afterwards there will come a season when these very persons will say, "This was he whom we had sometimes in derision." [Wisdom 5:3] ...

We must find out whence true patience, worthy of the name, is to be had. There are those who attribute it to the powers of human will, not those that people have from divine assistance but from their own free will. But that is an arrogant error. It is the error of the rich about which the psalm speaks, “a reproach to the rich and contempt to the proud.” It is not the patience of the poor, which “shall not perish forever.” For the poor receive it from the wealthy One to whom it is said, “You are my God, for you have no need of my goods,” from whom “is every best gift and every perfect gift,” on whom the poor and needy person calls, who praises his name and by seeking, by asking, by knocking, says, “Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the sinner and out of the hand of the transgressor of the law and of the unjust. For you are my patience, O Lord: my hope, from my youth.” The rich and those who disdain being needy before the Lord should not receive true patience from him. Glorying in their own false patience, they wish “to confound the counsel of the poor person, but the Lord is his hope.” Since they are human and attribute so much to themselves, that is, to their human will, they do not tend to apply to themselves the words of Scripture: “Cursed is everyone that trusts in man.” For, even if sometimes in order not to displease people or to suffer worse ills, they bear up under things that are hard and rugged, or else in pleasing themselves and loving their own presumption they suffer these same evils with an arrogant will, that which the blessed James the apostle said about wisdom must be said to them about their patience: “This is not the wisdom that descends from above. It is earthly, sensual, devilish.” For, why is there not a false patience of the proud just as there is a false wisdom of the proud? He who is the source of true wisdom is also the source of true patience. And to him the one who is poor in spirit sings, “My soul is subject to God, for from him is my patience.”
