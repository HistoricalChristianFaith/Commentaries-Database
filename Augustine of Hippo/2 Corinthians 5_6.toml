Man indeed brought death to himself and to the Son of Man, but the Son of Man, by dying and rising again, brought life to man.… He wished to suffer this in the sight of his enemies, that they might think him, as it were, forsaken, and that the grace of the New Testament might be entrusted to us, to make us learn to seek another happiness, which we now possess by faith, but then we shall behold it. “For while we are in the body,” says the apostle, “we are absent from the Lord, for we walk by faith and not by sight.” Therefore, we now live in hope, but then we shall enjoy reality.
