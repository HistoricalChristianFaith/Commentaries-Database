And he therefore adds, "Do well, O Lord, unto those that are good and true of heart" [Psalm 125:4]. They who are right in heart, of whom I was speaking a little before—they who follow the will of God, not their own will,— reflect upon this. But they who wish to follow God, allow Him to go before, and themselves to follow; not themselves to go before, and Him to follow; and in all things they find Him good, whether chastening, or consoling, or exercising, or crowning, or cleansing, or enlightening; as the Apostle says, "We know that all things work together for good to them that love God." [Romans 8:28]
