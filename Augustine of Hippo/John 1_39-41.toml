Do we think that it was not at all important for the Evangelist to tell us what hour it was? Is it possible that he wanted us to notice nothing there, to seek nothing? It was the tenth hour. This number signifies the law, for the law was given in Ten Commandments. But the time had come that the law was to be fulfilled through love because it could not be fulfilled by the Jews through fear. This is why the Lord says, “I have not come to destroy the law but to fulfill.”
