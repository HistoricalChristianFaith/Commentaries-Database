"The Lord is in His holy temple" [Psalm 11:4], yea in such wise as the Apostle says, "For the temple of God is holy, which" temple "you are." [1 Corinthians 3:17] "Now if any man shall violate the temple of God, him shall God destroy." He violates the temple of God, who violates unity: for he "holds not the head, from which the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies  according to the working after the measure of every part makes increase of the body to the edifying of itself in love."  The Lord is in this His holy temple; which consists of His many members, fulfilling each his own separate duties, by love built up into one building. Which temple he violates, who for the sake of his own pre-eminence separates himself from the Catholic society. "The Lord is in His holy temple; the Lord, His seat is in heaven." If you take heaven to be the just man, as you take the earth to be the sinner, to whom it was said, "Earth you are, and unto earth shall you go;" [Genesis 3:19] the words, "The Lord is in His holy temple" you will understand to be repeated, while it is said, "The Lord, His seat is in heaven."
