"They shall not be ashamed in the evil time." In the day of trouble, in the day of distress, they shall not be "ashamed," as one is ashamed whose hope deceives him. Who is the person who is "ashamed"? The one who says, "I have not found that which I was in hope of." Nor undeservedly either. You hoped for it from yourself or from a person, your friend. But "cursed is one who puts his trust in humankind." You are ashamed because your hope has deceived you; your hope that was based on a lie. - "Expositions of the Psalms 37.8"

No, I say that either before the law, or in the time of the Old Testament, they were freed from sins, not by their own power, because "cursed is everyone who has put his hope in humankind," and without any doubt those are under this curse whom also the sacred psalm notifies, "who trust in their own strength," nor by the old covenant that gives birth to bondage … but I say that they were freed by the blood of the Redeemer, who is the one Mediator of God and people, the Christ Jesus.
