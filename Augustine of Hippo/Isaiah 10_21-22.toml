May the remnant be saved, as Isaiah said, “and the remnant has” clearly “been saved.” For out of them were the twelve apostles, out of them more than five hundred brothers, to whom the Lord showed himself after his resurrection. Out of their number were so many thousands baptized, who laid the price of their possessions at the apostles’ feet. Thus then was fulfilled the prayer here made to God: “For your servant David’s sake, turn not away the presence of your anointed.”

The remnant means the Jews who have believed in Christ. Many of them, we remember, did believe in the days of the apostles, and even today there are some converts, although very few.

And it is their own Scriptures that bear witness that it is not we who are the inventors of the prophecies touching Christ. That is why many of them, who pondered these prophecies before his passion and more especially after his resurrection, have come to believe in him, as was foretold: “For if your people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be converted.”

Through this Son of man, Christ Jesus, and from his remnant, that is, the apostles and the many others who from among the Israelites have believed in Christ as God, and with the increasing plenitude of the Gentiles, the holy vineyard is being completed.
