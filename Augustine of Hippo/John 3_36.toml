“Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life.” Why? Because he has done the work of God, seeing that this is the work of God that you should believe in the one whom he has sent. “But whoever does not believe in the Son will not have life, but the wrath of God remains on him”; not “will come upon him” but “remains on him.” He is abandoned, not healed.
