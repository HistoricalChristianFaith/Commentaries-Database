“Many a time have they fought against me from my youth up.” The church speaks of those whom it tolerates, and as if it were asked, “Is it now?” The church is of ancient birth. As long as saints have been so called, the church has been on earth. At one time the church was in Abel only, and he was fought against by his wicked and lost brother Cain. At one time the church was in Enoch alone, and he was translated from the unrighteous. At one time the church was in the house of Noah alone and endured all who perished by the flood, and the ark alone swam on the waves and escaped to shore. At one time the church was in Abraham alone, and we know what he endured from the wicked. The church was in his brother’s son, Lot, alone, and in his house, in Sodom; and he endured the iniquities and perversities of Sodom, until God freed him from their midst. The church also began to exist in the people of Israel: they endured Pharaoh and the Egyptians. The number of the saints began to be also in the church, that is, in the people of Israel. Moses and the rest of the saints endured the wicked Jews, the people of Israel. We come to our Lord Jesus Christ: The gospel was preached in the Psalms. … For this reason, lest the church wonder now, or lest any one wonder in the church who wishes to be a good member of the church, let him hear the church his mother saying to him, Marvel not at these things, my child: “many a time have they fought against me from my youth up.”

You accuse a person of greed, and he accuses God on the ground that he made gold. Do not be covetous. And God, you reply, should not make gold. This now remains, because you can not restrain your evil deeds, you accuse the good works of God: the creator and architect of the world displeases you. He ought not to make the sun either; for many contend concerning the lights of their windows and drag each other before courts of law. Oh, if we could restrain our vices! For all things are good, because a good God made all things; and his works praise him, when their goodness is considered by him who has the spirit of discerning them, the spirit of piety and wisdom.
