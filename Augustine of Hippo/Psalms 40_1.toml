Let us say then what this Psalm says. "I waited patiently for the Lord" [Psalm 40:1]. I waited patiently for the promise of no mere mortal who can both deceive and be himself deceived: I waited for the consolation of no mere mortal, who may be consumed by sorrow of his own, before he gives me comfort. Should a brother mortal attempt to comfort me, when he himself is in sorrow likewise? Let us mourn in company; let us weep together, let us "wait patiently" together, let us join our prayers together also. Whom did I wait for but for the Lord? The Lord, who though He puts off the fulfilment of His promises, yet never recalls them? He will make it good; assuredly He will make it good, because He has made many of His promises good already: and of God's truth we ought to have no fears, even if as yet He had made none of them good. Lo! let us henceforth think thus, He has promised us everything; He has not as yet given us possession of anything; He is a sponsible Promiser; a faithful Paymaster: do you but show yourself a dutiful exactor of what is promised; and if you be "weak," if you be one of the little ones, claim the promise of His mercy. Do you not see tender  lambs striking their dams' teats with their heads, in order that they may get their fill of milk?..."And He took heed unto me, and heard my cry." He took heed to it, and He heard it. See you have not waited in vain. His eyes are over you. His ears turned towards you. For, "the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears are open unto their cry."  What then? Did He not see you, when you used to do evil and to blaspheme Him? What then becomes of what is said in that very Psalm, "The face of the Lord is upon them that do evil"?  But for what end? "that He may cut off the remembrance of them from the earth." Therefore, even when thou were wicked, He "took heed of you;" but He "took no heed to you."  So then to him who "waited patiently for the Lord," it was not enough to say, He took heed of me, He says, "He took heed  to me;" that is, He took heed by comforting me, that He might do me good. What was it that He took heed to? "and He heard my cry."

1. Of all those things which our Lord Jesus Christ has foretold, we know part to have been already accomplished, part we hope will be accomplished hereafter. All of them, however, will be fulfilled, because He is "the Truth" who speaks them, and requires of us to be as "faithful," as He Himself speaks them faithfully. ...
