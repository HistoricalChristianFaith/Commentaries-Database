"My soul shall be patient for the Lord:" that hereafter it may be filled with dainties incorruptible, meanwhile, while here it remains, my soul shall be patient for the Lord. "For He is our Helper and Defender" [Psalm 33:20]: our Helper He is, while we endeavour after Him; and our Defender, while we resist the adversary.
