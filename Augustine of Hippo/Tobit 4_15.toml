“You loved malice above kindness.” Do you want proof that an evil person can see both, malice and kindness, yet chooses malice and turns away from kindness? Here it is. Why do such people complain when suffering unjustly? Why do they, in that situation, exaggerate the injustice as much as possible while commending kindness and denounce the offender who in treating them so badly has put malice above kindness? Let such people be their own criterion; let them judge their own behavior by their experience. If they will only obey Scripture’s injunction, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself,” and “Whatever good you want people to do for you, do the same yourselves for them,” they will have within themselves evidence that they must not treat others as they would not wish to be treated themselves.
