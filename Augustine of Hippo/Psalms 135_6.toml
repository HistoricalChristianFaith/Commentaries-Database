"All whatsoever the Lord willed, He made in the heaven, and in the earth, in the sea, and in all its deep places" [Psalm 135:6]. Who can comprehend these things? Who can enumerate the works of the Lord in the heaven and earth, in the sea, and in all deep places? Yet if we cannot comprehend them all, we should believe and hold them without question, because whatever creature is in heaven, whatever is in earth, whatever is in the sea and in all deep places, has been made by the Lord....

But as I said that the only thing the Almighty cannot do is what he does not will, in case anybody should consider it was very rash of me to say that the Almighty cannot do something, the blessed apostle said it too: “If we do not believe, he remains faithful, he cannot deny himself.” But it is because he does not wish to that he cannot do it, because he cannot even have the will to. Justice, after all, cannot have the will to do what is unjust, or wisdom will what is foolish or truth will what is false.Thus we are advised that almighty God not only, as the apostle says, “cannot deny himself,” but cannot do many things as well. Here I am saying it, and it is by his truth I dare to say what I dare not deny: almighty God cannot die, cannot change, cannot be deceived or mistaken, cannot be miserable, cannot be defeated. Perish the thought that the Almighty should be able to do these and similar things. And so it is that truth not only shows he is almighty because he cannot do these things but also requires anyone who can do them not to be almighty. God, you see, is willingly whatever he is; so he is willingly eternal, unchangeable, truthful, blessed and undefeatable. So if he can be what he does not wish, he is not almighty; but he is almighty, which is why he is capable of whatever he wishes. And therefore what he does not will he cannot be, the reason he is called almighty is that he is capable of whatever he wishes. As the psalm says about him, “In heaven and on earth he has done whatever he has willed.”

Accordingly, there is no doubt that human wills cannot resist the will of God, “who has done whatsoever he pleased in heaven and on earth” and who has even “done the things that are to come.” Nor can the human will prevent him from doing what he wills, seeing that even with the wills of people he does what he wills, when he wills to do it. Take, for instance, the case of Saul. When God willed to give the kingdom to Saul, was it in the power of the Israelites to subject themselves to him or not to subject themselves? In a sense, yes; but not in such a way that they were able to resist God. As a matter of fact, God carried the matter through by means of the wills of people themselves, having, as he undoubtedly does, the almighty power to bend human hearts whithersoever he pleases. So it is written, “And Samuel sent away all the people, everyone to his own house. Saul also departed to his own house in Gabaa; and there went with him a part of the army, whose hearts God had touched. But the children of Belial said, Shall this fellow be able to save us? And they despised him and brought him no presents.” Surely, no one will say that any one of those whose hearts God had touched, that they should go with Saul, failed to go with him, or that any of the children of Belial, whose hearts God had not so touched, did go with him.
