A king serves God one way as a man, another as a king. He serves him as a man by living according to faith. He serves Him as king by exerting the necessary strength to sanction laws that command goodness and prohibit its opposite. The king of the Ninevites served God by compelling the whole city to appease the Lord.

A sovereign serves God one way as a man, another way as a king. He serves him as man by living according to faith. He serves him as king by exerting the necessary strength to sanction laws that command goodness and prohibit its opposite. It was thus that Ezekiel served him by destroying the groves and temples of idols and the high places that had been set up contrary to the commandments of God. Thus Josiah served him by performing similar acts. Thus the king of the Ninevites served him by compelling the whole city to appease the Lord.
