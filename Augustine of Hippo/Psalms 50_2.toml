But we have heard the world called from the rising of the sun unto the going down: whence does He begin to call, who has called? This thing also hear ye: "Out of Sion is the semblance of His beauty" [Psalm 50:2]. Evidently the Psalm does agree with the Gospel, which says, "Throughout all nations, beginning at Jerusalem." [Luke 24:47] Hear, "Throughout all nations:" He has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down. Hear, "Beginning at Jerusalem:" "Out of Sion is the semblance of His beauty." Therefore, "He has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down," agrees with the words of the Lord, who says, "It behooved Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day; and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in His Name throughout all nations." [Luke 24:46-47] For all nations are from the rising of the sun unto the going down. But that, "Out of Sion is the semblance of His beauty." that thence begins the beauty of His Gospel, that thence He began to be preached, being "beautiful in form beyond the sons of men,"  agrees with the words of the Lord, who says, "Beginning at Jerusalem." New things are in tune with old, old things with new: the two Seraphim say to one another, "Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of Sabaoth." [Isaiah 6:3] The two Testaments are both in tune, and the two Testaments have one voice: let the voice of the Testaments in tune be heard, not that of pretenders disinherited. This thing then has the God of gods done, "He has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down, His semblance going before out of Sion." For in that place were His disciples, [Acts 1:4] who received the Holy Ghost sent from heaven on the fiftieth day after His resurrection. Thence the Gospel, thence the preaching, thence the whole world filled, and that in the Grace of Faith.
