"And I let them go according to the affections of their heart" [Psalm 81:12]. Behold the press: the orifices are open, the lees run. "And I let them go," not according to the healthfulness of My commands; but, according to the affections of their heart: I gave them up to themselves. The Apostle also says, "God gave them up to the desires of their own hearts." [RomansÂ 1:24] "I let them go according to the affection of their heart, they shall go in their own affections." There is what ye shudder at, if at least you are straining out into the hidden vats of the Lord, if at least you have conceived a hearty love for His storehouses, there is what ye shudder at. Some stand up for the circus, some for the amphitheatre, some for the booths in the streets some for the theatres, some for this, some for that, some finally for their "new gods;" "they shall go in their own affections."
