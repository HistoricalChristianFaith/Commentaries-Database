What does that show, if not that God was speaking through the prophet? Now it is we clergy who were above all terrified by the prophetâ€™s words, that is, the leaders whom God appointed to speak to his people, and so we begin by seeing our own faces in those words. For as the reader intoned them we had a kind of mirror held up to us in which we could inspect ourselves, and inspect ourselves we did. Inspect yourselves, too, then.
