How long are you going to keep speaking of a father? How often will you change your fathers—at one time Abraham, at another God? Hear the Son of God tell you whose children you are: “You are of your father the devil.”

You are his children because of your desires, not because you are born of him. What are his desires? “He was a murderer from the beginning.” This explains why “your will is to do your father’s desires.” “You seek to kill me, a man who tells you the truth.” The devil, too, harbored ill will toward the human race and killed it. For the devil, in his envy of the human race, assumed the guise of a serpent and spoke to the woman, and from the woman he instilled his poison into the man. They died by listening to the devil, who they would not have listened to had they but listened to the Lord. For man [humankind], having his place between [God], who created, and [the devil], who was fallen, should have obeyed the Creator, not the deceiver. Therefore “he was a murderer from the beginning.” Look at the kind of murder he did. The devil is called a murderer not as armed with a sword or steel. He came to humanity, sowed his evil suggestions and killed him. Do not think then that you are not a murderer when you persuade your brother to evil. If you persuade your brother to evil, you kill him. And to let you know that you kill him, listen to the psalm: “The sons of men [humankind], whose teeth are spears and arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.”

Someone may object that the words of the Lord about the devil [here] … are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the human race when human beings, whom he could kill by his deceit, were made; but also that he did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels. Instead he refused to submit to his Creator and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own. In this way he was deceived and deceiving.… But they do not notice that the Lord did not say, “The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth” but “The devil did not remain in the truth.” By this, he meant us to understand that the devil had fallen from the truth in which, if he had remained, he would have become a partaker and would have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.…They suppose [according to 1 John 3:8] that the devil was made with a sinful nature, but they misunderstand the passage; for if sin is natural, it is not sin at all. And how do they answer the prophetic proofs—either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under the person of the king of Babylon, “How you are fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!” or what Ezekiel says, “You were in Eden, the garden of God …” where it is meant that he was at some point without sin? For a little after, it is still more explicitly said, “You were perfect in your ways.” And if these passages cannot be interpreted properly in any other way, then we must understand by this passage also, “He did not remain in the truth,” that he was once in the truth but did not remain in it. And from this passage, “The devil has sinned from the beginning,” it is not that he sinned from the beginning of his created existence; rather, sin began in him, and he was the beginning of sin.
