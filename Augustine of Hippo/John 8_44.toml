Someone may object that the words of the Lord about the devil [here] … are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the human race when human beings, whom he could kill by his deceit, were made; but also that he did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels. Instead he refused to submit to his Creator and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own. In this way he was deceived and deceiving.… But they do not notice that the Lord did not say, “The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth” but “The devil did not remain in the truth.” By this, he meant us to understand that the devil had fallen from the truth in which, if he had remained, he would have become a partaker and would have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels.…They suppose [according to 1 John 3:8] that the devil was made with a sinful nature, but they misunderstand the passage; for if sin is natural, it is not sin at all. And how do they answer the prophetic proofs—either what Isaiah says when he represents the devil under the person of the king of Babylon, “How you are fallen, O Lucifer, son of the morning!” or what Ezekiel says, “You were in Eden, the garden of God …” where it is meant that he was at some point without sin? For a little after, it is still more explicitly said, “You were perfect in your ways.” And if these passages cannot be interpreted properly in any other way, then we must understand by this passage also, “He did not remain in the truth,” that he was once in the truth but did not remain in it. And from this passage, “The devil has sinned from the beginning,” it is not that he sinned from the beginning of his created existence; rather, sin began in him, and he was the beginning of sin.
