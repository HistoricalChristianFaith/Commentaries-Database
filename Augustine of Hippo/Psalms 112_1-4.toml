But even if this should be referred to the form in which each one shall rise, what should hinder us from applying to the woman what is expressly said of the man, understanding both sexes to be included under the general term “man?” For certainly in the saying, “Blessed is he who feareth the Lord,” women also who fear the Lord are included.

Your fourth question is, “Why David said, ‘His seed shall be mighty on the earth, the generation of the righteous shall be blessed,’ when we know that the children of the just were and are cursed and those of the unjust were and are blessed.” I answer this question from an exposition of the same psalm that I gave to the people. For, “Blessed is the one who fears the Lord; he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments.” God, who alone judges rightly and mercifully, shall see how much he excels in his commandments, since, as holy Job says, “The life of [a person] on earth is a warfare.” And again it is written, “For the corruptible body is a load on the soul, and the earthly habitation presses down the mind that muses on many things.” But he who judges us is the Lord, and we should not judge before the time until the Lord shall come and bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the heart. Then shall each person have praise from God. Therefore, [God] shall see how much each person excels in his commandments, yet each person shall delight exceedingly who truly loves the peace of the cobuilding, nor should each person despair now, since “in his commandments he shall delight exceedingly,” and there will be “peace in the land to men of good will.”
