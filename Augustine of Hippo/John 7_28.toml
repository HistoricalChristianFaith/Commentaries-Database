Our Lord replies that they both knew him and knew him not, as if to say, you both know where I come from and do not know where I am from. You know where I am from, that I am Jesus of Nazareth, whose parents you know. The birth from the Virgin was the only part of the matter unknown to them: … with this exception, they knew all that pertained to Jesus as man.… So he says rightly, “You both know me and know where I am from,” that is, according to the flesh and the likeness of man. But in respect of his divinity, he says, “I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true.”
