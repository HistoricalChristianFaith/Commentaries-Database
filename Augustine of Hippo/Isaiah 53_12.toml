Three men were crucified in the same place, the Lord in the middle, because “he was reckoned among the wicked.” They placed the two robbers on either side, but they were not crucified for the same reason. They were flanking Christ as he hung there, but they were far removed from him in reality. They were crucified by their crimes, he by ours.
