"And let all rejoice that hope in You;" those of course to whose taste the Lord is sweet. "They will exult for evermore, and You will dwell in them" [Psalm 5:11]. This will be the exultation for evermore, when the just become the Temple of God, and He, their Indweller, will be their joy. "And all that love Your name shall glory in You:" as when what they love is present for them to enjoy. And well is it said, "in You," as if in possession of the inheritance, of which the title of the Psalm speaks: when they too are His inheritance, which is intimated by, "You will dwell in them." From which good they are kept back, whom God, according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses, drives out.
