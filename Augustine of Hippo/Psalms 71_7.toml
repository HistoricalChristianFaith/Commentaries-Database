"As it were a monster I have become unto many" [Psalm 71:7]. Here in time of hope, in time of groaning, in time of humiliation, in time of sorrow, in time of infirmity, in time of the voice from the fetters— here then what? "As it were a monster I have become unto many." Why, "As it were a monster"? Why do they insult me that think me a monster? Because I believe that which I see not. For they being happy in those things which they see, exult in drink, in wantonness, in chamberings, in covetousness, in riches, in robberies, in secular dignities, in the whitening of a mud wall, in these things they exult: but I walk in a different way, contemning those things which are present, and fearing even the prosperous things of the world, and secure in no other thing but the promises of God. And they, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." [1 Corinthians 15:32] What do you say? Repeat it: "let us eat," he says, "and drink." Come now, what have you said afterwards? "for tomorrow we die." You have terrified, not led me astray. Certainly by the very thing which you have said afterwards, you have stricken me with fear to consent with you. "For tomorrow we die," you have said: and there has preceded, "Let us eat and drink." For when you had said, "Let us eat and drink;" you added, "for tomorrow we die." Hear the other side from me, "Yea let us fast and pray, 'for tomorrow we die.'" I keeping this way, strait and narrow, "as it were a monster have become unto many: but You are a strong helper." Be  with me, O Lord Jesus, to say to me, faint not in the narrow way, I first have gone along it, I am the way itself, [John 14:6] I lead, in Myself I lead, unto Myself I lead home. Therefore though "a monster I have become unto many;" nevertheless I will not fear, for "You are a strong Helper."
