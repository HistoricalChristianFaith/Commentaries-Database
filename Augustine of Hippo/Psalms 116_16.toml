Let therefore the slave purchased at so great a price confess his condition, and say, Behold, O Lord, how that I am Your servant: "I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid" [Psalm 116:16]....This, therefore, is the son of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, the free mother of us all. [Galatians 4:26] And free indeed from sin she is, but the handmaid of righteousness; to whose sons still pilgrims it is said, "You have been called unto liberty;" [Galatians 5:13] and again he makes them servants, when he says, "but by love serve one another."...Let therefore that servant say unto God, Many call themselves martyrs, many Your servants, because they hold Your Name in various heresies and errors; but since they are beside Your Church, they are not the children of Your handmaid. But "I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid." "You have broken my bonds asunder."

11. Let therefore the slave purchased at so great a price confess his condition, and say, "Behold, O Lord, how that I am Thy servant: "I am Thy servant, and the son of Thine handmaid" (ver. 16). ...This, therefore, is the son of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, the free mother of us all. And free indeed from sin she is, but the handmaid of righteousness; to whose sons still pilgrims it is said, "Ye have been called unto liberty;" and again he maketh them servants, when he saith, "but by love serve one another." ...Let therefore that servant say unto God, Many call themselves martyrs, many Thy servants, because they hold Thy Name in various heresies and errors; but since they are beside Thy Church, they are not the children of Thy handmaid.
