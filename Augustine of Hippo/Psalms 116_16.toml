Let therefore the slave purchased at so great a price confess his condition, and say, Behold, O Lord, how that I am Your servant: "I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid" [Psalm 116:16]....This, therefore, is the son of the heavenly Jerusalem, which is above, the free mother of us all. [Galatians 4:26] And free indeed from sin she is, but the handmaid of righteousness; to whose sons still pilgrims it is said, "You have been called unto liberty;" [Galatians 5:13] and again he makes them servants, when he says, "but by love serve one another."...Let therefore that servant say unto God, Many call themselves martyrs, many Your servants, because they hold Your Name in various heresies and errors; but since they are beside Your Church, they are not the children of Your handmaid. But "I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid." "You have broken my bonds asunder."

He [the psalmist] must not give into his panic; in his panic he is likely to be mistaken. And while he was trembling with fear, he was given courage, where he said, "O Lord, I am your servant and the son of your maidservant; you have burst my chains asunder." My biggest chain was the love of staying alive, and therein was the cause of my dying. Many, you see, for love of staying alive, have died eternally. And again, many martyrs, by thinking nothing of life that has an end, have gained life without end. Just as the person who loves money often disregards money for love of money, so as to gain more money by disregarding money. So we have the dictum of a well-known personage, "On occasion to take no account of money is now and then extremely profitable." And that is what moneylenders do; they amass money by giving it away, as though sowing a little of it in order to reap a large quantity. In the same way, too, the martyrs for love of life disregarded life. By fearing death, they would have died; by wishing to live, they would have refused to live.

But after the Lord cried out through the Gospel, "Come to me, all you who labor and are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take my yoke on you, and learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart," how many, when they heard the Gospel did what the rich man, when he heard it from the Lord's own mouth, did not do? Therefore, let us now do it, let us follow the Lord. Let us loose the shackles by which we are prevented from following. And who is suited to loose such knots, if that one should not help to whom it was said, "You have broken my bonds"? And about him another psalm says, "The Lord releases those that were fettered, the Lord raises up those that were bowed down."
