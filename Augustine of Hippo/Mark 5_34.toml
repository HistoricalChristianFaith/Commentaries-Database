Few are they who by faith touch him; multitudes are they who throng about him.

De Con. Evan., 2, 28: But we must understand, that what is added of the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, took place when Jesus had again crossed the sea in a ship, though how long after does not appear; for if there were not an interval, there could be no time for the taking place of that which Matthew relates, concerning the feast at his own house; after which event, nothing follows immediately, except this concerning the daughter of the chief of the synagogue. For he has so putit together, that the transition itself shows that the narrative follows the order of time. It goes on, “There cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue”.
For he attaches himself not to the  words of the father, but to what is of most importance, his wishes; for hewas in such despair, that his wish was that she should return to life, not thinking that she could be found alive, whom he had left dying.
