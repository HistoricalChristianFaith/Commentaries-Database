The rule of love is that one should wish his friend to have all the good things he wants to have himself and should not wish the evils to befall his friend which he wishes to avoid himself. He shows this benevolence to all men. No evil must be done to any. Love of oneâ€™s neighbor works no evil. Let us then love even our enemies as we are commanded, if we wish to be truly unconquered.
