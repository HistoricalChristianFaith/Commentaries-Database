Is anybody, I mean to say, in a position to have both the will and the ability, unless the one who granted us the will by calling us also helps us to have the ability by inspiring us? The fact is, his mercy gets in ahead of us every single time; to call us when we were lacking the will and then to ensure we obtain the ability to do what we will. So let us say to him, “I have sworn and determined to keep the judgments of your justice.” I have indeed determined, and promised obedience because you have ordered it; but because “I can see another law in my members fighting back against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin that is in my members,” “I have been utterly humbled, Lord; give me life according to your word.” Look, “to will is available to me”;14 therefore, “approve, Lord, the voluntary offering of my mouth,” so that your peace may come on earth to people of good will.

A most holy and solemn day has dawned for us to rejoice in, and one that is very special and glorious for this church as its crowning ornament, seeing the most blessed Cyprian filled it with the light for us by the glory of his sufferings. For praising this revered bishop and venerable martyr no tongue would be sufficient, not even were he to praise himself. So in this sermon of mine, which I am paying to your ears as something owed you on his account, please acknowledge the loving readiness of my will, rather than demanding an effective display of any skill. Thus it is, you see, that when the holy praise singer perceived himself to be less than capable of praising God—for which, indeed, not just speech but even any thought is insufficient—he said, “Make the voluntary offerings of my mouth acceptable, Lord.” Let me too say the same; let this also be a sign of my devotion, and even if I am not equal to explaining what I wish, may there be an acceptable offering in the fact that I do wish.
