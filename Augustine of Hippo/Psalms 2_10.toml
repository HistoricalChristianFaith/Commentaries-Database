How, then, do kings serve the Lord with fear except by forbidding and restraining with religious severity all acts committed against the commandments of the Lord? A sovereign serves God one way as man, another way as king: he serves him as man by living according to faith; he serves him as king by exerting the necessary strength to sanction laws that command goodness and prohibit its opposite. It was thus that Hezekiah served him by destroying the groves and temples of idols and the high places that had been set up contrary to the commandments of God; thus Josiah served him by performing similar acts; thus the king of the Ninevites served him by compelling the whole city to appease the Lord; thus Darius served him by giving Daniel power to break the idol and by feeding his enemies to the lions; thus Nebuchanezzar … served him when he restrained all his subjects from blaspheming God by a terrible penalty. It is thus that kings serve the Lord as kings when they perform acts in his service that none but kings can perform.

"And now understand, you kings" [Psalm 2:10]. "And now;" that is, being now renewed, your covering of clay worn out, that is, the carnal vessels of error which belong to your past life, "now understand," you who now are "kings;" that is, able now to govern all that is servile and brutish in you, able now too to fight, not as "they who beat the air, but chastening your bodies, and bringing them into subjection." [1 Corinthians 9:26-27] "Be instructed, all you who judge the earth." This again is a repetition; "Be instructed" is instead of "understand;" and "you who judge the earth" instead of "you kings." For He signifies the spiritual by "those who judge the earth." For whatsoever we judge, is below us; and whatsoever is below the spiritual man, is with good reason called "the earth;" because it is defiled with earthly corruption.
