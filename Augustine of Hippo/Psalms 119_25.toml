"My soul cleaves to the pavement: O quicken Thou me according to Your word" [Psalm 119:25]. What means, "My soul cleaves to the pavement, O quicken Thou me according to Your word"?...If we look upon the whole world as one great house, we see that the heavens represent its vaulting, the earth therefore will be its pavement. He wishes therefore to be rescued from earthly things, and to say with the Apostle, "Our conversation  is in heaven." To cling therefore to earthly things is the soul's death; the contrary of which evil, life is prayed for, when he says, "O quicken Thou me."
