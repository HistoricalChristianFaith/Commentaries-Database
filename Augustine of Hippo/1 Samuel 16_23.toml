You, a man of the church, ought to be better instructed by the music of the church than by Pythagoras. Think what Davidâ€™s lyre did for Saul, who was harassed by an evil spirit but recovered from this disturbance when the holy man played his lyre; beware of thinking the concupiscence of the flesh is a good merely because it is sometimes checked by musical sounds. - "Against Julian 5.5.23"
