And yet it is in him and from him that we have peace, whether it is the peace he leaves with us when going to the Father or that which he will give us when we ourselves are brought by him to the Father. And what is it he leaves with us, when ascending from us, other than his own presence, which he never withdraws? For he himself is our peace who has made both one. It is he, therefore, who becomes our peace, both when we believe that he is and when we see him as he is. For if—so long as we are in this corruptible body that burdens the soul and are walking by faith, not by sight—he does not forsake those who are sojourning at a distance from himself, how much more, when we have attained to that sight, shall he fill us with himself?

This peace he left, after a fashion, in his last will and testament to his disciples, our apostles. As he was about to go to the Father, you see, he said, “My peace I give, my peace I leave to you.” And he did not separate Judas from himself, though he would not have been making a mistake if he had wished to separate him. I mean he would never separate an innocent person instead of a guilty one, or by separating the guilty forsake the innocent.… It was Judas himself who separated himself from the Lord. He was tolerated to the very end. He gave the kiss of peace, though he did not have peace in his heart. And yet he accepted the kiss of peace. That kiss did not bind him to Christ. It condemned him.

Though he was only going for a time, their hearts would be troubled and afraid for what might happen before he returned, lest in the absence of the Shepherd the wolf might attack the flock.
