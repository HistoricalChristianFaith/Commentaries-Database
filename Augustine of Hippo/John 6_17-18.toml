He fled alone to the mountain—the first begotten from the dead—because he has ascended above all the heavens and is interceding for us. … But while he was above what were the disciples enduring in the ship below? For that ship prefigured the church while he is on high.…While they were sailing to [Capernaum], John tells us what happened to them. It became dark and Jesus had not come to them. It was right that John said it was dark, because the light [Jesus] had not yet come to them. As the end of the world draws near, errors increase, terrors multiply, iniquity abounds and infidelity escalates. Light, again, is love according to John. Whoever hates his brother is in darkness. … The waves and storms and winds then that agitate the ship, are the clamors of hurtful speech and love waxing cold.… Nevertheless the wind, and storm, and waves, and darkness were not able to stop and sink the vessel. For the one who endures to the end shall be saved.…
And how does Jesus come to the disciples? He comes walking upon the waves, keeping all the swellings of the world under his feet, pressing down all of humanity’s pride. And so it continues, so long as time endures, so long as the ages roll. Tribulations increase, all these swell and mount up: Jesus passes on treading upon the waves. And yet, so great are the tribulations that even those who have trusted in Jesus and who strive to persevere to the end greatly fear lest they fail.… But they open the gospel, they open the Scriptures and find all these things there foretold; that this is the Lord’s doing. He tramples down the heights of the world that he may be glorified by the humble.
