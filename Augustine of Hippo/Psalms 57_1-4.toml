So let us call out to him what we have just been singing: “Have mercy on me, God, have mercy on me because in you my soul has put its trust.” “Have mercy on me, God,” he says. Why? “Because in you my soul has put its trust.” This, he says, is the sacrifice I offer you, so that you may hear me: “because in you my soul has put its trust. Whoever hoped in the Lord and was left in the lurch?” Even great saints are subject to temptation, and however much progress we make in God, we live in need of pardon. Was it little lambs and not the rams of the flock that the Lord Jesus taught how to pray? It was his disciples, our apostles, the very leaders of the flock, whose children we are, of whom it is said, “Bring to the Lord the children of rams”;2 yes, it was these rams he was teaching to pray, when he told them to say, “Forgive us our debts.” If this is a daily prayer, then we live in need of pardon. All our sins were forgiven us in baptism, and we live in need of pardon. We make progress if our hope is nourished in God and strengthened by his aid to enable us to put a brake on all covetousness. Let us keep on fighting; our struggles are known to him, and he knows how to be both a spectator and a helper.

You will not be able to move to the good place from the bad place unless you do good in the bad place. What sort of place is that other? One where nobody goes hungry. So if you want to live in the good place where nobody goes hungry, in this world “share your food with the hungry.” Because in that blessed place nobody is a foreigner, and all are living in their own native land; so if you wish to be in the good place, whenever in this bad place you find a foreigner who has nowhere to go, welcome him into your home. Show hospitality in the bad place, in order to get to the place where you cannot be a “guest worker.” In the good place nobody is in need of clothes; there is no cold weather there, nor hot weather. What need of shelter, what need of clothing? There will be no shelters there, but there will be protection; so in fact even there we find shelter: “under the shadow of your wings will I hope.” So in this bad place provide shelter for the person who has none, so that you may find yourself in the good place, where you can enjoy such shelter that you need never want to patch your thatched roof. After all, there are no showers of rain there but instead a perennial fountain of truth. But the shower from this [fountain] makes you glad, not wet; this shower is the fountain of life itself. What is the meaning of “Lord, with you is the fountain of life”? It means, “And the Word was with God.”

But if, after all these preceding actions of yours, you also shouted, “Crucify, crucify,” hear what the prophet also shouts against you, “The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, their tongue a sharpened sword.” See with what weapons, with what arrows, with what sword you have put to death a just man when you said that it was not lawful for you to put anyone to death. So it is that, although the chief priests had not come themselves but had sent others to arrest Jesus, the Evangelist Luke in the same place in his narrative said, “But Jesus said to those who had come to him,” namely, “the chief priests and the magistrates of the temple and the elders, ‘Have you come out, as it were, against a thief?’ ” and so on. Since, therefore, the chief priests [came] not themselves but in those whom they have sent for arresting Jesus, what else does it mean than that they themselves came in their power of giving the order? So all who shouted with ungodly voices for him to be crucified, they themselves killed him, not indeed by themselves but yet by him who was driven to this sacrilegious crime by their shouting.

See the kind of murder, brothers. The devil is called a murderer, not armed with a sword, not girded with a weapon; he came to humankind, he planted an evil word, and he killed him. Do not, then, think that you are not a murderer when you persuade your brother to do evils; if you persuade your brother to do evils, you kill him. And, that you may know that you kill him, hear the psalm: “The sons of men, their teeth are weapons and arrows, their tongue a sharp sword.”
