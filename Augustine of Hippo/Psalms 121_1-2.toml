And say, “I have lifted my eyes to the mountains from which help shall come to me” in such a way that you add to it immediately, “My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” Therefore let us lift our eyes to the mountains from which help shall come to us. Yet it is not the mountains themselves in which our hope is to be placed, for the mountains receive what they may present to us. Therefore we must put our hope in that place from which the mountains also receive [what they give to us]. When we lift our eyes to the Scriptures, because the Scriptures were delivered through people, we lift our eyes to the mountains from which help will come to us; and yet since they who wrote the Scriptures were themselves people, they were not providing enlightenment from themselves. Rather, Christ was the true light who enlightens everyone coming into the world.

However just people may be, however preeminent in grace, however luminous their wisdom, however great the merits that set them on a pinnacle, they are only mountains. Pay attention to the psalm: “I lifted up my eyes to the mountains, from where my help shall come,” because “there was a man sent by God, whose name was John; this man came to bear witness to the light.” So you have lifted up your eyes to the mountain John, from where your help may come, because he is bearing witness to the light. Continue with the psalm; do not stop on the mountain: “My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” That is Christ; “all things were made through him.” He is the constructor of the world; he is, you see, the Word of the Father; the Father made all things through the Word.

The Son of God, the only begotten of the Father, God always, man for our sake, having become what he made—I mean, he became man, having made humankind—says to the Father, “I confess to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth.” “You are my Father, Lord of heaven and earth”; Father of the one through whom all things were made. The whole of creation, you see, is briefly unfolded in these two words, heaven and earth. That is why it says in the first book of God’s Scriptures, “In the beginning, God made heaven and earth”12; and also, “My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” But by the word heaven is to be understood whatever is in the heavens, and by the word earth whatever is on the earth; so by naming these two parts of creation, you do not leave out a single creature, because it is either here, or it is there.
