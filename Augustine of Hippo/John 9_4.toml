After the resurrection of the living and the dead, when he will say to those placed at his right hand, “Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom,” and to those at his left, “Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels,” then shall be the night when no one can work but only get back what he has previously done. There is a time for working, another for receiving; for the Lord shall render to every one according to his works. While you live, do something if you are to be doing anything at all. For then that appalling night shall come to envelop the wicked it its folds. But even now every unbeliever, when he dies, is received within that night: there is no work to be done there. In that night was the rich man burning and asking a drop of water from the beggar’s finger. … Unhappy man! When you were living, that was the time for working. Now you are already in the night in which no one can work.
