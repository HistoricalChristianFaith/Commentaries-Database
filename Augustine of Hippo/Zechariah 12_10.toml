Now, indeed, that body is worthy of a heavenly dwelling place, not subject to death, not changeable through the ages [of life]. For as he had grown to that age from infancy, so he does not decline to old age from the age which was young adulthood. He remains as he ascended; he is going to come to those to whom, before he comes, he wanted his word to be preached. So therefore he will come in a human form. The ungodly too will see this; those placed to the right will see it too; those separate to the left will see it too, as it was written, “They shall see him whom they have pierced.” If they will see him whom they have pierced, they will see the same body that they thrust through with a spear, [for] the Word is not struck by a spear.

And perhaps it is then that the words “all flesh” will become more perfectly fulfilled. Now I mean to say, flesh has seen him, but not all flesh. Then, however, at the judgment, as he comes with his angels to judge the living and the dead, “when all who are in tombs hear his voice and come forth, some to the resurrection of life, others to the resurrection of judgment,” it is not only the just but also the wicked, those on the right, these on the left, who will see that form which he pleased to take on for us. Even those who killed him “will look on the one whom they have pierced.” So “all flesh shall see the salvation of God.” Body will be seen by body, because he will come to judge him in his real body. But to those placed on the right and sent on into the kingdom of heaven, he is going to show himself in the same way as he could already be seen in the body; and yet he had said, “Whoever loves me shall be loved by my Father; and I will love him, and manifest myself to him.”

“For the Lord shall build up Zion.” This work is going on now. O you living stones, run to the work of the building, not to ruin. Zion is building; beware of the ruined walls. The tower is building, the ark is in building; remember the deluge. This work is in progress now, but when Zion is built, what will happen? “And he will appear in his glory.” That he might build up Zion, that he might be a foundation in Zion, he was seen in Zion, but not in his glory: “We have seen him, and he had no form or comeliness.” But truly when he shall have come with his angels to judge, shall they not then look upon him whom they have pierced? And too late they shall [be] put to confusion, who refused confusion in early and healthful repentance.
