He also says to the Thessalonians, “For the rest, brothers, pray for us that the word of the Lord may run and may be glorified even as among you; that we may be delivered from troublesome and evil men, for not all men have faith.” How else could the word of God run and be glorified except by the conversion to the faith of those to whom it is preached, when Paul says to present believers, “Even as among you”? Surely he knows that this is accomplished by him to whom he wishes prayer to be made that this may be so, and also that he may be delivered through their prayers from troublesome and evil men. It is for this reason that he adds, “For not all men have faith,” as if to say, “The word of God will not be glorified among all, even though you are praying” because those who were likely to believe were the ones “who were ordained to life everlasting,” predestined “to the adoption of children through Jesus Christ to himself” and chosen “in him before the foundation of the world.” No one is so unlearned, so carnal, so slow of wit as not to see that God does what he commands us to ask him to do.

With this in mind, dearly beloved, let us always look forward with longing toward our everlasting joy. Let us always pray for fortitude in our temporal labors and trials. Let us offer prayers for one another. Let my prayers be offered for you, and yours for me. And, brothers, do not think that you need my prayers, but that I have no need of yours. We have mutual need of one another’s prayers, for those reciprocal prayers are enkindled by charity and—like a sacrifice offered on the altar of piety—are fragrant and pleasing to the Lord. If the apostles used to ask for prayers on their own behalf, how much more does it behoove me to do so? For I am far from being their equal, although I long to follow their footsteps as closely as possible. But I have neither the wisdom to know nor the rashness to say what progress I have made.
