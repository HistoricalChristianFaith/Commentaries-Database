"Fix my prayer in Your ears, O Lord" [Psalm 86:6]. Great earnestness of him who prays! That is, let not my prayer go out of Your ears, fix it then in Your ears. How did he travail that he might fix his prayer in the ears of God? Let God answer and say to us; Would you that I fix your prayer in My ears? Fix My law in your heart; "and attend to the voice of my prayer."
