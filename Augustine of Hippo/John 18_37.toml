It was not that Jesus was afraid to confess himself a king, but the phrase “you say” is nuanced enough that he neither denies himself to be a king (for he is a king whose kingdom is not of this world), nor does he confess that he is such a king as to warrant the supposition that his kingdom is of this world. For, since this was the very idea in Pilate’s mind when he said,’ “Are you a king then?” the answer Pilate received was, “You say that I am a king.” For it was said, “You say,” as if it had been said, since you are worldly, you say it in a worldly way.

It is evident that Jesus here referred to his own birth in time when, by becoming incarnate, he came into the world. He is not referring to what had no beginning whereby he was God through whom the Father created the world. For this then, that is, because [he was referring to his birth in time], he declared that he was born, and to this end he came into the world, in other words, that by being born of the Virgin he might witness to the truth. But because not everyone has the truth he further adds, “Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.” One hears, that is to say, with the ears of the inward person, or, in other words, he obeys my voice, which is equivalent to saying, he believes me. When Christ, therefore, witnesses to the truth, he witnesses, of course, to himself.… For if our thoughts turn to the nature wherein we have been created—inasmuch as we were all created by the Truth—who is there that is not of the truth? But it is not given to everyone to hear, that is, to obey the truth and to believe in the truth. At any rate, in no case certainly is there any preceding of merit; otherwise grace should cease to be grace. For if he had said, “Everyone who hears my voice is of the truth,” then it would be supposed that someone was declared to be of the truth because that person conforms to the truth. This is not what he says however, but, “Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.” And in this way no one is of the truth simply because he or she hears his voice. They only hear because they are of the truth, that is, because this is a gift of the truth bestowed on them. And what else is this, but that by Christ’s gracious bestowal they believe on Christ?

“Truth has sprung up from the earth, and righteousness has looked down from heaven.” Yes, “truth has sprung up from the earth” because Christ was born from a woman. “Truth has sprung up from the earth” because the Son of God has come forth from the flesh. What is Truth? The Son of God. What is the earth? Our flesh. Inquire where Christ was born, and you will see that “truth has sprung up from the earth.” Yet this Truth that has sprung up from the earth existed before the earth, for heaven and earth were made through him. But in order that righteousness might look down from heaven, that is, that human beings might be made righteous through divine grace, Truth was born from the Virgin Mary, that he might be in a position to offer sacrifice for those who needed justification, the sacrifice of his passion, the sacrifice of the cross. How could he offer his sacrifice for our sins, except by dying? But how could he die, unless he took from us what could die? Had he not taken mortal flesh from us, Christ could not have died, for the Word does not die, the Godhead does not die, the Power and Wisdom of God19 does not die. How could he offer himself as a saving victim, if he did not die? But how could he die without clothing himself in flesh? And how could he put on flesh unless Truth sprang up from the earth?
