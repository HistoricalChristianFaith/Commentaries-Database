De Con. Evan., ii, 27: But it may be thought that He added Pharisees, because they joined with the disciples of John in saying this to the Lord, whilst Matthew relates that the disciples of John alone said it: but the words which follow father show that those who said it spoke not of themselves, but of others. For it goes on, “And they came and say unto Him, Why do the disciples "For these words show, that the guests who were there came to Jesus, and had said this same thing to the disciples, so that in the words which he uses, “they came,” he speaks not of those same persons, of whom he had said, “And the disciples of John and the Pharisees were fasting.” But as they were fasting, those persons who remembered it, come to Him. Matthew then says this, “And there came to Him the disciples of John, saying,” because the Apostles also were there, and all eagerly, as each could, objected these things.
Mark here calls them children of the nuptials, whom Matthew calls children of the bridegroom; for we understand the children of the nuptials to be not only those of the bridegroom, but also of the bride.
