"Blessed are they whose unrighteousness is forgiven, and whose sins are covered" [Psalm 32:1]: and whose sins are buried in oblivion. "Blessed is the man to whom the Lord has not imputed sin, nor is there guile in his mouth" [Psalm 32:2]: nor has he in his mouth boastings of righteousness, when his conscience is full of sins.
