For I imagine that what follows, "I am a companion of all them that fear You, and keep Your commandments" [Psalm 119:63], does relate to the Head Himself, as it is in the Epistle which is inscribed to the Hebrews: "Both He that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brethren.". ..Therefore Jesus Himself speaks in this prophecy: some things in His Members and in the Unity of His Body, as if in one man diffused over the whole world, and growing up in succession throughout the roll of ages: and some things in Himself our Head. And on this account, that since He became the companion of His brethren, God of men, the Immortal of the mortal, for this reason the seed fell upon the earth, that by its death it might produce much fruit; he next adds concerning this very fruit, "The earth, O Lord, is full of Your mercy" [Psalm 119:64]. And whence this, save when the ungodly is justified? That we may make progress in the knowledge of this grace, he adds, "O teach me Your righteousnesses!"
