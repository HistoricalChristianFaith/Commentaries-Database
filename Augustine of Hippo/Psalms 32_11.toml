"Be glad in the Lord, and rejoice, you righteous:" be glad, and rejoice, you righteous, not in yourselves, but in the Lord. "And glory, all you that are right in heart" [Psalm 32:11]: and glory in Him, all you who understand that it is right to be subject unto Him, that so ye may be placed above all things beside.
