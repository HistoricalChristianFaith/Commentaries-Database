"For unto You, Lord, are my eyes; in You have I hoped, take not Thou away my life" [Psalm 141:8]. For they were tortured in persecutions, and many failed. It occurs to him that many have failed, many have been in hazard, and as it were in the midst of the tribulation of persecution is sent forth the voice of one praying; "For unto You, Lord, are my eyes:" I care not what they threaten who stand around, "unto You, Lord, are my eyes." More do I fix my eye on Your promises than on their threats. I know what You have suffered for me, what You have promised me.

It occurreth to him that many have failed, many have been in hazard, and as it were in the midst of the tribulation of persecution is sent forth the voice of one praying; "For unto Thee, Lord, are mine eyes:" I care not what they threaten who stand around, "unto Thee, Lord, are mine eyes."
