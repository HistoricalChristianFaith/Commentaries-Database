But why should we wonder that he rose from supper and laid aside his garments who, being in the form of God, emptied himself? And why should we wonder if he girded himself with a towel who took on him the form of a servant and was found in the likeness of a man? Why wonder if he poured water into a basin that he used to wash his disciples’ feet who poured his blood upon the earth to wash away the filth of their sins? Why wonder if with the towel in which he was girded he wiped the feet he had washed who with the very flesh that clothed him laid a firm pathway for the footsteps of his Evangelists? In order, indeed, to gird himself with the towel, he laid aside the garments he wore. But when he emptied himself in order to assume the form of a servant, he did not lay down what he had, but he assumed that which he did not have before. When about to be crucified, he was indeed stripped of his garments, and when he was dead, he was wrapped in linen clothes: and all that suffering of his is for our purification. When, therefore, about to suffer the last extremities of humiliation, he here illustrated beforehand its friendly compliances—not only to those for whom he was about to endure death but to him also who had resolved to betray him to death. Because so great is the beneficence of human humility that even the divine Majesty was pleased to commend it by his own example. For proud humans would have perished eternally had they not been found by the lowly God. For the Son of man came to seek and to save that which was lost. And as he was lost by imitating the pride of the deceiver, let him now, when found, imitate the Redeemer’s humility.
