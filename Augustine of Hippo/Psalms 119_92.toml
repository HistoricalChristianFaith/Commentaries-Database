He then looks back towards the source of this earth's deliverance, which caused it to abide when founded; and adds, "If my delight had not been in Your law, I should perchance have perished in my humiliation" [Psalm 119:92]. This is the law of faith, not a vain faith, but that which works through love. [GalatiansÂ 5:6] Through this grace is gained, which makes men courageous in temporal tribulation, that they may not perish in the humiliation of mortality.

92. He then looketh back towards the source of this earth's deliverance, which caused it to abide when founded; and addeth, "If my delight had not been in Thy law, I should perchance have perished in my humiliation" (ver. 92). This is the law of faith, not a vain faith, but that which worketh through love. Through this grace is gained, which maketh men courageous in temporal tribulation, that they may not perish in the humiliation of mortality.
