So let the blind run to Christ and by receiving their sight be enlightened. Christ, after all, is light in the world, even among the worst of people. Divine miracles were performed, but no one has performed miracles from the beginning of the human race, except the one to whom Scripture says, “Who alone performs marvels.” Why does it say “who alone performs marvels”? Surely, because when he wishes to perform them, he has no need of any human beings. But when a human being performs them, he does need God. He, Christ, performed miracles alone. Why? Because the Son is God in the Trinity, together with the Father and the Holy Spirit, one God of course, “who alone performs marvels.”

But whoever listens with deeper attention to Christ saying, “if I had not done in them the works that no other man has done” (but even if the Father and the Holy Spirit have done these, no other one has done [them] because there is one substance of the whole Trinity), he will find that he himself did [them] if ever any man of God did any such thing. For indeed, he can in himself do all things by himself; but no one can do anything without him. For Christ together with the Father and the Holy Spirit are not three gods but the one God about whom it has been written, “Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who alone does wonderful things.” Therefore, no other individual has done whatever works he has done in them, because whatever another person has done, any one of them has done it by his doing. But he did these things himself, not by their doing.
