Paul says [elsewhere], “I have kept the faith,” but the same apostle also says, “For I know whom I have believed, and I am certain that he is able to keep that which I have deposited with him against that day.” “That which I have deposited with him” means: What I have commended to him, for some [Latin] copies do not have the word depositum but commendatum, which is clearer. Now what do we commend to God’s keeping save those things which we pray he will preserve? Is not our very faith among these? For what did the Lord commend for the apostle Peter, by his prayer for him, when he said to him, “I have prayed for you, Peter, that your faith shall not fail”? This means that God would preserve his faith and that it would not fail by giving way to temptation.
