But what next does he adjoin? "For they that believe not to dwell" [Psalm 68:18]: or, as some copies have, "For not believing to dwell:" for what else are men not believing, but they that believe not? To whom this has been said, is not easy to perceive. For as though a reason were being given of the above words, when it had been said, "You have led captivity captive, You have received gifts in men:" there has been added in continuation, "for they that believe not to dwell," that is, not believing that they should dwell. What is this? Of whom says he this? Did that captivity, before it passed into a good captivity, show whence it was an evil captivity? For through not believing they were possessed by the enemy, "that works in the sons of unbelief: among whom you were sometime, while you were living among them." [EphesiansÂ 2:2] By the gifts therefore of His grace, He that has received gifts in men, has led captive that captivity. For they believed not that they should dwell. For faith has thence delivered them, in order that now believing they may dwell in the House of God, even they too becoming the House of God, and the Chariot of God, consisting of thousands of men rejoicing.
