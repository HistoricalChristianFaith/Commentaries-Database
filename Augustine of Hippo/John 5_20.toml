Again mortal thought is troubled. The Father shows the Son what he himself does. “Therefore,” someone says, “the Father does [his work] separately so that the Son may be able to see what he does.” Again there occurs to human thought two craftsmen, as it were, as though an artisan would teach his son his artistic skill and show him whatever he does so that [his son] also may be able to do it himself. He says, “He shows him all that he himself does.” Therefore when the Father does something, is it that the Son does not do [that same thing] so that he can see what the Father is doing? This, at any rate is certain, that “all things were made through him and without him was made nothing.” From this we see how the Father shows the Son what he makes, although the Father makes nothing except what he makes through the Son.
