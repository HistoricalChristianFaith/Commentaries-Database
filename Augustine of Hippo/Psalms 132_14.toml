"This shall be My rest for ever" [Psalm 132:14]. These are the words of God. "My rest:" I rest there. How greatly does God love us, brethren, since, because we rest, He says that He also rests! For He is not sometimes Himself disturbed, nor does He rest as we do; but He says that He rests there, because we shall have rest in Him. "Here will I dwell: for I have a delight therein."
