But someone will object, This is strange. What great matter is it that one man among this large crowd does not have a wedding garment? Why rivet attention on this one man? So what if he creeps in unperceived by the servants of the householder? How could it be said that because of just that one, “they invited in both good and bad together”? Attend therefore, beloved, and understand. This man represents a whole class of persons of whom there are many.
