The heavens were opened, and Stephen saw the chief of martyrs; he saw Jesus standing at the Father’s right hand; he saw, so that he would not keep quiet. As for his persecutors, they could not see, but they could be envious; and the reason they did not see was that they were envious. As for Stephen, he did not keep quiet about what he saw, in order to reach the one whom he saw. “Behold,” he said, “I can see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing at the right hand of majesty.” Immediately they covered their ears, as against a blasphemy. You can recognize them in the psalm: “Like the deaf cobra,” it says, “that blocks its ears, in order not to hear the voice of the charmer and the spell cast by the wise one.” Just as snakes, you see, in order to avoid bursting out and leaving their dens when they are being charmed, are said to press one ear to the ground and block the other with their tails—and yet the charmer brings them out. So also Stephen’s persecutors were still hissing in their dens, while seething in their hearts. They were not yet bursting out; they blocked their ears. Let them burst out now, let them show what they really are; let them rush for the stones. They rushed, they stoned him.
