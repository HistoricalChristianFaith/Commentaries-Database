This [charge] may very well agree with what Luke records in connection with the said accusation brought by the Jews. For after the words “we found this fellow perverting our nation,” he has added the clause, “and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king.” This will also offer a solution for the difficulty previously referred to, namely, the occasion that might seem to be given for supposing John to have indicated that no specific charge was laid by the Jews against the Lord, when they answered and said to him, “If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you.”
