This [charge] may very well agree with what Luke records in connection with the said accusation brought by the Jews. For after the words "we found this fellow perverting our nation," he has added the clause, "and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar and saying that he himself is Christ a king." This will also offer a solution for the difficulty previously referred to, namely, the occasion that might seem to be given for supposing John to have indicated that no specific charge was laid by the Jews against the Lord, when they answered and said to him, "If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered him up unto you."

(Tr. cxvi) The Jews thought they could alarm Pilate more by the mention of Caesar, than by telling him of their law, as they had done above; We have a law, and by that law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God. So it follows, But the Jews cried out, saying, If thou let this Man go, thou art not Caesar's friend; whosoever maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.
