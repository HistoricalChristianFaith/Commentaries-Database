Moses in fact took care to appoint teachers of reading and writing for God’s people before they had any written record of God’s law. The Septuagint Scripture calls these instructors grammatoeisagogo&#;&#;, which is Greek for “bringersin of letters,” because they brought them, in a sense, into their students’ minds or perhaps introduced their students to them.
