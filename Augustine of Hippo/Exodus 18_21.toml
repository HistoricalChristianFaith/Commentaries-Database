Moses in fact took care to appoint teachers of reading and writing for God’s people before they had any written record of God’s law. The Septuagint Scripture calls these instructors grammatoeisagogoı́, which is Greek for “bringers-in of letters,” because they brought them, in a sense, into their students’ minds or perhaps introduced their students to them.
