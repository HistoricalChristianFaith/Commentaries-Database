Lest ye should think it a light matter, brethren, to hate, or, not to love, hear what follows: Every one that hates his brother, is a murderer. 1 John 3:15 How now, if any made light of hating his brother, will he also in his heart make light of murder? He does not stir his hands to kill a man; yet he is already held by God a murderer; the other lives, and yet this man is already judged as his slayer! Every one that hates his brother is a murderer: and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.

Whoever hates his brother is a murderer. But this text of Scripture does not apply to males only; it is equally valid for females. Any woman who has injured someone else must make amends as quickly as possible, and the injured sister must forgive without reserve.

Whoever hates is a murderer. You may not have prepared any poison or committed a crime. You have only hated, and in doing so, you have killed yourself first of all.
