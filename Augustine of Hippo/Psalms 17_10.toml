"Mine enemies have compassed about My soul;" "they have shut up their own fat" [Psalm 17:10]. They have been covered with their own gross joy, after that their desire has been satiated with wickedness. "Their mouth has spoken pride." And therefore their mouth spoke pride, in saying, "Hail, King of the Jews," [MatthewÂ 27:29] and other like words.
