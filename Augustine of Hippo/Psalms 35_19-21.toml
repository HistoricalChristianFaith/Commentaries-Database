"Let not them that are Mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over Me:" for they rejoice over Me because of My chaff. "Who hate Me without a cause;" that is, whom I never hurt; "winking with their eyes" [Psalm 35:19]: that is, pretending hypocrites, "For they spoke indeed peace to Me" [Psalm 35:20]. What is, "winking with their eyes"? Declaring by their looks, what they carry not in their heart. And who are these "winking with their eyes"? "For they spoke indeed peace to Me; and with wrath devised craftily." "Yea they opened their mouth wide against Me" [Psalm 35:21]. First winking with their eyes, those lions sought to ravish and devour; first fawning they spoke peace, and then with wrath devised craftily. What peace spoke they? "Master, we know that Thou acceptest not man's person, and teachest the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to give tribute unto Cæsar, or not?" They spoke indeed peace unto Me. What then? Did You not know them, and they deceived You, winking with their eyes? Truly He knew them; therefore said He, "Why do you tempt Me, you hypocrites?" [Matthew 22:16-18] Afterward, "they opened their mouth wide against Me," crying, "Crucify Him, Crucify Him! [Luke 23:21] and said, Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it." This, when they insulted Him, "Aha, Aha, Prophesy unto us, Thou Christ." [Matthew 26:68] As their peace was pretended when they tempted Him concerning the money, so now insulting was their praise. "They said, Aha, Aha, our eyes have seen it" [Psalm 35:21]: that is, Your deeds, Your miracles. This Man is the Christ. "If He be the Christ, let Him come down from the Cross, and we will believe Him. He saved others, Himself He cannot save."  "Our eyes have seen it." This is all whereof He boasted Himself, when "He called Himself the Son of God." [John 19:7] But the Lord was hanging patient upon the Cross: His power had He not lost, but He showed His patience. For what great thing was it for Him to come down from the Cross, who could afterward rise again from the sepulchre? But He seems to have yielded to His insulters; and this, beloved, that having risen again He should show Himself to His own, and not to them, and this is a great mystery; for His resurrection signified the New Life, but the New Life is known to His friends, not to His enemies.
