"With the holy You shall be holy" [Psalm 18:25]. There is a hidden depth also, wherein You are known to be holy with the holy, for that You make holy. "And with the harmless You shall be harmless." For Thou harmest no man, but each one is bound by the bands of his own sins. [ProverbsÂ 5:22]

26. "With the holy Thou shalt be holy" (ver. 25). There is a hidden depth also, wherein Thou art known to be holy with the holy, for that Thou makest holy. "And with the harmless Thou shalt be harmless." For Thou harmest no man, but each one is bound by the bands of his own sins.
