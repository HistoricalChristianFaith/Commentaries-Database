Because human nature was subjected to an enemy as the just desert of sin, man must first be rescued from his power, that he might find him. Then if his life in this flesh is prolonged, he is assisted in the conflict that he may overcome the enemy. And finally the victor will be beatified, that he may reign, and at the very end he will ask: “Death, where is thy devouring?”.

I think that “death” in this passage refers to a carnal habit which resists the good will through a delighting in temporal pleasures.
