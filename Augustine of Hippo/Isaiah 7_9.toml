“Unless you believe, you shall not understand,” showing that as righteousness is by faith, understanding comes by wisdom. Accordingly, in the case of those who eagerly demand evident truth, we must not condemn the desire but regulate it, so that beginning with faith it may proceed to the desired end through good works.

If you are not able to understand, believe, that you may understand. Faith goes before; understanding follows after; since the prophet says, “Unless you believe, you shall not understand.

The mysteries and secrets of the kingdom of God first seek for believing people, that they may make them understanding. For faith is understanding’s step, and understanding faith’s attainment. This the prophet expressly says to all who prematurely and in undue order look for understanding and neglect faith.

So, then, in some points that bear on the doctrine of salvation, which we are not yet able to grasp by reason—but we shall be able to sometime—let faith precede reason, and let the heart be cleansed by faith so as to receive and bear the great light of reason; this is indeed reasonable. Therefore the prophet said with reason: “If you will not believe, you will not understand”; thereby he undoubtedly made a distinction between these two things and advised us to believe first so as to be able to understand whatever we believe. It is, then, a reasonable requirement that faith precede reason, for, if this requirement is not reasonable, then it is contrary to reason, which God forbid. But, if it is reasonable that faith precede a certain great reason that cannot yet be grasped, there is no doubt that, however slight the reason which proves this, it does precede faith.
