Let us advert also to that sense, which concerning Christ our Lord Himself, our Head Himself, does present itself. For when Himself in form of a servant [Philippians 2:7] appeared on earth, they that crucified Him said, "He is not God." Because Son of God He was, truly God He was. But they that are corrupted and have become abominable said what? "He is not God:" let us slay Him, "He is not God." You have the voice of these very men in the book of Wisdom.  For after there had gone before the verse, "The unwise man has said in his heart, There is no God;" as if reasons were required why the unwise man could say this, he has subjoined, "Corrupted they are, and abominable have become in their iniquities" [Psalm 53:2]. Hear ye those corrupted men. "For they have said with themselves, not rightly thinking:" [Wisdom 2:1] corruption begins with evil belief, thence it proceeds to depraved morals, thence to the most flagrant iniquities, these are the grades. But what with themselves said they, thinking not rightly? "A small thing and with tediousness is our life." [Wisdom 2:1] From this evil belief follows that which also the Apostle has spoken of, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we shall die." [1 Corinthians 15:32] But in the former passage more diffusely luxury itself is described: "Let us crown us with roses, before they be withered; in every place let us leave the tokens of our gladness." [Wisdom 2:8-9] After the more diffuse description of that luxury, what follows? "Let us slay the poor just man:" [Wisdom 2:10] this is therefore saying, "He is not God." Soft words they seemed but now to say: "Let us crown us with roses, before they be withered." What more delicate, what more soft? Would you expect, out of this softness, Crosses, swords? Wonder not, soft are even the roots of brambles; if any one handle them, he is not pricked: but that wherewith you shall be pricked from thence has birth. "Corrupted," therefore, are those men, "and abominable have become in their iniquities." They say, "If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross." [Matthew 27:40] Behold them openly saying, "He is not God."...
