"And gives unto the cattle their food" [Psalm 147:9]. These are the cattle he means, even God's flocks. God defrauds not His flock of their food through men, for whose "service He makes the grass to grow." "And to the young of the ravens that call upon Him." Shall we perchance think this, that the ravens call upon God to give them their food? Think not that the unreasoning creature calls upon God: no creature knows how to call upon God, save the reasonable alone. Consider it as spoken in a figure, lest you think, as some evil men say, that the souls of men migrate into cattle, dogs, swine, ravens. Give this no place in your hearts or in your faith. The soul of man is made after the image of God: He will not give His image to dog or swine. Who are "the young of the ravens"? The Israelites used to say that they alone were righteous, because to them the Law had been given: all other men of every nation they used to call sinners. And in truth all nations were given up to sin, to idolatry, to the worship of stones and stocks: but did they continue so? Although the ravens themselves, our fathers, did not, yet we, "the young of the ravens," do call upon God. [1 Peter 1:18] ...For "the young of the ravens," who seemed to worship the images of their forefathers, have advanced, and turned to God. And now you hear "the young of the ravens" calling upon the one God. What then? Do you say to "the young of the ravens," "have you left your father?" Plainly I have, says he; for he is a raven who calls not upon God. I, "the young of the raven," do call upon God.
