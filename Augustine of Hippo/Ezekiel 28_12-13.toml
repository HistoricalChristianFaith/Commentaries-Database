The Manichaeans do not understand that if the devil is evil by nature, there can be no question of sin at all. They have no reply to the witness of the prophets, for example, where Isaiah, representing the devil figuratively in the person of the prince of Babylon, asks, “How you are fallen from heaven, O Day Star, son of the dawn?” or where Ezekiel says, “You were in Eden, the garden of God; every precious stone was your covering.” These texts indicate that the devil was for a time without sin.
