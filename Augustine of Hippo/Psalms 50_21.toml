"These things have you done, and I held my tongue" [Psalm 50:21]. Therefore the Lord our God shall come, and shall not keep silence. Now, "These things have you done, and I held my tongue." What is, "I held my tongue"? From vengeance I have desisted, my severity I have deferred, patience to you I have prolonged, your repentance I have long looked for..."You have imagined iniquity, that I shall be like you;" You have  imagined that I shall be like you, while you will not be like Me. For, "Be," he says, "perfect, even as your Father, which is in the heavens, who makes His sun to rise on the good and evil." [Matthew 5:48, 45] Him you would not copy, who gives good things even to evil men, insomuch that sitting thou dost detract even from good men. "I will reprove you," when "God manifest shall come, our God, and shall not keep silence," "I will reprove you." And what to you shall I do in reproving you? What to you shall I do? Now yourself you see not, I will make you see yourself. Because if you should see yourself, and should displease yourself, you would please Me: but because not seeing yourself you have pleased yourself, you will displease both Me and yourself; Me when you shall be judged; yourself when you shall burn. But what to you shall I do? He says. "I will set you before your face." For why would you escape yourself? At your back you are to yourself, you see not yourself: I make you see yourself: what behind your back you have put, before your face will I put; you shall see your uncleanness, not that you may amend, but that you may blush....
