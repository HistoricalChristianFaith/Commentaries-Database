"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath" [Psalm 37:8]. Wherefore are you angry? Wherefore is it that, through that passion and indignation, you blaspheme, or almost blaspheme? Against "the man who brings wicked devices to pass, cease from anger, and forsake wrath." Do you not know whither that wrath tempts you on? You are on the point of saying unto God, that He is unjust. It tends to that. "Look! Why is that man prosperous, and this man in adversity?" Consider what thought it begets: stifle the wicked notion. "Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:" so that now returning to your senses, you may say, "My eye is disturbed because of wrath."  What eye is that, but the eye of faith? To the eye of your faith I appeal.  Thou believed in Christ: why did you believe? What did He promise you? If it was the happiness of this world that Christ promised you, then murmur against Christ; yes! Murmur against Him, when you see the wicked flourishing. What of happiness did He promise? What, save in the Resurrection of the Dead? But what in this life? That which was His portion. His portion, I say! Do you, servant and disciple, disdain what your Lord, what your Master bore?...
