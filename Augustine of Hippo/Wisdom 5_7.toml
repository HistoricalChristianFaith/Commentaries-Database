We must come to him who is the way, the truth and the life. And it should not surprise us that we reach, by faith, him through whom we walk in faith. Indeed, because he is the way, we run with him. And since he is our homeland, once we have finished the race we arrive where he is. In fact, being the rest and homeland of the angels according to his divinity, he became the way of pilgrims according to his humanity. As the rest and homeland of the angels, and indeed of all the faithful, “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” And as the way of pilgrims, “the Word became flesh and came to dwell among us.” When, after the sin of the first man, we were cast out of the earthly paradise52 as into a valley of tears, losing both the way and the homeland, we walked in difficult and lonely places, not knowing the way of the Lord. But not only did the good and merciful king of our homeland take it on himself to frequently send us his servants, but also he himself deigned to come down and prepare the way by which we can return to our homeland. O mortal, if you were lazy in looking for the way, the way himself deigned to look for you. If you were lazy in coming to the way, the way himself has come to you. Rise and walk. Flee the way of the world, wide and spacious, which delights for a time and damns for eternity. Run by the way of Christ, on which you will suffer for a very brief time, then rejoice forever together with the angels.
