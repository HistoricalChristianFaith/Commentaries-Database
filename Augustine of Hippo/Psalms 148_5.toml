Did it [Gen 1:1] say, “In the beginning,” because it was made first? Or was it impossible for heaven and earth to have been made first among the creatures, if the angels and all the intellectual powers were made first? We must believe that the angels are the creation of God and were made by him. For the prophet included the angels in Psalm 148, when he said, “He commanded, and they were made; he gave the order, and they were created.” But if the angels were made first, we can ask whether they were made in time or before all time or at the start of time. If [they were made] in time, there already was time before the angels were made, and since time itself is also a creature, it turns out that we have to admit that something was made before the angels. But if we say that they were made at the start of time, so that time began with them, we have to say that it is false that time began with heaven and earth, as some claim.

After all, what is beyond hoping for from God, to whom nothing is difficult? He does great things just as he does small ones; he raises the dead, just as he creates the living. If a painter can make a mouse with the same art as he makes an elephant—different subjects, one and the same art—how much more God, who “spoke and they were made, commanded and they were created”? What can be difficult for him to make who makes with a word? He created the angels above the heavens with ease, with equal ease the luminaries in the heavens, with equal ease the fishes in the sea, with equal ease the trees and animals on the earth, great things with the same ease as small. It was supremely easy for him to make everything out of nothing—is it astonishing that he gave some old people a son?

All things that God did not beget of himself but made through his Word, he made not out of things that already existed but out of what did not exist at all, that is, out of nothing. Thus the apostle says, “Who calls those things that are not as though they were.” But it is written more clearly in the book of the Maccabees. “I beseech you, my child, lift your eyes to the heaven and the earth and all that are therein. See and know that God did not make those things out of anything that already existed.” There is also what is written in the Psalms. “He spoke, and they were made.” Clearly he did not beget these things of himself but made them by his Word and command. What he did not beget he made of nothing; for there was nothing else out of which he might have made them. Of him the apostle says most openly, “Since of him and through him and in him are all things.”
