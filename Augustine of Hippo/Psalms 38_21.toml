"Forsake me not, O Lord; O my God, depart not from me" [Psalm 38:21]. Let us speak in Him, let us speak through Him (for He Himself intercedes for us), and let us say, "Forsake me not, O Lord my God." And yet He had said, "My God! My God! Why have You forsaken Me?" [Matthew 27:46] and He now says, "O My God, depart not from Me." If He does not forsake the body, did He forsake the Head? Whose words then are these but the First Man's? To show then that He carried about Him a true body of flesh derived from him, He says, "My God, My God why have You forsaken Me?" God had not forsaken Him. If He does not forsake You, who believest in Him, could the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, One God, forsake Christ? But He had transferred to Himself the person of the First Man. We know by the words of an Apostle, that "our old man is crucified with Him." [Romans 6:6] We should not, however, be divested of our old nature, had He not been crucified "in weakness." For it was to this end that He came that we may be renewed in Him, because it is by aspiration after Him, and by following the example of His suffering, that we are renewed. Therefore that was the cry of infirmity; that cry, I mean, in which it was said, "Why have You forsaken Me?" Thence was it said in that passage above, "the words of mine offenses." As if He were saying, These words are transferred to My Person from that of the sinner.
