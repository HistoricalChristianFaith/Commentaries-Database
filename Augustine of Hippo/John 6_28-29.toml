Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?" For He had said to them, "Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto everlasting life." "What shall we do?" they say; by observing what, shall we be able to fulfil this precept? "Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent." This is then to eat the meat, not that which perisheth, but that which endureth unto eternal life. To what purpose dost thou make ready teeth and stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten already.

Faith is indeed distinguished from works, even as the apostle says that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law: and there are works which seem good, without faith in Christ, but they are not really good, because they are not referred to that end which makes works good: "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." And therefore the Lord did not wish to distinguish faith from work, but declared faith itself to be work, for that is the very faith which worketh by love. And He did not say, This is your work, but, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent:" that "he that glorieth may glory in the Lord."
