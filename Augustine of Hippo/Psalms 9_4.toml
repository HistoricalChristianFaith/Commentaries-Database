"You  sat on the throne Who judgest equity" [Psalm 9:4]. Whether the Son say this to the Father, who said also, "You could have no power against Me, except it were given you from above," [John 19:11] referring this very thing, that the Judge of men was judged for men's advantage, to the Father's equity and His own hidden things: or whether man say to God, "You  sat on the throne Who judgest equity," giving the name of God's throne to his soul, so that his body may perhaps be the earth, which is called God's "footstool:" [Isaiah 66:1] for "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself:" [2 Corinthians 5:19] or whether the soul of the Church, perfect now and without spot and wrinkle, [Ephesians 5:27] worthy, that is, of the hidden things of the Son, in that "the King has brought her into His chamber," [Song of Songs 1:4] say to her spouse, "You  sat upon the throne Who judgest equity," in that You have risen from the dead, and ascended up into heaven, and sittest at the right hand of the Father: whichsoever, I say, of those opinions, whereunto this verse may be referred, is preferred, it transgresses not the rule of faith.

6. "Thou satest on the throne Who judgest equity" (ver. 4). Whether the Son say this to the Father, who said also, "Thou couldest have no power against Me, except it were given thee from above," referring this very thing, that the Judge of men was judged for men's advantage, to the Father's equity and His own hidden things: or whether man say to God, "Thou satest on the throne Who judgest equity," giving the name of God's throne to his soul, so that his body may peradventure be the earth, which is called God's "footstool:" for "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself:" or whether the soul of the Church, perfect now and without spot and wrinkle, worthy, that is, of the hidden things of the Son, in that "the King hath brought her into His chamber," say to her spouse, "Thou satest upon the throne Who judgest equity," in that Thou hast risen from the dead, and ascended up into heaven, and sittest at the right hand of the Father: whichsoever, I say, of those opinions, whereunto this verse may be referred, is preferred, it transgresses not the rule of faith.
