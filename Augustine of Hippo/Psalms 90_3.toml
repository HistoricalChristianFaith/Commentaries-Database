But as our life here is exposed to numerous and great temptations, and it is to be feared lest we may be turned aside by them from that refuge, let us see what in consequence of this the prayer of the man of God seeks for. "Turn not Thou man to lowness" [Psalm 90:3]: that is, let not man, turned aside from Your eternal and sublime things, lust for things of time, savour of earthly things. This prayer is what God has Himself enjoined us, in the Prayer, "Lead us not into temptation," [Matthew 6:13] He adds, "Again You say, Come again, you children of men." As if he said, I ask of You what You have commanded me to ask: giving glory to His grace, that "he that glories, in the Lord he may glory:" [1 Corinthians 1:31] without whose help we cannot by an exertion of our own will overcome the temptations of this life. "Turn not Thou man to lowness: again you say, Turn again, you children of men." But grant what You have enjoined, by hearing the prayer  of him who can at least pray, and aiding the faith of the willing soul.
