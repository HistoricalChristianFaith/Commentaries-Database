On the whole, I do not think Jesus wanted to convey any further meaning than that they might understand and rejoice that they themselves would gain so many to Christ. When they were being driven out of the Jewish congregations, ultimately it would be found insufficient to expel them, and the Jews would not allow them to live, fearing that everyone would be converted by their preaching to the name of Christ and turned away from the observance of Judaism, as if what they were preaching were the very truth of God. This is how we should understand his reference to the Jews, when he said of them, “They will put you out of the synagogues.” For the witnesses, in other words, the martyrs of Christ, were similarly slain by the Gentiles. The Gentiles, however, did not think that it was to the true God but to their own false deities that they were doing service when they acted. But every Jew who killed the preachers of Christ considered that he was serving God, believing as he did that all who were converted to Christ were deserting the God of Israel.

But what harm was it for the apostles to be expelled from the Jewish synagogues, as if they were not going to separate themselves from it soon enough, although no one expelled them? No doubt he meant to announce that the Jews would refuse to receive Christ while the disciples … were not going to desert him. And so, the disciples, who could not exist without him, would also be thrown out along with him by those who would not have him as their dwelling place. For certainly there were no other people of God than the seed of Abraham. And if they would only acknowledge and receive Christ, they would have remained as the natural branches in the olive tree. The churches of Christ also would have been no different from the synagogues of the Jews. They would have been one and the same if they had also desired to remain in him. But since they refused, continuing to keep Christ outside, there was nothing left to do but put out of the synagogues those who would not abandon Christ.
