When these words of the Gospel, which are certainly clear, are understood, all those mysteries that lie hidden in this miracle of the Lord will be opened.… He omitted none of the ancient Scriptures, that is, the water, and for that reason they were called senseless by the Lord because they still tasted water, not wine. But how did he make wine from water? When he opened their understanding to them and explained the Scriptures to them, beginning with Moses through all the prophets. Now, intoxicated by this, they said, “Was not our heart burning on the road when he opened to us the Scriptures?” For they understood Christ in these books in which they had not known him.Therefore our Lord, Jesus Christ, changed water into wine; and what was tasteless acquires taste, what was not intoxicating intoxicates. For if he has ordered the water poured out of them and so himself put in wine from the secret hollows of creation from which he also created the bread when he satisfied so many thousands … thus he could have also, after the water had been poured out, poured in wine. But if he had done this, he would have seemed to have repudiated the old Scripture.
But when he turned the water itself into wine, he showed us that the ancient Scripture comes from him too; for by his order the jars were filled. This Scripture, too, is indeed from the Lord. But it has no taste if Christ is not understood in it.
