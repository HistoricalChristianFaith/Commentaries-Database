The same angel, however, said to the Virgin Mary, “Hail, full of grace, the Lord is with you”; the one who will be in you is already with you. “Blessed are you among women.” Holy Scripture bears witness to the fact that in the proper usage of the Hebrew language all females are habitually called women; in case some of you perhaps may be astonished and scandalized, if you are not used to hearing the Scriptures. There’s a place in the Scriptures where the Lord says openly, “Set apart the women who have not known man.” In any case, call to mind those origins of ours; when Eve was made from the man’s side, what does Scripture say? “He removed a rib from him and built it into a woman.” She is already called a woman, taken indeed from the man but not yet united to the man. So now, when you hear from the angel, “Blessed are you among women,” take it in such a way, as if it were saying, in our usage, Blessed are you among females.
