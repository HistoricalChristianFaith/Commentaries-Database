"We will exult in Your salvation" [Psalm 20:5]. We will exult in that death will in no wise hurt You; for so You will also show that it cannot hurt us either. "And in the name of the Lord our God will we be magnified." And the confession of Your name shall not only not destroy us, but shall even magnify us.
