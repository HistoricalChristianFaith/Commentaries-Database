De Cons. Ev., ii, 63: This may seem a discrepancy, that Matthew here gives it, "Why askest thou me concerning good?” whereas Mark and Luke’s have, “Whycallest thou me good?” For this, “Why askest thou me concerning good?” may seem rather to be referred to his question, “What good thing shall I do?” for in that he both mentioned “good,” and asked a question. But this, “Good Master, "is not yet a question. Either sentence may be understood thus very appropriately to the passage.
Serm., 84, 1: And He said not, “If thou desirest life eternal; but, “If thouwilt enter into life,” calling that simply “life,” which shall be everlasting. Here we should consider how eternal life should be loved, when this miserable and finite life is so loved.
de Op. Monach., 25: Nor need it be made a scruple in what monasteries, or to the  indigent brethren of what place, any one gives those things that he has, for there is but one commonwealth of all Christians. Therefore wheresoever any Christian has laid out his goods, in all places alike he shall receive what is necessary for himself, shall receive it of that which is Christ’s.
cont. Faust, v. 9: Nor are such only partakers in the kingdom of heaven, who, to the end they may be perfect, sell or part with all that they have; but in these Christian ranks are numbered by reason of a certain communication of their charity a multitude of hired troops; those to whom it shall be said in the end, “I was hungry, and ye gave me to eat;” whom be it far from us to consider excluded from life eternal, as they who obey not the commands of the Gospel.
Gennadius, de Eccles. Dogm.36: It is good to distribute with discrimination to the poor; it is better, with resolve of following the Lord to strip one’s self of all at once, and freed from anxiety to suffer want with Christ.
Ep. 31, 5: I know not how, but in the love of worldly superfluities, it is what we have already got, rather than what we desire to get, that most strictly enthrals us. For whence went this young man away sorrowful, but that he had great possessions? It is one thing to lay aside thoughts of further acquisition, and another to strip ourselves of what we have already made our own; one is only rejecting what is not ours, the other is like parting with one of our own limbs.
