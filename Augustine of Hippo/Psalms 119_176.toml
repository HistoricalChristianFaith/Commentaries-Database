At last he opens himself completely, and shows what person was speaking throughout the whole Psalm. "I have gone astray," he says, "like a sheep that is lost: O seek  Your servant, for I do not forget Your commandments" [Psalm 119:176]. Let the lost sheep be sought, let the lost sheep be quickened, for whose sake its Shepherd left the ninety and nine in the wilderness, [Matthew 18:12-13] and while seeking it, was torn by Jewish thorns. But it is still being sought, let it still be sought, partly found let it still be sought. For as to that company, among whom the Psalmist says, "I do not forget Your commandments," it has been found; but through those who choose the commandments of God, gather them together, love them, it is still sought, and by means of the blood of its Shepherd shed and sprinkled abroad, it is found in all nations.
