Thus "there have been multiplied above the hairs of My head they that hate Me gratis" [Psalm 69:4]. How multiplied? So as that they might add to themselves even one out of the twelve. [Matthew 26:14] "There have been multiplied above the hairs of My head they that hate Me for nought." With the hairs of His head He has compared His enemies. With reason they were shorn when in the place of Calvary He was crucified. [Matthew 27:33] Let the members accept this voice, let them learn to be hated gratis. For now, O Christian, if it must needs be that the world hate you, why do you not make it hate you gratis, in order that in the Body of your Lord and in this Psalm sent before concerning Him, you may acknowledge your own voice?

Just as it was said to Jesus, "Why, then, will you die if you have not committed a sin that deserves the death penalty?" Immediately he answered, "I do what the Father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the Father. Arise, let us go." Where? To the place where he, who had done nothing deserving of death, would be handed over to death. The Father had commanded that he should die—he about whom it had been prophesied, "I must repay what I did not take." He was the one who was about to suffer death without deserving it and [thereby] redeem us from the penalty of death. Adam, however, had committed sin when he reached out his hand to the tree [to pick the forbidden fruit]; he presumptuously deceived himself that he could seize the name of divinity that cannot be shared with or given to anyone [except one who is God]; divinity was conferred on the Son of God by nature, not by robbery.
