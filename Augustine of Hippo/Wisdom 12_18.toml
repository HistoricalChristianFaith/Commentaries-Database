Why did he not say “in wrath” but “as in wrath”? Because God does everything with absolute tranquility. Indeed, it is also written, “You, master of strength, judge with gentleness.” Therefore, even when he threatens he does not become angry, nor is he disturbed in any way. It calls him angry because he punishes and does justice. Similarly, people who do not want to amend their lives are as though they were alive, but they do not live, because vengeance for the first sin, and for those that they have added, hangs over them. This vengeance is called the wrath of God, because it proceeds from God’s judgment. Thus the Lord says of the one who does not believe, “but the wrath of God hangs over him.” We also, being born mortal, were under the wrath of God. Therefore the apostle says, “We were once by nature deserving of wrath, like the others.” What does “by nature deserving of wrath” mean, if not that we carry with us the wrath of the first sin? But if we convert, wrath ceases, and grace is offered to us. If, however, you do not want to convert, you add other offenses to the ones you were born with. And, “as in wrath,” you will be devoured even in the present time.

How is it that it is written, “Power is in your hands whenever you want,” as if God needs a period of time to carry out some work? Or, rather, are all things accomplished by God (as we say) like an artist thinks out a design—not over an extended period of time—but by that power that accomplishes in an enduring way even those things that we see are not enduring but passing? Even with our own speech, when some words pass away while others follow, we should not think that the same thing happens with the thought that gave rise to the expression we just finished. Consequently, although God, who exercises power when he wishes, accomplishes his works without the passage of time, nonetheless temporal natures themselves carry out their movements within time.
