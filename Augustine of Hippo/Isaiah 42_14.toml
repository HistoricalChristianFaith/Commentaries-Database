The one who speaks is now keeping quiet. He speaks in commandments; he keeps quiet in judgment.… How has he kept quiet, seeing that he spoke to say this very thing? He says, “I have kept quiet,” and yet he does not keep quiet, because just by saying “I have kept quiet,” God has not kept quiet. So then, Lord, I hear you speaking in so many commandments, as many sacred signs, so many pages, so many books. And then I hear you saying this, “I have kept quiet, will I keep quiet always?” So how have you kept quiet? Because I am not yet saying, “Come, you blessed of my Father, receive the kingdom.” And I am not yet saying to the others, “Go into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.” And while I am not yet saying these things, I am already warning you that I am going to say them.

“Sweet and righteous is the Lord.” You love [him] because he is sweet. You fear [him] because he is righteous. In a gentle voice, he said, “I have kept silence.” But as a just person, “shall I always be silent?” “A Lord compassionate and merciful.” Yes, indeed. Yet add, patient; yet add, and very compassionate.
