"He fashions their hearts singly:" He gives spiritually to their hearts their proper gifts, so that neither the whole body may be eye, nor the whole hearing; [1 Corinthians 12:17] but that one in this manner, another in that manner, may be incorporated with Christ. "He understands all their works" [Psalm 33:15]. Before Him are all their works understood.
