"Who shall ascend into the mount of the Lord?" Who shall ascend to the height of the righteousness of the Lord? "Or who shall stand in His holy place?" [Psalm 24:3]. Or who shall abide in that place, whither He shall ascend,  founded above the seas, and prepared above the rivers?

3. "Who shall ascend into the mount of the Lord?" Who shall ascend to the height of the righteousness of the Lord? "Or who shall stand in His holy place?" (ver. 3). Or who shall abide in that place, whither He shall ascend, founded above the seas, and prepared above the rivers?
