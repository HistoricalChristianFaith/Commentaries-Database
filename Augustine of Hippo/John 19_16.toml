It was not said “then he delivered him to them” so that they might crucify him but “so that he might be crucified,” that is, that Jesus might be crucified by the judicial sentence and power of the governor. But the Evangelist has said that Jesus was delivered to them so that he might show that they [i.e., the Jewish leaders] were implicated in the crime from which they tried to hold themselves aloof. For Pilate would have done no such thing except to implement what he perceived was their determined desire.
