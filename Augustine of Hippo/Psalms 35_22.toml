"This You have seen, O Lord; keep not silence" [Psalm 35:22]. What is, "keep not silence"? Judge Thou. For of judgment is it said in a certain place,  "I have kept silence; shall I keep silence for ever?" And of the delaying of judgment it is said to the sinner, "These things have you done, and I kept silence;" "You thought that I was altogether such an one as yourself."  How keeps He silence, who speaks by the Prophets, who speaks with His own mouth in the Gospel, who speaks by the Evangelists, who speaks by us, when we speak the truth? What then? He keeps silence from judgment, not from precept, not from doctrine. But this His judgment the Prophet in a manner invokes, and predicts: "You have seen, O Lord: keep not silence;" that is, You will not keep silence, needs must that You will judge. "O Lord, be not far from Me." Until Your judgment come, be not far from Me, as You have promised, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world."
