...He subjoins, "Remember not our iniquities of old" [Psalm 79:8]. He says not bygone, which might have even been recent; but "of old," that is, coming from parents. For to such iniquities judgment, not correction, is  owing. "Speedily let Your mercies anticipate us." Anticipate, that is, at Your judgment. For "mercy exalts above in judgment." [JamesÂ 2:13] Now there is "judgment without mercy," but to him that has not showed mercy. But whereas he adds, "for we have become exceeding poor:" unto this end he wills that the mercies of God should be understood to anticipate us; that our own poverty, that is, weakness, by Him having mercy, should be aided to do His commandments, that we may not come to His judgment to be condemned.

11. ...He subjoineth, "Remember not our iniquities of old" (ver. 8). He saith not bygone, which might have even been recent; but "of old," that is, coming from parents. For to such iniquities judgment, not correction, is owing. "Speedily let Thy mercies anticipate us." Anticipate, that is, at Thy judgment. For "mercy exalteth above in judgment." Now there is "judgment without mercy," but to him that hath not showed mercy. But whereas he addeth, "for we have become exceeding poor:" unto this end he willeth that the mercies of God should be understood to anticipate us; that our own poverty, that is, weakness, by Him having mercy, should be aided to do His commandments, that we may not come to His judgment to be condemned.
