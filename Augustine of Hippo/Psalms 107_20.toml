"He sent His Word, and healed them" [Psalm 107:20]. See what evil there is in satiety; see whence He delivers, to whom he cries that loathes his food. "He sent His Word, and healed them, and snatched them," from whence? Not from wandering, not from hunger, not from the difficulty of overcoming sins, but "from their corruption." It is a sort of corruption of the mind to loathe what is sweet.
