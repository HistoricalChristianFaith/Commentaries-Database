When tribulation comes, you will not be without help. This will show you that what he sent you during the day was true. In a certain passage it is written, “Mercy is as wonderful in time of affliction as clouds that bear rain in time of drought.” “By day the Lord sent his mercy, and by night I will tell of it.” At no time does he show you his help more than when tribulation comes, in such a way that he who had promised by day that he would do so, frees you from it.
