Speaking of Noah, our unerring Scriptures tell us that he “was a just and perfect man in his generation,” meaning that he was perfect as far as citizens of the city of God can be perfect during the pilgrimage of this present life, not, of course, as perfect as they are to be in that immortal life in which they will be as perfect as the angels of God.
