(Tr. xliv. 9) Or they sought how they could throw reproach upon the man, and cast him out of their synagogue. He declares however openly what he thinks: He said, He is a Prophet. Not being anointed yet in heart, he could not confess the Son of God; nevertheless, he is not wrong in what he says: for our Lord Himself says of Himself, A prophet is not without honour, save in his own country. (Luke 4:24)

(Tr. xliv. s. 10) i. e. had been blind, and now saw.

(Tr. xliv. 10) As f to say, We might justly be compelled to speak for an infant, that could not speak for itself: but he, though blind from his birth, has been always able to speak.

(Tr. xliv. 10) It was no disadvantage to be put out of the synagogue: whom they cast out, Christ took in.
Therefore said his parents, He is of age, ask him.

"But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had received his sight. And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, whom ye say was born blind? How then doth he now see? His parents answered and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind: but by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man should confess that he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue. Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him." What is this: "They feared the Jews"? "They feared the Jews," that is, the Pharisees. As it is written elsewhere, "Many of the rulers also believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue." O evil fear! The Jews expel from the synagogue, and Christ receives into heaven. Nevertheless the love of human glory hindered many even who believed from confessing.
