The Prophet addresses this Queen (for he delights in singing to her), and moreover each one of us, provided, however, we know where we are, and endeavour to belong to that body, and do belong to it in faith and hope, being united in the membership of Christ.  For it is us whom he addresses, saying, "Hearken, O daughter, and behold" [Psalm 45:10], as being one of the "Fathers" (for they are "daughters of kings"), although it be a Prophet, or although it be an Apostle  that is addressing her; addressing her, as a daughter, for we are accustomed to speak in this way, "Our fathers the Prophets, our fathers the Apostles;" if we address them as "fathers," they may address us as children: and it is one father's voice addressing one daughter. "Hearken, O daughter, and see." "Hear" first; afterward "see." For they came to us with the Gospel; and that has been preached to us, which as yet we do not see, and which on hearing of it we believed, which by believing it, we shall come to see: even as the Bridegroom Himself speaks in the Prophet, "A people whom I have not known served me. In the hearing of me with the ear it obeyed me."  What is meant by on "hearing of me with the ear"? That they did not "see." The Jews saw Him, and crucified Him; the Gentiles saw Him not, and believed. Let the Queen who comes from the Gentiles come in "the vesture of gold, clothed with various colours;"  let her come from among the Gentiles clad in all languages, in the unity of Wisdom: let it be said unto her, "Hearken, O daughter, and see." If you will not hear, you shall not "see."...

"And incline your ear." It is not enough to "hearken;" hearken with humility: bow down your ear. "Forget also your own people, and your father's house." There was a certain "people," and a certain house of your father, in which you were born, the people of Babylon, having the devil for your king. Whencesoever the Gentiles came, they came from their father the devil; but they have renounced their sonship to the devil. "Forget also your own people, and your father's house." He, in making you a sinner, begot you loathsome: the Other, in that "He justifies the ungodly," [RomansÂ 4:5] begets you again in beauty.
