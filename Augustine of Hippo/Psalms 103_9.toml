"He will not always be chiding: neither keeps He His anger for ever" [Psalm 103:9]. Since it is in consequence of His anger that we live in the scourges and corruption  of mortality: we have this in punishment for the first sin....Is it not through His anger, my brethren, that "in the sweat of your face and in toil you shall eat bread, and the earth shall bear thorns and thistles unto you"?  This was said to our forefathers. Or if our life is different from this; if you can, turn unto some pleasure, where you may not feel thorns. Choose what you have wished, whether you are covetous or luxurious; to name these two alone; add a third passion, that of ambition; how great thorns are there in the desire of honours? In the luxury of lusts how great thorns? In the ardour of covetousness how great thorns? What troubles are there in base loves? What terrible anxieties here in this life? I omit hell. Beware lest you even now become a hell unto yourself. The whole of this, my brethren, is the result of His anger: and when you have turned yourself unto works of righteousness, you can not but toil upon earth; and toil ends not before life ends. We must toil on the way, that we may rejoice in our country. He therefore consoles by His promises your toil, your labours, your troubles, saying to you, "He will not always be chiding."
