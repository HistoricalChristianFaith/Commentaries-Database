"As for our God, He is in heaven above" [Psalm 115:3]. Not in heaven, where they see the sun and moon, works of God which they adore, but "in heaven above," which overpasses all heavenly and earthly bodies. Nor is our God in heaven in such a sense, as to dread a fall that should deprive Him of His throne, if heaven were withdrawn from under Him. "In heaven and earth He has made whatsoever pleased Him." Nor does He stand in need of His own works, as if He had place in them where He might abide; but endures in His own eternity, wherein He abides and has done whatsoever pleased Him, both in heaven and earth; for they did not support Him, as a condition of their being created by Him: since, unless they had been created, they could not have supported Him. Therefore, in whatsoever He Himself dwells, He, so to speak, contains this as in need of Himself, He is not contained by this as if He needed it. Or it may be thus understood: "In heaven and in earth He has done whatsoever pleased Him," whether among the higher or the lower orders of His people, He has made His grace His free gift, that no man may boast in the merits of his own works....
