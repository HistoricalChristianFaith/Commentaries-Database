...Such children ought therefore to be "around" the Lord's "table, like olive-branches."  A complete Vine it is, a great bliss: who would now refuse to be there? When you see any blasphemer have a wife, children, grandchildren, and yourself perchance without them, envy them not; discern that the promise has been fulfilled in you also, but spiritually. If therefore we have, why have we? Because we fear the Lord. "Lo, thus shall the man be blessed that fears the Lord" [Psalm 128:4]. He is the man, who is also the men; and the men are one man; because many are one, because Christ is One.
