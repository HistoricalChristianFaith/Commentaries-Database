Let frugality be joined to fasting. Just as overeating is to be censured, so stimulants of the appetite must be eliminated. It is not that certain kinds of food are to be detested but that bodily pleasure is to be checked. Esau was censured not for having desired a fat calf or plump birds but for having coveted a dish of lentils.
