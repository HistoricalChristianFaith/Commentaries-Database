Mystically, the broiled fish is Christ who suffered. And he is the bread that came down from heaven. The church is united to his body in order to participate in everlasting blessedness. This is why he says, “Bring of the fish that you have now caught,” in order to signify that all of us who have this hope and are in that number seven of disciples, which represents the universal church here, partake of this great sacrament and are admitted to this bliss.

We find in the four Evangelists ten distinct appearances of the Lord to different persons after his resurrection: First was to the women near the sepulcher; the second to the women returning from the sepulcher;7 the third, to Peter; the fourth, to the two going to Emmaus;9 the fifth, to the large number in Jerusalem when Thomas was not present; the sixth when Thomas saw him;11 the seventh at the sea of Tiberias; the eighth by all the Eleven on a mountain of Galilee mentioned by Matthew;13 a ninth when for the last time he sat eating with the disciples; a tenth when he was seen no longer on earth but lifted up in the cloud as he ascended into heaven.

[The “third time”] is a reference not to appearances but to days. In other words, the first day includes all of his manifestations of himself on the day of his resurrection, then the second day occurs eight days after that when Thomas saw and believed, and now the third day occurs with the draught of fishes. And afterward as often as he saw them up to the time of his ascension.
