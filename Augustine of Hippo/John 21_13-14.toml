We find in the four Evangelists ten distinct appearances of the Lord to different persons after his resurrection: First was to the women near the sepulcher; the second to the women returning from the sepulcher; the third, to Peter; the fourth, to the two going to Emmaus; the fifth, to the large number in Jerusalem when Thomas was not present; the sixth when Thomas saw him; the seventh at the sea of Tiberias; the eighth by all the Eleven on a mountain of Galilee mentioned by Matthew; a ninth when for the last time he sat eating with the disciples; a tenth when he was seen no longer on earth but lifted up in the cloud as he ascended into heaven.
