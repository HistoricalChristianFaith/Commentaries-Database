"He has made His wonderful works to be remembered" [Psalm 111:4]: by abasing this man, exalting that. Reserving unusual miracles for a fit season, that thus human weakness, intent upon novelty, may remember them, although His daily miracles be greater. He created so many trees throughout the whole earth, and no one wonders: He dried up one with a word, and the hearts of mortals were thunderstruck. [Matthew 21:19-20] For that miracle, which has not through its frequency become common, will cling most firmly to the heart. But of what use were the miracles, save that He might be feared? What too would fear profit, unless "the gracious and merciful Lord" gave "meat unto them that fear Him"? [Psalm 111:5]; meat that does not spoil, "bread that comes down from heaven,"  which He gave to no deservings of ours. For "Christ died for the ungodly." [Romans 5:6] No one then would give such food, save a gracious and merciful Lord. But if He gave so much to this life, if the sinner who was to be justified received the Word made flesh; what shall he receive when glorified in a future world? For, "He shall ever be mindful of His covenant." Nor has He who has given a pledge, given the whole.
