"For all our days are failed, and in Your anger we have failed" [Psalm 90:9]. These words sufficiently prove that our subjection to death is a punishment. He speaks of our days failing, either because men fail in them from loving things that pass away, or because they are reduced to so small a number; which he asserts in the following lines: "our years are spent in thought like a spider."

And so the human race was held fast in a just condemnation, and all people were children of wrath—of that wrath of which it is written, "All our days are spent; and in your wrath we have fainted away. Our years shall be considered as a spider." Or as Job says of this same wrath, "Man, born of a woman, living for a short time, is full of wrath." And of this wrath the Lord Jesus also speaks: "He who believes in the Son has everlasting life; he who does not believe in the Son does not have life, but the wrath of God rests on him." He does not say it "will come" but it "rests" upon him, for everyone is born with it. And that is why the apostle says, "We were by nature children of wrath even as the rest." Since people were lying under this wrath because of original sin—sin still more heavy and destructive in proportion as the sins added on it were great or numerous—there was the need for a mediator, that is, a reconciler, who would placate this wrath by the offering of one sacrifice, of which all the sacrifices under the law and the prophets were foreshadowings.
