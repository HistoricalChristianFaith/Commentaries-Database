"The law of the Lord is undefiled, converting souls" [Psalm 19:7]. The law of the Lord, therefore, is Himself who came to fulfil the law, not to destroy it; [Matthew 5:17] an undefiled law, "Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth," [1 Peter 2:22] not oppressing souls with the yoke of bondage, but converting them to imitate Him in liberty. "The testimony of the Lord is sure, giving wisdom to babes." "The testimony of the Lord is sure;" for, "no man knows the Father save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him," [Matthew 11:27] which things have been hidden from the wise and revealed to babes; [Luke 10:21] for, "God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble." [James 4:6]

The law cannot be fulfilled except by spiritual persons, and there cannot be such save by grace. The more one is assimilated to the spiritual law, the more one attains to a spiritual disposition, and the more one fulfills the law. The more one delights in it, the less one is afflicted by its burdensomeness and the more one is quickened by its light.… When grace forgives sins and infuses a spirit of charity, righteousness ceases to be hard and becomes even pleasant.
