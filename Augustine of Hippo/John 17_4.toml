If knowledge of God is eternal life, the more we grow in this knowledge, the greater the advances we make toward life. And we shall not die in the eternal life that is to come. For then, when there shall be no death, the knowledge of God shall be perfected. Then God will be most fully glorified because then it will be the completed glory, as expressed in Greek by doxa.… But glory was defined among the ancients as fame accompanied with praise. But if one’s praise depends on what is said of him, how will God be praised when he himself shall be seen? And so it is said in Scripture, “Blessed are they who dwell in your house. They will be praising you forever and ever.” There, where there shall be full knowledge of God, his praise will continue without end. And because it is full knowledge, the glorification will also be full and complete.
