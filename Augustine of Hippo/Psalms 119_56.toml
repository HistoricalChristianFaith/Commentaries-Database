Considering this, he adds, "This was made unto me, because I sought out Your righteousnesses" [Psalm 119:56]. "Your" righteousnesses, whereby Thou dost justify the ungodly; not mine, which never make me godly, but proud. For this man was not one of those who, "ignorant of God's righteousness, and going about to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God." [Romans 10:3] Others have better interpreted these righteousnesses, as those whereby men are justified for nought through God's grace, though by themselves they cannot be righteous, "justifications."  But what means, "This was made unto me"? What is "This"? It is perhaps the law? As he had said, "and I have kept Your law;" to which he subjoins, "This was made unto me," meaning, "This was made my law." We must therefore enquire first what was thus made unto him, next in what manner, whatever it may have been, was made unto him. "This," he says, "was made unto me:" not "This law," for the Greek, as I have said, refuses this sense. Perhaps then, "This night:" since the preceding sentence stands thus: "I have thought upon Your Name, O Lord, in the night-season:" and the next words are, "This was made unto me:" since then it is not the law, it must truly be the night which is thus spoken of. What then means, "I had the night-season: for I have sought out Your righteousnesses"? Rather light had come unto him than night, since he sought out the righteousnesses of God. And it is thus rightly understood, "It was made unto me," as if it were said, It became night for my sake, that is, that it might profit me. For that low estate of mortality is not absurdly understood as night, where the hearts of mortals are hid to one another, so that from such darkness innumerable and heavy temptations arise....
