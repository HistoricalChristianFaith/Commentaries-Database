The Lord was crucified at the third hour by the tongues of the populace, at the sixth hour by the hands of the soldiers. When Pilate took his seat before the tribunal, it was “about the sixth hour,” or early in the sixth hour. When Jesus was nailed to the tree between two thieves, it was the end of the sixth hour. It was between the sixth and ninth hour that the sun was obscured and the darkness prevailed, as we have it jointly attested on the authority of the three Evangelists Matthew, Mark and Luke.
