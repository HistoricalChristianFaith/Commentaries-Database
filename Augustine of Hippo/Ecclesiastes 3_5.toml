As for you, you both have children and live in that end of the world when the time has already come not “to scatter stones but to gather; not to embrace but to refrain embraces.” [This is a time] when the apostle cries out, “But this I say, brethren, the time is short; it remains that those who have wives be as if they had none.” Surely, if you had sought a second marriage, it would not have been in obedience to a prophecy or a law, or even the desire of the flesh for offspring, but merely a sign of incontinence. You would have followed the advice of the apostle, when, after having said, “It is good for them if they so remain, even as I,” he immediately added, “But if they do not have selfcontrol, let them marry, for I prefer them to marry rather than to burn.”

Now this propagation of children which among the ancient saints was a most bounden duty for the purpose of begetting and preserving a people for God, among whom the prophecy of Christ’s coming must have had precedence over everything, now has no longer the same necessity. For from among all nations the way is open for an abundant offspring to receive spiritual regeneration, from whatever quarter they derive their natural birth. So that we may acknowledge that the Scripture which says there is “a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing,” is to be distributed in its clauses to the periods before Christ and since. The former was the time to embrace, the latter to refrain from embracing.
