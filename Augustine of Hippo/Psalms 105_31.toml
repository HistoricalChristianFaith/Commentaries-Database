"He spoke the word, and there came all manner of flies, and lice in all their quarters" [Psalm 105:31]. If it be asked when He spoke, it was in His Word before it took place; and there it was, without time, at what time it should take place: although even then He commanded it to be done, when it was to be done, through Angels, and through his servants Moses and Aaron.
