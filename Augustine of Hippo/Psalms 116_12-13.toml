I am certainly obliged to love the Redeemer, and I know what he said to Peter: “Peter, do you love me? Feed my sheep.” This was said once, said again, said a third time. Love was being questioned and toil commanded, because where the love is greater, the toil is less. “What shall I pay back to the Lord for all that he has paid back for me?” If I say that what I am paying back is my herding his sheep, even here it is “not I who am doing it but the grace of God with me.” So when can I be found to be paying him back, since he gets in first every time? And yet, because we love freely, because we are herding his sheep, we look for a reward.How shall this be? How can “I love freely and that’s why I’m herding sheep” be consistent with “I request a reward, because I’m herding sheep”? This could not possibly happen; in no way at all could a reward be sought from one who is loved freely, unless the reward were the very one who is being loved. I mean, if what we are paying back for his having redeemed us is our herding his sheep, what are we paying back for his having made us shepherds? Being bad shepherds, you see—which God preserve us from—is something we are by our own badness; whereas good shepherds—which God grant we may be—is something we can be only by his grace.

So let us praise the Lord, brothers and sisters, because we are holding his trustworthy promises, though we have not yet received the things promised. Do you imagine it is not enough to hold him to his promises and that we should be demanding the payment of his debts? By making promises, God has become our debtor. It is out of his goodness, not our rights, that he has become a debtor. What have we ever given him, that we should be able to hold him in our debt? Or perhaps because you heard in the psalm, “What shall I render to the Lord?” First of all, when he says, “What shall I render to the Lord?” they are the words of a debtor, not of someone demanding repayment of a debt. Something had been advanced to him. “What shall I render the Lord?” What is “What shall I render?” What shall I pay back? What for? “For all the things he has rendered to me.” What has he rendered to me? To begin with, I was nothing, and he made me; I had gotten lost, and he looked for me; looked for me and found me; I was a captive, and he redeemed me; having bought me, he set me free; from a slave he made me into a brother. “What shall I render to the Lord?” You haven’t got anything you can tender.When you look for absolutely everything from him, what have you got that you can render to him? But wait. There is something or other the psalmist wants to say, when he asks, “What shall I render to the Lord for all the things he has rendered to me?” He looks around everywhere for something he can tender, pay back, and he seems to find it. What does he find? “I will take the cup of salvation.” Even though you were thinking of paying something back, you are still looking for something to take. Look here, please. If you are still looking for something to take, you will still be a debtor. When are you going to be a someone who pays back? So if you are always going to be a debtor, when will you ever pay back? You won’t find anything you can pay back; you won’t have anything apart from what he has given.

Christ loved you before you existed; he created you; he predestined you before the foundation of the world; once created through the agency of your father and mother, he has reared you. It is not your parents, you see, who made you, though they hand on to you their family characteristics. He loved you, he created you, he reared you, he gave himself up for you, he listened to insults for you, he endured wounds for you, he redeemed you with his blood. Aren’t you overwhelmed, and won’t you say, “What shall I give back to the Lord for all that he has given to me?” What will you give back to the Lord for all that he has given to you? Listen to his saying, “Whoever has loved father or mother more than me is not worthy of me.” Listen to him saying it, fear the menace contained in it, love the promise implied in it.What have you given back to the Lord for all that he has given to you? So, all right, you have already given something back, eh? Well, what have you given back? Have you saved him as he has saved you? Have you opened up eternal life for him, as he has done for you? Have you created him, as he did you? Did you make him the Lord as he made you a person? Have you given anything back to him that does not come back to you? If you look frankly at the truth of the matter, you have not given him anything.… “For what do you have that you have not received?” Why don’t you find something you can give back to the Lord? Give him back yourself, give him back what he has made. Give him back yourself, not what is yours, his creation, not your perversion.
