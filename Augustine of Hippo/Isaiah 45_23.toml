For it is written, “As I live,” says the Lord, “every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.” So then every one of us shall give account of himself to God. Let us not, therefore, judge one another any more, but judge this rather, that no one put a stumbling block, or occasion to fall, in his brother’s way.
