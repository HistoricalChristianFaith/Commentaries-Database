Overcoming well means overcoming all the machinations of the devil. He serves up enticements, he is overcome by self-restraint; he inflicts pains and tortures, he is overcome by patience; he suggests errors, he is overcome by wisdom. As a last resort, when all these ploys have been defeated, he suggests to the soul, “Well done, well done, how much you’ve been able to do! How valiantly you’ve contended! Who can be compared with you? How well you have overcome!” The holy soul must answer him, “Let them be put to confusion and shame, those who say to me, Well done, well done!” So when do you overcome, if not when you say, “It is in the Lord that my soul shall be praised; let the gentle hear and rejoice”?
