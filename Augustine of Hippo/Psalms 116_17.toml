"I will offer to You the sacrifice of praise" [Psalm 116:17]. For I have not found any deserts of mine, since You have broken my bonds asunder; I therefore owe You the sacrifice of praise; because, although I will boast that I am Your servant, and the son of Your handmaid, I will glory not in myself, but in You, my Lord, who hast broken asunder my bonds, that when I return from my desertion, I may again be bound unto You.

My God, let me be thankful as I remember and acknowledge all your mercies. Let my whole self be steeped in love of you and all my being cry, "Lord, there is none like you!" "You have broken the chains that bound me; I will sacrifice in your honor." I shall tell how it was that you broke them and, when they hear what I have to tell, all who adore you will exclaim, "Blessed be the Lord in heaven and on earth. Great and wonderful is his name."
