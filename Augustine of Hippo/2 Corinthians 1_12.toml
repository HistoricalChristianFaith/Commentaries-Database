Cato is rightly praised more than Caesar, for, as Sallust says of him: “The less he sought for glory the more it followed him.” However, the only kind of glory they were greedy for was merely the reputation of a good name among men; whereas virtue rests not on others’ judgments but on the witness of one’s own conscience and therefore is better than a good name. Hence the apostle says: “For our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience.” … Therefore, virtue should not pursue the glory, honor and dominion which they sought, even though their good men sought to reach these ends by good means, but these things should follow virtue. There is no true virtue save that which pursues the end which is man’s true good. It follows, therefore, that Cato should not have sought the honors he sought, but his city should have given them to him because of his virtue and without his asking for them.
