"Praise the Lord in His saints," that is, in those whom He has glorified: "praise Him in the firmament of His power" [Psalm 150:1]. All these His saints are; as the Apostle says, "But we may be the righteousness of God in Him." If then they be the righteousness of God, which He has wrought in them, why are they not also the strength of Christ which He has wrought in them, that they should rise again from the dead? For in Christ's resurrection, "strength" is especially set forth to us, for in His Passion was weakness, as the Apostle says. And well does it say, "the firmament of His power." For it is the "firmament of His power" that He "dies no more, death has no more dominion over Him."
