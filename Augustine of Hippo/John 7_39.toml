Why then did the Lord Jesus Christ determine not to give the Holy Spirit until he should be glorified? We need to first inquire in what manner the Holy Spirit was not yet in holy people, as best as we are able, before we speak further, in case this should trouble anyone. We read in the Gospel concerning the Lord himself newly born that Simeon by the Holy Spirit recognized him; that Anna the widow, a prophetess, also recognized him; that John, who baptized him, recognized him;33 that Zachariah, being filled with the Holy Spirit, said many things; that Mary herself received the Holy Spirit to conceive the Lord. We have therefore many preceding evidences of the Holy Spirit before the Lord was glorified by the resurrection of his flesh. Nor was it another spirit that the prophets also had, who proclaimed beforehand the coming of Christ.

How is this to be understood, unless the special giving or sending of the Holy Spirit after the glorification of Christ was to be such as it had never been before? For it was not that it had never occurred previously, but that it had never been known in a way such as this. For if the Holy Spirit was not given before, how were the prophets who spoke filled? … How then was “the Spirit not given, since Jesus was not yet glorified,” unless because that giving or granting or mission of the Holy Spirit was to have a certain character of its own in its very advent such as never had happened before? For we read nowhere that people spoke in tongues that they did not know through the Holy Spirit coming on them. But this is what happened then [in Acts], when it was necessary that his coming should be made plain by visible signs, in order to show that the whole world, and all nations constituted with different tongues, should believe in Christ through the gift of the Holy Spirit to fulfill that which is sung in the psalm: “There is no speech or language where their voice is not heard; their sound is gone out through all the earth and their words to the end of the world.” … The Holy Spirit, whether by the shape of a dove or by fiery tongues … by motion within time and by [various] forms, manifested himself co-eternal and unchangeable with the Father and the Son.
