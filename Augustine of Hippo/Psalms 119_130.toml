"When your word goes forth," he says, "it gives light, and makes His little ones to understand" [Psalm 119:130]. What is the little one save the humble and weak? Be not proud therefore, presume not in your own strength, which is nought; and you will understand why a good law was given by a good God, though it cannot give life. For it was given for this end, that it might make you a little one instead of great, that it might show that you had not strength to do the law of your own power: and that thus, wanting aid and destitute, you might fly unto grace, saying, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.". ..Let all be little ones, and let all the world be guilty before You: because "by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified" in Your sight; "for by the Law is the knowledge of sin," etc. [Romans 3:19-21] These are Your wonderful testimonies, which the soul of this little one has searched; and has therefore found, because he became humbled and a little one. For who does Your commandments as they ought to be done, that is, by "faith which works through love," [Galatians 5:6] save love itself be shed abroad in his heart through the Holy Spirit? [Romans 5:5]

129. "When thy word goeth forth," he saith, "it giveth light, and maketh His little ones to understand" (ver. 130). What is the little one save the humble and weak? Be not proud therefore, presume not in thine own strength, which is nought; and thou wilt understand why a good law was given by a good God, though it cannot give life. For it was given for this end, that it might make thee a little one instead of great, that it might show that thou hadst not strength to do the law of thine own power: and that thus, wanting aid and destitute, thou mightiest fly unto grace, saying, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak." ...Let all be little ones, and let all the world be guilty before Thee: because "by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified" in Thy sight; "for by the Law is the knowledge of sin," etc. These are Thy wonderful testimonies, which the soul of this little one hath searched; and hath therefore found, because he became humbled and a little one. For who doth Thy commandments as they ought to be done, that is, by "faith which worketh through love," save love itself be shed abroad in his heart through the Holy Spirit?
