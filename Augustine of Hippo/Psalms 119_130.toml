"When your word goes forth," he says, "it gives light, and makes His little ones to understand" [Psalm 119:130]. What is the little one save the humble and weak? Be not proud therefore, presume not in your own strength, which is nought; and you will understand why a good law was given by a good God, though it cannot give life. For it was given for this end, that it might make you a little one instead of great, that it might show that you had not strength to do the law of your own power: and that thus, wanting aid and destitute, you might fly unto grace, saying, "Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am weak.". ..Let all be little ones, and let all the world be guilty before You: because "by the deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified" in Your sight; "for by the Law is the knowledge of sin," etc. [Romans 3:19-21] These are Your wonderful testimonies, which the soul of this little one has searched; and has therefore found, because he became humbled and a little one. For who does Your commandments as they ought to be done, that is, by "faith which works through love," [Galatians 5:6] save love itself be shed abroad in his heart through the Holy Spirit? [Romans 5:5]
