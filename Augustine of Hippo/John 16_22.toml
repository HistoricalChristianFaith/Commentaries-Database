Now the church is in travail, longing for this fruit of all its labor. Then [i.e., in the future] it will bring it to birth in its actual contemplation. Now it is groaning and in labor; then it will bring forth in joy. Now it brings forth in prayer; then it will bring forth in praise. And accordingly it is a male child since it is toward this fruit of [the church’s] eager longing that all the tasks of its activity are directed. For he alone is free of every bond, for he is desired of himself and not for any other end. All its actions are in service to him. For what is worthily done is directed toward him because it is done for his sake. He is to be had and to be held because of himself, not because of another beyond him. Here then is the end that contents us. Therefore it shall be eternal, for no end will suffice for us if it is not the One of which there is no end. It was this thought that inspired Philip when he said, “Show us the Father, and it is enough for us.” And in that showing the Son promises us himself also.… This is the joy that “no one shall take from you.”
