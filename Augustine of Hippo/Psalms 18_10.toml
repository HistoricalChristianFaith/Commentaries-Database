"And He mounted above the cherubim, and did fly" [Psalm 18:10]. And He was exalted above the fullness of knowledge, that no man should come to Him but by love: for "love is the fulfilling of the law." [RomansÂ 13:10] And full soon He showed to His lovers that He is incomprehensible, lest they should suppose that He is comprehended by corporeal imaginations. "He flew above the wings of the winds." But that swiftness, whereby He showed Himself to be incomprehensible, is above the powers of souls, whereon as upon wings they raise themselves from earthly fears into the air of liberty.
