Hold on to the gift but acknowledge the giver. When the Lord promised he was going to give his Spirit, he said, “If anyone is thirsty let him come to me and drink. Whoever believes in me, rivers of living water will flow from his belly.” Where does this river in you come from? Remember your former dryness. I mean, if you had not been dry, you would not have been thirsty. If you had not been thirsty, you would not have drunk. What do I mean when I say: if you had not been thirsty, you would not have believed in Christ? Unless you had discovered how empty you were, you would not have believed in Christ. Before saying “rivers of living water will flow from his belly,” he first said, “If anyone is thirsty, let him come and drink.” The reason you will have a river of living water is that you drink. You do not drink if you are not thirsty.
