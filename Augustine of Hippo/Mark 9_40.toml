Both declarations are true: that “he who is not with me is against me, and he that gathers not with me scatters abroad”; and also the injunction, “Forbid him not; for he that is not against you is for you.”13 This means that one fittingly shares in the worshiping community insofar as one stands with the whole church, and not against it. Yet those same individuals must be reproached for separating themselves from the church, wherever their gathering inadvertently becomes a scattering. If then one seeks reconciliation with the church, one does not need to receive what one already possesses, but merely needs to be set aright on those points at which one had gone astray.

This is the principle on which the whole church acts, not condemning common sacraments among heretics; for in these they are with us, and they are not against us. But she condemns and forbids division and separation, or any sentiment adverse to peace and truth. For in this respect they are against us, precisely because they are not with us, in the sense that and due to the fact that in not gathering with us, they are consequently scattering.
