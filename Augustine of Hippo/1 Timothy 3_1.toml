Consider these three temperaments: the contemplative, the active, the contemplativeactive. A man can live the life of faith in any of these three and get to heaven. What is not indifferent is that he love truth and do what charity demands. No man must be so committed to contemplation as, in his contemplation, to give no thought to his neighbor’s needs, nor so absorbed in action as to dispense with the contemplation of God. The attraction of leisure ought not to be emptyheaded inactivity but in the quest or discovery of truth, both for his own progress and for the purpose of sharing ungrudgingly with others. Nor should the man of action love worldly position or power, for all is vanity under the sun, but only what can be properly and usefully accomplished by means of such position and power … of contributing to the eternal salvation of those committed to one’s care. Thus, as St. Paul wrote, “If any one aspires to the office of bishop, he desires good work.” He wanted to make clear that the office of bishop, episcopatus, implies work rather than dignity.

“I want to be a bishop; oh, if only I were a bishop!” Would that you were! Are you seeking the name or the real thing? If it’s the real thing you’re seeking, you are setting your heart on a good work. If it’s the name you’re seeking, you can have it even with a bad work but with a worse punishment. So what shall we say? Are there bad bishops? Perish the thought, there aren’t any; yes, I have the nerve, the gall to say there are no bad bishops; because if they are bad, they aren’t bishops. You are calling me back again to the name and saying, “He is a bishop, because he is seated on the bishop’s throne.” And a straw scarecrow is guarding the vineyard. ..

But you think that this should not have happened to you because you believe that no one should be forced to do good. See what the apostle said, “If a man desire the office of a bishop, he desires a good work,” yet how many are forced against their will to undertake the episcopacy. Some are dragged in, locked up and kept under guard, suffering all this unwillingly until there arises in them a will to undertake this good work. .
