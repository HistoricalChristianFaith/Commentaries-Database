Quaest. Ev., 1, 26: Whereas the rich are few in comparison of the multitude of the poor, we must suppose that the disciples understood all who wish for riches, as included in the number of the rich. By the word “beheld” them, the Evangelist conveys that He soothed their troubled soul by His merciful eye.
