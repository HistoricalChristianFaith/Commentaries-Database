“On whom does my Spirit rest, if not on one who is humble and quiet and who trembles at my words?” So when he becomes the occupant, he fills and guides and leads the person, restrains from evil and spurs on to good, makes justice delightful, so that the person does good out of love for what is right, not out of fear of punishment. No one is capable on their own of doing what I have said. But if you have the Holy Spirit as the occupant of your house, you will find him also assisting you in everything good.

At these words Peter trembled, Plato did not; so let the fisherman keep what the great and famous philosopher ignored! “You have hidden these things from the wise and the knowing and have revealed them to the little ones.”
