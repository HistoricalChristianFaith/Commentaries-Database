"For our heart shall rejoice in Him:" for not in ourselves, wherein without Him there is great need; but in Himself shall our heart rejoice. "And we have trusted in His holy Name" [Psalm 33:21]; and therefore have we trusted that we shall come to God, because unto us absent has He sent, through faith, His own Name.
