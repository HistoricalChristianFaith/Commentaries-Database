"Let the habitation of them become forsaken" [Acts 1:20] [Psalm 69:26]. This is now evident. For in the same manner as He has mentioned not only a secret deliverance of His, saying, "Give heed to My soul, and redeem her;"  but also one open after the body, adding, "because of mine enemies deliver me:" so also to these men He foretells how there are to be certain secret misfortunes, whereof a little before He was speaking....For the blindness of the Jews was secret vengeance: but the open was what?
