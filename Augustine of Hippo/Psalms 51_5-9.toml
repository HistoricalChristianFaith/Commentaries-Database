So it is because of this quite unique innocence that the psalm says, “Against you alone have I sinned and done what is evil in your presence, that you may be justified in your words and may overcome when you are judged,” because he could find not a hint of evil in you [Jesus Christ]. Why could he find it in you, though, O human race? Because it goes on to say, “For I myself was conceived in iniquity, and in sins did my mother conceive me.” It is David saying this. Inquire how David was born; you will discover that it was of a lawful wife, not of adultery. So in terms of what sort of propagation does he say “I was conceived in iniquity”? It can only be that there is here a kind of propagation or transmission of death, which every person contracts who is born of the union of man and woman.

So all past sins are forgiven people on conversion; but for the rest of this life there are certain grave and deadly sins, from which one can be released only by the most vehement and distressing humbling of the heart and contrition of spirit and the pain of repentance. These are forgiven through the keys of the church. If you start judging yourself, you see, if you start being displeased with yourself, God will come along to show you mercy. If you are willing to punish yourself, he will spare you. In fact, all who repent and do penance well are punishing themselves. They have to be severe with themselves, so that God may be lenient with them. As David says, “Turn your face away from my sins, and blot out all my iniquities.” But on what terms? He says in the same psalm, “Since I acknowledge my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.” So if you acknowledge it, God overlooks it.

God does not listen to sinners. When he was beating his breast, he was punishing his sins; when he was punishing his sins, he was associating himself with God as judge. God, you see, hates sins; if you too hate them, you are beginning to join God, so that you can say to him, “Turn your face away from my sins.” Turn your face away—but from what? From my sins. “Do not turn your face away from me.” What’s the meaning of “your face from my sins”? Don’t see them, don’t look at them; overlook them instead, so that you can pardon me.
