"Your arrows are sharp, are most powerful" [Psalm 45:5]; words that pierce the heart, that kindle love. Whence in the Song of Songs it is said, "I am wounded with love." [Song of Songs 2:5] For she speaks of being "wounded with love;" that is, of being in love, of being inflamed with passion, of sighing for the Bridegroom, from whom she received the arrow of the Word. "Your arrows are sharp, are most powerful;" both piercing, and effective; "sharp, most powerful." "The peoples shall fall under You." Who have "fallen"? They who were "wounded" have also "fallen." We see the nations subdued unto Christ; we do not see them "fall." He explains where they "fall," viz. "in the heart." It was there they lifted themselves up against Christ, there they "fall" down before Christ. Saul was a blasphemer of Christ: he was then lifted up, he prays to Christ, "he is fallen," he is prostrate before Him: the enemy of Christ is slain, that the disciple of Christ may live! By an arrow launched from heaven, Saul (not as yet Paul, but still Saul), still lifted up, still not yet prostrate, is wounded in "the heart:" he received the arrow, he fell "in heart." For though he fell prostrate on his face, it was not there that he fell down in heart:  but it was there where he said aloud, "Lord, what dost Thou bid me do?" [Acts 9:6] But just now thou were going to bind the Christians, and to bring them to punishment: and now you say unto Christ, "What dost Thou bid me do?" O arrow sharp and most mighty, by whose stroke "Saul" fell, so as to become "Paul." As it was with him, so was it also with "the peoples;" consider the nations, observe their subjection unto Christ. "The peoples" (then) "shall fall under You in the heart of the King's enemies;" that is, in the heart of Your enemies. For it is Him that he calls King, Him that he recognises as King. "The peoples shall fall under You in the heart of the King's enemies." They were "enemies" before; they have been stricken by your arrows: they have fallen before You. Out of enemies they have been made friends: the enemies are dead, the friends survive. This is the meaning of, "for those which shall be changed." We are seeking to "understand" each single word, and each separate verse; yet so far only are we to seek for their "understanding," as to leave no one to doubt that they are spoken of Christ.
