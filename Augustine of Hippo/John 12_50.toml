If life everlasting is the Son himself and the commandment is life everlasting, what is this but saying, “I am the commandment of the Father”? And in the same way in the following, “Whatever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to me, so I speak,” we must not understand “said to me” as if words were spoken to the only Word or that the Word of God needed words from God. The Father spoke to the Son in the same way as he gave life to the Son. It was not that the Son was ignorant or did not [already] have life. Rather, it was simply because the Son was what he was. What, then, is meant by “as he said to me, so I speak” but that I am the Word who speaks. The Father is true, the Son is truth: the True begat the Truth. What then could he say to the Truth if the Truth was perfect from the beginning and no new truth could be added to him? That he spoke to the Truth then means that he begat the Truth.
