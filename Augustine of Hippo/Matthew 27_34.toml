De Cons. Ev., iii, 9: This is to be understood to have been done at the end ofall when He was led off to crucifixion after Pilate had delivered Him up to the Jews.
“And when he had tasted thereof, he would not drink.” That Mark says, “But he received it not,” we understand to mean that He would not receive it to drink thereof. For that He tasted it Matthew bears witness; so that Matthew’s, “He could not drink thereof,” means exactly the same as Mark’s, “He received it not;” only Mark does not mention His tasting it.That He tasted but would not drink of it signifies that He tasted the bitterness of death for us, but rose again the third day.
