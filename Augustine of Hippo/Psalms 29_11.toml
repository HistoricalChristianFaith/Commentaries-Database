"The Lord will give strength to His people"  [Psalm 29:11]. For the Lord will give strength to His people fighting against the storms and whirlwinds of this world, for peace in this world He has not promised them. [John 16:33] "The Lord will bless His people in peace." And the same Lord will bless His people, affording them peace in Himself; for, says He, "My peace I give unto you, My peace I leave with you." [John 14:27]
