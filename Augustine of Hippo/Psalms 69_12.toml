"Against Me were reviling they that were sitting in the gate" [Psalm 69:12]. "In the gate" is nothing else but in public. "And against Me they were chanting,  they that were drinking wine." Do ye think, brethren, that this has befallen Christ alone? Daily to Him in His members it happens: whenever perchance it is necessary for the servant of God to forbid excess of wine and luxuries in any village or town, where there has not been heard the Word of God, it is not enough that they sing, nay more even against him they begin to sing, by whom they are forbidden to sing. Compare ye now His fasting and their wine.
