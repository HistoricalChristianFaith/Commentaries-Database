So then the Son speaks, the Holy Spirit teaches. When the Son speaks, we take in the words; when the Holy Spirit teaches, we understand those words.… The whole Trinity indeed both speaks and teaches, but unless each person worked separately as well, the whole would be too much for human infirmity to take in.

The text says the Spirit will, “Suggest,” that is, “bring to your remembrance.” Every wholesome hint to remember that we receive is of the grace of the Spirit.
