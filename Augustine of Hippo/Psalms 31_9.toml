"Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am troubled" [Psalm 31:9]. But what is this unlooked-for cruelty of the persecutors, striking such dread into me? "Have mercy on me, O Lord." For I am now no more alarmed for death, but for torments and tortures. "My eye has been disordered by anger." I had my eye upon You, that You should not abandon me: You are angry, and hast disordered it. "My soul, and my belly." By the same anger my soul has been disturbed, and my memory, whereby I retained what my God has suffered for me, and what He has promised me.
