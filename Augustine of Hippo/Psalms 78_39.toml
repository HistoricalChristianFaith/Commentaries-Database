"And He remembered that they are flesh, a spirit  going and not returning" [Psalm 78:39]. Therefore calling them and pitying them through His grace, He called them back Himself, because of themselves they could not return. For how does flesh return, "a spirit walking and not turning back,"  while a weight of evil deserts does weigh it down unto the lowest and far places of evil, save through the election of grace?...For thus also is solved this no unimportant question, how it is written in the Proverbs, when the Scripture was speaking of the way of iniquity, "all they that walk in her shall not return." [ProverbsÂ 2:19] For it has been so spoken as if all ungodly men were to be despaired of: but the Scripture did only commend grace; for of himself man is able to walk in that way, but is not able of himself to return, except when called back by grace.
