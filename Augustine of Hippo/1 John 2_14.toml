"I write unto you, children." Whence children? "Because ye have known the Father. I write unto you fathers:" he enforceth this, and repeateth, "Because ye have known Him that is from the beginning." Remember that ye are fathers: if ye forget "Him that is from the beginning," ye have lost your fatherhood. "I write unto you, young men." Again and again consider that ye are young men: fight, that ye may overcome: overcome, that ye may be crowned: be lowly, that ye fall not in the fight. "I write unto you, young men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in you, and ye have overcome the wicked one."

All these things, my brethren,-"because we have known That which is from the beginning, because we are strong, because we have known the Father,"-do all these, while they in a manner commend knowledge, not commend charity? If we have known, let us love: for knowledge without charity saveth not. "Knowledge puffeth up, charity edifieth." If ye have a mind to confess and not love, ye begin to be like the demons. The demons confessed the Son of God, and said, "What have we to do with Thee?" and were repulsed. Confess and embrace, For those feared for their iniquities; love ye Him that forgiveth your iniquities.
