They were wrestling in the womb of their mother, and it was said to Rebekah, when they were wrestling there, “Two peoples are in your womb.” Two men, two peoples, a good people, an evil people; but still they are wrestling in one womb.How many evil people there are in the church! And one womb carries them until they are separated in the end. And the good shout against the evil, and the evil shout back against the good, and both are wrestling in the bowels of the one.
