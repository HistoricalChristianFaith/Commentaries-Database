"The Voice of the Lord breaking the cedars" [Psalm 29:5]. The Voice of the Lord humbling the proud in brokenness of heart. "The Lord shall break the cedars of Libanus." The Lord by repentance shall break them that are lifted on high by the splendour of earthly nobility, when to confound them He shall have "chosen the base things of this world," [1 Corinthians 1:28] in the which to display His Divinity.
