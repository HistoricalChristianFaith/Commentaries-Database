(de Cons. Ev. iii. 9.) After the lord's trial comes His Passion, which Matthew thus begins, Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the common hall, &c.

(ubi sup.) Hence we understand what Mark means by clothed him with purple; (Mark 15:17.) instead of the royal purple, this scarlet cloak was used in mockery; and there is a shade of purple which is very like scarlet. Or it may be, that Mark spoke of the purple which the cloak contained, though its colour was scarlet.

(ubi sup.) But Matthew seems to introduce this here as recollected from above, not that it was done at the time Pilate gave Him up for crucifixion. For John puts it before. He is given up by Pilate.

(Qu√¶st. Ev. ii. in fin.) That they took from off the Lord in His passion His own garment, and put on Him a coloured robe, denotes those heretics who said that He had a shadowy, and not a real body.
