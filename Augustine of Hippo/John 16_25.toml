But the hour is coming when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of my Father.” The hour of which he speaks may be understood of that future period of life when we shall see him openly, as the apostle said, “face to face.” Thus, when Jesus says, “These things I have spoken to you in proverbs” agrees with what the apostle said, “Now we see as in a glass darkly.” But “I will show you” that the Father shall be seen through the instrumentality of the Son, which is akin to what Jesus says elsewhere, “For no one knows the Father except the Son and the one to whom the Son shall reveal him.”
