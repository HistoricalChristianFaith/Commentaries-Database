For how great things besides has His boundless Goodness and illimitable Greatness made, which we do not know! When we lift the gaze of our eyes even to the heaven, and then recall it from sun, moon, and stars to the earth, and there is all this space where our sight can wander; beyond the heavens who can extend the eyesight of his mind, not to say of his flesh? So far then as His works are known to us, let us praise Him through His works. [Romans 1:20] "Generation and generation shall praise Your works" [Psalm 145:4]. Every generation shall praise Your works. For perhaps every generation is meant by "generation and generation."...Did he perchance mean to imply two generations by that repetition? For we are in this generation sons of God, we shall be in another generation sons of the Resurrection. Scripture has called us "sons of the Resurrection;" the Resurrection itself it has called Regeneration. "In the regeneration," it says, "when the Son of Man shall be seated in His Majesty." [Matthew 19:28] So also in another place; "For they shall not marry, nor be given in marriage, for they are the sons of the Resurrection." [Luke 20:35-36] Therefore "generation and generation shall praise Your works....And they shall tell out Your excellence." For neither shall they praise Your works, save in order to "tell out Your excellence." Boys at school are set to praise, and all such things are set before them to be praised, as God has wrought: a mortal is set to praise the sun, the sky, the earth; to come to even lesser things, to praise a rose, or a laurel; all these are works of God: they are set, they are undertaken, they are praised: the works are lauded, of the Worker they are silent. I desire in the works to praise the Creator: I love not a thankless praiser. Do you praise what He has made, and art silent of Him who made? In that which you see, what is it that you praise? The form, the usefulness, some virtue, some power in the things. If beauty delight you, what is more beautiful than the Maker? If usefulness be praised, what more useful than He who made all things? If excellence be praised, what more excellent than He by whom all things were made?...
