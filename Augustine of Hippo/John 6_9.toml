(lib. lxxxiii. Quæst. q. 61. in princ.) The five barley loaves signify the old law; either because the law was given to men not as yet spiritual, but carnal, i. e. under the dominion of the five senses, (the multitude itself consisted of five thousand:) or because the Law itself was given by Moses in five books. And the loaves being of barley is also an allusion to the Law, which concealed the soul's vital nourishment, under carnal ceremonies. For in barley the corn itself is buried under the most tenacious husk. Or, it alludes to the people who were not yet freed from the husk of carnal appetite, which cling to their heart.

(lib. lxxxiv. Quæst. qu. 61) The two fishes again, that gave the pleasant taste to the bread, seem to signify the two authorities by which the people were governed, the Royal, viz. and the Priestly; both of which prefigure our Lord, who sustained both characters.

(Tr. xxiv. 5) The boy who had these is perhaps the Jewish people, who, as it were, carried the loaves and fishes after a servile fashion, and did not eat them. That which they carried, while shut up, was only a burden to them; when opened became their food.

What, then, think we that five loaves signify? As far as the meaning which commends itself presents itself to my mind, the five loaves are the five books of Moses. With reason are they not wheaten, but barley loaves; because they belong to the Old Testament. And ye know that barley is so formed that we hardly get at the marrow of it; for that marrow is clothed with a coating of husk, and the husk itself is tenacious and coherent, so that it is stripped off with difficulty. Such is the letter of the Old Testament; clothed with the coverings of carnal sacraments: but yet if we get at its marrow, it feeds and satisfies.

A certain boy, then, brought five loaves and two fishes. If we inquire who this boy was, perhaps it was the people of Israel, which, in a childish sense, carried the food, and ate not. For that which they carried, was a burden to them while closed; but when opened, was food for them. Moreover, the two fishes seem to me to signify those two sublime persons of the Old Testament, who were anointed for sanctifying and ruling the people, the Priest and the King. And at length came in the mystery He who was signified by them, He who was pointed out by the marrow of the barley, He who was concealed under the barley's husk. The same came, one person sustaining the two characters, of Priest and of King.
