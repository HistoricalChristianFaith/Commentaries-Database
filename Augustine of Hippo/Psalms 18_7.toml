"And the earth was moved and trembled" [Psalm 18:7]. When the Son of Man was thus glorified, sinners were moved and trembled. "And the foundations of the mountains were troubled." And the hopes of the proud, which were in this life, were troubled. "And were moved, for God was angry with them." That is, that the hope of temporal goods might have now no more establishment in the hearts of men.
