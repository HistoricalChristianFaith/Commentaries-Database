The law said, “You shall not covet,” in order that, when we find ourselves lying in this diseased state, we might seek the medicine of grace. By that commandment [we might] know both in what direction our endeavors should aim as we advance in our present mortal condition and to what a height it is possible to reach in the future immortality. For unless perfection could somewhere be attained, this commandment would never have been given to us.

There you are then, the law tells you “you shall not covet.” You know the law which says, “You shall not covet.” Covetousness surges up in you, which you didn’t know. It was there inside, you see, but it wasn’t known. You started to make an effort to overcome what was inside, and what was hidden came to light. Proud fellow, through the law you have been made into a transgressor. Acknowledge grace, and become a singer of praise.

Even a lion can be shooed off its prey by the terrifying threat of arms and weapons and the crowd of people perhaps surrounding it or coming to attack it; and yet the lion comes, the lion returns. It hasn’t seized its prey; it hasn’t either laid aside its evil intention. If that’s what you’re like, your justice is still the sort by which you take care not to get tortured. What’s so great about being afraid of punishment? Who isn’t afraid of it?

What is the accomplishing of good except the cessation and end of evil? But what is the cessation of evil except what the law says, “You shall not lust”? To lust not at all is the accomplishing of good because it is the cessation of evil. He said this: “To accomplish good is not there for me,” because he was unable to bring it about that he did not lust. He only brought it about that he reined in lust, that he did not consent to lust and that he did not offer his members to lust for its service.

To save me from saying a lot, among other commandments it contains “You shall not covet your neighbor’s property.” Don’t covet; don’t go up and down in front of that country house belonging to someone else and sigh because it’s such a fine one. Do not covet your neighbor’s property. “The Lord’s is the earth and its fullness.” What haven’t you acquired, if you have got hold of God? So don’t covet your neighbor’s property.
