"And let them exalt Him in the assembly of the people, and praise Him in the seat of the elders" [Psalm 107:32]. Let them exalt, let them praise, peoples and elders, merchants and pilots. For what has He done in this assembly? What has He established? Whence has He rescued it? What has He granted it? Even as He resisted the proud, and gave grace to the humble: [James 4:6] the proud, that is, the first people of the Jews, arrogant, and extolling itself on its descent from Abraham, and because to that nation "were entrusted the oracles of God." [Romans 3:2] These things did not avail them unto soundness, but unto pride of heart, rather to swelling than to greatness. What then did God, resisting the proud, but giving grace to the humble; cutting off the natural branches for their pride; grafting in the wild olive for its humility?

"He made the rivers a wilderness" [Psalm 107:33]. Waters did run there, prophecies were in course. Seek now a prophet among the Jews; you find none. For "He made the outgoings of waters to be thirst." Let them say, "Now there is no prophet more, and He will not know us any more."  "A fruitful land to be saltpools" [Psalm 107:34]. You seek there the faith of Christ, you find not: you seek a prophet, you find not: you seek a sacrifice, you find not: you seek a temple, you find none. Wherefore this? "From the wickedness of them that dwell therein." Behold how He resists the proud: hear how He gives grace to the humble. "He made the wilderness to be a standing water, and the dry ground to be outgoings of waters" [Psalm 107:35]. "And He caused the hungry to dwell there" [Psalm 107:36]. Because to Him it was said, "You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedec."  For you seek a sacrifice among the Jews; you have none after the order of Aaron. You seek it after the order of Melchizedec; you find it not among them, but through the whole world it is celebrated in the Church. "From the rising of the sun to the setting thereof the name of the Lord is praised.". .."And they sowed fields, and planted vineyards, and gat fruit of grain" [Psalm 107:37]: at which that workman rejoices, who says, "Not because I desire a gift, but I seek fruit." [Philippians 4:17] "And He blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and their cattle were not diminished" [Psalm 107:38]. This stands. For "the foundation of God stands sure; because the Lord knows them that are His." [2 Timothy 2:19] They are called "beasts of burden," and "cattle," that walk simply in the Church, yet are useful; not much learned, but full of faith. Therefore, whether spiritual or carnal, "He blessed them."
