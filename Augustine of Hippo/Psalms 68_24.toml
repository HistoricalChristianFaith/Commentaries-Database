"There have been seen Your steps, O God" [Psalm 68:24]. The steps are those wherewith You have come through the world, as though in that chariot You were going to traverse the round world; which chariot of clouds He intimates to be His holy and faithful ones in the Gospel, where He says, "From this time  you shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds." [Mark 13:26] Leaving out that coming wherein He shall be Judge of quick and dead, [2 Timothy 4:1] "From this time," He says, "you shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds." These "Your steps have been seen," that is, have been manifested, by the revealing the grace of the New Testament. Whence has been said, "How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim peace, that proclaim good things!" [Romans 10:15] For this grace and those steps were lying hid in the Old Testament: but when there came the fullness of time, and it pleased God to reveal His Son, [Galatians 4:4] that He might be proclaimed among the Gentiles, "there were seen Your steps, O God: the steps of my God, of the  King who is in the holy place." In what holy place, save in His Temple? "For the Temple of God is holy," he says, "which you are." [1 Corinthians 3:17]

30. "There have been seen Thy steps, O God" (ver. 24). The steps are those wherewith Thou hast come through the world, as though in that chariot Thou wast going to traverse the round world; which chariot of clouds He intimateth to be His holy and faithful ones in the Gospel, where He saith, "From this time ye shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds." Leaving out that coming wherein He shall be Judge of quick and dead, "From this time," He saith, "ye shall see the Son of Man coming in clouds." These "Thy steps have been seen," that is, have been manifested, by the revealing the grace of the New Testament. Whence hath been said, "How beautiful are the feet of them that proclaim peace, that proclaim good things!" For this grace and those steps were lying hid in the Old Testament: but when there came the fulness of time, and it pleased God to reveal His Son, that He might be proclaimed among the Gentiles, "there were seen Thy steps, O God: the steps of my God, of the King who is in the holy place." In what holy place, save in His Temple? "For the Temple of God is holy," he saith, "which ye are."
