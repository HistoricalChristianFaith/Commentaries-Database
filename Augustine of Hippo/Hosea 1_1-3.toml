Under no circumstances would any reasonable person imagine that the Lordâ€™s feet were anointed with precious ointment by the woman for the same reason that was customary for sensual, dissolute men whose banquets were such that we loathe them. In that case the good odor13 is the good reputation that each one will possess by the works of good life, as long as one follows the footsteps of Christ, and as it were, anoints his feet with very precious ointment. Hence what is frequently sinful in other persons is a symbol of some sublime truth in the person of God or a prophet.
