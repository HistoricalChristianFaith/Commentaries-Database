"And I walked at liberty: for I sought Your precepts" [Psalm 119:45]...."And I walked at liberty." Here the copulative conjunction, "and," is not used as a connecting particle; for he does not say, and I will walk, as he had said, "and I will keep Your commandments for ever and ever:" or if this latter verse be in the optative mood, and may I keep Your law; he does not add, And may I walk at liberty, as if he had desired and prayed for both of these things; but he says, "And I walked at liberty." If this conjunction were not used here, and if the sentence were introduced free from any such connection with what preceded, "I walked at liberty," the reader would never be induced by anything unusual in the mode of speech to think he should seek for some hidden sense. Doubtless, then, he wished what he has not said to be understood, that is, that his prayers had been heard; and he then added what he had become: as if he were to say, When I prayed for these things, You heard me, "And I walked at liberty;" and so with the remaining expressions which he has added to the same purpose.
