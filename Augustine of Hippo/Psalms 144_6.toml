"Flash Your lightning, and You shall scatter them; send forth Your arrows, and You shall confound them" [Psalm 144:6]. But there are some that conspire, that "gather themselves together against the Lord, and against His Christ." They have come together, they have conspired. "Flash forth Your lightnings, and You shall scatter them." Abound with Your miracles, and their conspiracy shall be broken...."Send forth Your arrows, and You shall confound them." Let the unsound be wounded, that, being well wounded, they may be made sound; and let them say, being set now in the Church, in the Body of Christ, let them say with the Church, "I am wounded with Love."
