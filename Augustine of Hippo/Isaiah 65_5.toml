So insofar as they say, “Do not touch me, because I am pure,” they are like this Pharisee who had invited the Lord and who thought [the Lord] did not know the woman, just because he had not stopped her touching his feet. But in another respect the Pharisee is better, in that while he thought Christ was only a man, he did not believe that sins could be forgiven by a man. So the Jews appear to have a better understanding than the heretics. What did the Jews say? “Who is this who even forgives sins?” Does a mere man have the audacity to claim this for himself?” What … does the heretic say? “I forgive, I cleanse, I sanctify.”
