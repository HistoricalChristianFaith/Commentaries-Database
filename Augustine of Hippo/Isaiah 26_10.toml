In the resurrection itself it is not easy to see God, except for those who are clean of heart; hence, “Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.” From here on he begins to speak of that world where all who rise again will not see God, but only those who rise to eternal life. The unworthy will not see him, for of them it is said, “Let the wicked be taken away lest he behold the brightness of the Lord.” But the worthy will see him, and of such the Lord spoke when, though present, he was not seen, saying, “He that loves me keeps my commandments, and he that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.”

In this human form the good will see him in whom they have believed; the wicked, him whom they have despised. But the wicked will not see him in the form of God in which he is equal to the Father, for as the prophet says, “The wicked shall be taken off that he may not see the glory of the Lord,” and, on the other hand, “Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God.”

Then, therefore, we shall come and we shall enjoy the one thing; but the one thing will be all things to us. For what was it I said, my brothers, when I began to speak? What is that sufficiency which we shall possess when we shall have no need? What is the sufficiency which we shall possess? I had intended to say, “What will God give to us which he will not give to them?” “Let the wicked be taken away that he may not see the glory of God.” Hence God will give his glory to us so that we may enjoy it; and the wicked will be taken away that he may not see the glory of God. God himself will be the entire sufficiency which we shall possess as our own. Greedy one, what did you seek to gain? What does anyone, for whom God is not enough, seek from God?
