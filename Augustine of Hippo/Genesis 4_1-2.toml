Note that the name Cain means “ownership,” which explains what was said at the time of his birth by his father or mother: “I have come into possession of a man through God.”

Cain was followed by Abel, who was killed by his brother and served as the first prophetic symbol of the City of God. He was like an alien on earth, destined to suffer cruel persecutions at the hands of the wicked men who can properly be called natives of earth because they love this world as their home and find their happiness in the worldly felicity of the earthly city.
