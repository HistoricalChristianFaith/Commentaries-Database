Let us not think that in this text the word heaven signifies the universe of heavenly bodies, for the word earth includes every kind of body, for one ought to disregard the whole world when laying up treasure in heaven. Therefore the reference is to that heaven of which it is said, “The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s.” Moreover, since we ought to fix our treasure and our heart on that which will abide forever and not on something which will pass away, the heaven here mentioned means the spiritual firmament, for “heaven and earth will pass away.”
