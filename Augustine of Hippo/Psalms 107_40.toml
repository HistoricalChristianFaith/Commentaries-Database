"Contempt was poured on princes" [Psalm 107:40]. For they were rejected by the Church of God, and the more because they wished to be princes, therefore they were despised, and became salt that had lost its savour, cast out abroad, so that it is trodden under foot of men. [Matthew 5:13] "And He led them astray in the pathless place, and not in a way." Those above in the way, those directed to a city, and finally led there, not led astray; but these, where there was no way, led astray. What is, "Led them astray"? God "gave them up to their own hearts' lusts." [Romans 1:24] For "led astray" means this, gave them up to themselves. For if you enquire closely, it is they that lead themselves astray.
