How do we think, except as in the way that the prophet also foretells of God, that he has done the things that are going to be? For he does not say, “Who will do the things that are going to be, but “who did the things that are going to be.” Therefore, [God] both did them and is going to do them. For neither have they been done if he did not do them, nor are they going to be done if he will not do them. Therefore, [God] did them by predestining them; he is going to do them by working.

By predestination God indeed foreknew that which he himself was going to do. Thus it was said, “He has made that which shall be.” Furthermore, [God] can foreknow even those things that he himself does not do, such as whatever sins there may be. There are certain things that are sins and at the same time punishment for sins, so that it is written, “God delivered them up to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not fitting.” This is not the sin of God, however, but the judgment of God.
