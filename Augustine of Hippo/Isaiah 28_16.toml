Therefore, with the exception of this cornerstone, I do not see how people are to be built into a house of God, to contain God dwelling in them, without being born again, which cannot happen before they are born.

To the one group, the infant at birth is shown as the chief cornerstone announced by the prophet; to the other group he is manifested at the very outset of his career. He has already begun to weld together in himself the two walls originally set in different directions, bringing shepherds from Judea and magi from the East.

A stone anointed; why a stone? “Behold, I lay in Zion a stone, elect, precious; and he that believes on him shall not be confounded.” Why anointed? Because Christ comes from “anointing” (chrisma).

Here is what one believes with the heart unto justice and makes confession of with the mouth unto salvation. But you’re afraid to confess it, in case people taunt you with it; and not ones who have not come to believe, because they too believe it inwardly. But in case those who are ashamed to confess it should taunt you with it, listen to what comes next. For Scripture says, “Nobody who believes in him shall be put to shame.” Reflect on all this; stick to it all. This is prey, food not for the belly but for the intelligence.
