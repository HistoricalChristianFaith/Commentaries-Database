"For she works for her husband's good and not his harm, all the time." That is why this lady despoils the nations, working for her husband's good and not his harm. All the time she does good and not harm: not for herself either, but for her husband, "that whoever lives may live no longer for himself, but for the one who died and rose again for all."
