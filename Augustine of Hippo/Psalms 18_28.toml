"For you will light My candle, O Lord" [Psalm 18:28]. For our light is not from ourselves; but "You will light my candle, O Lord. O my God, You will enlighten my darkness." For we through our sins are darkness; but "You, O my God, wilt enlighten my darkness."

Examine human nature: it is born and increases, it learns these customs of people. What does [this nature] know except earth, of the earth? It speaks human things, it knows human things, it understands human things. Carnal itself, [this nature] judges carnally, it surmises carnally. Let the grace of God come, let it enlighten a person’s darkness, as [the psalmist] says.… Let grace take possession of the human mind and turn it to its own light; immediately it begins to say what the apostle says: “Yet not I, but the grace of God with me” and “And it is no longer I that live, but Christ lives in me.”
