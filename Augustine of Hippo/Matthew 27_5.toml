The Evangelist had above brought down his history, of what was done to the Lord as far as early morning; he then turned back torelate Peter’s denial, after which he returned to the morning to continue the course of events, "When the morning was come”.
Since the Chief Priests were employed about the murder of the Lord from the morning to the ninth hour, how is this proved that before the crucifixion Judas returned them the money he had received, and said to them in the temple, "I have sinned, in that I have betrayed innocent blood?”
