“Let the wickedness of sinners be consummated.” In this context, “consummated” means “brought to completion,” in tune with what is said in the Apocalypse, “Let the righteous become more righteous yet, and the filthy still wallow in their filth.” The wickedness of those who crucified the Son of God seems to be complete, but greater still is the wickedness of those who do not wish to live uprightly and hate the commandments of truth for which the Son of God was crucified. The psalmist said, therefore, “Let the wickedness of sinners be consummated,” that is, let it come to the pinnacle of wickedness, so that the righteous judgment can come immediately.
