So there is a forehead of the inner self. That is where those people were marked, to save them from being wiped out. Because even if they did not put right the sins that were committed among them, at least they were pained by them, and by their very pain they set themselves apart; while set apart for God, they were mixed together in the eyes of people. They are marked with a sign in secret; they escape harm in public. The destroyer is sent next and is told, “Go, destroy, do not spare young, old, male, female; but do not go near those who have the sign on their foreheads.” What a sure guarantee has been given you, my brothers and sisters, you among this people who are groaning and grieving over the wicked deeds committed in your midst and are not committing them!
