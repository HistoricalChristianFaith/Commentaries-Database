"For evil-doers shall be cut off" [Psalm 37:9]. "But I see their prosperity." Believe Him who says, "they shall be cut off;" Him who sees better than thou, since His eye anger cannot cloud. "For evil-doers shall be cut off. But those that wait upon the Lord,"— not upon any one that can deceive them; but verily on Him who is the Truth itself—"But those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land." What "land," but that Jerusalem, with the love of which whosoever is inflamed, shall come to peace at the last.
