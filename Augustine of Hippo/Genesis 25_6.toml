If then we are the sons of the free Jerusalem, let us realize that some gifts belong to those who are disinherited; others, to the heirs. For they are heirs to whom it is said, “You have not received a spirit of bondage so as to be again in fear, but you have received a spirit of adoption as sons, by virtue of which we cry: ‘Abba! Father!’ ”
