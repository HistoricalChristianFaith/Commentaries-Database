City of God, book xx, ch. 30: Seeing He preached the judgment to come which was hidden from the Gentiles.
So He neither bruised nor quenched the Jewish persecutors, who are here likened to a bruised reed which has lost its wholeness, and to a smoking flax which has lost its flame; but He spared them because He was not come to judge them, butto be judged by them.
Quaest. Ev., i, 3: In the smoking flax it is observed, that when the flame is out it causes a stink.
