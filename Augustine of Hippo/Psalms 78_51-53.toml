The Psalm proceeds then after the commemoration of the plagues of the Egyptians [Psalm 78:51] and says, "And He took away like sheep His people, and He led them through like a flock in the desert" [Psalm 78:52]. "And He led them down in hope, and they feared not, and their enemies the sea covered" [Psalm 78:53]. This comes to pass to so much the greater good, as it is a more inward thing, wherein being delivered from the power of darkness, we are in mind translated into the Kingdom of God, and with respect to spiritual pastures we are made to become sheep of God, walking in this world as it were in a desert, inasmuch as to no one is our faith observable: whence says the Apostle, "Your life is hidden with Christ in God." [Colossians 3:3] But we are being led home in hope, "For by hope we are saved." [Romans 8:24] Nor ought we to fear. For, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" [Romans 8:31] And our enemies the sea has covered, He has effaced them in baptism by the remission of sins.
