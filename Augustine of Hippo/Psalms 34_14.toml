It is nothing that thou spoil not: clothe the naked. If you have not spoiled, you have declined from evil; but you will not do good, except thou receive the stranger into your house.

"Seek peace, and ensue it;" because when thou also hast risen, this mortal shall be changed, and you shall embrace peace there where no man shall trouble you. For there is perfect peace, where you will not hunger....
