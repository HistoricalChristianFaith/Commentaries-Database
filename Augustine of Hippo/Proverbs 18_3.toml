Confession dies with a dead man, but is always possible for one who is alive. There is this saying, “When a sinner shall have come into the depth of evil things, he despises [them].” For it is one thing to long for, another thing to fight against righteousness. It is one thing to desire to be delivered from evil, another thing to defend one’s evil doings rather than to confess.
