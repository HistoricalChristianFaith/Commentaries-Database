He is God, so he also takes pity. He gets angry, and he takes pity. He gets angry and strikes; he takes pity and heals. He gets angry and does to death; he takes pity and brings to life. In one person he does this. It’s not that he does some people to death and brings others to life, but in the same people he is both angry and gentle. He is angry with errors; he is gentle with bad habits put right. “I will strike and I will heal: I will kill and I will make alive.” One and the same Saul, afterward Paul, he both laid low and raised up. He laid low an unbeliever; he raised up a believer. He laid low a persecutor; he raised up a preacher.

[Paul’s conversion] fulfilled in him what was written in the prophet, “I will strike, and I will heal.” What God strikes, you see, is that in people which lifts up itself against God. The surgeon isn’t being heartless when he lances the tumor, when he cuts or burns out the suppurating sore. He’s causing pain; he certainly is, but in order to restore health. It’s a horrid business; but if it wasn’t, it wouldn’t be any use.

So the apostle was petrified, knocked down and laid low, raised up and patched up. The words, you see, were realized in him: “It is I that will strike and I that will heal.” You see, it doesn’t say, “I will heal, and I will strike,” but “I will strike, and I will heal.” I will strike you and give myself to you. Thus being laid low, he was horrified at his own justice, in which he was certainly without reproach, praiseworthy, great, even glorious among the Jews. He reckoned it was waste, he thought it was loss, he counted it dung, “that he might be found in him, not having his own justice, which is from the law; but that which is through the faith of Christ, which is,” he says, “from God.”
