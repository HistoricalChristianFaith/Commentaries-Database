There are many allusions to the last judgment in the Psalms, but for the most part only casual and slight. I cannot, however, omit to mention what is said there in express terms of the end of this world: “In the beginning hast Thou laid the foundations of the earth, O Lord; and the heavens are the work of Thy hands. They shall perish, but Thou shall endure; yea, all of them shall wax old like a garment; and as a vesture Thou shall change them, and they shall be changed: but Thou art the same, and Thy years shall not fail.”

Suppose they say, though, that the Lord’s own divine substance is not the same when he is with the Father as it was when he wished to show himself on earth without taking a body, then what else have the poor fools committed themselves to, but saying that the divine substance is subject to change in place and time? They do not want to read, or they find it difficult to understand, what is said by the prophet, “They will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment. Like clothing you will change them, and they will be discarded. But you remain the same, and your years will never end”; and what is written in the book of divine Wisdom about Wisdom: “While remaining in herself, she renews all things.”

If, however, they do not say “so impure” but “so weak,” we agree entirely. And that is why Christ is our strength, because he was not changed by our weakness. Here I recognize the aptness of the prophet’s words, “You will change them, and they shall be changed; but you yourself are the same, and your years shall not fail.” Not only did the weakness of the flesh not change him for the worse, but by him it was changed for the better.

These things that we hold according to our faith, and which reason also demonstrates, can be supported by testimonies from the divine Scriptures, so that the less intelligent who cannot follow the argument may believe on divine authority and so may deserve to reach understanding. Those who understand, and are less instructed in ecclesiastical sacred books, are not to think that we have produced them out of our heads and that they are not in the Scriptures. That God is immutable is written thus in the Psalms: “You shall change them, and they shall be changed; but you are the same.” And in the book of Wisdom it is written of Wisdom: “Abiding in herself she renews all things.” The apostle Paul says, “To the invisible, incorruptible, only wise God.” The apostle James writes, “Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.” Because the Son was not made, but all things were made through him, it is written, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him nothing was made.”
