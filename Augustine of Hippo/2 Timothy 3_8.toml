Do they not resist this truth, men corrupted in mind, reprobates concerning the faith, who respond and speak iniquity, saying, “We have it from God that we are men but from our own selves that we are just”? What are you [Pelagians] saying? You deceive your own selves, not protecting but jettisoning free will, from the height of haughtiness through empty expanses of presumption into the depths of a drowning deep in the sea. Without doubt it is your pronouncement that man of himself does justice. This is the height of your presumption.
