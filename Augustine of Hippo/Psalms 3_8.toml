"Salvation is of the Lord; and upon Your people be Your blessing" [Psalm 3:8]. In one sentence the Psalmist has enjoined men what to believe, and has prayed for believers. For when it is said, "Salvation is of the Lord," the words are addressed to men. Nor does it follow, "And upon Your people" be "Your blessing," in such wise as that the whole is spoken to men, but there is a change into prayer addressed to God Himself, for the very people to whom it  was said, "Salvation is of the Lord." What else then does he say but this? Let no man presume on himself, seeing that it is of the Lord to save from the death of sin; for, "Wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord." [Romans 7:24-25] But bless, O Lord, Your people, who look for salvation from You.

He who gives salvation is called “the salvation of the Lord,” and he is likewise our salvation who received him.
