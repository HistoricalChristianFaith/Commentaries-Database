"Let my mouth be fulfilled with praise, that with hymn I may tell of Your glory, all the day long Your magnificence" [Psalm 71:8]. What is "all the day long"? Without intermission. In prosperity, because  You      comfort: in adversity, because  You      correct: before I was in being, because  You made; when I was in being, because You gave health: when I had sinned, because You forgave; when I was converted, because You helped; when I had persevered, because You crowned.
