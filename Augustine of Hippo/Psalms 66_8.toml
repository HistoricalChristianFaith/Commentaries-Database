"Bless our God, you nations" [Psalm 66:8]. Behold, there have been driven back they that are bitter, reckoning has been made with them: some have been converted, some have continued proud. Let not them terrify you that grudge the Gentiles Gospel Grace: now has come the Seed of Abraham, in whom are blessed all nations. [Genesis 12:3] Bless ye Him in whom you are blessed, "Bless our God, you nations: and hear ye the voice of His praise." Praise not yourselves, but praise Him.
