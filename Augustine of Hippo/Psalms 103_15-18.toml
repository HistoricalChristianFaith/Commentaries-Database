Applicable to this difference is what has been written: “And to those who retain his commandments in memory, that they may do them.” For many retain them in memory that they may despise them or even deride and attack them. The words of Christ do not abide in those who in a way barely touch him [and] do not take firm hold of him. And therefore [these words] will not be a benefit for those people but a witness [against them]. And because [the words] are in them in such a way that they do not abide in them, for this reason [those people] are bound by them so that they may be judged in accordance with them.
