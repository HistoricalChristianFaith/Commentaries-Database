But "cursed is he that puts his trust in man." [Jeremiah 17:5] You are ashamed, because your hope has deceived you; your hope that was set on a lie. For "every man is a liar."  But if you dost place your hopes on your God, you are not made "ashamed." For He in whom you have put your trust, cannot be deceived.  Whence also the man whom we mentioned just above, the now "strengthened" righteous man, when fallen on an evil time, on the day of tribulation, what says he to show that he was not "ashamed"? "We glory in tribulation; knowing that tribulation works patience, and patience experience, and experience hope; but hope makes not ashamed." Whence is it that hope "makes not ashamed"? Because it is placed on God. Therefore follows immediately, "Because the love of God is spread in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given unto us." [Romans 5:3-5] The Holy Spirit has been given to us already: how should He deceive us, of whom we possess such an "earnest" already?
