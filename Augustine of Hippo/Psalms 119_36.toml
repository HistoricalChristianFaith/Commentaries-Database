He next says, "Incline mine heart unto Your testimonies, and not to covetousness" [Psalm 119:36]. This then he prays, that he may profit in the will itself.. ..But the Apostle says, "Avarice is a root of all evils." [1 Timothy 6:10] But in the Greek, whence these words have been rendered into our tongue, the word used by the Apostle is not πλεονεξία, which occurs in this passage of the Psalms; but φιλαργυρία, by which is signified "love of money." But the Apostle must be understood to have meant genus by species when he used this word, that is, to have meant avarice universally and generally by love of money, which is truly the root of all evils. [Genesis 3:5] ...If therefore our heart be not inclined to covetousness, we fear God only for God's sake, so that He is the only reward of our serving Him. Let us love Him in Himself, let us love Him in ourselves, Him in our neighbours whom we love as ourselves, whether they have Him, or in order that they may have Him....
