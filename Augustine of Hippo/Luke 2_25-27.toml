The just Simeon saw him with his heart, because he recognized the infant. He saw him with his eyes, because he took the infant in his arms. Seeing him in both ways, recognizing the Son of God, and cuddling the one begotten of the Virgin, he said, “Now, Lord, you are letting your servant go in peace, since my eyes have seen your salvation.” Notice what he said. You see, he was being kept until he should see with his eyes what he already perceived with faith. He took the baby body, he cradled the body in his arms. On seeing the body, that is, on perceiving the Lord in the flesh, he said, “My eyes have seen your salvation.” How do you know this is not the way in which all flesh is going to see the salvation of God?
