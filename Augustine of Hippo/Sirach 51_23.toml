The Word of God was directed to us. It was proclaimed to exhort us, as the Scripture says: “Receive instruction in the house of instruction.” Instruction is given so as to instruct, and the house of instruction is the church of Christ. Let us ask ourselves the object and purpose of this instruction: who is instructed, and who imparts the instruction. One learns to live well, and the purpose for which he learns to live well is so as to live forever. To this end Christians are taught, and Christ is the one who teaches.
