How, my brethren? When the farmer goes forth with the plough, carrying seed, is not the wind sometimes keen, and does not the shower sometimes deter him? He looks to the sky, sees it lowering, shivers with cold, nevertheless goes forth, and sows. For he fears lest while he is observing the foul weather, and awaiting sunshine, the time may pass away, and he may not find anything to reap. Put not off, my brethren; sow in wintry weather, sow good works, even while you weep; for, "They that sow in tears, shall reap in joy." They sow their seed, good will, and good works. "They went on their way and wept, casting their seed" [Psalm 126:6]. Why did they weep? Because they were among the miserable, and were themselves miserable. It is better, my brethren, that no man should be miserable, than that you should do alms....Nevertheless, as long as there are objects for its exercise, let us not fail amid those troubles to sow our seed. Although we sow in tears, yet shall we reap in joy. For in that resurrection of the dead, each man shall receive his own sheaves, that is, the produce of his seed, the crown of joys and of delight. Then will there be a joyous triumph, when we shall laugh at death, wherein we groaned before: then shall they say to death, "O death, where is your strife? O death, where is your sting?" [1 Corinthians 15:55] But why do they now rejoice? Because "they bring their sheaves with them."

So it is only proper, brothers and sisters, that you should be told these things. Attend to the poor, whether they are lying there or whether they are walking about; attend to the poor, do good works. If you are in the habit of doing so, do so; if you are not in the habit of doing so, do so. Let there be an increase in the number of do-gooders, because there is an increase, certainly, in the number of the faithful. When you do something, you cannot yet see the quantity of the good you do; just as when the countryman sows he cannot yet see the crop, but he trusts the earth. You then, why don’t you trust God? Our harvest is coming. Imagine that we are now toiling away in what we do, toiling away as we work, only to reap the benefit in due course, as it is written: “Going they were going and weeping, casting their seed; but coming they shall come with rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.”

This psalm [126], being sung to the Lord, seems to fit the holy martyrs; but if we are members of Christ, as we ought to be, we can take these words as referring to all of us: “Those who sow in tears shall reap in joy. Going they shall go and weep, casting their seed. But coming they shall come with merrymaking, carrying their sheaves.” Where are they going, and where are they coming from? What are they sowing in tears? What is the seed, what are the sheaves? Going into death, coming from death; going by being born, coming by rising again. Sowing is whatever good we have done; our sheaves, what we shall receive at the end. So if the seed is good, the works are good, why “in tears,” seeing that God loves a cheerful giver?27The first thing to notice, dearly beloved, is how these words above all suit the blessed martyrs. Nobody, after all, has spent as much as those who have spent their very selves, as the apostle Paul says: “And I myself will be spent for your souls.” They spent themselves by confessing Christ and by carrying out with his help the saying “You have sat at a great table; know that you must prepare similar things yourself.” What is the meaning of “know that you must prepare similar things yourself,” if not what the blessed John explains: “Just as Christ laid down his life for us, so we too ought to lay down our lives for the brethren”? There you are, that is how much they spent.

I say this so that we should not nurse hopes of receiving the fruits of our sowing during this time in which we have done the sowing. Here we sow with toil a harvest of good works, but it is in the time to come that we shall garner its fruits with joy, according to what is written: “Going they sent and wept, scattering their seed; but coming they will come with rejoicing, carrying their sheaves.”
