"The beginning," he says, "of Your words is truth; all the judgments of Your righteousness endure for evermore" [Psalm 119:160]. From truth, he says, Your words do proceed, and they are therefore truthful, and deceive no man, for in them life is announced to the righteous, punishment to the ungodly. These are the everlasting judgments of God's righteousness.
