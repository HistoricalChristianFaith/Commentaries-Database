"And that was counted unto him for righteousness among all posterities for evermore" [Psalm 106:31]. God counted this unto His Priest for righteousness, not only as long as posterity shall exist, but "for evermore;" for He who knows the heart, knows how to weigh with how much love for the people that deed was done.
