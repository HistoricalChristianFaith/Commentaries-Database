And the surest sign that you have been taught of God is that you put into practice what you have been taught. Of that character are all who are called according to God’s purpose, as it is written in the prophets, “They shall be all taught of God.” The person, however, who has learned what ought to be done but does not do it, has not yet been “taught of God” according to grace but only according to the law, not according to the Spirit but only according to the letter. There are many who appear to do what the law commands through fear of punishment, not through love of righteousness, and such righteousness as this apostle calls “his own which is after the law”—a thing as it were commanded, not given.… When the free person keeps a commandment, he does it readily. And whosoever learns his duty in this spirit does everything that he has learned ought to be done.
