“Will he go to the Gentiles and teach them?” They did not understand this at all. And yet even their mistake is an unwitting prophecy of our salvation. The Lord would indeed go to the Gentiles, not in his own person, but by his feet. What were his feet? Those which Saul desired to trample upon by persecution when the Head cried out to him, “Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?” … He sent to us those whom he had made his members, and so made us his members.
