De Doctr. Christ., i, 26, 30: But since the Divine substance is more excellent and higher than our nature, the command to love God is distinct from that to love our neighbour. But if by yourself, you understand your whole self, that is both your soul and your body, and in like manner of your neighbour, there is no sort of things to be loved omitted in these commands. The love of God goes first, and the rule thereof is so set out to us as to make all other loves enter in that, so that nothing seems said of loving yourself. But then follows, “Thou shalt love thyneighbour as thyself,” so that love of yourself is not omitted.
