"Day continues according to Your ordinance" [Psalm 119:91]. For all these things are day: "and this is the day which the Lord has made: let us rejoice and be glad in it:"  and "let us walk honestly as in the day." [Romans 13:13] "For all things serve You." He said all things of some: "all" which belong to this day "serve You." For the ungodly of whom it is said, "I have compared your mother unto the night,"  do not serve You.
