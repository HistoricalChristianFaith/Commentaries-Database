Terrified by my sins and the dead weight of my misery, I had turned my problems over in my mind and was half determined to seek refuge in the desert. But you forbade me to do this and gave me strength by saying, "Christ died for us all, so that being alive should no longer mean living with our own life but with his life who died for us." Lord, I cast all my troubles on you and from now on "I shall contemplate the wonders of your law." You know how weak I am and how inadequate is my knowledge: teach me and heal my frailty. Your only Son, "in whom the whole treasury of wisdom and knowledge is stored up," has redeemed me with his blood. "Save me from the scorn of my enemies," for the price of my redemption is always in my thoughts. I eat it and drink it and minister it to others; and as one of the poor I long to be filled with it, to be one of those who "eat and have their fill." And "those who look for the Lord will cry out in praise of him."
