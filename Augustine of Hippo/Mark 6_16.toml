De Con. Even., ii, 43: But in these words Luke bears witness to Mark, to this point at least, that others and not Herod said that John had risen; but Luke had represented Herod as hesitating and has put down his words as if he said, “John have I beheaded, but who is this of whom I hear such things?” Or else these words are to be spoken, so as to indicate that he is still hesitating, particularly as Mark who had said above that others had declared that John had risen from the dead, afterwards however is not silent as to Herod’s plainly saying, “It is John, whom I beheaded: he is risen from the dead.” Which words also may be spoken in two ways, either they may be understood as those of a man affirming or doubting.
