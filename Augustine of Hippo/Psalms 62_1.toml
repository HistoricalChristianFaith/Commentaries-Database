Who endowed him with such patience? Who? Let the psalm tell us. There, after all, we can read, there we can sing, "Shall my soul not be subject to God? For it is from him that my patience comes." Whoever imagines that Saint Vincent was capable of these things by his own powers is making a very big mistake. Those, you see, who are confident they are capable of this by their own powers may seem to overcome by patience but are in fact being overcome by pride.

The title of it is, "Unto the end, in behalf of Idithun, a Psalm to David himself." I recollect that already  to you has been explained what Idithun is....Let us see how far he has leaped over, and whom he has "leaped over," and in what place, though he has leaped over certain men, he is situate, whence as from a kind of spiritual and secure position he may behold what is below....He being set, I say, in a certain fortified place, does say, "Shall not my soul be subject to God?" [Psalm 62:1]. For he had heard, "He that does exalt himself shall be humbled; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted:" [Matthew 23:12] and fearful lest by leaping over he should be proud, not elated by those things which were below, but humble because of Him that was above; to envious men, as it were threatening to him a fall, who were grieved that he had leaped over, he has made answer, "Shall not my soul be subject to God?"..."For from Himself is my salvation."
