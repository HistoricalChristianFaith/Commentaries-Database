But he tells what this joy is when he says, “That they may have my joy fulfilled in themselves.” This has already been elucidated above where he says, “That they may be one, even as we are.” This joy of his that is bestowed on them by him was to be fulfilled, he says, in them. And for that very end he declared that he had spoken in the world. This is that peace and blessedness in the world to come. If we want to attain it, we must live temperately and righteously and godly in the present.
