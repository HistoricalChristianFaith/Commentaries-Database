Some heretics say that the God proclaimed in the Old Testament is not the Father of Christ but a kind of prince of evil angels. … [Jesus] contradicts the heretics when he calls him his Father whom the Jews called their God but did not know. For had they known him, they would have received his Son. However, he adds about himself, “But I know him.” And here too, if people simply judge by outward appearances he might appear arrogant.… But do not guard against arrogance so much so that the truth gets left behind.
