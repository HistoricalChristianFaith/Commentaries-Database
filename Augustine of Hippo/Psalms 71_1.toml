"O God, in You I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting" [Psalm 71:1]. Already I have been confounded, but not for everlasting. For how is he not confounded, to whom is said, "What fruit had ye in these things wherein ye now blush?" [Romans 6:21] What then shall be done, that we may not be confounded for everlasting? "Draw near unto Him, and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not blush."  Confounded you are in Adam, withdraw from Adam, draw near unto Christ, and then you shall not be confounded. "In You I have hoped, O Lord, I shall not be confounded for everlasting." If in myself I am now  confounded, in You I shall not be confounded for everlasting.
