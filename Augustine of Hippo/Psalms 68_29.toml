"From Your Temple in Jerusalem, to You kings shall offer presents" [Psalm 68:29]. Jerusalem, which is our free mother, [Galatians 4:26] because the same also is Your holy Temple: from that Temple then, "to You kings shall offer presents." Whatever kings be understood, whether kings of the earth, or whether those whom "He that is above the heavens distinguishes over the dove silvered;" "to You kings shall offer presents." And what presents are so acceptable as the sacrifices of praise? But there is a noise against this praise, from men bearing the name of Christian, and having diverse opinions.
