"O God, Your way is in the Holy One" [Psalm 77:13]. He is contemplating now the works of the mercy of God around us, out of these he is babbling, and in these affections he is exulting. At first he is beginning from thence, "Your way is in the Holy One?" What is that way of Yours which is in the Holy One? "I am," He says, "the Way, the Truth, and the Life." [John 14:6] Return therefore, you men, from your affections...."Who is a great God, like our God?"  Gentiles have their affections regarding their gods, they adore idols, they have eyes and they see not; ears they have and they hear not; feet they have and they walk not. Why do you walk to a God that walks not? I do not, he says, worship such things, and what do you worship? The divinity which is there.  You      then worship that whereof has been said elsewhere, "for the Gods of the nations are demons."   You      either worship idols, or devils. Neither idols, nor devils, he says. And what do you worship? The stars, sun, moon, those things celestial. How much better Him that has made both things earthly and things celestial. "Who is a great God like our God?"
