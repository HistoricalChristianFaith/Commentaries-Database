Super Gen. c. Man. i. 8: But who was He that had created this faith in him, but only He who now marvelled at it? But even had it come from any other, how should He marvel who know all things future? When the Lords marvels, it is only to teach us what we ought to wonder at; for all these emotions in Him are not signs of passion, but examples of a teacher.
cont. Faust. xxii, 74: He praises his faith, but gives no command to quit his profession of a soldier.
Serm., 62, 4: He says, not ‘all,’ but many; yet these from the east and west; for by these two quarters the whole world is intended.Haymo: Or; From the east shall come they, who pass into the kingdom as soon as they are enlightened; from the west they who have suffered persecution for the faith even unto death. Or, he comes from the east who has served God from a child; he from the west who in decrepit age has turned to God.
As we see Christians called to the heavenly feast, where is the bread of righteousness, the drink of wisdom; so we see the Jews in reprobation. “The children of the kingdom shall be cast into outer darkness,” that is, the Jews, who have received the Law, who observe the types of all things that were to be, yet did not acknowledge the realities when present.
cont. Faust., xvi. 24: Moses set before the people of Israel no other God than the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Christ sets forth the very same God. So that so far was He from seeking to turn that people away from their own God, that He therefore threatened them with the outer darkness, because He saw them turned away from their own God. And in this kingdom He tells them the Gentiles shall sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for no other reason than that they held the faith of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. To these Fathers Christ gives His testimony, not as though they had been converted after death, or had received justification after His passion.
Serm., 62. 3: As the Lord did not enter the centurion’s house with His body, but healed the servant, present in majesty, but absent in body; so He went among the Jews only in the body, but among other nations He was neither born ofa Virgin, nor suffered, nor endured human sufferings, nor did divine wonders; and yet was fulfilled that which was spoken, “A people that I have not knownhath served me, and hath obeyed me by the hearing of the ear.” The Jews behold, yet crucified Him; the world heard, and believed.
