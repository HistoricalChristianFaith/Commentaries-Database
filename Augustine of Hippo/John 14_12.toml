And so he promised that he himself would also do those greater works. Do not let the servant exalt himself above his Lord or the disciple above his Master. He says that they will do greater works than he does himself, but it is all by his doing such works in or by them, and not as if they did them of themselves. And so we have the song that is addressed to him, “I will love you, O Lord, my strength.” But what, then, are those greater works? Was it that their very shadow, as they themselves passed by, that healed the sick? For it is a mightier thing for a shadow, than for the hem of a garment, to possess the power of healing. The one work was done by Christ himself, the other by them. And yet it was he that did both.

But there is still something to excite thought in his doing such greater works by the apostles. For he did not say, as if merely with reference to them, “the works that I do shall you do also. And greater works than these shall you do,” but wishing to be understood as speaking of all that belonged to his family, he said, “He who believes in me, the works that I do shall he do also. And greater works than these shall he do.” If, then, he who believes shall do such works, he who shall not do them is certainly no believer, just as “He who loves me, keeps my commandments” implies, of course, that whoever does not keep them does not love.… In a similar way, also, it is said here, “He who believes in me shall do such works.” The one who does not do good works, therefore, is no believer. What have we here, then, brothers? Is it that one is not to be counted among believers in Christ who will not do greater works than Christ? It would be hard, unreasonable, intolerable to suppose so, that is, unless it is rightly understood. Let us listen, then, to the apostle when he says, “To him who believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.” This is the work in which we may be doing the works of Christ, for even our very believing in Christ is the work of Christ.
