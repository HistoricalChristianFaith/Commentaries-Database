"They told, in order that they might hide traps: they said, Who shall see them?" [Psalm 64:5]. They thought they would escape Him, whom they were killing, that they would escape God. Behold, suppose Christ was a man, like the rest of men, and knew not what was being contrived for Him: does God also know not? O heart of man! Wherefore have you said to yourself, Who sees me? When He sees that has made you? "They said, Who shall see them?"  God did see, Christ also was seeing: because Christ is also God. But wherefore did they think that He saw not? Hear the words following.
