"Let all the seed of Israel fear Him." Let all who have been born to a new life, and restored to the vision of God "fear Him." "Since He has not despised, nor disregarded the prayer of the poor man" [Psalm 22:24]. Since He has not despised the prayer, not of him who, crying unto God in the words of sins was loath to overpass a vain life, but the prayer of the poor man, not swollen up with transitory pomps. "Nor has He turned away His face from Me." As from him who said, I will cry unto You, but You will not hear. "And when I cried unto Him He heard Me."
