This act is done literally by many when they receive one another in hospitality.… For it is unquestionably better that it should be done with the hands and that the Christian does not disdain to do what Christ did. For when the body is bent at the feet of a brother, the feeling of humility is made to rise in the heart, or, if it is already there, it is confirmed. But besides this moral meaning … is not a brother able to change a brother from the pollution of sin?… Let us confess our faults one to another, forgive one another’s faults and pray for one another’s faults. … In this way we shall wash one another’s feet.
