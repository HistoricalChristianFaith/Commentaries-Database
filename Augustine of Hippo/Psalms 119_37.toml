The next words in the Psalm which we have undertaken to expound are, "O turn away my eyes, lest they behold vanity: and quicken Thou me in Your way" [Psalm 119:37]. Vanity and truth are directly contrary to one another. The desires of this world are vanity: but Christ, who frees us from the world, is truth. He is the way, too, wherein this man wishes to be quickened, for He is also the life: "I am the way, the truth, and the life," [JohnÂ 14:6] are His own words.
