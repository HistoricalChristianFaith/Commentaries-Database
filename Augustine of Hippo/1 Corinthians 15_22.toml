This does not mean that all who die in Adam will be members of Christ, since the majority will be punished in eternity by a second death. The apostle uses the word all in both clauses because as no one dies in a natural body except in Adam, so no one is made to live again in a spiritual body, except in Christ.

Man indeed brought death to himself and to the Son of Man. But the Son of Man, by dying and rising again, brought life to man.

No human enters into death except through Adam and no one into eternal life except through Christ. This is the meaning of that repeated phrase all, because as all men belong to Adam through their first or carnal birth, so all men who belong to Christ come to the second or spiritual birth. Therefore he says “all” in both places because as all who die die only in Adam, so all who will be made alive will not be made alive except in Christ.

Notice how he emphasizes “one” and “one,” that is Adam and Christ, the former for condemnation, the latter for justification.… Obviously he is speaking of the resurrection of the just where there is life eternal, not of the resurrection of the wicked where there will be eternal death. Those who “shall be made alive” are contrasted with the others who will be damned.

We commonly say that all enter a certain house through one door, not because all humanity enters that house but because no one enters except through that door. It is in this sense that as all die in Adam so do all those who live live in Christ.… Aside from the one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus, there is no other name under heaven whereby we must be saved.
