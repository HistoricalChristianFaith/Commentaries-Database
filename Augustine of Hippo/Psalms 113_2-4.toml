Now follows what concerns us: In the holy church. The holy church is what we are; but I do not mean “we” in the sense of just those of us who are here, you who are listening to me now; as many of us are by the grace of God Christian believers in this church, that is in this city, as many as there are in this region, as many as there are in this province, as many as there are also across the sea, as many as there are in the whole wide world, since “from the rising of the sun to its setting the name of the Lord is praised.” Such is the catholic church, our true mother, the true consort of that bridegroom.
