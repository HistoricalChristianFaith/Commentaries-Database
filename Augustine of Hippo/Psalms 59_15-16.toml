"They shall be scattered abroad in order that they may eat" [Psalm 59:15]; that is, in order that they may gain others, in order that into their Body they may change believers. "But if they shall not be filled, they shall murmur." Because above also he had spoken of the murmur of them, saying, "For who has heard?" "And You, O Lord," he says, "shall deride them, saying, Who has heard?"  Wherefore? Because, as nothing You shall count all nations. Let the Psalm be concluded. See ye the Corner [EphesiansÂ 2:20] exulting, now with both walls rejoicing. The Jews were proud, humbled they have been; Gentiles were despairing, raised up they have been: let them come to the Corner, there let them meet, there run together, there find the kiss of peace; from different parts let them come, but with differing not come, those of Circumcision, these of uncircumcision. Far apart were the walls, but before that to the Corner they came: but in the Corner let them hold themselves, and now let the whole Church from both walls, say what? "But I will sing of Your power, and I will exult in the morning of Your mercy" [Psalm 59:16]. In the morning when temptations have been overcome, in the morning when the night of this world shall have passed away; in the morning when no longer the lyings in wait of robbers and of the devil and of his angels we dread, in the morning when no longer by the lamp of prophecy we walk, but Himself the Word of God as it were a Sun we contemplate. "And I will exult in the morning of Your mercy." With reason in another Psalm is said, "In the morning I will stand by You, and I will meditate."  With reason also of the Lord Himself the Resurrection was at dawn, that there should be fulfilled that which has been said in another Psalm, "In the evening shall tarry weeping and in the morning exultation."  For at even the disciples mourned our Lord Jesus Christ as dead, at dawn at Him rising again they exulted. "For You have become my taker up, and my refuge in the day of my tribulation."
