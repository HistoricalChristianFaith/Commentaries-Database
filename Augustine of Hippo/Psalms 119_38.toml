"O establish Your word in Your servant, that I may fear You" [Psalm 119:38]. And what else is this than, Grant unto me that I may do according to what You say? For the word of God is not established in those who remove it in themselves by acting contrary to it; but it is established in those in whom it is immoveable. God therefore establishes His word, that they may fear Him, in those unto whom He gives the spirit of the fear of Him; not that fear of which the Apostle says, "You have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear;" [Romans 8:15] for "perfect love casts out" this "fear," [1 John 4:18] but that fear which the Prophet calls "the spirit of the fear of the Lord;" [Isaiah 11:2] that fear which "is pure, and endures for ever;"  that fear which fears to offend Him whom it loves.
