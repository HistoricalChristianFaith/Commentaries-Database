What is it that was said? “The two will be one flesh. This is a great sacrament, but I am speaking of Christ and the church.” … So that you may realize that these are in some sense two persons and yet again are one by the union of marriage, he speaks as one in Isaiah: “He has bound a headband on me like a bridegroom and clothed me with an ornament like a bride.” He called himself a bridegroom as the head, the bride as the body. So he speaks as one; let us hear him and let us also speak in him. May we be in his members, so that his voice can be ours also.
