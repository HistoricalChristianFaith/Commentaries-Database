"Blessed is the man that has not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly" [Psalm 1:1]. This is to be understood of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord Man.  "Blessed is the man that has not gone away in the counsel of the ungodly," as "the man of earth did," [1 Corinthians 15:47] who consented to his wife deceived by the serpent, to the transgressing the commandment of God. "Nor stood in the way of sinners." For He came indeed in the way of sinners, by being born as sinners are; but He "stood" not therein, for that the enticements of the world held Him not. "And has not sat in the seat of pestilence." He willed not an earthly kingdom, with pride, which is well taken for "the seat of pestilence;" for that there is hardly any one who is free from the love of rule, and craves not human glory. For a "pestilence" is disease widely spread, and involving all or nearly all. Yet "the seat of pestilence" may be more appropriately understood of hurtful doctrine; "whose word spreads as a canker." [2 Timothy 2:17] The order too of the words must be considered: "went away, stood, sat." For he "went away," when he drew back from God. He "stood," when he took pleasure in sin. He "sat," when, confirmed in his pride, he could not go back, unless set free by Him, who neither "has gone away in the counsel of the ungodly, nor stood in the way of sinners, nor sat in the seat of pestilence."
