If God does not punish the sinner, what about the prophecy, “If the just person scarcely will be saved, where will the impious and the sinner appear?” And elsewhere: “Truly the wicked shall perish”;91 and again: “Let sinners be consumed out of the earth, and the unjust, so that they be no more”; and finally: “As smoke vanishes, so let them vanish away: as wax melts before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of God.” In these passages it is not so much the incredulous and the unfaithful whom I hear condemned, but the sinners. In a certain passage I read that our Savior said, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.” Yet, those people believed in Christ and even called him Lord. Nevertheless, on that account alone the gate of the heavenly kingdom is not opened to them, because by their deeds they deny him whom they praise with their lips. Moreover, the apostle asserts that God is denied by deeds no less than by words: “They profess to know God, but by their works they disown him.” And the Lord himself says in the Gospel, “Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out devils in your name and work many miracles in your name?’ And then I will declare to them, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, all you workers of iniquity.’ ” It is related that they were so strong in their faith that they worked miracles in the name of the Lord; nevertheless, their faith will not profit them, because they have not performed works of justice. So, if faith alone suffices, why are they eternally confined with the minions of Satan in the flames of hell, since they are condemned not because of unbelief but because they did nothing good, as is written: “And the king will say to those on his left hand, ‘Depart from me, accursed ones, into the everlasting fire that my Father prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat,’ ” etc.? He did not say “because you have not believed in me.” Hence, we may conclude that they were condemned for lack of good works, not because of unbelief.
