Why, then, if the law is good, is it called a “ministry of death”? Because “sin, that it might be shown to be sin, worked death for me through that which is good.” Do not marvel when it is said of the preaching of the gospel, “We are a sweet aroma of Christ to God, in them that are being saved and in them who perish, to the one an aroma of life to life, to the other an aroma of death to death.” Now the law is called a “ministry of death” to the Jews, for whom it was written on stone, to symbolize their hardness of heart. But this does not apply to those who fulfill the law in charity. For charity is the fulfillment of the law.
