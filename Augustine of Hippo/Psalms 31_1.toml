"In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me not be put to confusion for ever" [Psalm 31:1]. In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me never be confounded, while they shall insult Me as one like other men. "In Your righteousness rescue Me, and deliver Me." And in Your righteousness rescue Me from the pit of death, and deliver Me out of their company.
