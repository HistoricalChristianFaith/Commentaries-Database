"In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me not be put to confusion for ever" [Psalm 31:1]. In You, O Lord, have I trusted, let Me never be confounded, while they shall insult Me as one like other men. "In Your righteousness rescue Me, and deliver Me." And in Your righteousness rescue Me from the pit of death, and deliver Me out of their company.

1. To the end a Psalm of David Himself, the Mediator strong of hand in persecutions. For the word ecstasy, which is added to the title, signifies a transport of the mind, which is produced either by a panic, or by some revelation. But in this Psalm the panic of the people of God troubled by the persecution of all the heathen, and by the failing of faith throughout the world, is principally seen. But first the Mediator Himself speaks: then the People redeemed by His Blood gives thanks: at last in trouble it speaks at length, which is what belongs to the ecstasy; but the Person of the Prophet himself is twice interposed, near the end, and at the end.
