There isn’t anyone, after all, who doesn’t love himself. But we have to look for the right sort of love and avoid the wrong sort. You see, anyone who loves himself by leaving God out of his life and leaves God out of his life by loving himself, doesn’t even remain in himself but goes away from himself.… Listen to the apostle giving his support to this understanding of the matter. “In the last days,” he says, “dangerous times will loom up.” What are the dangerous times? “There will be people loving themselves.” That’s the core of the evil. So let’s see if they remain in themselves by loving themselves; let’s see, let’s hear what comes next: “There will be people, he says, loving themselves, lovers of money.” Where are you now, you that were busy loving yourself? Obviously, you’re outside. Are you, I’m asking you, are you money? Obviously, after loving yourself by neglecting God, by loving money you have even abandoned yourself.

Since I have already given an example of love [amor] used in a good sense, someone may want an example of the same word used in a bad sense. If so, let him read the text, “Men will be lovers [amantes] of self, covetous [amatores pecuniae].”
