"Unto You, O Lord, have I cried;  My God, be not silent from me" [Psalm 28:1]. Unto You, O Lord, have I cried; My God, separate not the unity of Your Word from that which as Man I am. "Lest at any time Thou be silent from me: and I shall be like them that go down into the pit." For from this, that the Eternity of Your Word ceases not to unite Itself to Me, it comes that I am not such a man as the rest of men, who are born into the deep misery of this world: where, as if You are silent, Your Word is not recognised. "Hear, O Lord, the voice of my supplication, whist I pray unto You, while I hold up my hands to Your holy temple" [Psalm 28:2]. Whilst I am crucified for their salvation, who on believing become Your holy temple.
