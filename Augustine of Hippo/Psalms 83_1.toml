The people of God, then, in this Psalm says, "O God, who shall be like You?" [Psalm 83:1]. Which I suppose to be more fitly taken of Christ, because, being made in the likeness of men, [Philippians 2:7] He was thought by those by whom He was despised to be comparable to other men: for He was even "reckoned among the unrighteous," [Isaiah 53:12] but for this purpose, that He might be judged. But when He shall come to judge, then shall be done what is here said, "O God, who is like You?" For if the Psalms did not use to speak to the Lord Christ, that too would not be spoken which not one of the faithful can doubt was spoken unto Christ. "Your throne, O God, is for ever and ever, a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of Your kingdom."  To him therefore also now it is said, "O God, who shall be like You?" For unto many  You vouchsafed to be likened in Your humiliation, even so far as to the robbers that were crucified with You: but when in glory You shall come, "who shall be like You?"...

So let them keep quiet, let them now see that the real Hercules is the God to whom the faithful say, "God, who is like you? Do not keep silent, or grow gentle, God." What I had undertaken was to show how "do not grow gentle" means rooting out errors, not people. He does not grow gentle, so he gets angry. But he is God, so he also takes pity. He gets angry, and he takes pity. He gets angry and strikes; he takes pity and heals. He gets angry and does to death; he takes pity and brings to life. In one person he does this. It is not that he does some people to death and brings others to life, but in the same people he is both angry and gentle. He is angry with errors; he is gentle with bad habits put right. "I will strike, and I will heal; I will kill, and I will make alive." One and the same Saul, afterward Paul, he both laid low and raised up. He laid low an unbeliever, he raised up a believer. He both laid low a persecutor, he raised up a preacher.
