But, "understand these things, you that forget God" [Psalm 50:22]. See how He cries, and keeps not silence, spares  not. You had forgotten the Lord,  did not think of your evil life. Perceive how you have forgotten the Lord. "Lest at length He seize like a lion, and there be none to deliver." What is "like a lion"? Like a brave one, like a mighty one, like him whom none can withstand. To this he made reference when he said, "Lion." For it is used for praise, it is used also for showing evil. The devil has been called lion: "Your adversary," He says, "like a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom He may devour." [1 Peter 5:8] May it not be that whereas he has been called lion because of savage fierceness, Christ has been called Lion for wondrous mightiness? And where is that, "The Lion has prevailed of the tribe of Judah?" [Revelation 5:5] ...
