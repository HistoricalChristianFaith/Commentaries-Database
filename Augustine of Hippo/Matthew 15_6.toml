De Cons. Ev., ii, 49: The Evangelist thus constructs the order of his narrative, “Then came unto him,” that, as appeared in the passage over the lake, the order of the events that followed that might be shewn.
cont. Adv. Leg. et Proph., ii, 1: Christ here clearly shows both that that law which the heretic blasphemes is God’s law, and that the Jews had their traditions foreign to the prophetical and canonical books; such as the Apostle calls “profane and vain fables.”.
cont. Faust., xvi, 24: The Lord here teaches us many things; That it was not He that turned the Jews from their God; that not only did He not infringe the commandments, but convicts them of infringing them; and that He had ordained no more than those by the hand of Moses.
Quaest. Ev., i, 16: Otherwise; “The gift whatsoever thou offerest on my account, shall profit thee;” that is to say, Whatsoever gift thou offerest onmy account, shall henceforth remain with thee; the son signifying by these words that there is no longer need that parents should offer for him, as he isof age to offer for himself. And those who were of age to be able to say thus to their parents, the Pharisees denied that they were guilty, if they did notshew honour to their parents.
