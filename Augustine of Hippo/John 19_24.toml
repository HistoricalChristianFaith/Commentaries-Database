That they cast lots for his tunic alone, “woven from the top without seam,” rather than dividing it, demonstrated clearly enough that the visible sacraments, even though they too are the garments of Christ, can still be had by anybody, good or bad. But that sincere and genuine faith, which “works through love” to achieve the integrity of unity—because “the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us”5—that this faith does not belong to anybody at all but is given by God’s hidden grace as by lot. Thus to Simon, who had baptism but did not have this, Peter could say, “You have no lot or part in this faith.”
