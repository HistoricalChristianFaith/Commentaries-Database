"But I am a worm, and no man" [Psalm 22:6]. But I, speaking now not in the person of Adam, but I in My own person, Jesus Christ, was born without human generation in the flesh, that I might be as man beyond men; that so at least human pride might deign to imitate My humility. "The scorn of men, and outcast of the people." In which humility I was made the scorn of men, so as that it should be said, as a reproachful railing, "Be His disciple:" [John 9:28] and that the people despise Me.

Understand your God. That is what he is, this one so great and so small, “a worm and no man,” and yet through him humankind was made.
