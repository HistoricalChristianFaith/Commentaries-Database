But with what profit is this? "O God of virtues turn Thou nevertheless" [Psalm 80:14]. Although these things have been done, "Turn Thou nevertheless." "Look from heaven and see, and visit this vineyard." "And perfect Thou her whom Your right hand has planted" [Psalm 80:15]. No other plant Thou, but this make Thou perfect. For she is the very seed of Abraham, she is the very seed in whom all nations shall be blessed: [Genesis 22:18] there is the root where is borne the graffed wild olive. "Perfect Thou this vineyard which Your right hand has planted." But wherein does He perfect? "And upon the Son of man, whom You have strengthened to Yourself." What can be more evident? Why do ye still expect, that we should still explain to you in discourse, and should we not rather cry out with you in admiration, "Perfect Thou this vineyard which Your right hand has planted, and upon the Son of man" perfect her? What Son of man? Him "whom You have strengthened to Yourself." A mighty stronghold: build as much as you are able. "For other foundation no one is able to lay, except that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus." [1 Corinthians 3:11]
