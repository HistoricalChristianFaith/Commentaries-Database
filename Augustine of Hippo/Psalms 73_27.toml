"Behold, they that put themselves afar from You shall perish" [Psalm 73:27]. He therefore departed from God, but not far: for "I have become as it were a beast," he says, and "I am always with You."  But they have departed afar, because not only things earthly they have desired, but have sought them from demons and the Devil. "They that put themselves afar from You shall perish." And what is it, to become afar from God? "You have destroyed every man that commits fornication away from You." To this fornication is opposed chaste love. What is chaste love? Now the soul does love her Bridegroom: what does she require of Him, from Her Bridegroom whom she loves? Perchance in like manner as women choose for themselves men either as sons-in-law or as bridegrooms: she perchance chooses riches, and loves his gold, and estates, and silver and cattle and horses, and household, and the like. Far be it. He does love Him alone, for nought he does love Him: because in Him he has all things, for "by Him were made all things." [JohnÂ 1:3]
