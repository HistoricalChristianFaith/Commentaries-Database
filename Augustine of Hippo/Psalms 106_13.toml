"They acted hastily: they forgot His works" [Psalm 106:13]: other copies read more intelligibly, "They hastened, they forgot His works, and would not abide His counsel." For they ought to have thought, that so great works of God towards themselves were not without a purpose, but that they invited them to some endless happiness, which was to be waited for with patience; but they hastened to make themselves happy with temporal things, which give no man true happiness, because they do not quench insatiable longing: for "whosoever," says our Lord, "shall drink of this water, shall thirst again." [John 4:4, 13]
