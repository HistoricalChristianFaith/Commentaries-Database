But still, when the ability is given, surely no necessity is imposed. Therefore, although David had received ability to kill Saul, he preferred sparing to striking him. From this, we understand that bad people receive ability for the condemnation of their depraved will, while good people receive ability for the trying of their good will.

Jesus told Pilate, “You would have no power against me,” that is, even the little measure you really have, “except” this very measure, whatever its amount, “were given to you from above.” But knowing as I do its amount, for it is not so great as to render you altogether independent, “therefore he that delivered me unto you has the greater sin.” He, indeed, delivered me to your power at the bidding of envy, while you exercise your power on me through the impulse of fear. And yet not even through the impulse of fear should one person kill another, especially the innocent. Nevertheless to do so by an officious enthusiasm is a much greater evil than under the constraint of fear. And therefore the truth-speaking teacher does not say, “Only the one who delivered me to you has sin,” as if the other had none. Rather, he says that he “has the greater sin,” letting him understand that Pilate himself was not exempt from blame. The sin of the latter is not reduced to nothing because the other sin is greater.
