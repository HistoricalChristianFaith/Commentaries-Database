"Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob" [Psalm 114:7]. What means, "at the presence of the Lord," save at the presence of Him who said, "Lo, I am with you always, even unto the end of the world." [MatthewÂ 28:30] For the earth trembled; but because it had remained slothful, it was made to tremble, so that it might be more firmly fixed at the presence of the Lord.
