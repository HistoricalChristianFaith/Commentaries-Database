"Raising the clouds from the ends of the earth" [Psalm 135:7]. We see these works of God in His creation. For the clouds come from the ends of the earth to the midst thereof, and rain; you scan not whence they arise. Hence the prophet signifies this, from "the ends of the earth," whether it be from the bottom, or from the circumference of the ends of the earth, whencesoever He wills He raises the clouds, only from the earth. "He has made lightnings into rain." For lightnings without rain would frighten you, and bestow nothing on you. "He makes lightnings unto rain." It lightens, and you tremble; it rains, you rejoice. "He has made lightnings unto rain." He who terrified you, Himself causest that you should rejoice. "Who brings the winds out of His treasures," their causes are hidden, you know not whence they come. When the wind blows, you feel it; why it blows, or from what treasure of His wisdom it is brought forth, you know not; [JohnÂ 3:8] yet you owe to God the worship of faith, for it would not blow unless He had bidden who made it, unless He had brought it forth who created it.
