Next he says, "The iniquity of the proud has been multiplied upon me" [Psalm 119:69]: of those, that is, whom it profited not that human nature was humbled after it went wrong. "But I will search Your commandments with my whole heart." Howsoever, he says, iniquity shall abound, love shall not grow cold in me. [Matthew 24:12] He, as it were, says this, who in His sweetness learns the righteousnesses of God. For in proportion as the commandments of Him who aids us are the more sweet, so much the more does he who loves Him search after them, that he may perform them when known, and may learn them by doing them; because they are more perfectly understood when they are performed.
