The man who speaks in this Psalm, as if he were tired of human mutability, whence this life is full of temptations, among his tribulations, on account of which he had above said, "The wicked have persecuted me;"  and, "They have almost made an end of me upon earth"  [Psalm 119:89]; burning with longings for the heavenly Jerusalem; looked up to the realms above, and said, "O Lord, Your word endures for ever in heaven;" that is, among Your Angels who serve everlastingly in Your armies, without desertion.
