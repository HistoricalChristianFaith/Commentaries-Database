Next follows, "His seed shall be mighty upon earth" [Psalm 112:2]. The Apostle witnesses, that the works of mercy are the seed of the future harvest, when he says, "Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap;" [Galatians 6:9] and again, "But this I say, He which sows sparingly, shall reap also sparingly." [2 Corinthians 9:6] But what, brethren, is more mighty than that not only Zacchæus should buy the kingdom of Heaven by the half of his goods, [Luke 19:8] but even the widow for two mites, [Mark 12:42] and that each should possess an equal share there? What is more mighty, than that the same kingdom should be worth treasures to the rich man, and a cup of cold water to the poor?..."Glory and riches shall be in his house" [Psalm 112:3]. For his house is his heart; where, with the praise of God, he lives in greater riches with the hope of eternal life, than with men flattering, in palaces of marble, with splendidly adorned ceilings, with the fear of everlasting death. "For his righteousness endures for ever:" this is his glory, there are his riches. While the other's purple, and fine linen, and grand banquets, even when present, are passing away; and when they have come to an end, the burning tongue shall cry out, longing for a drop of water from the finger's end. [Luke 16:24]
