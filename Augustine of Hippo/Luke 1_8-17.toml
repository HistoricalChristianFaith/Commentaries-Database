The angel Gabriel came to Zechariah, not to Elizabeth. Why? Because it was through Zechariah that John was going to be in Elizabeth. The angel, in announcing that John was going to come by being born, went not to the receptacle of the womb but to the source of the seed. He announced they would both have a son, but he made the announcement to the father. John, after all, was going to come from the marriage of male and female. And once more the same Gabriel came to Mary - not to Joseph. The angel came to the one from whom that flesh was to begin, from whom it was to take its starting point.

The priest was offering sacrifice on behalf of the people. The people were expecting the Christ. John was the one who would announce the Christ.
