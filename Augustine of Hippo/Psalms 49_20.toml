But wherefore this? What he has written in the middle of the Psalm,  the same also he has writ at the end: "Man, though he was in honour, understood not, was compared to the beasts without sense, and was made like to them" [Psalm 49:20]. But you, brethren, consider that you be men made after the image and likeness of God. The image [Genesis 1:26] of God is within, is not in the body; is not in these ears which you see, and eyes, and nostrils, and palate, and hands, and feet; but is made nevertheless:  wherein is the intellect, wherein is the mind, wherein the power of discovering truth, wherein is faith, wherein is your hope, wherein your charity, there God has His Image: there at least ye perceive and see that these things pass away; for so he has said in another Psalm, "Though man walks in an image, yet he is disquieted in vain: he heaps up treasures, and knows not for whom he shall gather them."  Be not disquieted, for of whatsoever kind these things be, they are transitory, if you are men who being in honour understand. For if being men in honour ye understand not, you are compared to the beasts without sense, and are made like to them.
