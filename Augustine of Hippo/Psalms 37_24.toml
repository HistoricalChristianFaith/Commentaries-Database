"Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down; for the Lord upholds his hand" [Psalm 37:24]. See what it is "to delight in" Christ's "way." Should it happen that he suffers some tribulation; some forfeiture of honour, some affliction, some loss, some contumely, or all those other accidents incident to mankind frequently in this life, he sets the Lord before him, what kind of trials He endured! And, "though he fall he shall not be utterly cast down, for the Lord upholds his hand," because He has suffered before him. For what should you fear, O man, whose steps are ordered so, that you should "delight in the way of the Lord"? What should you fear? Pain? Christ was scourged. Should thou fear contumelies? He was reproached with, "You have a devil,"  who was Himself casting out the devils. Haply you fear faction, and the conspiracy of the wicked. Conspiracy was made against Him. You can not make clear the purity of your conscience in some accusation, and sufferest wrong and violence, because false witnesses are listened to against you. False witness was borne against Him first, not only before His death, but also after His resurrection....
