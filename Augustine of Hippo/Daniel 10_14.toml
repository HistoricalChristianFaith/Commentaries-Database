The Greek version has a more concise expression for “give me understanding,” sunetison me, expressing “give understanding” by the single word sunetison, which the Latin cannot do; as if one could not say, “Heal me,” and it were necessary to say, “Give me health,” as it is here said, “Give me understanding”; or “Make me whole,” as here it may be said, “Make me intelligent.” This indeed an angel could do, for he said to Daniel, “I come to give you understanding”; and this word is in the Greek, as it is here also, sunetisai se; as if the Latin translator were to render therapeusai se by sanitatem dare tibi. For the Latin interpreter would not make a circumlocution by saying, to give you understanding, if, as we say from health, “to heal you,” so one could say from intellect, “to intellectuate you.” But if an angel could do this, what reason is there that this man should pray that this be done for him by God? Is it because God had commanded the angel to do it? Just so: for Christ is understood to have given this command to the angel.
