We are then truly free when God ordered our lives, that is, formed and created us not as individuals—this he has already done—but also as good people, which he is now doing by his grace, that we may indeed be new creatures in Christ Jesus. Accordingly, the prayer “Create in me a clean heart, O God.” This does not mean, as far as the natural human heart is concerned, that God has not already created this.

So then Rome, the head of the nations, has these two lights of the nations lit by the one who enlightens every person who comes into this world47—one light in which God has exalted the most abject lowliness, the other in which he cured the wickedness that deserved to be condemned. With the former let us learn not to be proud, with the latter not to despair. How simply these great examples have been set before us, and how salutary they are! Let us always commemorate them and in praising them glorify that true light. So none of us should get a swollen head about having a high position in the world; Peter was a fisherman. None of us, reflecting on our own iniquity, should run away from God’s mercy; Paul was a persecutor. The former says, “The Lord has become the refuge of the poor”;49 the latter says, “Let me teach the wicked your ways, and the godless will be converted to you.”
