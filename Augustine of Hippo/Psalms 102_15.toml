"The heathen shall fear Your Name, O Lord; and all the kings of the earth Your Majesty" [Psalm 102:15]. Now that You have pitied Sion, now that Your servants have taken pleasure in her stones, by acknowledging the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets; now that they have pitied her dust; so that man is formed, or rather re-formed, in life out of dust; hence preaching has increased among the heathen: let the heathen fear Your Name, let another wall approach also from the heathen, let the Corner Stone [EphesiansÂ 2:20] be recognised, let the two who come from different regions, but who no longer differ in belief, meet in close union.
