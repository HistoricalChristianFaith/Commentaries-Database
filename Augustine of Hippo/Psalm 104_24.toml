"O Lord, how great are made Your works!" [Psalm 104:24]. Justly great, justly sublime! Where were those works made, that are so great? What was that station where God stood, or that seat whereupon He sat, when He did those works? What was the place where He worked thus? Whence did those so beautiful works proceed at the first? To take it word for word, every ordained creation, running by ordinance, beautiful by ordinance, rising by ordinance, setting by ordinance, going through all seasons by ordinance, whence has it proceeded? Whence has the Church herself received her rise, her growth, her perfection? In what manner is she destined to a consummation in immortality? With what heralding is she preached? By what mysteries is she recommended? By what types is she concealed? By what preaching is she revealed? Where has God done these things? I see great works. "How great are made Your works, O Lord!" I ask where He has made them: I find not the place: but I see what follows: "In Wisdom have You made them all." All therefore You have made in Christ...."The earth is full of Your creation." The earth is full of the creation of Christ. And how so? We discern how: for what was not made by the Father through the Son? Whatever walks and does crawl on earth, whatever does swim in the waters, whatever flies in the air, whatever does revolve in heaven, how much more then the earth, the whole universe, is the work of God. But he seems to me to speak here of some new creation, of which the Apostle says, "If any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new. And all things are of God." [2 Corinthians 5:17-18] All who believe in Christ, who put off the old man, and put on the new, [Ephesians 4:22-24] are a new creature. "The earth is full of Your works." On one spot of the earth He was crucified, in one small spot that seed fell into the earth, and died; but brought forth great fruit....
