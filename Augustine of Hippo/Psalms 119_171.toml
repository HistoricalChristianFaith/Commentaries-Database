"My lips shall burst forth praise: when You have taught me Your righteousnesses" [Psalm 119:171]. We know how God teaches those who are docile unto God. For every one who has heard from the Father and has learned, comes unto Him "who justifies the ungodly:"  so that he may keep the righteousnesses of God not only by retaining them in his memory, but also by doing them. Thus does he who glories, glory not in himself, but in the Lord, [1 Corinthians 1:31] and burst forth praise.
