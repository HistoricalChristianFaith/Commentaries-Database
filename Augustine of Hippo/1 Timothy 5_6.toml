But there is a kind of death that the apostle detests when he says of the widow, “But she that lives in pleasures is dead while she is living.” Hence, the soul which was impious but has now become pious is said to have come back to life from the dead and to live on account of justification by faith. The body, on the contrary, is not only said to be about to die on account of the departure of the soul, which will come to pass, but, in a certain number of passages, it is even spoken of as already dead on account of the great weakness of flesh and blood, as where the apostle says, “The body, it is true, is dead on account of sin, the spirit is life on account of justice.”
