How have you come? You have come by believing, but you have not yet come through to the end. We are still on the road. We have come, but we have not yet come through. “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice before him with trembling, in case the Lord might be angry and you perish from the way of justice.” When you arrogate to yourself the discovery of the way of justice, be afraid of perishing from the way of justice through this very arrogance. “I have come,” he says, “I have come of my own accord, I have come of my own free will.” Why such consternation? Do you want to hear that even this much has been bestowed on you as well? Listen to him calling: “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.”

Let no man say, I come of myself; I believe of myself. There is no man that comes, unless he be drawn. Whom He draws, and whom He draws not, why He draws one and draws not another, presume not to decide, if thou wouldest not err. Take once for all, and understand: Art thou not yet drawn? Pray that thou mayest be drawn. What do we say here, brethren? If we be drawn to Christ, then we believe unwillingly; therefore violence is employed, not the will moved. A man may enter the church unwillingly, approach the altar unwillingly, receive the sacrament unwillingly: but he cannot believe, unless willingly. If we believed with the body, one might believe against his will: but to believe is not a thing done with the body. Hearken to the apostle: "With the heart man believeth unto righteousness." And what follows? "And with the mouth confession is made unto salvation." This confession springs from the root of the heart. Sometimes thou hearest a man confessing, and knowest not whether he believeth. But thou oughtest not to call him one confessing, whom thou thinkest not believing. For to confess is to utter that which thou hast in thy heart: if thou hast one thing in the heart and utterest another, thou speakest, thou dost not confess. Since then with the heart a man believeth, which no man does against his will, and, since he that is drawn seems to be driven as if unwilling, how do we solve this question, "No man cometh unto me, except the Father who hath sent me draw him"?

If he be drawn unwillingly, saith one, he believeth not; and if he believe not, neither comes he. We run not on our feet, but on our affections: we run not by the steps of our body, but by the acts of our will. Hence, in a sense, "He that cleaves to a harlot becomes one body." The apostle does not say, One body he becomes by running; but one body "by cleaving." This then the Lord also requires, that thou cleave to Him; and therefore He makes use of no carnal motions, but of that drawing. And this is what He means, "No man comes to me, except the Father, who hath sent me, draw him."

Do not think that thou art drawn against thy will: the mind is also drawn by love. Neither ought we to fear, lest we be justly blamed by men who weigh words, but are far removed from the understanding of things, especially divine things, and should perchance say to us, How can I believe by will, if I am drawn? I say, it is not enough that thou art drawn by the will; thou art also drawn by delight. What is it to be drawn by delight? "Delight thyself in the Lord, and He shall give thee the desires of thy heart." There is a certain delight of the heart, to which that bread of heaven is sweet. Further, if the poet could say, "Every man is drawn by his own delight,"-not necessity, but delight; not obligation, but pleasure,-how much more strongly ought we to say that a man is drawn to Christ, who is delighted with truth, delighted with blessedness, delighted with justice, delighted with everlasting life, all which Christ is?

Show me one that loves, and he feels what I say. Show me one that longs, one that hungers, one that travels in this wilderness, and thirsts and pants after the fountain of his eternal home; show such, and he knows what I say. But if I speak to the cold and indifferent, he knows not what I say. How do we prove this, brethren? If we are drawn to Christ unwillingly, then we believe unwillingly: the result is violence, not willingness. A man may enter the church without wanting to, he may approach the altar without wanting to, he may receive the sacrament without wanting to; but he cannot believe, unless he wants to.
