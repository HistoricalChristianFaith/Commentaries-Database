How have you come? You have come by believing, but you have not yet come through to the end. We are still on the road. We have come, but we have not yet come through. “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice before him with trembling, in case the Lord might be angry and you perish from the way of justice.” When you arrogate to yourself the discovery of the way of justice, be afraid of perishing from the way of justice through this very arrogance. “I have come,” he says, “I have come of my own accord, I have come of my own free will.” Why such consternation? Do you want to hear that even this much has been bestowed on you as well? Listen to him calling: “No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him.”
