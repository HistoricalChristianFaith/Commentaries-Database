But tell us the other thing you were saying you were going to tell us. “The prophet,” says he, “says God ‘will come from Afric,’ and now of course where the Afric is, there is Africa.” Well, there’s a fine testimony for you! God will come from the Afric, and from Africa God will come. The heretics are announcing another Christ who is born in Africa and goes through the world. I’m asking what it means, God will come from Africa. If you said, “God has only remained in Africa,” you would certainly be saying something shameful enough. But now you also say, “He will come from Africa.” We know where Christ was born, where he suffered, where he ascended into heaven, where he sent his disciples from, where he filled them with the Holy Spirit, where he instructed them to evangelize the whole world, and they complied, and the world is filled with the gospel. And you say, “God will come from Africa!” …So how does he come from “the shady mountain”? Read the Gospel once more: it was from the Mount of Olives that Christ ascended into heaven. Continue. And what could be clearer? You hear “from the Afric”; you have heard “from the shady mountain.” We recite the law, we recite the Gospel; you have heard “beginning from Jerusalem”; now hear “throughout all the nations.” In the same prophet continue with those words that you ignored, those words you left out.… “God will come from the Afric, and the Holy One from the shady mountain,” that is, from the Mount of Olives, where he ascended into heaven, where he sent his disciples from, where he also said as he was about to ascend, “It is not for you to know the times which the Father has placed in his own power; but you will receive might from on high, and you will be witness to me … in Jerusalem, and in Judea and in Samaria, and as far as the whole earth.”

Where we recognize Christ in what is written: “God will come from the south and the holy one from the shady mountain; his strength will cover the heavens,” there we recognize the church in what follows: “And the earth is full of his praise.” Jerusalem was settled from Africa, as we read in the book of Joshua, son of Nun; from there the name of Christ was spread abroad; there is the shady mountain, the Mount of Olives, from which he ascended into heaven, so that his strength might cover the heavens and the church might be filled through all the earth with his praise.
