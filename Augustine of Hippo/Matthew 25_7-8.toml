Of what cry are we speaking? That of which the apostle says, “In the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump? For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed”? And so when the cry was made at midnight, “Behold, the bridegroom comes!” what follows? “Then all those maidens arose.” But who are “all those” who arose? “The hour will come,” said the Lord himself, “when all that are in the graves shall hear his voice and shall come forth.” Therefore at the last trumpet they all arose. “When the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them; but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps.”

Note then, beloved, that before those virgins slept, it is not said that their lamps were extinguished. The lamps of the wise virgins burned with an inward oil, with the assurance of a good conscience, with an inner glory, with an inmost charity. Yet the lamps of the foolish virgins were also still burning. In what way were they burning? They burned because there was no lack of praise among human onlookers. But after that they arose, that is, in the resurrection from the dead. They began to trim their lamps, that is, began to prepare to render to God an account of their works. And because there is then no human beholder to praise them, all persons are wholly employed in their own cause. There is no one then who is not thinking of self. Therefore there were none to sell them oil.

So their lamps began to fail, and the foolish plead with the five wise, “Give us of your oil, for our lamps are going out.” They sought for what they had been most prone to seek for, to shine, that is, with others’ oil, to walk after others’ praises.
