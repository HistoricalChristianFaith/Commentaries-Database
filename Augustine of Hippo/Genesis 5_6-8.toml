Now notice that when the inspired writer sets forth the length of the lives of the men he mentions, the narrative always ends with the formula “and he begot sons and daughters, and all the time that so and so lived were so many years, and he died.” Considering that these sons and daughters are not named and remembering how long people lived in that first period of our history, can anyone refuse to believe that so great a multitude of men was born as to have been able, in groups, to build a great number of cities?
