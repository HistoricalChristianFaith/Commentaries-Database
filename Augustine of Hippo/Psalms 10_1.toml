"Why, O Lord," says he, "have You withdrawn afar off?" Then he who thus inquired, as if all on a sudden he understood, or as if he asked, though he knew, that he might teach, adds, "You despise in due seasons, in tribulations:" that is, You despise seasonably, and causest tribulations to inflame men's minds with longing for Your coming. For that fountain of life is sweeter to them that have much thirst.
