“I pray not,” he adds, “that you should take them out of the world but that you should keep them from the evil.” For they still thought it was necessary to be in the world, although they were no longer of it. Then he repeats the same statement: “They are not of the world, even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them in the truth.” For they are kept from the evil, as he had previously prayed that they might be. But it may be inquired how they were no longer of the world if they were not yet sanctified in the truth. Or, if they already were, why does he request that they should be sanctified? Isn’t it because even those who are sanctified still continue to make progress in the same sanctification and grow in holiness? And they do not do so without the aid of God’s grace but by his sanctifying of their progress, even as he sanctified them at the outset [of their sanctification].
