Through such glorious deeds of the holy martyrs, with which the church blossoms everywhere, we prove with our own eyes how true what we have just been singing is, that “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints”; seeing that it is precious both in our sight and in the sight of him for the sake of whose name it was undertaken. But the price of these deaths is the death of one man. How many deaths were bought by one dying man, who was the grain of wheat that would not have been multiplied if he had not died! You heard his words when he was drawing near to his passion, that is, when he was drawing near to our redemption: “Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.”On the cross, you see, he transacted a grand exchange; it was there that the purse containing our price was untied; when his side was laid open by the lance of the executioner, there poured out from it the price of the whole wide world. The faithful were bought and the martyrs; but the faith of the martyrs has been proved; blood is the witness to it. They have paid back what was spent for them, and they have fulfilled what John says: “Just as Christ laid down his life for us, so we too should lay down our lives for the brothers.” And in another place it says, “You have sat down at a great table; consider carefully what is set before you, since it behooves you to prepare the same kind of things yourself.” It is certainly a great table, where the lord of the table is himself the banquet. Nobody feeds his guests on himself; that is what the Lord Christ did, being himself the host, himself the food and drink. So the martyrs recognized what they ate and drank, so that they could give back the same kind of thing.

The Lord, though, bears striking witness to his witnesses [martyrs], when after stiffening their hearts for the struggle, he does not abandon their bodies once they are dead, like the outstanding miracle he performed over the body of blessed Vincent. The enemy desired and took all necessary steps to ensure that the body should completely disappear; but a divine sign gave its whereabouts away and revealed it for religious burial and veneration so promptly that it would continue as a lasting memorial to the victory of piety and impiety’s defeat. Indeed, “how precious in the sight of the Lord must be the death of his saints,” when not even the earth of the flesh is ignored after the life has gone out of it; and when, as the invisible soul withdraws from its visible home, this dwelling of his servant is preserved by the Lord’s care and honored for the Lord’s glory by his faithful fellow servants.

So Vincent vanquished Dacian while he lived; he vanquished him also when he was dead. Living he trampled on the torments, dead he swam across the sea. But the one who guided and steered the lifeless corpse through the waves was the same one who had granted him an invincible spirit among the torturer’s iron claws. The torturer’s flames did not intimidate his heart, the waters of the sea did not sink his body. But all these things occurred just to show that “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” To this glory may the Lord bring us too under his protection, whose is the honor and the empire for ever and ever.

But the truth was revealed to the man who pointed out the things that were discovered. The place, you see, was indicated by preceding signs; and it was discovered to be just as it had been revealed in them. Many people received relics from there, because that was God’s will, and they came as far as here. So both this place and this day is being commended to your graces’91 devotion; each is to be celebrated to the honor of God, whom Stephen confessed. After all, we have not built an altar in this place to Stephen, but an altar to God from Stephen’s relics. Altars of this kind are pleasing to God. You ask why? Because “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” Those who shed their blood for their Redeemer were redeemed by his blood. He shed his as the redemptive price of their salvation; the martyrs shed theirs as a means of spreading his gospel. They gave him something in exchange, but not from their own resources; their ability to do so, after all, was his gift; and for that to be done that could be done by them was his gift. As a mark of his favor, he proved them with the occasion of their martyrdom. It happened, they suffered, they trampled on the world.

Yet he himself also made precious the blood of his people for whom he gave the price of his blood; for if he did not make precious the blood of his people, it would not be said, “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.” And so also in regard to what Jesus says, “The good shepherd lays down his life for his sheep.” He is not the only one who did this; and yet, if those who did [so] are Christ’s members, he himself alone likewise did this. For he could do [something] without them, but how could they do [anything] without him since he himself said, “Without me you can do nothing”? From this we show, however, what the others also did: because John the apostle himself, who preached this Gospel that you have heard, said in his epistle, “As Christ laid down his life for us, so we, too, ought to lay down our lives for our brothers.” “We ought to,” he said; he who first showed the way made us debtors. Therefore in a certain place it has been written, “If you sit to dine at the table of the ruler, wisely understand what is set before you. And put forth your hand, knowing that you ought to prepare such things.” You know what the table of the ruler is; thereupon is the body and blood of Christ. He who approaches such a table, let him prepare such things. What is, let him prepare such things? “As he laid down his life for us, so we, too, ought,” for edifying the people and defending the faith, “to lay down our lives for our brothers.”

The earth has been filled with the blood of the martyrs as with seed, and from that seed have sprung the crops of the church. They have asserted Christ’s cause more effectively when dead than when they were alive. They assert it today, they preach him today; their tongues are silent, their deeds echo round the world. They were arrested, bound, imprisoned, brought to trial, tortured, burned at the stake, stoned to death, run through, fed to wild beasts. In all their kinds of death they were jeered at as worthless, but “precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.”
