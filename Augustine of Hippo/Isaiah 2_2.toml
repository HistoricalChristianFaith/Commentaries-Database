The central place they are all coming to is Christ; he is at the center, because he is equally related to all; anything placed in the center is common to all.…Approach the mountain, climb up the mountain, and you that climb it, do not go down it. There you will be safe, there you will be protected; Christ is your mountain of refuge. And where is Christ? At the right hand of the Father, since he has ascended into heaven.

It talks of a mountain, and the mountain is veiled to the party of Donatus. …The holy Daniel saw a vision and wrote down what he saw, and he said that he had seen a stone hewn out of a mountain without hands. It is Christ, coming from the nation of the Jews, which was also a mountain, you see, because it has the kingdom.…
What is the mountain over which the heretics stumbled? Listen to Daniel again: “And that stone grew and became a great mountain, such that it filled all the face of the earth.” How right the psalm is to say to Christ the Lord as he rises again, “Be exalted over the heavens, O God, and let your glory be over the whole earth.” What is your glory over the whole earth? Over the whole earth your church, over the whole earth your bride.
