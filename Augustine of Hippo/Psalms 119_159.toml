And he commends himself as differing from them, and says, "Behold, how I have loved Your commandments" [Psalm 119:159]. He says not, I have not denied Your words or testimonies, as the Martyrs were urged to do, and, when they refused, suffered intolerable torments: but he said this wherein is the fruit of all sufferings; for, "if I give up my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing." [1 Corinthians 13:3] The Psalmist, praising this virtue, says, "Behold, how I have loved Your commandments." Then he asks his reward, "O Lord, quicken me, according to Your mercy." These put me to death, do Thou quicken me. But if a reward be asked of mercy, which justice is bound to give; how much greater is that mercy, which enabled him to gain the victory, on account of which the reward was sought for?
