"Who will lead Me down into the city of standing round?" [Psalm 60:9]. What is the city of standing round? If you remember already, I have made mention thereof in another Psalm,  wherein has been said, "And they shall go around the city." For the city of standing round is the compassing around of the Gentiles, which compassing around of the Gentiles in the middle thereof had the one nation of the Jews, worshipping one God: the rest of the compassing around of the Gentiles to idols made supplication, demons they did serve. And mystically it was called the city of standing round; because on all sides the Gentiles had poured themselves around, and had stood around that nation which did worship one God...."Who will lead me down even unto Idum√¶a?"
