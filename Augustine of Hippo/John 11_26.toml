What does this mean? “He who believes in me, though he were dead.” Just as Lazarus is dead, “yet shall he live,” for he is not the God of the dead but of the living. Such was the answer he gave the Jews concerning their fathers, long ago dead, that is, concerning Abraham and Isaac and Jacob: “I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob: He is not the God of the dead but of the living. For all live unto him.” Believe then, and though you were dead, yet shall you live; but if you do not believe, even while you are alive you are dead. Let us prove this also by the fact that if you do not believe, though you live you are dead. To one who was delaying to follow him and saying, “Let me first go and bury my father,” the Lord said, “Let the dead bury their dead. But come and follow me.” There was there a dead man needing to be buried, there were there also dead people to bury the dead: the one was dead in the flesh, the others in soul. And how does death come to the soul? When faith is wanting. How does death come to the body? When the soul is wanting. For faith is the life of the soul.
