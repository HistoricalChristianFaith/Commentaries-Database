"Keep innocency" [Psalm 37:37]; keep it even as you used to keep your purse, when thou were covetous; even as you used to hold fast that purse, that it might not be snatched from your grasp by the thief, even so "keep innocency," lest that be snatched from your grasp by the devil. Be that your sure inheritance, of which the rich and the poor may both be sure. "Keep innocency." What does it profit you to gain gold, and to lose innocence?

"Keep innocency, and take heed unto the thing which is right." Keep thou your eyes "right," that you may see "the thing which is right;" not perverted, wherewith you look upon the wicked; not distorted, so that God should appear to you distorted and wrong, in that He favours the wicked, and afflicts the faithful with persecutions. Do you not observe how distorted your vision is? Set right your eyes, and "behold the thing that is right." What "thing that is right"? Take no heed of things present. And what will you see?

"For there is a remainder for the man that makes peace."  What is meant by "there is a remainder"? When you are dead, you shall not be dead. This is the meaning of "there is a remainder." He will still have something remaining to him, even after this life, that is to say, that "seed," which "shall be blessed." Whence our Lord says, "He that believes in Me, though he die, yet shall he live;" [John 11:25] — "seeing there is a remainder for the man that makes peace."
