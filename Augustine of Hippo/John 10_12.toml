Who then is the hireling? There are some in office in the church, of whom the apostle Paul says, “Who seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.” What does that mean, “who seek their own”? It means those who do not love Christ freely, who do not seek after God for his own sake. It means those who are pursuing temporal advantages, gaping for gain, coveting honors from people. When such things are loved by an overseer, and this is why they serve God, whoever does this is a hireling who cannot count himself among the children. For of such also the Lord says, “Truly, I say to you, they have their reward.” Listen to what the apostle Paul says of Timothy: “But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly to you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your circumstances; for I have no man like-minded, who will naturally care for you. For all seek their own, not the things that are Jesus Christ’s.”
