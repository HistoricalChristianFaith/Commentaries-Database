See what the Psalmist next most openly says: "Order my steps after Your word: and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me" [Psalm 119:133]. Where what else does he say than this, Make me upright and free according to Your promise. But so much the more as the love of God reigns in every man, so much the less has wickedness dominion over him. What else then does he seek than that by the gift of God he may love God? For by loving God he loves himself, so that he may healthily love his neighbour also as himself: on which commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. [Matthew 22:37-40] What then does he pray, save that God may cause the fulfillment by His help of those commandments which He imposes by His bidding?

This free will will be free in proportion as it is sound, and sound in proportion as it is submissive to divine mercy and grace. Therefore, it prays with faith and says, “Direct my paths according to your word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me.” It prays, it does not promise; it confesses, it does not declare itself; it begs for the fullest liberty, it does not boast of its own power. It is not everyone who trusts in his own strength, but everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. “How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed?” Therefore, those who believe rightly believe that they may call on him in whom they have believed and may be strong to do what they have learned in the precepts of the law, since faith obtains what the law commands.

When, however, you hear, “Sin shall have no dominion over you,” do not trust in yourself in order that sin may not dominate you, but trust in him to whom that holy one was praying when he said, “Direct my steps according to your word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me.” Lest, perhaps, when we have heard, “Sin shall not have dominion over you,” we should exalt ourselves and attribute this to our own strength, the apostle saw this and added at once, “Since you are not under the law but under grace.” Grace therefore causes sin not to have power over you. Do not, then, trust in yourself, lest thereby sin have much more dominion over you. And when we hear, “If by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the flesh, you shall live,” let us not attribute this good to our spirit alone, as if through itself it could do these things. For, lest we enjoy that carnal feeling, our spirit being dead rather than a death-dealing one, he immediately added, “For whoever are led by the Spirit of God, they are the children of God.” So, when by our spirit we put to death the works of the flesh, we are impelled by the Spirit of God, which grants the continence by which we restrain, master and overcome sexual desire.
