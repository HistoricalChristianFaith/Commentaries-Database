See what the Psalmist next most openly says: "Order my steps after Your word: and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me" [Psalm 119:133]. Where what else does he say than this, Make me upright and free according to Your promise. But so much the more as the love of God reigns in every man, so much the less has wickedness dominion over him. What else then does he seek than that by the gift of God he may love God? For by loving God he loves himself, so that he may healthily love his neighbour also as himself: on which commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. [MatthewÂ 22:37-40] What then does he pray, save that God may cause the fulfillment by His help of those commandments which He imposes by His bidding?

132. See what the Psalmist next most openly saith: "Order my steps after Thy word: and so shall no wickedness have dominion over me" (ver. 133). Where what else doth he say than this, Make me upright and free according to Thy promise. But so much the more as the love of God reigneth in every man, so much the less hath wickedness dominion over him. What else then doth he seek than that by the gift of God he may love God? For by loving God he loveth himself, so that he may healthily love his neighbour also as himself: on which commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets. What then doth he pray, save that God may cause the fulfillment by His help of those commandments which He imposeth by His bidding?
