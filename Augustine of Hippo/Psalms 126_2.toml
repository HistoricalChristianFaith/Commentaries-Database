"Then was our mouth filled with joy, and our tongue with exultation" [Psalm 126:2]. That mouth, brethren, which we have in our body, how is it "filled with joy"? It uses not to be "filled," save with meat, or drink, or some such thing put into the mouth. Sometimes our mouth is filled; and it is more that we say to your holiness,  when we have our mouth full, we cannot speak. But we have a mouth within, that is, in the heart, whence whatsoever proceeds, if it is evil, defiles us, if it is good, cleanses us. For concerning this very mouth ye heard when the Gospel was read. For the Jews reproached the Lord, because His disciples ate with unwashen hands.  They reproached who had cleanness without; and within were full of stains. They reproached, whose righteousness was only in the eyes of men. But the Lord sought our inward cleanness, which if we have, the outside must needs be clean also.

The Lord our God has granted me the favor of seeing you and being seen by you, and we can all give him thanks together. And if this is the reason that “our mouth is filled with joy and our tongue with exultation,” that we have seen each other in the mortal flesh, imagine what our joy will be when we have seen each other in that place, where we will have nothing at all to fear from each other. The apostle says, “Rejoice in hope.” So our present joy is in hope, not yet in the thing itself. “But hope which is seen,” he says, “is not hope; for why does anyone hope for what he can see? But if we are hoping for what we cannot see, we wait for it with patience.” But if travelers rejoice in each other’s company on the way, what joy they will obtain in their home country!
