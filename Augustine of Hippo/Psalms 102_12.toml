For not because I have fallen, have You grown old: for You are strong to set me free, who hast been strong to humble me. "But You, O Lord, endurest for ever: and Your remembrance throughout all generations" [Psalm 102:12]. "Your remembrance," because Thou dost not forget: "throughout all generations," forasmuch as we know the promise of life, both present and future. [1 Timothy 4:8]
