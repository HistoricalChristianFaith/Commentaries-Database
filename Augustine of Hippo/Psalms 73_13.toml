"And I said, therefore without cause I have justified my heart" [Psalm 73:13]. In that I serve God, and have not these things; they serve him not, and they abound in these things: "therefore without cause I have justified my heart, and have washed among the innocent my hands." This without cause I have done. Where is the reward of my good life? Where is the wage of my service? I live well and am in need; and the unjust man does abound. "And I have washed among the innocent my hands."
