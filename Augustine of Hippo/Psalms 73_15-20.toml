But because the psalmist realized afterward—as he goes on to say in the same psalm, “When I tried to understand this,” and he added, “it was a wearisome task,” why the wicked have all the luck; “it was a wearisome task,” he says, “until I went into the sanctuary of God and understood about their latter end,” that for the wicked who are now for a time given good fortune, eternal punishment is being saved up for the last day. So when he realized this he became upright of heart and began to praise God for everything, both for the troubles of decent people and for the good fortune of the wicked. For he observed that God is just in his retributions at the end and that he now gives some people temporal good fortune while keeping in store for them at the end everlasting misfortune, and that in the present life he is subjecting some decent people to the rigors of misfortune while saving up for them eternal good fortune in the next. He remarks that they have to change places, like that rich man who used to feast sumptuously every day and that poor man, full of sores, lying at the rich man’s gate and longing to fill himself with the crumbs that fell from the rich man’s table. But when they were both dead the first began to be in pain in hell, and the second was at rest in Abraham’s bosom. When the rich man thought this was unfair and wanted a drop of water dripped on his tongue from Lazarus’s middle finger (changing places, he now longed for a drop from the finger of the man who had longed for a crumb from his table), he heard from Abraham the judgment of the upright God: “Son,” he said, “remember that you received good things in your life and Lazarus bad things; but now he is at rest, and you are in torment.”
