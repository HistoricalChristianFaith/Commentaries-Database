In fact, to that prepared feast of which the Lord speaks in the Gospel, not all who were called wanted to come, nor could those come who did come except they were called. Accordingly neither should those who came give themselves the credit, for they came by invitation, nor should those who did not want to come blame it on another, but only on themselves, for they had been invited to come of their free will. Therefore, before merit, the calling determines the will. For this reason, even if someone called takes the credit for coming, he cannot take the credit for being called. And as for him who is called and does not come, just as his calling was not a deserved reward, so his neglecting to come when called lays the foundation for a deserved punishment. There will thus be the following two things: “Of your mercy and judgment will I sing, O Lord.” To mercy belongs the calling; to judgment belongs the blessedness of those who did not want to come.

Christ has come, but first to save, afterwards to judge, by pronouncing punishment for those who were unwilling to be saved and by leading those to life, who, by believing, did not spurn salvation. Thus the first dispensation of our Lord Jesus Christ is medicinal, not judicial; for if he had come first to judge, he would have found no one to whom to grant the rewards of justice. Therefore, because he saw that all were sinners and that no one at all was free from the death of sin, his mercy first had to be bestowed and his judgment shown later. For the psalm had sung about him, “Mercy and judgment I will sing to you, Lord.” It does not say judgment and mercy. For if judgment were first, there would be no mercy; but mercy first, judgment afterwards.

While the reprobate angels and people continue in eternal punishment, the saints will have fuller knowledge of the good conferred on them by grace. Then, through the very facts themselves they will gain a clearer understanding of what is written in the psalm: “Mercy and judgment I will sing to you, O Lord,” for it is only through unmerited mercy that anyone is freed and only through deserved judgment that anyone is condemned. Then will be clear what now is dark: When one of two children is through his mercy chosen by God for himself, while the other through his judgment is to be abandoned (the one chosen knowing what would have been his due through judgment had not mercy come to his aid), why the one rather than the other is chosen, when the condition of the two was the same? Or again, why miracles were not worked in the presence of some people who, had they been worked, would have done penance, while miracles were worked in the presence of those who were not going to believe anyway? For this is the Lord’s very clear statement: “Woe to you, Korazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if in Tyre and Sidon had been worked the miracles that have been worked in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.” And surely there was no injustice in God’s not willing that they be saved, though they could have been saved if he had so willed it.

But, inasmuch as “Christ has died for the wicked,” what person has been found good by the Lord? He therefore found all trees bad, but, to those who believe in his name, “he gave the power of becoming children of God.” Hence, whoever is now a good person (that is to say, a good tree) was found bad and has been made good. If the Lord had willed to root up the bad trees when he came, what tree would have been left that would not deserve to be rooted up? But he came to dispense mercy beforehand, so that he might afterwards dispense justice, for he is the Lord to whom the psalmist says, “Mercy and judgment I will sing to you, O Lord.” He therefore gave remission of sins to those who believe. Of them, he would not even demand an accounting of previous decrees. He gave remission of sins; he made the trees good. He delayed the axe; he removed the threat.

Obviously, it is just that those who have pardoned should receive pardon and that it should be given to those who give. It is natural that there should be in God both mercy for him that judges and judgment for him that shows mercy. That is why we say to him, “Mercy and judgment I will sing to you, O Lord.” Whoever, presuming on his own justice, expects judgment with mercy as if he were secure provokes the most just anger, of which the psalmist said in fear, “Enter not into judgment with your servant.” Therefore, God says to his perverse people, “Why will you contend with me in judgment?” For when “the just king shall sit on his throne, who will boast that he has a chaste heart, or who will boast that he is pure of sin?” What hope is there, then, unless “mercy exalts itself above judgment,” but only toward those who have shown mercy by saying sincerely, “Forgive us as we forgive” and by giving without protest? “For God loves a cheerful giver.” Finally, in order to comfort those in whom the former sentence had roused extreme fear, James in the sequence to that passage speaks of the works of mercy, when he points out how even daily sins, without which there is no living in this world, are expiated by daily remedies. Without these, the person who becomes guilty of all by offending in one point and by offending in many—“because in many things we all offend”—would drag with him to the judgment seat of the great judge a mighty load of guilt, gathered up bit by bit, and would not find the mercy that he had not shown. By forgiving and giving, he deserves to have his debts forgiven and the promised reward given to him.

“I grew deaf and humbled myself”—that is how it goes on—“and held my peace from good things.” “I grew deaf”: I did not listen to him talking. What progress such a spirit displays, in that while he rejoices inwardly at his brother’s being mistaken and his own conscience being easy, he refrains outwardly from barking! What a fine soul that is, how carefree, how joyful! This is the soul that says to God, “I would walk in the innocence of my heart, in the midst of your house.” The rowdies were hammering at the doors, but the house was safe and sound. “I grew deaf and humbled myself,” I did not stand up proudly against him. And in humbling myself “I held my peace from good things.” In fact it was not the time for saying anything good. It is the time to keep silent now. After the fellow has calmed down, talk then; then he will understand.
