"There went up smoke in His wrath" [Psalm 18:8]. The tearful supplication of penitents went up, when they came to know God's threatenings against the ungodly. "And fire burns from His face." And the ardour of love after repentance burns by the knowledge of Him. "Coals were kindled from Him." They, who were already dead, abandoned by the fire of good desire and the light of righteousness, and who remained in coldness and darkness, re-enkindled and enlightened, have come to life again.
