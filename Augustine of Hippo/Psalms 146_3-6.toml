A Christian sees this, poor, proletarian, moaning and groaning at his daily drudgery, and perhaps he says to himself, “What’s the good of my having become a Christian? Has it made me any better off than that fellow who isn’t, than that guy who doesn’t believe in Christ, than that so-and-so who blasphemes my God?” That psalm warns him, “Do not put your trust in princes.” Why do you take pleasure in the flower of the field? “All flesh is grass,” says the prophet. He does not merely say it, he shouts it. The Lord shouts to him: “Shout,” he says. And he answers, “What shall I shout? All flesh is grass, and all the honor of the flesh as the flower of the field. The grass has withered, the flower fallen.” So has everything perished then? Heaven forbid! “But the word of the Lord abides forever.” Why take pleasure in grass? Look, the grass has perished. Do you want to avoid perishing? Hold fast to the Word.So too in this psalm. Perhaps a poor, lowly Christian had his eyes fixed on a pagan, rich and powerful perhaps, had his eyes fixed on the flower of the field, and was perhaps halfway to choosing him for a patron rather than God. The psalm has a word for this person: “Do not put your trust in princes and in the sons of people, in whom there is no help.” He immediately replies, “It cannot be speaking of this person, can it? He was very well off. Look how healthy he is. This very day I see him flourishing. It is me, rather, who am constantly and miserably ill.” Why are you obsessed with these things as the only means of pleasure and satisfaction? That is not well-being. “His spirit will go out, and he will return to his earth.”

There can be no doubt, of course, that the poor man being God-fearing, while trapped in his temporal miseries, was thinking how this life must end sometime and how eternal rest is to be gained. They both died, but that poor man’s thoughts did not perish on that day. You see, it happened that the beggar died and was taken away by the angels to Abraham’s bosom. On that day all his thoughts were healed. And because Lazarus translated into English11 means “Helped”—if you are called Lazarus in Hebrew, you are called “Helped” in English—this psalm has rightly advised us, “Blessed is he whose helper is the God of Jacob.” When his spirit goes out and his flesh returns to its earth, his thoughts will not perish, because “his hope is in the Lord his God.” This is the lesson learned in the school of Christ the teacher, this is what is hoped for by the heart of the faithful hearer, this is the reward of the only true savior.”

“I am afraid,” says the apostle, “that just as the serpent led Eve astray by his cunning, in the same way your minds too may be corrupted from the chastity that is in Christ.” Now the minds of these people are corrupted by that sort of conversation, “Let us eat and drink; for tomorrow we die.” Those who love these things, who pursue these things, who assume this is the only life there is, who hope for nothing further, who either do not pray to God or pray to him for this life alone, who find any talk of diligence very tedious, will be very downcast when they hear me saying all this. They want to eat and drink, for tomorrow they die. If only they would give genuine thought to the fact that they are going to die tomorrow! Can there be any, after all, so mindless, so perverse, so hostile to their own souls, that they do not reflect, when they are about to die the next day, on how everything they have worked for has come to an end? That, you see, is what is written: “On that day shall all his schemes come to nothing.”
