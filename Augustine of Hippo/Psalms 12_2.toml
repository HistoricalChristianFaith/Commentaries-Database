"He has talked vanity each man to his neighbour" [Psalm 12:2]. By neighbour we must understand every man: for that there is no one with whom we should work evil; "and the love of our neighbour works no evil." [Romans 13:10] "Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have spoken evil things."  The repetition, "with a heart and a heart," signifies a double heart.

There is a double heart there, not a simple one; it is not what it has within itself that it utters outwardly. The double heart, once upon a time, received this damning judgment: “Deceitful lips in heart and heart have spoken evil.” It should have been enough to say, “In the heart they have spoken evil.” How are lips deceitful? What is deceit? When one thing is done openly, another covered up. Deceitful lips mean a not simple heart; and because it is not a simple heart, that is why “in heart and heart”; that is why “in heart” twice over; because it is a double heart.
