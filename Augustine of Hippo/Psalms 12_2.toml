"He has talked vanity each man to his neighbour" [Psalm 12:2]. By neighbour we must understand every man: for that there is no one with whom we should work evil; "and the love of our neighbour works no evil." [RomansÂ 13:10] "Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have spoken evil things."  The repetition, "with a heart and a heart," signifies a double heart.

3. "He hath talked vanity each man to his neighbour" (ver. 2). By neighbour we must understand every man: for that there is no one with whom we should work evil; "and the love of our neighbour worketh no evil." "Deceitful lips, with a heart and a heart they have spoken evil things." The repetition, "with a heart and a heart," signifies a double heart.
