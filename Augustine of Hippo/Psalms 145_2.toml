quote = "Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for ever and ever."
content = '''Now then begin to praise, if you intend to praise for ever. He who will not praise in this transitory "age," will be silent when "age upon age" has come. But lest any one should in any otherwise also understand what he says, "I will praise Your Name for the age," and should seek another age, wherein to praise, he says, "Every day will I bless You." Praise then and bless the Lord your God every day, that when single days have passed, and there has come one day without end, you may go from praise to praise, as "from strength to strength." No day shall pass by, wherein I bless You not. And it is no wonder, if in your day of joy thou bless the Lord. What if perchance some day of sorrow has dawned on you, as is natural in the circumstances of our mortal nature, as there is abundance of offenses, as temptations are multiplied; what, if something sad befall you, a man; will you cease to praise God? Will you cease to bless your Creator? If you cease, you have lied in saying, "every day," etc. But if you cease not, although it seem to you to be ill with you in the day of your sorrow, yet in your God it shall be well with you.'''
