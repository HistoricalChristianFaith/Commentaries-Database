A Christian sees this, poor, proletarian, moaning and groaning at his daily drudgery, and perhaps he says to himself, "What's the good of my having become a Christian? Has it made me any better off than that fellow who isn't, than that guy who doesn't believe in Christ, than that so-and-so who blasphemes my God?" That psalm warns him, "Do not put your trust in princes." Why do you take pleasure in the flower of the field? "All flesh is grass," says the prophet. He does not merely say it, he shouts it. The Lord shouts to him: "Shout," he says. And he answers, "What shall I shout? All flesh is grass, and all the honor of the flesh as the flower of the field. The grass has withered, the flower fallen." So has everything perished then? Heaven forbid! "But the word of the Lord abides forever." Why take pleasure in grass? Look, the grass has perished. Do you want to avoid perishing? Hold fast to the Word.So too in this psalm. Perhaps a poor, lowly Christian had his eyes fixed on a pagan, rich and powerful perhaps, had his eyes fixed on the flower of the field, and was perhaps halfway to choosing him for a patron rather than God. The psalm has a word for this person: "Do not put your trust in princes and in the sons of people, in whom there is no help." He immediately replies, "It cannot be speaking of this person, can it? He was very well off. Look how healthy he is. This very day I see him flourishing. It is me, rather, who am constantly and miserably ill." Why are you obsessed with these things as the only means of pleasure and satisfaction? That is not well-being. "His spirit will go out, and he will return to his earth."
