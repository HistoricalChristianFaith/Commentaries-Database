"The Voice of the Lord cutting short the flame of fire" [Psalm 29:7]. The Voice of the Lord, without any harm to Himself, passing through all the excited ardour of them that persecute Him, or dividing the furious rage of His persecutors, so that some should say, "Is not this haply the very Christ;" others, "Nay; but He deceives the people:" [John 7:41, 12] and so cutting short their mad tumult, as to pass some over into His love, and leave others in their malice.
