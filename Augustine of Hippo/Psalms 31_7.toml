"I will be glad, and rejoice in Your mercy:" which does not deceive me. "For You have regarded My humiliation:" wherein You have subjected me to vanity in hope. [Romans 8:20] "You have saved my soul from necessities" [Psalm 31:7]. You have saved my soul from the necessities of fear, that with a free love it may serve You.
