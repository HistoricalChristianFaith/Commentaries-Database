"Avenge Thou," he says, "my cause, and deliver me" [Psalm 119:154]. The former sentence is here almost repeated. And what is there said, "For I do not forget Your law," agrees with what we read here, "Quicken me, according to Your word." For these words are the law of God, which he has not forgot, so that he has abased himself, and will therefore be exalted. But the words, "Quicken me," pertain to this very exaltation; for the exaltation of the saints is everlasting life.
