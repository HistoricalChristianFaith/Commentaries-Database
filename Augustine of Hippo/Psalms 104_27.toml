Do you wish to see how incapable he is of hurting you, unless permitted? "These," he says, "wait all upon You, that You may give them meat in due season" [Psalm 104:27]. And this serpent wishes to devour, but he devours not whom he wishes....You have heard what the serpent's meat is. Thou dost not wish that God give you to be devoured by the serpent; because not the serpent's food: i.e. forsake not the Word of God. For where it is said to the serpent, "Dust you shall eat," it is said to the transgressor, "Dust you are, and unto dust you shall return."  Thou dost not wish to be the serpent's food? Be not dust. How, you reply, shall I not be dust? If you have not a taste for earthly things. Hear the Apostle, that you may not be dust. For the body which you wear is earth: but do thou refuse to be earth. What means this? "Set your affection on things above, not on things on the earth." [Colossians 3:2] If you dost not set your affections on earthly things, you are not earth: if you are not earth, you are not devoured by the serpent, whose appointed food is earth. The Lord gives the serpent his food when He will, what He will: but He judges rightly, he cannot be deceived, He gives him not gold for earth. "When You have given it them, they gather it."...

Let us all therefore fix our gaze on him, that he may feed our hungry souls; he himself was hungry for our sake, seeing that "he became poor though he was rich, in order that by his poverty we might be enriched." How appropriate that we sang to him just now, "All things look to you to give them their food at the proper time." If all things, then all people; if all people, then us too. So if I am going to give you anything good in this sermon, it is not I who shall be giving it but he from whom we all receive because we all look to him. It is time for him to give, but we must do what he said if he is to give, namely, we must look to him. Let us gaze on him with our minds, because just as the eyes and ears of your bodies are turned to me, so the eyes and ears of your minds should be turned to him.
