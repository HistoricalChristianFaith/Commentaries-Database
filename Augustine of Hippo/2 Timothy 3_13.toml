Make progress, make progress in welldoing, for, according to the apostle, there are certain people who go from bad to worse. If you are progressing, you are advancing. Progress in welldoing, progress in good faith, progress in good deeds. Keep singing. Keep advancing. Do not wander. Do not return. Do not remain stationary.
