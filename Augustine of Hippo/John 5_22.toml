A little before we were thinking that the Father does something that the Son does not do, … as though the Father were doing and the Son were seeing. In this way there was creeping in on our mind a carnal conception, as if the Father did something the Son did not do but that the Son was looking on while the Father showed what he was doing. Then, as the Father was doing what the Son did not do, just now we see the Son doing what the Father does not do. How he turns us about and keeps our mind busy! He leads us here and there, not allowing us to remain resting with our human conceptions so that by changing he may exercise us, by exercising he may cleanse us, by cleansing he may render us capable of receiving, and may fill us when made capable.

How can it be said, “The Father judges no one”? For since the Father has begotten the Son equal to himself, the Father does indeed judge with the Son. Therefore Jesus must have meant that in the judgment, it is not the form of God but the form of the Son of man that will appear. Not that the Father, who has committed all judgment to the Son, will not judge, because the Son identifies him as “one who seeks and judges.” But … it is as if it was said: No one will see the Father in the judgment of the living and the dead, but everyone will see the Son, because he is also the Son of man so that he can be seen even by the ungodly.
