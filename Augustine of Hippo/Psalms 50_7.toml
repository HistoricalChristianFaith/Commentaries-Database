"Hear, my people, and I will speak to you" [Psalm 50:7]. He shall come and shall not keep silence; see how that even now, if you hear, He is not silent. Hear, my people, and I will speak to you. For if you hear not, I will not speak to you. "Hear, and I will speak to you." For if you hear not, even though I shall speak, it will not be to you. When then shall I speak to you? If you hear? When do you hear? If you are my people. For, "Hear, my people:" you hear not if you are an alien people. "Hear, my people, and I will speak to you: Israel, and I will testify to you."...For "Your God," is properly said to that man whom God does keep more as one of His family, as though in His household, as though in His peculiar: "Your God am I." What will you more? Requirest thou a reward from God, so that God may give you something; so that what He has given you may be your own? Behold God Himself, who shall give, is your own. What richer than He? Gifts you were desiring, you have the Giver Himself. "God, your God, I am."
