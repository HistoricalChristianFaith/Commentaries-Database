"I have hated the unrighteous; and Your law have I loved" [Psalm 119:113]. He says not, I hate the wicked, and love the righteous; or, I hate iniquity, and love Your law; but, after saying, "I have hated the unrighteous," he explains why, by adding, "and Your law have I loved;" to show, that he did not hate human nature in unrighteous men, but their unrighteousness whereby they are foes to the law, which he loves.
