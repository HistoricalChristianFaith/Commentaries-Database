"The righteous Lord shall hew the necks of the sinners" [Psalm 129:4]....Which of us does not fix his eyes upon the earth, like the Publican, and say, "Lord, be merciful unto me a sinner"? [Luke 18:13] If therefore all are sinners, and none is found without sin; all must fear the sword that hangs above their neck, because "the righteous Lord shall hew the necks of the sinners." I do not imagine, my brethren, of all sinners; but in the member which He strikes, He marks what sinners He strikes. For it is not said, The righteous Lord will hew the hands of the sinners; or their feet; but because proud sinners were meant to be understood, and all proud men carry lofty necks, and not only do evil deeds, but even refuse to acknowledge them to be such, and when they are rebuked, justify themselves:. ..as it is written in Job (he was speaking of an ungodly sinner), "he runs against God, even upon his neck, upon the thick bosses of his bucklers;" [Job 15:26] so he here names the neck, because it is thus you exalt yourself, and dost not fix your eyes upon the ground, and beat your breast. You should cry unto Him, as it is cried in another Psalm, "I said, Lord, be merciful unto me, for I have sinned against You."  Since thou dost not choose to say this, but justifiest your deeds against the Word of God; what follows in Scripture comes upon you: the righteous Lord shall hew the necks of sinners.
