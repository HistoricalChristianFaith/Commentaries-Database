"I will confess to You, O Lord, for terribly have You been made wonderful: wondrous are Your works, and my soul knows it right well" [Psalm 139:14]. Aforetime "Your knowledge was made wonderful from me, it had waxed great, nor could I attain unto it." From me then "it had waxed great." Whence does "my soul" now "know right well," save because the "night is light in my delight?" save because Your grace has come unto me, and enlightened my darkness? save because You have possessed my reins? save because You have taken me up from my mother's womb?

14. "I will confess to Thee, O Lord, for terribly hast Thou been made wonderful: wondrous are Thy works, and my soul knoweth it right well" (ver. 14). Aforetime "Thy knowledge was made wonderful from me, it had waxed great, nor could I attain unto it." From me then "it had waxed great." Whence doth "my soul" now "know right well," save because the "night is light in my delight?" save because Thy grace hath come unto me, and enlightened my darkness? save because Thou hast possessed my reins? save because Thou hast taken me up from my mother's womb?
