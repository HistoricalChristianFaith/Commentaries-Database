"I will confess to You, O Lord, for terribly have You been made wonderful: wondrous are Your works, and my soul knows it right well" [Psalm 139:14]. Aforetime "Your knowledge was made wonderful from me, it had waxed great, nor could I attain unto it." From me then "it had waxed great." Whence does "my soul" now "know right well," save because the "night is light in my delight?" save because Your grace has come unto me, and enlightened my darkness? save because You have possessed my reins? save because You have taken me up from my mother's womb?
