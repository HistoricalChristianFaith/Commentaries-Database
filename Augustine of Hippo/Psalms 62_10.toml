He turns therefore Himself to them, thirsting for them: "Do not hope in iniquity" [Psalm 62:10]. For my hope is in God. You that will not draw near and pass over, "do not hope in iniquity." For I that have leapt over, my hope is in God; and is there anywise iniquity with God? [RomansÂ 9:14] This thing let us do, that thing let us do, of that thing let us think, thus let us adjust our lyings in wait; "Because of vanity being at one."  You thirst: they that think of those things against you are given up by those whom you drink. "Do not hope in vanity." Vain is iniquity, nought is iniquity, mighty is nothing save righteousness. Truth may be hidden for a time, conquered it cannot be. Iniquity may flourish for a time, abide it cannot. "Do not hope upon iniquity: and for robbery be not covetous." You are not rich, and will you rob? What do you find? What do you lose? O losing gains!  You           find              money, you lose righteousness. "For robbery be not covetous."...Therefore, vain sons of men, lying sons of men, neither rob, nor, if there flow riches, set heart upon them: no longer love vanity, and seek lying. For "blessed is the man who has the Lord God for his hope, and who has not had regard unto vanities, and lying follies."  You would deceive, you would commit a fraud, what bring ye in order that you may cheat. Deceitful balances. For "lying," he says, "are the sons of men in the balances," in order that they may cheat by bringing forth deceitful balances. By a false balance ye beguile men looking on: know ye not that one is he that weighs, Another He that judges of the weight? He sees not, for whom you weigh, but He sees that weighs you and him. Therefore neither fraud nor robbery covet ye any longer, nor on those things which you have set your hope:  I have admonished, have foretold, says this Idithun.
