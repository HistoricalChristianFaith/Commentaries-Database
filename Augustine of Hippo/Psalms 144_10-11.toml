"Who gives salvation to kings, who redeems David His servant" [Psalm 144:10]. You know who David is; be yourselves David. Whence "redeems He David His servant"? Whence redeems He Christ? Whence redeems He the Body of Christ? "From the sword of ill intent deliver me." "From the sword" is not sufficient; he adds, "of ill intent." Without doubt there is a sword of good intent. What is the sword of good intent? That whereof the Lord says, "I came not to send peace on earth, but a sword." [MatthewÂ 10:34] For He was about to separate believers from unbelievers, sons from parents, and to sever all other ties, while the sword cut off what was diseased, but healed the members of Christ. Of good intent then is the sword twice sharpened, powerful with both edges, the Old and New Testaments, with the narration of the past and the promise of the future. That then is the sword of good intent: but the other is of ill intent, wherewith they talk vanity, for that is of good intent, wherewith God speaks verity. For truly "the sons of men have teeth which are spears and arrows, and their tongue is a sharp sword."  "From" this "sword deliver me" [Psalm 144:11]. "And take me out of the hand of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity:" just as before. And that which follows, "their right hand is a right hand of iniquity," the same he had set down before also, when he called them "many waters." For lest you should think that the "many waters" were good waters, he explained them by the "sword of ill intent."
