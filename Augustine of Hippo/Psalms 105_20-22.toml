"The king sent and loosed him, the prince of the peoples, and let him go free" [Psalm 105:20]. The "king" is the same as "the prince of the peoples:" he "loosed" him from his bonds "and let him go free" from his prison. "He made him lord also of his house: and ruler of all his substance" [Psalm 105:21]. "That he might inform his princes like himself, and teach his old men wisdom" [Psalm 105:22]. The Greek has, "and teach his elders wisdom." Which might altogether be rendered to the letter thus; "Might inform his princes like himself, and make his elders wise." The word translated old men being presbyters or elders, not gerontas, old men: and to teach wisdom being from the Greek to sophize, which cannot be rendered by a single word in Latin, and is from the word  sophia, wisdom, different from prudence, which is in Greek  phronesis. Yet we do not read this in the high elevation of Joseph, as we read not of fetters in his low estate. But how could it happen that so great a man, the worshipper of the One True God, while in Egypt, should have been intent upon the nourishing of bodies, and the government of carnal matters only, and have felt no anxiety for souls, and how he could render them better? But those things are written in that history, which, according to the intention of the writer, in whom was the Holy Spirit, were judged sufficient for signifying future events in that narration.
