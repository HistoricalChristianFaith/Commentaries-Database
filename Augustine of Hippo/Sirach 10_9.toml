“No one knows the things of a person except the spirit of man which is in him.” And yet, there is something of a person that “the spirit … in him” does not know. But you, Lord, who made him, you fully know him. I indeed, though in your sight I despise myself and consider “myself but dust and ashes”—I still know something concerning you that I do not know about myself. Most assuredly, “we see through a glass dimly,” “not yet face to face.” As long as I am absent from you, I am more present with myself than with you.

I am afraid that the reason why the soul went forth away from God is that it was proud. In fact, I have no doubt about it. For it is written, “Pride is the beginning of all sin,” and “the beginning of human pride is a falling away from God.” It is written, it is firm and sure, it is true. And so, what is said of proud mortal humanity, clad in the tattered rags of the flesh, weighed down with the weight of a corruptible body, and all the while extolling himself, and forgetting the very skin he is clothed with—what, I ask, do the Scriptures say to him? “Why is dust and ashes proud?” Why proud! Let the Scriptures tell why. “Because in his life he put forth his inmost parts.” What does “put forth” mean except that he “threw it far away”? In other words, to send them out. For to enter within is to long after the inmost parts; to put forth the inmost parts is to send them out. The proud man gets rid of the inmost parts, the humble man earnestly desires the inmost parts. If we are cast out by pride, let us return by humility.
