There is, of course, the passage where he speaks of immortality after good works, as if he really demands it as his due, for he says: “I have fought the good fight, I have finished the course, I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall render to me at that day.” Do you think, perhaps, that because he said “shall render” he meant that it was his due? But when “he ascended on high and took captivity captive,” he did not render but “gave gifts to men.” How could the apostle speak presumptuously as of a debt being paid back to him, unless he had first received grace which was not due to him, being justified by which, he fought the good fight?
