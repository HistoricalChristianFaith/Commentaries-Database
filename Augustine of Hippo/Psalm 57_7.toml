...Let your Love see the Lord speaking to us, and exhorting us by His example: "A trap  they have prepared for My feet, and have bowed down My Soul" [Psalm 57:7]. They wished to bring It down as if from Heaven, and to the lower places to weigh It down: "They have bowed My Soul: they have dug before My face a pit and themselves have fallen into it." Me have they hurt, or themselves? Behold He has been exalted above the Heavens, God, and behold above all the earth the Glory of the Same: the kingdom of Christ we see, where is the kingdom of the Jews? Since therefore they did that which to have done they ought not, there has been done in their case that which to have suffered they ought: themselves have dug a ditch, and themselves have fallen into it. For their persecuting Christ, to Christ did no hurt, but to themselves did hurt. And do not suppose, brethren, that themselves alone has this befallen. Every one that prepares a pit for his brother, it must needs be that himself fall into it....
