In another place, when I said the following about our Lord Jesus Christ, “He did nothing by force but everything by persuasion and admonition,” I forgot that he threw out the sellers and buyers from the temple by flogging them. What does this matter to us? How is it important if he also cast out demons from people against their will, not by persuasive words but by force of his power?
