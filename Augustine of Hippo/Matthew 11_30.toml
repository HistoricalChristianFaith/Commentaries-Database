Serm., 69, 1: Whence do we all thus labour, but that we are mortal men, bearing vessels of clay which cause us much difficulty. But if the vessels of flesh are straitened, the regions of love will be enlarged. To what end then does He say, "Come unto me,” all ye that labour, but that ye should not labour?.
Serm., 69, 1: Not to create a world, or to do miracles in that world; but that "I am meek and lowly in heart.” Wouldest thou be great? Begin with the least.Wouldest thou build up a mighty fabric of greatness? First think of the foundation of humility; for the mightier building any seeks to raise, the deeper let him dig for his foundation. Whither is the summit of our building torise? To the sight of God.
