"Turn again then unto your rest, O my soul; for the Lord has done good to you" [Psalm 116:7]: not for your deservings, or through your strength; but because the Lord has done good to you. "Since," he says, "He has delivered my soul from death" [Psalm 116:8]. It is wonderful, most beloved brethren, that, after he had said that his soul should turn unto rest, since the Lord had rewarded him; he added, since "He has delivered my soul from death." Did it turn unto rest, because it was delivered from death? Is not rest more usually said of death? What is the action of him whose life is rest, and death disquietude? Such then ought to be the action of the soul, as may tend to a quiet security, not one that may increase restless toil; since He has delivered it from death, who, pitying it, said, "Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest," etc. [Matthew 11:28-30] Meek therefore and humble, following, so to speak, Christ as its path, should the action of the soul be that tends towards repose; nevertheless, not slothful and supine; that it may finish its course, as it is written, "In quietness make perfect your works." [Sirach 3:19] "You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes from tears, and my feet from falling." Whoever feels the chain of this flesh, chants these things as fulfilled in hope towards himself. For it is truly said, "I was in misery, and He delivered me;" but the Apostle says this also truly, that we are saved by hope. [Romans 8:24] And that we are delivered from death, is well said to be already fulfilled, so that we may understand the death of unbelievers, of whom he says, "Leave the dead to bury their dead." [Matthew 8:22] ...He will then clear our eyes of tears, when He shall save our feet from falling. For there will then be no slipping of our feet as they walk, when there will be no sliding of the weak flesh. But now, however firm our path, which is Christ, be; yet since we place flesh, which we are enjoined to subdue, beneath us; in the very work of chastening and subduing it, it is a great thing not to fall: but not to slip in the flesh, who can attain? "I shall please in the sight of the Lord, in the land of the living" [Psalm 116:9]....We "labour" indeed now, because we are awaiting "the redemption of our body:" [Romans 8:23] but, "when death shall have been swallowed up in victory, and this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal immortality;" [1 Corinthians 15:53-54] then there will be no weeping, because there will be no falling; and no falling, because no corruption. And therefore we shall then no longer labour to please, but we shall be entirely pleasing in the sight of the Lord, in the land of the living.
