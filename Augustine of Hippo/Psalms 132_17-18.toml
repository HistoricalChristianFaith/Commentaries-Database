What is the woman? The flesh of Christ. What is the lamp? “I have prepared a lamp for my anointed.” Therefore we were sought in order that we might be found; having been found, we speak. Let us not be proud because, before we were found, if we were not sought for, we would have been lost. Therefore let not those whom we love and whom we wish to win over to the peace of the catholic church say to us, “Why do you want us? Why do you seek us if we are sinners?” We seek you precisely that you may not be lost; we seek you because we were sought; we wish to find you because we were found.

Let me talk to your graces in the house of God about what this psalm here has reminded us of; who it is who says, “I have prepared a lamp for my Christ; his enemies I will clothe with confusion, but on him my sanctification shall flower”; and what that lamp may be, which he prepared for his Christ; and who the enemies of his Christ may be, whom he has clothed with confusion by means of that lamp; and what the sanctification is of the one who prepared a lamp for his Christ, which will flower on his Christ. In all these words, after all, the only thing that seems plain and open is what he says here, “my Christ”; none other, I mean, is to be understood, but Christ our Lord and Savior.

And, because they had shut themselves up against him, by asserting that they did not know what they knew, the Lord did not open up to them because they did not knock. For it has been said, “Knock, and it will be opened to you.” But they not only had not knocked that it might be opened, but by their denial they barricaded the door itself against themselves. And the Lord said to them, “Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.” And they were confounded through John, and in them was fulfilled the prophecy, “I have prepared a lamp for my Christ; his enemies I will clothe with confusion.”

So a lamp was prepared for Christ our Lord in the person of John the Baptist. His enemies, trying to trap him with their questions, withdrew in confusion when this lamp was brought out. Thus was fulfilled [the prophecy] “I will clothe his enemies with confusion.” Let us, though, brothers and sisters, acknowledge the Lord by means of John the Baptist his forerunner. Indeed by the Lord’s own witness, of which he said, “I have a greater witness than John,” let us believe in Christ and in this way be formed into the body of him the head, so that head and body may be the one Christ. And so in all of us, having been made one, shall be fulfilled, “but on him my sanctification shall flower.”
