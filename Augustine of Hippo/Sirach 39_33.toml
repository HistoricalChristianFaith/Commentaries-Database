Your creature had existence from the fullness of your goodness, so that a good that was entirely useless to you and, though it was from you and not equal to you, because it could be created by you, would not fail to exist. What value did the heavens and the earth, which you created in the beginning, have for you? And spiritual and bodily natures, created by you in your Wisdom—let them too declare what they deserve from you, because even the inchoate and the formless beings depend on your Word. In their element, whether spiritual or corporeal, they tend away from you toward disorder and degeneration—although a formless spiritual being is superior to a formed bodily being and a formless corporeal being in turn superior to what is absolutely nothing. Thus they would have remained suspended in your word, formless, if this same word had not called them to your unity, endowed them with form and made all of them very good11 thanks to you, the One and highest Good.
