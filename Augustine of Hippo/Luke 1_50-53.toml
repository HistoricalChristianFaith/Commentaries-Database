Who are the hungry? The humble, the needy. Who are the rich? Proud and self-important people. I will not send you far to find them. I will show you now, in one and the same temple, one of those rich who are sent away empty, and one of those poor who are filled with good things.“Two men went up into the temple to pray. One a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.” … Observe the rich man burping his undigested food, breathing out the fumes of his intoxication—with pride, though, not with justice. “God,” he says, “I thank you because I am not like other men, robbers, unjust, adulterers, like this tax collector here.” …
Come, poor men—come along, hungry tax collector. Rather, stand there, where you are standing. The tax collector, you see, “was standing a long way off,” but the Lord was drawing near to the humble. He did not dare to raise his eyes to heaven; yet where he did not raise his eyes, that is where he had his heart.
