When the apostle says elsewhere, “I desire that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule their households,” he recommends the good of marriage with wisdom and apostolic authority. He does not impose the duty of bearing children. It is not to be treated as it were a law to be observed, at least in the case of those who have chosen the state of continence. Finally, he makes it clear why he has said this, by adding, “Give the adversary no occasion for abusing us. For already some have turned aside after Satan.” By these words he wishes us to understand that for the young widows whom he thought it fitting to be married, continence would have been better than marriage, but that it was better for them to marry than to turn aside after Satan, that is, by looking back to former things after having chosen the excellent state of chastity in virginity or widowhood, to abandon it and to perish.
