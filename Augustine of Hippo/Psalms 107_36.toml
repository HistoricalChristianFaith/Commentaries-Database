"And He caused the hungry to dwell there" [Psalm 107:36]. Because to Him it was said, "You are a Priest for ever, after the order of Melchizedec." For you seek a sacrifice among the Jews; you have none after the order of Aaron. You seek it after the order of Melchizedec; you find it not among them, but through the whole world it is celebrated in the Church. "From the rising of the sun to the setting thereof the name of the Lord is praised."
