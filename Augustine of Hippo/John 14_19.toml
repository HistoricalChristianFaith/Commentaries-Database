But why does he speak of life as present to him and future to them? Because his resurrection preceded, and theirs was to follow. His resurrection was about to take place so soon that he speaks of it as present, theirs being deferred till the end of the world. He does not say “you live” but “you shall live.” … Because he lives, therefore we shall live: “As by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.”
