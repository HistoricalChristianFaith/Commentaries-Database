In reading what is said in this psalm of Christ and of the church, one would find that what is there foretold is fulfilled in the present state of the world. He would see the idols of the nations perishing from off the earth, and he would find that this is predicted by the prophets, as in Jeremiah: “Then shall you say to them, ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under heaven,’ ” and again, “O Lord, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to you from the ends of the earth and shall say, ‘Surely our ancestors have inherited lies, vanity and things in which there is no profit. Shall a person make gods for himself, and they are not gods?’ Therefore, behold, I will at that time cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might, and they shall know that I am the Lord.” Hearing these prophecies and seeing their fulfillment, I need not say that he would be affected. We know from experience how the hearts of believers are confirmed by seeing ancient predictions now being fulfilled.
