If " one dies to whom one of these superstitious remedies has been given"and how many have died with remedies, and how many have lived without them!"with what confidence does his spirit go forth to God? He has lost the sign of Christ, receiving instead the sign of the devil. Perhaps he may say that he has not lost the sign of Christ. Can you have, then, the sign of Christ along with the sign of the devil? Christ does not want cooperative ownership. He desires to have sole possession of what he has purchased. He bought it at such a high price in order that he alone may possess it. Would you make him the partner of that devil to whom you have sold yourself by your sin? "Woe to the double-hearted," to those who in their hearts give a portion to God and a portion to the devil. Angered that the devil has a portion there, God leaves and the devil takes possession of the whole. There is a reason why the Apostle admonishes, "Allow no place for the devil." - "Tractates on the Gospel of John 7.7"
