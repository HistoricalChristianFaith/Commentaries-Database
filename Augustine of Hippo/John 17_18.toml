But now he still goes on to speak of the apostles, for he proceeds to add, “As you have sent me into the world, even so have I also sent them into the world.” Whom did he send in this way but his apostles? For even the very name of apostles, which is a Greek word, signifies in Latin nothing more than, those that are sent. God, therefore, sent his Son, not in sinful flesh but in the likeness of sinful flesh. And his Son sent those who (born themselves in sinful flesh) were sanctified by him from the defilement of sin.
