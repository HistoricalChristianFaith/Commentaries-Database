What, then, does it mean, “the flesh profits nothing”? It profits nothing, but [only] as they understood it. For, of course, they understood flesh as [something that] is torn to pieces in a carcass or sold in a meat market, not as [something that] is enlivened by a spirit. And so it was said, “The flesh profits nothing.” … But he is talking there about that flesh that is alone by itself. Let spirit be added to flesh … and it profits very much. For if flesh profited nothing, the Word would not have become flesh to dwell among us.
