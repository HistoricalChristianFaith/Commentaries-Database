We answer them: You have Christ’s baptism; come, in order to have Christ’s Spirit as well. Be afraid of what is written: “But anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ, that person does not belong to him.” You have put on Christ in the form of the sacrament; put him on by imitating his example, “since Christ suffered for us, leaving us an example, so that we might follow his footsteps.” Do not be people who “have the form of piety but deny its power.” What greater power could piety have than the love of unity? It says in the Psalms, “I have seen the end of every consummation; your commandment is exceedingly broad.” Which commandment, if not the one about which it says, “A new commandment I give you, that you should love one another”? Why “broad,” if not because “the love of God has been poured out in our hearts”? Why “an end of every” consummation, if not because “the fullness of the law is love; and the whole law is summed up in this” that is written: You shall love “your neighbor” as “yourself”? The way you people, though, love your neighbors as yourselves, is that while you do not want anything bad to be believed about you, which has neither been seen nor proved, you are happy to believe about the whole world what you have neither seen nor received any proof of.

Let us run, therefore, my brothers, let us run and let us love Christ. What Christ? Jesus Christ. Who is this? The Word of God. And how does he come to the sick? “The Word was made flesh and dwelled among us.” What Scripture foretold was, therefore, accomplished: “Christ will suffer and rise from the dead on the third day.” Where does his body lie? Where do his members toil? Where ought you to be so that you may be under the head? “And penance and remission of sins is to be preached in his name through all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.” Let your love be spread about there. Christ and the psalm, that is, the Spirit of God, say, “Exceedingly broad is your commandment”—and someone or other puts in Africa the boundaries of love! Extend love through the whole world if you wish to love Christ, because Christ’s members lie throughout the world. If you love apart, you have been divided. If you have been divided, you are not in the body. If you are not in the body, you are not under the head.

You have heard in the psalm, “I have seen an end to all perfection.” What had this person seen? Had he climbed, do we suppose, to the peak of some very high and very sharp mountain and had he looked out and seen the perimeter of the earth and the circles of the whole world and therefore said, “I have seen an end of all perfection”? If this is praiseworthy, let us seek from God eyes of flesh so sharp that we may look for some exceedingly lofty mountain that is on earth from whose top we may see an end of all perfection. Do not go far. Look, I say to you, climb onto the mountain and see the end. Christ is the mountain. Come to Christ; you see from there an end of all perfection. What is this end? Ask Paul. “Now the end of the commandment is love, from a pure heart and a good conscience and an unfeigned faith.” And in another place, “But love is the fulfillment of the law.”
