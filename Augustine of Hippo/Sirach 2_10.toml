“Listen, O God, to my prayer, while I am troubled; from fear of the enemy deliver my soul.” Enemies have raged against the martyrs. For what was that voice of Christ’s body praying? It was praying for this: to be delivered from enemies and praying that enemies might not have power to kill them. Were they not therefore listened to because they were killed, and has God forsaken his servants who have contrite hearts and despised those who hope in him? Certainly not. For “who has called on God and been forsaken; who has hoped in him and been deserted by him?” Therefore, they were heard, and they were killed—and yet, they were delivered from their enemies. Others who were afraid gave in and lived, and yet these same people were swallowed up by their enemies. The slain were delivered, the living were swallowed up. This is what that recognizable voice of the psalmist is referring to when it says, “Perhaps they would have devoured us alive.” Many, in fact, were devoured alive, but many others were devoured dead. The ones who considered Christianity as foolish were already dead, in fact, by the time they came to devour them.
