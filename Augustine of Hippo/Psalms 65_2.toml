"Hearken," he says, "to my prayer, unto You every flesh shall come" [Psalm 65:2]. And we have the Lord saying, that there was given to Him "power over every flesh." [John 17:2] That King therefore began even now to appear, when there was being said, "Unto You every flesh shall come." "To You," he says, "every flesh shall come." Wherefore to Him shall "every" flesh come? Because flesh He has taken to Him. Whither shall there come every flesh? He took the first-fruits thereof out of the womb of the Virgin; and now that the first-fruits have been taken to Him, the rest shall follow, in order that the holocaust may be completed. Whence then "every flesh"? Every man. And whence every man? Have all been foretold, as going to believe in Christ? Have not many ungodly men been foretold, that shall be condemned also? Do not daily men not believing die in their own unbelief? After what manner therefore do we understand, "Unto You every flesh shall come"? By "every flesh" he has signified, "flesh of every kind:" out of every kind of flesh they shall come to You. What is, out of every kind of flesh? Have there come poor men, and have there not come rich men? Have there come humble men, and not come lofty men? Have there come unlearned men, and not come learned men? Have there come men, and not come women? Have there come masters, and not come servants? Have there come old men, and not come young men; or have there come young men, and not come youths; or have there come youths, and not come boys; or have there come boys, and have there not been brought infants? In a word, have there come Jews  (for thence were the Apostles, thence many thousands of men at first betraying, afterwards believing [Acts 2:41]), and have there not come Greeks; or have there come Greeks, and not come Romans; or have there come Romans, and not come Barbarians? And who could number all nations coming to Him, to whom has been said, "Unto You every flesh shall come"?
