Our Lord wishes to reveal what he was. He might have said that he who believes in me has me.… But what is it “to have me”? It is to have eternal life. Eternal life took death on itself; eternal life willed to die.… Life underwent death, that life might kill death.… For eternal life is the Word that “in the beginning was with God, and the Word was God, and the life was the light of humanity.” The same eternal life gave eternal life also to the flesh that it assumed. He came to die; but on the third day he rose again. Between the Word taking flesh and the flesh rising again, death, which came between, was consumed.
