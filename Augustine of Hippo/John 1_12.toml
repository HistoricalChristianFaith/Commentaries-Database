John adds, “As many as received him.” What did he afford to them? Great benevolence! Great mercy! He was born the only Son of God and was unwilling to remain alone. Many, when they do not have sons, in advanced age adopt a son. In this way they obtain by an exercise of will what nature has denied to them. This is what people do. But if any one has an only son, that person rejoices the more in him, because he alone will possess everything, and he will not have anyone to divide with him the inheritance, so that he should be poorer. This is not how God does things. That same only Son whom he had begotten, and by whom he created all things, is the one he sent into this world so that he might not be alone but might have adopted brothers and sisters. For we were not born of God in the manner in which the Only Begotten was born of him, but we were adopted by his grace. For he, the Only Begotten, came to loose the sins in which we were entangled and whose burden hindered our adoption. Those whom he wished to make his brothers and sisters are the ones he himself freed and made joint heirs.… He was not afraid of having joint heirs, because his inheritance does not become less if its possessors are many. Those very persons, since he is the possessor, become his inheritance, and he in turn becomes their inheritance. … Let us possess him, and let him possess us. Let him possess us as Lord; let us possess him as salvation, let us possess him as light. What then did he give to them who received him? “To them he gave power to become sons of God, even to them that believe on his name,” that they may cling to the wood and cross the sea.

When any person … is … considered to be among the children of God, such an achievement must not be considered to have been accomplished by their ability alone. This ability they have received through the grace of God, because they did not possess it in a nature that had become corrupted and depraved.

I mean, you are not being told not to be a human, in the sense that you are to be a beast, but rather that you are to be among those to whom “he gave the right to become children of God.” God, you see, wants to make you a god; not by nature, of course, like the one whom he begot; but by his gift and by adoption. For just as he through being humbled31 came to share your mortality; so through lifting you up he brings you to share his immortality.

Now turn your attention to the doctor of our salvation who has come to us, our Lord Jesus Christ. He found us blind of heart, he promised us a light that “eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor has it come up into the heart of [a] man.” This is what the angels see, what they enjoy. I mean, just as healthy people see what the blind do not see, so angels see what people do not see. Why doesn’t [a] man see it? Because he still wants to be “man.” So let man [humankind] himself start getting cured, so that from being “man” he may be numbered among the sons of God, because “he gave them the right to become children of God,” that is, he gave them the right to be cured, to have the mistiness of heart wiped away, because “blessed are the pure in heart, because it is they who shall see God.”
