Listen now to what he adds: "Blessed are they that keep His testimonies, and seek Him with their whole heart" [Psalm 119:2]. No other class of the blessed seems to me to be mentioned in these words, than that which has been already spoken of. For to examine into the testimonies of the Lord, and to seek Him with all the heart, this is to be undefiled in the way, this is to walk in the law of the Lord.
