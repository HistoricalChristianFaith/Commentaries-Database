When, therefore, we look for the city of God in these seventytwo nations, we cannot affirm that while they had but one tongue, that is, one language, the human race had departed from the worship of the true God. Nor can we conclude that genuine godliness had survived only in those generations that descend from Shem through Arpachshad and reach to Abraham. But from the time when they proudly built a tower to heaven, a symbol of godless exaltation, the city or society of the wicked becomes apparent. Whether it was only disguised before or nonexistent, whether both cities remained after the flood—the godly in the two sons of Noah who were blessed and in their posterity, and the ungodly in the cursed son and his descendants, from whom sprang that mighty hunter against the Lord—is not easily determined.

But to avoid needless prolixity, we shall mention not the number of years each member of this series lived but only the year of his life in which he gave birth to his heir, that we may thus reckon the number of years from the flood to Abraham and may at the same time leave room to touch briefly and cursorily upon some other matters necessary to our argument. In the second year, then, after the flood, Shem when he was  years old begat Arpachshad; Arpachshad when he was  years old begat Cainan; Cainan when he was  years begat Salah. Salah himself, too, was the same age when he begat Eber. Eber lived  years and begat Peleg, in whose days the earth was divided. Peleg himself lived  years and begat Reu; and Reu lived  years and begat Serug; Serug , and begat Nahor; and Nahor , and begat Terah; and Terah , and begat Abram, whose name God afterwards changed into Abraham. There are thus from the flood to Abraham , years, according to the common or Septuagint versions. In the Hebrew copies far fewer years are given, and for this either no reason or a not very credible one is given.
