"Deliver me not up unto the souls of them that trouble me" [Psalm 27:12]. Suffer not them that trouble me to be satiated with my evils. "For unrighteous witnesses have risen up against me." For there have risen up against me they that speak falsely of me, to remove and call me back from You, as if I seek glory of men. "And iniquity has lied unto itself." Therefore iniquity has been pleased with its own lie. For me it has not moved, to whom because of this there has been promised a greater reward in heaven.
