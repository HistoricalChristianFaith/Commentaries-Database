Andrew was Peter’s brother, and we know from the Gospel that the Lord called Peter and Andrew from the ship, saying, “Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of men.” And from that time they joined him and did not leave him. On the present occasion these two followed him, however, not as those who were not again to leave him but to see where he was living and to fulfill the Scripture, “Let your foot wear out the threshold of his doors; get up and come to him continually and be instructed in his commandments.” He showed them where he lived. They came and remained with him.
