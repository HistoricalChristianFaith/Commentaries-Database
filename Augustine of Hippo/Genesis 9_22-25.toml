Why did Ham sin and yet vengeance was declared against his son Canaan? Why was the son of Solomon punished by the breaking up of the kingdom? Why was the sin of Ahab, king of Israel, visited upon his posterity? How do we read in the sacred books, “Returning the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them” and “Visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation?” The number here can be taken for all the descendants. Are these statements false? Who would say this but the most open enemy of the divine words? Then carnal generation even of the people of God of the Old Testament binds children for the sins of their parents.

When subjection came, it was merely a condition deservedly imposed on sinful man. So, in Scripture, there is no mention of the word slave until holy Noah used it in connection with the curse on his son’s wrongdoing.
