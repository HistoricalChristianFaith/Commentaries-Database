"For behold, God helps me" [Psalm 54:4]. Even themselves know not themselves, amid whom I am hiding. But if they too were to set God before their face, they would find in what manner God helps me. For all holy men are helped by God, but within, where no one sees. For in like manner as the conscience of ungodly men is a great punishment, so a great joy is the very conscience of godly men. "For our glory this is," says the Apostle, "the testimony of our conscience." [2 Corinthians 1:12] In this within, not in the flower of the Ziphites without, does glory that man that now says, "For behold God helps me." Surely though afar off are to be those things which He promises, this day have I a sweet and present help; today in my heart's joy I find that without cause certain say, "Who does show to us good things? For there is signed upon us the light of Your countenance, O Lord, You have put pleasantness into my heart."  Not into my vineyard, not into my flock, not into my cask, not into my table, but "into my heart." "For behold God helps me." How does He help you? "And the Lord is the lifter up of my soul."
