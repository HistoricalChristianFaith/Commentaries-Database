"And He sent out His arrows, and scattered them" [Psalm 18:14]. And He sent out Evangelists traversing straight paths on the wings of strength, not in their own power, but His by whom they were sent. And "He scattered them," to whom they were sent, that to some of them they should be "the savour of life unto life, to others the savour of death unto death." [2 Corinthians 2:16] "And He multiplied lightnings, and troubled them." And He multiplied miracles, and troubled them.
