"Then believed they in His words" [Psalm 106:12]. The expression seems barely Latin, for he says not "believed His word,"  or "on His words,"  but "in His words;"  yet it is very frequent in Scripture. "And praised praise unto Him;" such an expression as when we say, "This servitude he served," "such a life he lived." He is here alluding to that well-known hymn, commencing, "I will sing unto the Lord, for He has triumphed gloriously: the horse and the rider has He thrown into the sea."
