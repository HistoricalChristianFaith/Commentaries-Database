Be there done that which follows, "Rebuke the beasts of the cane" [Psalm 68:30]. For both beasts they are, since by not understanding they do hurt: and beasts of the cane they are, since the sense of the Scriptures they wrest according to their own misapprehension. For in the cane the Scriptures are as reasonably perceived, as language in tongue, according to the mode of expression whereby the Hebrew or the Greek or the Latin tongue is spoken of, or the like; that is to say, by the efficient cause the thing which is being effected is implied. Now it is usual in the Latin language for writing to be called style, because with the stilus it is done: so then cane also, because with a cane it is done. The Apostle Peter says, that "men unlearned and unstable do wrest the Scriptures to their own proper destruction:" [2 Peter 3:16] these are the beasts of the cane, whereof here is said, "Rebuke the beasts of the cane."
