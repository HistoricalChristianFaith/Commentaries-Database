"Then again called they the man that had been blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner." Give God the praise: Deny what thou hast received. This, in truth, is not to give God the praise, but rather to blaspheme God. "Give God the praise." "We know that this man is a sinner. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."
