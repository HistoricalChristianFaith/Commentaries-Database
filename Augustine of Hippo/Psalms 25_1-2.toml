"Unto You, O Lord, have I lift up my soul" [Psalm 25:1]: with spiritual longing have I lift up the soul, that was trodden down on the earth with carnal longings. "O my God, in You I trust, I shall not be ashamed" [Psalm 25:2]. O my God, from trusting in myself I was brought even to this weakness of the flesh; and I who on abandoning God wished to be as God, fearing death from the smallest insect, was in derision ashamed for my pride; now, therefore, "in You I trust, I shall not be ashamed."
