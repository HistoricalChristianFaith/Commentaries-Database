Of what else than the advent of Christ, who was to come, is Habakkuk understood to say, “And the Lord answered me, and said, ‘Write the vision openly on a tablet of boxwood so that the one who reads these things may understand.’ ” For the vision is yet for a time appointed, and it will arise in the end, and it will not become void. If it delays, wait for it, because it will surely come and will not be delayed.
