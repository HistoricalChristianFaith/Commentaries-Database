He was not silent here as to why we should do these things, adding to his statement, “And you yourselves should be like men waiting for their master’s return from the wedding.” When he comes, he will repay us who have restrained ourselves from yielding to what lust has demanded and who have done what love has commanded, that we might reign in his perfect and everlasting peace, free from the struggle of evil and enjoying the supreme delight of good.
