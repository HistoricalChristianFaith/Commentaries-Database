"The lines have fallen to me in glorious places" [Psalm 16:6]. The boundaries of my possession have fallen in Your glory as it were by lot, like as God is the possession of the Priests and Levites. [NumbersÂ 18:20] "For Mine inheritance is glorious to Me." "For Mine inheritance is glorious," not to all, but to them that see; in whom because I am, "it is to Me."
