It was not in vain that the prophecy had preceded him: “As a lamb before its shearer is dumb, so he opened not his mouth.” When he did not open his mouth, it was reminiscent of the figure of a lamb. It was not as one of bad conscience convicted of sins, but as one who in his meekness was being sacrificed for the sins of others.
