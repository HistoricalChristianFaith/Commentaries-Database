This is confessed by this little one; "I opened my mouth," he says, "and drew in the spirit: for I longed for Your commandments" [Psalm 119:131]. What did he long for, save to obey the divine commandments? But there was no possibility of the weak doing hard things, the little one great things: he opened his mouth, confessing that he could not do them of himself: and drew in power to do them: he opened his mouth, by seeking, asking, knocking: [Matthew 7:7] and thirsty drank in the good Spirit, which enabled him to do what he could not do by himself, "the commandment holy and just and good." [Romans 7:12] Not that they themselves who "are led by the Spirit of God," [Romans 8:14] do nothing; but that they may not do nothing good, they are moved to act by the good Spirit. For so much the more is every man made a good son, in proportion as the good Spirit is given unto Him by the Father in a greater measure.
