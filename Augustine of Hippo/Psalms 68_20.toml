[David] had expectations from God in line with the old covenant, not realizing that it contains signs of things to come—so he was expecting to receive good fortune in this life from God, and he was looking on this earth for what God is keeping for his people in heaven. He wanted to be happy here, though happiness is not to be found here. Happiness, you see, is of course something great and good, but it has its own proper region. It was from the region of happiness that Christ came, and not even he found it here. He was jeered at, he was reviled, he was arrested, he was scourged, he was bound, he was knocked about, insulted with spittle, he was crowned with thorns, hanged on a tree. And finally—"even for the Lord is the departure of death." It is written in a psalm (those who caught the allusion applauded): "Even for the Lord is the departure of death." So why, slave, do you seek happiness here, where even for the Lord is the departure of death?
