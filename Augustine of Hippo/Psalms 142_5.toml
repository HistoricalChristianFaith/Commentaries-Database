"Unto you have I cried, O Lord: I have said, You are my hope" [Psalm 142:5]. When I endured, when I was in tribulation, "I said, You are my hope." My hope here, therefore I endure. But "my portion," not here, but "in the land of the living." God gives a portion in the land of the living; but not something from Himself without Himself. What will He give to one that loves Him, save Himself?

6. "Unto thee have I cried, O Lord: I have said, Thou art my hope" (ver. 5). When I endured, when I was in tribulation, "I said, Thou art my hope." My hope here, therefore I endure. But "my portion," not here, but "in the land of the living." God giveth a portion in the land of the living; but not something from Himself without Himself. What will He give to one that loveth Him, save Himself?
