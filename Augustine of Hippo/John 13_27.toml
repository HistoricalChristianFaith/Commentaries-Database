But now, after the bread, Satan entered into Judas, no longer to tempt one who belonged to another but to take possession of him as his own.

The one who persuaded Judas to betray Christ is the one who persuaded him to hang himself with a noose. He repented, you remember, of “having betrayed righteous blood,” but his repentance was without hope. He repented, but he also despaired. He did not believe he would receive mercy. He did not come to the one he had betrayed and ask him his pardon. He did not ask for pardon from him; he did not implore him to set him free; he did not entrust himself to his blood for redemption.
