"The Lord reigns, He is clothed with beauty; the Lord is clothed with strength, and is girded" [Psalm 93:1]. We see that He has clothed Himself with two things: beauty and strength. But why? That He might found the earth. So it follows, "He has made the round world so sure, that it cannot be moved." Whence has He made it so sure? Because He has clothed Himself in beauty. He would not make it so sure, if He put on beauty only, and not strength also. Why therefore beauty, why strength? For He has said both. You know, brethren, that when our Lord had come in the flesh, of those to whom He preached the Gospel, He pleased some, and displeased others. For the tongues of the Jews were divided against one another: "Some said, He is a good Man; others said, Nay, but He deceives the people." [JohnÂ 7:12] Some then spoke well, others detracted from Him, tore Him, bit and insulted Him. Towards those therefore whom He pleased, "He put on beauty;" towards those whom He displeased, "He put on strength." Imitate then your Lord, that you may become His garment: be with beauty towards those whom your good works please: show your strength against detractors....
