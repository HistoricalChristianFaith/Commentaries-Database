Again they say, “Who made the devil?” He made himself; for the devil was made by sinning, not by nature. “Or,” they say, “God should not have made him if he knew that he would sin.” On the contrary, why should he not have made him? For through his own justice and providence God corrects many as a result of the malice of the devil. Or have you perhaps not heard the apostle Paul saying, “And I handed them over to Satan so that they might learn not to blaspheme”? On Genesis, Against the Manichaeans.

Let us learn, brethren, when actions are alike, to distinguish the intentions of the actors; otherwise, if we shut our eyes to this, we might judge falsely, and we might accuse wellwishers of doing us harm. Likewise, when the same apostle says that he delivered up certain men to Satan, “that they may learn not to blaspheme,” did he render evil for evil, or did he, rather, judge that it was a good work to correct evil men even by evil? Letters.

Out of love the apostle delivered a man up to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit might be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.
