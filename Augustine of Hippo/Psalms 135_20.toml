"Bless the Lord, you house of Aaron. Bless the Lord, you house of Levi" [Psalm 135:20]. Bless the Lord, you nations, this is, the "house of Israel" generally; bless Him, you leaders, this is, the "house of Aaron;" bless Him, you servants, this is, the "house of Levi." What of the other nations? "You that fear the Lord, bless the Lord."
