"Who brought out Israel from the midst of them" [Psalm 136:11]. He brought out also His saints and faithful ones from the midst of the wicked. "With a mighty Hand and stretched-out Arm" [Psalm 136:12]. What more powerful, what more out-stretched, than that of which is said "To whom is the Arm of the Lord revealed?" [Isaiah 53:1] "Who divided the Red Sea in two parts" [Psalm 136:13]. He divided also in such wise, that the same baptism should be to some unto life, to others unto death. "And brought out Israel through the midst of it" [Psalm 136:14]. So too He brings out His renewed people through the laver of regeneration. "And overthrew Pharaoh and his power in the Red Sea" [Psalm 136:15]. He quickly destroys both the sin of His people and the guilt thereof by baptism. "Who led His people through the wilderness" [Psalm 136:16]. Us too He leads through the drought and barrenness of this world, that we perish not therein. "Who smote great kings" [Psalm 136:17], "and slew famous kings" [Psalm 136:18]. From us too He smites and slays the deadly powers of the devil. "Sehon king of the Amorites" [Psalm 136:19], an "useless shoot," or "fiery temptation," for so is Sehon interpreted: the king of "them who cause bitterness," for such is the meaning of Amorites. "And Og, the king of Basan" [Psalm 136:20]. The "heaper-together," such is the meaning of Og, and, king of "confusion," which Basan signifies. For what else does the devil heap together but confusion? "And gave away their land for an heritage" [Psalm 136:21], "even an heritage unto Israel His servant" [Psalm 136:22]. For He gives them, whom once the devil owned, for an heritage to the seed of Abraham, that is, Christ. "Who remembered us in our low estate" [Psalm 136:23], "and redeemed us from our enemies" [Psalm 136:24] by the Blood of His only-begotten Son. "Who gives food to all flesh" [Psalm 136:25], that is, to the whole race of mankind, not Israelites only, but Gentiles too; and of this Food is said, "My Flesh is meat indeed." "Give thanks unto the God of Heaven" [Psalm 136:26]. "Give thanks unto the Lord of lords" [Psalm 136:27]. For what he here says, "the God of Heaven," I suppose that he meant to express in other words what He had before said, "the God of gods." For what there he subjoined, he has here also repeated. "Give thanks unto the Lord of lords." "But to us there is but one God," etc., "and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him;" [1 Corinthians 8:5-6] to whom we confess that "His mercy endures for ever."
