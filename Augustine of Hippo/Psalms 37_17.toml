..."For the arms of the wicked shall be broken" [Psalm 37:17]. Now by "their arms" is meant their power. What will he do in hell? Will it be what the rich man had to do, he who was wont "to fare sumptuously" in the upper world, and in hell "was tormented"?  Therefore their arms shall be broken; "but the Lord upholds the righteous." How does He "uphold" them? What says He unto them? Even what is said in another Psalm, "Wait on the Lord, be of good courage; and let your heart be strengthened. Wait, I say, on the Lord."  What is meant by this, "Wait on the Lord"? Thou sufferest but for a time; you shall rest for ever: your trouble is short; your happiness is to be everlasting. It is but for "a little while" you are to sorrow; your joy shall have no end. But in the midst of trouble does your "foot" begin to "slip"? The example even of Christ's sufferings is set before you. Consider what He endured for you, in whom no cause was found why He should endure it? How great soever be your sufferings, you will not come to those insults, those scourgings, to that robe of shame, to that crown of thorns, and last of all to that Cross, which He endured; because that is now removed from the number of human punishments.  For though under the ancients criminals were crucified, in the present day no one is crucified. It was honoured, and it came to an end. It came to an end as a punishment; it is continued in glory. It has removed from the place of execution to the foreheads of Emperors. He who has invested His very sufferings with such honour, what does He reserve for His faithful servants?...
