And how is it declared? "In the nations gathering together in one, and the kingdoms, that they may serve the Lord" [Psalm 102:22]. How is this accomplished, unless by the blood of the slain? How accomplished, but by the groans of the fettered? Those therefore who were in tribulation and humility have been heard; that in our times the Church might be in the great glory which we see her in, so that the very kingdoms which then persecuted her, now serve the Lord.
