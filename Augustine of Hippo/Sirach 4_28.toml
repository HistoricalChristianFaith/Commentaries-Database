“Martyrs” is a Greek word; however, tradition nowadays uses this name instead of the Latin one; in Latin, rather, one would say “witnesses.” So, there are authentic martyrs, and there are false ones. There are, in fact, true witnesses and false witnesses. But the Scripture affirms, “The false witness will not remain unpunished.” If the false one does not remain unpunished, then the true witness will not remain without rewards. Certainly, it would be an easy thing to render testimony to the Lord Jesus Christ and to the truth of him being God; but it would be an assignment arduous enough to render it until death. There were some leaders of the Jews, cited in the Gospel, who believed in the Lord Jesus; but because of the Jews, it is said, they did not dare to recognize him publicly. And it is immediately noted down in the passage; in fact, the Evangelist, continuing, affirms, “For they loved the glory of people more than the glory of God.” There were, then, those who, before people, were ashamed to recognize Christ; there were still others, certainly better, who were not ashamed to recognize Christ before people, but who were incapable of confessing him unto death. In fact, the gifts of God are such that sometimes they only gradually develop themselves in the soul. First pay attention, then confront among them these three categories of witnesses: the first includes he who believes in Christ and hardly manages to whisper his name; the next, he who believes in Christ and recognizes him openly; the third, he who believes in Christ and, in his confession, is ready to die for Christ. The first is so weak that his shame prevails over his fear; the second already puts on a brave face, but not yet until the blood; the third has everything, so there is nothing left to be desired. He meets in fact all that is written: “He fights until death for the truth.”
