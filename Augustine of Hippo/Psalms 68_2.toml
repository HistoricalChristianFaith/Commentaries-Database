"As smoke fails, let them fail" [Psalm 68:2]. For they lifted up themselves from the fires of their hatred unto the vapouring of pride, and against Heaven setting their mouth, and shouting, "Crucify, Crucify," [JohnÂ 19:6] Him taken captive they derided, Him hanging they mocked: and being soon conquered by that very Person against whom they swelled victorious, they vanished away. "As wax melts from the face of fire, so let sinners perish from the face of God." Though perchance in this passage he has referred to those men, whose hard-heartedness in tears of penitence is dissolved: yet this also may be understood, that he threatens future judgment; because though in this world like smoke, in lifting up themselves, that is, in priding themselves, they have melted away, there will come to them at the last final damnation, so that from His face they will perish for everlasting, when in His own glory He shall have appeared, like fire, for the punishment of the ungodly, and the light of the righteous.
