The signs given in the Gospel and in prophecy and fulfilled in us show the coming of the Lord…. We know that the coming is near by the fact that we see the fulfillment of certain signs of that coming that have been accomplished…. The signs that Christ told them to look for are listed in the Gospel of Saint Luke: “Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the times of the nations are fulfilled.” This has happened and no one doubts that it has happened…. It is plain that there is no country or place in our time that is not harassed or humbled according to the words “for fear and expectation of what will come on the whole world.” All the signs that the gospel describes in the earlier verses have mostly been accomplished.

Anyone can see that he refers to that city when Christ says, “When you shall see Jerusalem surrounded by an army, then know that its desolation is near.” Anyone can see that these words refer to the last coming of the Lord when he says, “When you shall see these things come to pass, know that the kingdom of God is near.” When he says, “Alas for those who are with child and for those who give suck in those days! Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a sabbath. For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be.” This passage is phrased in this way in Matthew and Mark so that it is uncertain whether it is to be understood of the destruction of the city or of the end of the world…. Luke has so arranged it that it seems to refer to the destruction of that city.
