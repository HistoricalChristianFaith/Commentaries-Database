"And the way of sinners He shall root out." What is, "the way of sinners"? To mock at these things which we say. Who is an orphan, who a widow? What kingdom of heaven, what punishment of hell is there? These are fables of the Christians. To what I see, to that will I live: "let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die." [1 Corinthians 15:32] Beware lest such men persuade you of anything: let them not enter through your ears into your heart; let them find thorns in your ears: let him, who seeks to enter thus, go away pierced: for "evil communications corrupt good manners." [1 Corinthians 15:33] But here perhaps you will say, "Wherefore then are they prosperous? Behold, they worship not God, and commit every kind of evil daily: yet they abound in those things, through want of which I toil." Be not envious against sinners. What they receive, you see, what is in store for them, do you not see?...Will you not believe even the Lord your God, who says, "Broad and spacious is the way that leads to destruction, and many there be that walk by it"? [Matthew 7:13] This "way the Lord will root out." And, when "the way of sinners" has been "rooted out," what remains for us? "Come, you blessed of My father, enjoy the Kingdom;" [Matthew 25:34] "The Lord shall reign for ever" [Psalm 146:10]. "O Sion, your God" shall reign for ever; surely your God will not reign without you. "For generation and generation." He has said it twice, because he could not say it for ever. And think not that eternity is bounded by finite words. The word eternity consists of four syllables; in itself it is without end. It could not be commended to you, save thus, "for generation and generation." Too little has he said: if he spoke it all day long, it were too narrow: if he spoke it all his life, must he not at length hold his peace? Love eternity: without end shall you reign, if Christ be your End, with whom you shall reign for ever and ever. Amen.
