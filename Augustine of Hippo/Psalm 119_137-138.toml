Thus, then, as if giving a reason why he had cause to weep much, and to mourn deeply for his sin, he says, "Righteous are You, O Lord, and true is Your judgment" [Psalm 119:137]. "You have commanded Your testimonies, righteousness, and Your truth exceedingly" [Psalm 119:138]. This righteousness of God and righteous judgment and truth, is to be feared by every sinner: for thereby all who are condemned are condemned of God; nor is there one who can righteously complain against the righteous God of his own damnation. Therefore the tears of the penitent are needful; since if his impenitent heart were condemned, he would be most justly condemned. He indeed calls the testimonies of God righteousness: for He proves himself righteous by giving righteous commandments. And this is truth also, that God may become known by such testimonies.
