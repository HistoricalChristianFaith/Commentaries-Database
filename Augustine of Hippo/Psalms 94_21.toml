For what follows? "They will be captious against the soul of the righteous" [Psalm 94:21]. Why will they be captious? Because they can find no true ground of accusation. For how were they captious against our Lord? They made up false accusations, [Matthew 26:59] because they could not find true ones. "And will condemn the innocent blood." Why all this takes place, he will show in the sequel.
