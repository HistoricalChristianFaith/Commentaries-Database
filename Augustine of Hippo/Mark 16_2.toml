All the Gospels refer to the period when the heavens were just beginning to brighten in the east. This, of course, does not take place until the sunrise is at hand. For it is the brightness which is diffused by the rising sun that is familiarly designated by the name of the dawn. Mark does not contradict the other Evangelist who uses the phrase, “When it was yet dark.” For as the day breaks, what remains of the darkness passes away just in proportion as the sun continues to rise.
