What do we do with such a useful member? With it we pray to God. With it we make amends. With it we utter praises. With it we sing with one voice in harmony to God. With it every day we show ourselves kind and considerate when we talk to others or give them advice. What are we doing at this very moment? This very tongue of mine is performing you a service. What are we to do, in order not to transgress with the tongue? Especially as it is written, “Death and life are in the hands of the tongue,” and again it is written, “I saw many fall by the edge of the sword, but not like those who fell by the tongue.” Again it is written, “And the tongue is established among our members, as something that defiles our whole body.” And yet again the same Lord says, “They have taught their tongues to speak lies.” - "Sermon 16a.2"
