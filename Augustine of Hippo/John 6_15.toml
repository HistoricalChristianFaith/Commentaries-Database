Indeed our Lord teaches us here that whenever escape is necessary, there is an even greater necessity for prayer.

"When therefore Jesus knew that they would come and take Him by force, to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone." Christ now a king, nay, always a king, but having His kingdom not from men. What did He humble Himself by not accepting, which He always had? And further, who is so king as He, who sways the minds and hearts of believers?

But such a king they wished to make Him, as could be made by men: Jesus would not be; for He was such a king as even Himself to make men. He was of another order, who came for this purpose to the world. What, then, is it, that He would not be made a king? He would not be made the king that would make the felicity of men to consist in that sort of happiness that is earthly. Let them conceive this, who are rejoicing to have made a king for themselves, not out of Christ's flock, but out of the goats. Our Lord Jesus Christ therefore exhibited this fact to human minds, that a man ought not to be elated when he has the applause of the people; even as He ought not to fear when they speak evil against him.
