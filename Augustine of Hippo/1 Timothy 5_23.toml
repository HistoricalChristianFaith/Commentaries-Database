Because of the necessary activities of this life, health is not to be despised until “this mortal shall put on immortality,” and that is the true and perfect and unending health which is not refreshed by corruptible pleasure when it fails through earthly weakness but is maintained by heavenly strength and made young by eternal incorruptibility. The apostle himself says, “Make not provision for the flesh in its concupiscence,” because our care of the flesh must be in view of the exigencies of salvation. “For no man ever hated his own flesh.”

Thus, many Christians do not eat meat, yet they do not superstitiously consider it unclean. And the same individuals who abstain when healthy take meat without qualm when sick, if it be required as a cure. Many do not drink wine. Nevertheless, they do not think it would defile them. In fact, they show great sympathy and good judgment in seeing that it is provided for those who tend to be listless and for all who cannot maintain bodily health without it.
