Let us hear also why He doth not cast out him that cometh: "For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." Therefore dost Thou not cast out him that cometh, because Thou camest down from heaven, not to do Thine own will, but the will of Him that sent Thee? Explain, tell us: why is this the reason why Thou castest not out him that cometh to Thee? Pride casteth out, humility casteth not out. Wherefore pride casteth out: because it doeth its own will. Wherefore humility casteth not out: "because I came, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." For that cause did the Lord deign in this place to commend humility to us. Our soul departed from God when proud: we return to God when humble. Even as in a disease, when any humor abounding in the body breaks through the skin, they say that the disease has come out; but there is no healing, unless that which burst forth externally return inward and become sound: so did our soul break out by swelling, and was as it were in wound and ulcer of pride. She was cast out of Paradise; and because wounded in the inner man by pride, she was cast into a mortal body, and thereby drank in dissolution, and learnt to love pride: in pride could she not return. That she might return, the Lord came to her, Himself without any sin, neither with any tumor of pride; and He came to die and pay His death for our sins, that humbled she might return, who proud was cast out.

For He Himself teaches us humility by doing, not His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him. Art thou proud, O man? and God humbled Himself. Perchance thou wouldest be ashamed to imitate a humble man: at least imitate the humble God. God's Son came in man, and was made humble. It is enjoined thee to be humble, not to become a brute: He, God, was made man; thou, O man, acknowledge that thou art man; all thy humility is, to know thyself.

Since therefore God teaches humility, He saith, "I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." For this is pride, to do one's own will: for humility, to do the will of God. Wherefore, "him that cometh to me, I will not cast out." Why? "Because I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." I came humble, I came to teach humility, I came a master of humility: he that cometh to me, is incorporated with me; he that cometh to me becomes humble; he that cleaveth to me will be humble; because he doth, not his own will, but the will of God; and therefore he is not cast out, because when he was proud he was cast out.
