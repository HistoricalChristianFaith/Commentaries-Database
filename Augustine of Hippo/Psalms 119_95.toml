"The ungodly," he says, "have awaited me that they might destroy me; but I have understood Your testimonies" [Psalm 119:95]. What means, "that they might destroy me"? Did he then fear that he should perish altogether at the death of his body? God forbid! And what means, "have awaited me," save that he should consent with them unto iniquity? For then they would destroy him. And he has said why he has not perished: "I understood Your testimonies." The Greek word, Μαρτύρια, sounds more familiarly to the ears of the Church. For though they should slay me not consenting unto them, yet while I confessed Your testimonies (martyria) I should not perish; but they who, that they might destroy me, were waiting till I should consent unto them, tortured me even when I did confess them. Yet he did not leave that which he had understood, looking on it and seeing an end without end, if only he should persevere unto the end.
