"Break the arm of the sinner and of the malicious" [Psalm 10:15]; of him, namely, of whom it was said above, "He shall have dominion over all his enemies." He called his power then, his arm; to which Christ's power is opposed, of which it is said, "Arise, O Lord God, let Your hand be exalted. His fault shall be required, and he shall not be found because of it;"  that is he shall be judged for his sins, and himself shall perish because of his sin. After this, what wonder if there follow, "The Lord shall reign for ever and world without end; ye heathen shall perish out of His earth"? [Psalm 10:16]. He uses heathen for sinners and ungodly.
