"Many there are that trouble me, and persecute me; yet do I not swerve from Your testimonies" [Psalm 119:157]. This has been realized: we know it, we recollect it, we acknowledge it. The whole earth has been crimsoned by the blood of Martyrs; heaven is flowery with the crowns of Martyrs, the Churches are adorned with the memorials of Martyrs, seasons distinguished by the birthdays of Martyrs, cures more frequent  by the merits of Martyrs. Whence this, save because that has been fulfilled which was prophesied  of that Man who has been spread abroad around the whole world. We recognize this, and render thanks to the Lord our God. For thou, man, you have yourself said in another Psalm, "If the Lord Himself had not been on our side, they would have swallowed us up quick."  Behold the reason why you have not swerved from His testimonies, and hast won the palm of your heavenly calling amid the hands of the many who persecuted and troubled you.
