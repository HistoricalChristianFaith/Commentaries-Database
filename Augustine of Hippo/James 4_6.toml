quote='''
Give me someone professing perpetual continence, who is free from all vices and blemishes of conduct. For her I fear prideâ€”I dread the swelling of self-conceit from so great a blessing. The more there is in her which she is satisfied with, the more I fear that in pleasing herself she will displease the one who resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.
