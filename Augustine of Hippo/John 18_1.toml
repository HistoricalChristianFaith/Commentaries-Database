Matthew proceeds with his narrative … as follows: “Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane.” This is mentioned also by Mark. Luke, too, refers to it, although he does not mention the piece of ground by name.… There, we understand, was also the garden that John brings into notice when he gives his narrative.
