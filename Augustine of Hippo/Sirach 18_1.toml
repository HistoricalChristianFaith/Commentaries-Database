Scripture narrates the story of how the God who finished all his work in six days is the same one who it says elsewhere, and without any contradiction, that “he created everything at the same time.” Consequently, he who created all things at the same time simultaneously also simultaneously created these six or seven days, or, rather, this one day repeating the day six or seven times. What need was there to enumerate these six days in such a precise and ordered way? Surely it was necessary for those who cannot arrive at a comprehension that “God created everything at the same time,” that Scripture accompanied them more slowly, step by step, to the final goal of the story to which it was leading them.
