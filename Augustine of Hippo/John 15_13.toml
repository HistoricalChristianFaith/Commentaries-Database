But “greater love has no one than this, that he should lay down his life for his friends.” No one, you think? Absolutely no one. It is true; Christ said it. Let us question the apostle, and let him answer us: “Christ,” he says, “died for the ungodly.” And again he says, “While we were enemies, we were reconciled with God through the death of his Son.” So there you are. In Christ we do find greater love, seeing that he gave up his life not for his friends but for his enemies. How great must be God’s love for humanity and what extraordinary affection, so to love even sinners that he would die for love of them! “For God emphasizes his love toward us”—they are the apostle’s words—“because while we were still sinners Christ died for us.”
