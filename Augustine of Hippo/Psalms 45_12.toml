"And the daughters of Tyre shall worship Him with gifts" [Psalm 45:12]. It is that selfsame "King, who is your God," that the daughters of Tyre shall worship with gifts. The daughters of Tyre are the daughters of the Gentiles; the part standing for the whole. Tyre, a city bordering on this country, where the prophecy was delivered, typified the nations that were to believe in Christ. Thence came that Canaanitish woman, who was at first called "a dog;" for that you may know that she was from thence, the Gospel speaks thus. "He departed into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts," with all the rest that is related there. She who at first, at the house of her "father," and among her "own people," was but "a dog," who by coming to, and crying after that "King," was made beautiful by believing in Him, what did she obtain to hear? "O woman, great is your faith." [Matthew 15:21-28] "The King has greatly desired your beauty. And the daughters of Tyre shall worship with gifts."  With what gifts? Even so would this King be approached, and would have His treasuries filled: and it is He Himself who has given us that wherewith they may be filled, and may be filled  by you. Let them come (He says) and "worship Him with gifts." What is meant by "with gifts"?..."Give alms, and all things are clean unto you." Come with gifts to Him that says, "I will have mercy rather than sacrifice."  To that Temple that existed aforetime as a shadow of that which was to come, they used to come with bulls, and rams, and goats, with every different kind of animal for sacrifice: that with that blood one thing should be done, and another be typified by it. Now that very blood, which all these things used to figure, has come: the King Himself has come, and He Himself would have your "gifts." What gifts? Alms. For He Himself will judge hereafter, and will Himself hereafter account "gifts" to certain persons. "Come" (He says), "ye blessed of My Father." Why? "I was an hungred, and you gave Me meat," [Matthew 25:34-35] etc. These are the gifts with which the daughters of Tyre worship the King; for when they said, "When saw we You?" He who is at once above and below (whence those "ascending" and "descending" are spoken of ), said, "Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of Mine, you have done it unto Me." [Matthew 25:40]
