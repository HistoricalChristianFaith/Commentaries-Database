"You shall bless the crown of the year of Your goodness" [Psalm 65:11]. Seed is now sowing, that which is sown is growing, there will be the harvest too. And now over the seed the enemy has sown tares; and there have risen up evil ones among the good, false Christians, having like leaf, but not like fruit. For those are properly called tares,  which spring up in the manner of wheat, for instance darnel, for instance wild oats, and all such as have the first leaf the same. Therefore of the sowing of the tares thus says the Lord: "There has come an enemy, and has sown over them tares;" [Matthew 13:25] but what has he done to the grain? The wheat is not choked by the tares, nay, through endurance of the tares the fruit of the wheat is increased. For the Lord Himself said to certain workmen desiring to root up the tares, "Suffer ye both to grow unto the harvest." [Matthew 13:30] ...Conquer the devil, and you will have a crown. "You shall bless the crown of the year of Your goodness." Again he makes reference to the goodness of God, lest any one boast of his own merits. "Your plains shall be filled with abundance."
