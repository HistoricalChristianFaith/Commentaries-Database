"Because my heart was delighted" [Psalm 73:21]. He is saying with what things he is tempted: "because my heart was delighted," he says, "my reins also were changed." When those temporal things delighted me, my reins were changed. It may also be understood thus: "because my heart was delighted" in God, my reins also were changed, that is, my lusts were changed, and I became wholly chaste. "My reins were changed."
