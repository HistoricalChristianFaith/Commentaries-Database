The Lord made whole the humble and the poor. The rulers, however, were mad and therefore not only did not acknowledge the Physician but even were eager to kill him. There was a crowd of people that quickly saw its own sickness, though, and without delay recognized his remedy. Look at what that very crowd, moved by his miracles, said: “When Christ comes, will he do more signs than these?” Unless there are two Christs, this is surely the Christ.
