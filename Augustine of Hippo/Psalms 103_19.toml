"The Lord has prepared His throne in heaven" [Psalm 103:19]. Who but Christ has prepared His throne in heaven? He who descended and ascended, He who died, and rose from the dead, He who lifted up to heaven the manhood He had assumed, has Himself prepared His throne in heaven. The throne is the seat of the Judge: observe therefore ye who hear, that "He has prepared His throne in heaven."...The kingdom is the Lord's, and He shall be the Governor among the people.  "And His kingdom shall rule over all."
