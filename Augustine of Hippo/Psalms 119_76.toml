"O let Your merciful kindness be my comfort, according to Your word unto Your servant" [Psalm 119:76]. Next mercy, whereby we are renewed unto life, by the promise of Him whose blessing is His grace. For this reason he says, "according to Your Word unto Your servant:" that is, according to that which You have promised unto Your servant. Whether therefore it be regeneration whereby we are here adopted among the sons of God, or faith and hope and charity, which three are built up in us, although they come from the mercy of God; nevertheless, in this stormy and troublesome life they are the consolations of the miserable, not the joys of the blessed.
