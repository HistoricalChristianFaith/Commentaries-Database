“And those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast; and the door was shut.” Then the foolish virgins came afterward. But had they bought any oil? Had they found any from whom they might buy it? No. Therefore they found the doors shut. They began to knock, but too late.

Now it is no wonder that precisely “while they were going out to buy,” while they were seeking for praise from others and found none, while they were seeking for persons by whom to be comforted and found none—just then the shut door opened. Just then “the bridegroom came,” and the bride, the church, was glorified then with Christ and all its members gathered together into one.
