For when he had said, "We have received Your mercy in the midst of Your people," he signified that there is a people not receiving the mercy of God, in the midst of whom some do receive the mercy of God: and then lest it should occur to men that there are so few, as to be nearly none, how did He console them in the words following? "According to Your Name, O God, so is Your praise unto the ends of the earth" [Psalm 48:9]. What is this? ...That is, as You are known through all the earth, so You are also praised through all the earth, nor are there wanting who now praise You through all the earth. But they praise You who live well. For, "According to Your Name, O God, so is Your praise," not in a part, but "unto the ends of the earth." "Your right hand is full of righteousness." That is, many are they also who shall stand at Your right hand. Not only shall they be many who shall stand at Your left hand, but there also shall be a full heap set at Your right hand.
