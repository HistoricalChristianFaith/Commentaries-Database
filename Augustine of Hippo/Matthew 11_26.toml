Serm., 67, 1: If Christ, from whom all sin is far, said, “I confess, "confession is not proper for the sinner only, but sometimes also for him that gives thanks. We may confess either by praising God, or by accusing ourselves. When He said, “I confess unto thee,” it is, I praise Thee, not I accuse Myself.
That the wise and understanding are to be taken as the proud, Himself opens tous when He says, “and hast revealed them unto babes;” for who are “babes” butthe humble?
