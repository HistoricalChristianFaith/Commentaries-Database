We may appropriately understand of them, what was said to the bride in the Canticle of Canticles: “We shall make you likenesses of gold inlaid with silver while the king is reclining at his table,” that is, while Christ is in his secret place, because “your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ your life shall appear, then you too will appear with him in glory.” - "On the Trinity 1.8.16"
