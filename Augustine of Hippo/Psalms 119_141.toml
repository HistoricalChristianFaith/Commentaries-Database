"I am young, and of no reputation; yet do I not forget Your righteousnesses:" not as my enemies, who "have forgotten Your words" [Psalm 119:141]. The younger seems to grieve for those older than himself who had forgotten the righteousnesses of God, while he himself had not forgotten. For what means, "I am young, yet do I not forget"? save this, Those older than me have forgotten. For the Greek word is νεώτερος, the same as that used in the words above, "Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way?"  This is a comparative, and is therefore well understood in its relation to some one older. Let us therefore here recognize the two nations, who were striving even in Rebecca's womb; when it was said to her, not from works, but of Him that calls, "The elder shall serve the younger."  But the younger says here that he is of no reputation: for this reason he has become greater: since "behold, they that were first are last, and they that were last first." [Matthew 20:16]
