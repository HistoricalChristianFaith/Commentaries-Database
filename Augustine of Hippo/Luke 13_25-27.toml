Christ has hidden enemies. All those who live unjust and irreligious lives are Christ's enemies, even if they are signed with his name and are called Christians. I mean the ones to whom he is going to say, "I do not know you," and they say to him, "Lord, in your name we ate and drank. In your name, we performed many deeds of power. What did we eat and drink in your name?" You see that they did not value their food very highly, and yet it was with reference to it that they said they belonged to Christ. Christ is the food that is eaten and drunk. Even Christ's enemies eat and drink him. The faithful know the Lamb without spot on which they feed, if only they fed on it in such a way that they are not liable to punishment! The apostle says, "Whoever eats and drinks unworthily is eating and drinking judgment upon himself."
