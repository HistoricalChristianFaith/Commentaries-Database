He was granting pardon, but while he was granting it he raised his face to her and said, “Has no one stoned you?” And she did not say, “Why? What have I done, Lord? I’m not guilty, am I? That is not what she said. What she said was, “No one, Lord.” She accused herself. They had been unable to prove it against her and had withdrawn. But she confessed, because her Lord was not unaware of her guilt but was nonetheless seeking her faith and her confession. “Has no one stoned you?” “No one, Lord.” “No one”—that is confession of sins. “Lord”—that is pardon of what she deserved. “No one, Lord. I acknowledge both things. I know who you are; I know who I am. It is to you I am confessing. You see, I have heard the words, ‘Confess to the Lord, for he is good.’ I know my confession, I know your mercy.”
