Let us not be making inquiries as to where the Son, the Father’s co-equal, is, since no one has yet found out where he is not. But if anyone would inquire, let him inquire rather how he may be with him—not everywhere, as he is, but wherever he may be. For when he said to the [thief] … “Today you will be with me in paradise,” in respect to his human nature his own soul was on that very day to be in hell, his flesh in the sepulcher. But as respected his Godhead he was certainly also in paradise. And therefore the soul of the thief, absolved from his past crimes and already in the blessed enjoyment of his grace, although his soul could not be everywhere as Christ was, yet could on that very day be also with him in paradise, from which he, who is always everywhere, had not withdrawn. On this account, doubtless, it was not enough for him to say, “I will that they also be where I am,” but he added, “with me.” For to be with him is the chief good. For even the miserable can be where he is, since wherever any are, there is he also. But the blessed are only with him because it is only of him that they can be blessed. Was it not truly said to God, “If I ascend into heaven, you are there. And if I go down into hell, you are present”? Or is not Christ after all that Wisdom of God that “penetrates everywhere because of its purity”? But “the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness does not comprehend it.” Let us take a similar illustration from what is visible, even if it is only remotely similar. The blind person—even when there is light where he is—does not really experience the light but is, in reality, absent from its presence. In the same way, because someone who is an unbeliever and ungodly (or even a believer who is godly) is not yet competent to gaze on the light of wisdom—although there is nowhere he or she could be where Christ is not—yet that person still cannot experience Christ with actual sight. For there is no doubt that a true believer is with Christ by faith, because in reference to this he says, “He that is not with me is against me.” But when he said to God the Father, “I will that they also whom you have given me be with me where I am,” he spoke exclusively of that sight that will see him as he is.
