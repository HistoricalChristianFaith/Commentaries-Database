Give me someone professing perpetual continence, and free from these and all similar vices and blemishes of conduct. For her I fear pride; for her I dread the swelling of selfconceit from so great a blessing. The more there is in her from which she finds selfcomplacence, the more I fear lest by pleasing herself she will displease him who “resists the proud but gives grace to the humble.”
