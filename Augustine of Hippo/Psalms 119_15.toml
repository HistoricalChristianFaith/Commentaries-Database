"I will talk of Your commandments, and have respect unto Your ways"  [Psalm 119:15]. And thus the Church does exercise herself in the commandments of God, by speaking in the copious disputations of the learned against all the enemies of the Christian and Catholic faith; which are fruitful to those who compose them, if nothing but the ways of the Lord is regarded in them; but "All the ways of the Lord are," as it is written, "mercy and truth;"  the fullness of which both is found in Christ.
