He replied, “The Father is with me,” so that they would not think that the Son had come forth from the Father in any sense that would lead them to suppose that [the Father] had also withdrawn from his presence.

But when he was taken, not only did [the disciples] outwardly abandon his bodily presence, but they mentally abandoned their faith. This is what he is talking about when he says, “Do you now believe?” … This was as if he had said, Afterward, you will be so confused that you will leave behind even what you now believe. It is apparent that this is indeed what happened because they did fall into such despair and such a death, so to speak, of their old faith. For instance, Cleopas, after Jesus’ resurrection, and unaware that he was speaking with Jesus, narrated what had happened to him, saying, “We trusted that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel.” They left him, in other words, by abandoning the very faith that had formerly believed in him.
