He is foretelling the New Covenant, under which all those old sacrifices have ceased. They had a part to play in prefiguring a special sacrifice that was to come, by the blood of which we would be cleansed.

What then: Do You not accept my sacrifices? "But your holocausts are always in My sight." Certain holocausts concerning which it is said in another Psalm, "If You had desired sacrifice, I would surely have given, with holocausts You will not be delighted:" and again he turns himself, "Sacrifice to God is a troubled spirit, a heart broken and humbled God does not despise." Which be then holocausts that He despises not? Which holocausts that are always in His sight? "Kindly, O Lord," he says, "deal in Your good will with Sion, and be the walls of Jerusalem built, then shall You accept the sacrifice of righteousness, oblations, and holocausts." He says that certain holocausts God will accept. But what is a holocaust? A whole consumed with fire: causis is burning, holon is whole: but a "holocaust" is a whole consumed with fire. There is a certain fire of most burning love: be the mind inflamed with love, let the same love hurry off the limbs to its use, let it not allow them to serve cupidity, in order that we may wholly glow with fire of divine love that will offer to God a holocaust. Such "holocausts of yours are in My sight always."
