Let us direct the mind’s gaze and, with the Lord’s help, let us search out God. The word of the divine canticle is, “Seek God and your soul will live.” Let us seek him who is to be found, and in doing so let us seek him who has been found. He has been hidden so that he may be sought for and found. He is immeasurable so that, even though he has been found, he may still be sought for.… Therefore it was not thus said, “Seek his face always,” as about certain men: “always learning and never attaining to a knowledge of the truth,” but rather as that one says, “When a man ends, then he is beginning.”
