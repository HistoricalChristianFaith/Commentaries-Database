Now let us hasten over the verses following after the destruction of Jerusalem, for the reason that they are both evident, and it does not please me to tarry over the punishment even of enemies. "As if in a forest of trees with axes, they have cut down the doors thereof at once; with mattock and hammer they have thrown Her down" [Psalm 74:6]. That is, conspiring together, with firm determination, "with mattock and hammer" they have thrown Her down. "They have burned with fire Your Sanctuary, they have defiled on the ground the Tabernacle of Your name" [Psalm 74:7].
