He says, look at the sun, the moon, the movement of the stars, the cycle of the year, the changing of the seasons, the regular succession of night and day. For this is what he has added: “He who brings forth by number the order of the cosmos.” For He calls the setting in order of creation “the cosmos.” “He shall call them all by names.” He is ignorant of nothing, he says, but He knows all things with clarity, since it is He who has given a name equally to each and everything. “By means of the greatness of Your glory and by the power of Your might nothing has escaped You.” He has power above all, He is able to do all, He is ignorant of nothing that exits and He knows the very thoughts of men. (Theodoret of Cyrus)  God, whose knowledge is simply manifold, and uniform in its variety, comprehends all incomprehensibles with so incomprehensible a comprehension, that though He willed always to make His later works novel and unlike what went before them, He could not produce them without order and foresight, nor conceive them suddenly, but by His eternal foreknowledge.  (St. Augustine City of God)
