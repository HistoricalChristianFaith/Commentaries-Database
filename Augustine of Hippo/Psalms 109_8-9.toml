"Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow" [Psalm 109:8]. After his death, both his children were fatherless, and his wife a widow. "Let his children be vagabonds, and be carried away, and beg their bread" [Psalm 109:9]. By "vagabonds" he means, uncertain whither to go, destitute of all help. "Let them be driven from their habitations." He here explains what he had said above, "Let them be carried away." How all this happened to his wife and children, the following verses explain.
