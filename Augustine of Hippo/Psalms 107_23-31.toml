..."They who go down on the sea in ships, doing their business on the mighty waters" [Psalm 107:23]; that is, among many peoples. For that waters are often put for peoples, the Apocalypse of John is witness, when on John's asking what those waters were, it was answered him, they are peoples. They then who do their business on mighty waters, "they have seen the works of the Lord, and His wonders in the deep" [Psalm 107:24]. For what is deeper than human hearts? Hence often break forth winds; storms of sedition, and dissensions, disturb the ship. And what is done in them? God, willing that both they who steer, and they who are conveyed, should cry unto Him, "He spoke, and the breath of the storm stood" [Psalm 107:25]. What is, stood? Abode, continued, still disturbs, long tosses; rages, and passes not away. "For He spoke, and the breath of the storm stood." And what did that breath of the storm? "They go up even to the heavens," in daring; "They go down even into the deeps" [Psalm 107:26], in fearing. "Their soul wasted in miseries." "They were disturbed, and moved like a drunken man" [Psalm 107:27]. They who sit at the helm, and they who faithfully love the ship, feel what I say. Certainly, when they speak, when they read, when they interpret, they appear wise. Woe for the storm! "and all their wisdom," he says, "was swallowed up." Sometimes all human counsels fail; whichever way one turns himself, the waves roar, the storm rages, the arms are powerless: where the prow may strike, to what wave the side may be exposed, whither the stricken ship may be allowed to drift, from what rocks she must be kept back lest she be lost, is impossible for her pilots to see. And what is left but that which follows? "And they cried out unto the Lord when they were troubled, and He delivered them from their distresses" [Psalm 107:28]. "And He commanded the storm, and it stood unto clear air" [Psalm 107:29], "and the waves of it were still." Hear on this point the voice of a steersman, one that was in peril, was brought low, was freed. "I would not," he says, have you ignorant, brethren, of our distress, which befell us in Asia, that "we were pressed above strength, and above measure" (I see all his "wisdom swallowed up"), "so that we were weary," he says, "even of life." [2 Corinthians 1:8] ...

"And they were glad, because they were still, and He brought them into the haven of their desire" [Psalm 107:30]. "Let His mercies confess unto the Lord, and His wonders towards the sons of men" [Psalm 107:31]. Everywhere, without exception, let not our merits, not our strength, not our wisdom, "confess unto the Lord," but, "His mercies." Let Him be loved in every deliverance of ours, who has been invoked in every distress.
