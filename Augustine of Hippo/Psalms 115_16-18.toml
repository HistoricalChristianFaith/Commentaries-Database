Because the Lord insists that our heart be cleansed, he therefore goes further and gives a command, saying, “Do not collect treasure on earth, where the moth and corrosion destroy, and where thieves dig up and steal; but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor corrosion destroys, nor thieves dig up and steal. For where your treasure is, there your heart also will be.” Now, if a person does something with the intention of gaining earthly profit, his heart is on the earth. And how can a heart be clean while it is wallowing on the earth? On the other hand, if it is in heaven it will be clean, for whatsoever things are heavenly are clean. A thing becomes defiled if it is mixed with a baser substance, even though that other substance is not vile in its own nature; for instance, gold is debased by pure silver if it is mixed with it. So also is our mind defiled by a desire for the things of earth, although the earth itself is pure in its own class and in its own order. Let us not think that in this text the word heaven signifies the universe of heavenly bodies, for the word earth includes every kind of body, and a person ought to disregard the whole world when he is laying up treasure for himself in heaven. Therefore, the reference is to that heaven of which it is said, “The heaven of heaven is the Lord’s.” Moreover, since we ought to fix our treasure and our heart on that which will abide forever and not on something that will pass away, the heaven here mentioned means the spiritual firmament, for “heaven and earth will pass away.”
