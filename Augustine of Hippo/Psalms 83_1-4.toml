So let them keep quiet, let them now see that the real Hercules is the God to whom the faithful say, “God, who is like you? Do not keep silent, or grow gentle, God.” What I had undertaken was to show how “do not grow gentle” means rooting out errors, not people. He does not grow gentle, so he gets angry. But he is God, so he also takes pity. He gets angry, and he takes pity. He gets angry and strikes; he takes pity and heals. He gets angry and does to death; he takes pity and brings to life. In one person he does this. It is not that he does some people to death and brings others to life, but in the same people he is both angry and gentle. He is angry with errors; he is gentle with bad habits put right. “I will strike, and I will heal; I will kill, and I will make alive.” One and the same Saul, afterward Paul, he both laid low and raised up. He laid low an unbeliever, he raised up a believer. He both laid low a persecutor, he raised up a preacher.
