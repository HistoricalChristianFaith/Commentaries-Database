"My shame is continually before me; and the confusion of my face has covered me" [Psalm 44:15]. "For the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes" [Psalm 44:16]: that is to say, from the voice of them that insult over me, and who make it a charge against me that I worship You, that I confess You! And who make it a charge against me that I bear that name by which all charges against me shall be blotted out. "For the voice of him that reproaches and blasphemes," that is, of him that speaks against me. "By reason of the enemy and the persecutor." And what is the "understanding" conveyed here? Those things which are told us of the time past, will not be done in our case:  those which are hoped for, as to be hereafter, are not as yet manifest. Those which are past, as the leading out of Your people with great glory from Egypt; its deliverance from its persecutors; the guiding of it through the nations, the placing of it in the kingdom, whence the nations had been expelled. What are those to be hereafter? The leading of the people out of this Egypt of the world, when Christ, our "leader" shall appear in His glory: the placing of the Saints at His right hand; of the wicked at His left; the condemnation of the wicked with the devil to eternal punishment; the receiving of a kingdom from Christ with the Saints to last for ever.  These are the things that are yet to be: the former are what are past. In the interval, what is to be our lot? Tribulations! "Why so?" That it may be seen with respect to the soul that worships God, to what extent it worships God; that it may be seen whether it worships Him "freely" from whom it received salvation "freely."...What have you given unto God? You were wicked, and thou were redeemed! What have you given unto God? What is there that you have not "received" from Him "freely"? With reason is it named "grace," because it is bestowed (gratis, i.e.) freely. [RomansÂ 11:6] What is required of you then is this, that thou too should worship "Him freely;" not because He gives you things temporal, but because He holds out to you things eternal....
