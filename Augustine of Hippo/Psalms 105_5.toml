"Remember," he says, "His marvellous works that He has done, His wonders, and the judgments of His mouth" [Psalm 105:5]. This passage seems like that, "You shall say unto the children of Israel, I Am has sent me unto you:" an expression which, in ever so small part, scarce a mind  takes in. Then mentioning His own Name, He mercifully mingled in His grace towards men, saying, "I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob; this is My Name for ever." [ExodusÂ 3:14-15] By which He would have it to be understood, that they whose God He declared Himself lived with Him for ever, and He said this, which might be understood even by children, that they who by the great powers of love knew how to seek His face for evermore, might according to their capacity comprehend, I Am that I  Am.
