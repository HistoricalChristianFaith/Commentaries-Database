These Jews then saw the man; they neither perceived nor believed him to be God.

This question may be solved in two ways: I judge no man, that is, I do not judge him now. He says this elsewhere: “God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved.” It is not that he abandons his justice but rather only defers it. Or, having said, “You judge according to the flesh,” he says immediately, “I judge no man.” He adds this to let you know that Christ does not judge according to the flesh, as people judged him. Therefore let no scruple of doubt remain in our heart against the faith that we hold and declare concerning Christ as judge. Christ is come first to save but then to judge.
