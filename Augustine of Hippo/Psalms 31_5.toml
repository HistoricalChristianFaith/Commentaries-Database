"Into Your hands I commend My Spirit" [Psalm 31:5]. To Your power I commend My Spirit, soon to receive It back. "You have redeemed Me, O Lord God of truth." Let the people too, redeemed by the Passion of their Lord, and joyful in the glorifying of their Head, say, "You have redeemed me, O Lord God of truth."
