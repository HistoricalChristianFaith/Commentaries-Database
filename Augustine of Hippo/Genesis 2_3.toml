Heaven, too, will be the fulfillment of that sabbath rest foretold in the command: “Be still and see that I am God.” This, indeed, will be that ultimate sabbath that has no evening and that the Lord foreshadowed in the account of his creation: “And God rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done. And he blessed the seventh day and sanctified it: because in it he had rested from all his work that God created and made.” And we ourselves will be a “seventh day” when we shall be filled with his blessing and remade by his sanctification. In the stillness of that rest we shall see that he is the God whose divinity we desired for ourselves when we listened to the seducer’s words, “You shall be as gods,” and so fell away from him, the true God who would have given us a divinity by participation that could never be gained by desertion. For where did the doing without God end but in the undoing of man through the anger of God? Only when we are remade by God and perfected by a greater grace shall we have the eternal stillness of that rest in which we shall see that he is God.
