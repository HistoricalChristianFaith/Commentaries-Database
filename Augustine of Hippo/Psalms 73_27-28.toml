For if anyone should have love, he sees God because “God is love,” and that eye is cleansed more and more by love so that he may see that unchangeable substance in whose presence he may always rejoice, which he may enjoy forever, joined together with the angels. But let him run now that he may one day rejoice in his homeland.

So if you want to keep the order of true charity, act justly, love mercy, shun self-indulgence; begin according to the Lord’s instruction to love not only friends but also enemies. And when you strive to maintain these standards faithfully with your whole heart, you will be able to climb up by these virtues, as by a flight of steps, to being worthy to love God with your whole mind and your whole strength. And when you reach this happy state of perfection, you will reckon all the desires of this world as nothing but dung, and with the prophet you will be able to say, “But for me to cling to God is good.”

We ought to be on our guard against loving God for any reward. What is the point, after all, of loving God for a reward? What sort of reward is it that God is going to give you? Whatever else he gives you, it is less than he is. You are worshiping him not freely, not gratuitously, in order to receive something from him. Worship him freely, and you will receive God himself; God, you see, is keeping himself for you to enjoy him. And if you love the things he made, what must he that made them be like? If the world is beautiful, what must the architect of the world be like? So tear your heart away from the love of creatures, in order to cling to the creator, and to be able to say what is written in the psalm, “But for me it is good to cling to God.”

If you recognize that you have received the virtues that you have, and if you return thanks to him from whom you have received them, directing them to his service even in your secular office; if you rouse the people subject to your authority and lead them to worship God, both by the example of your own devout life and by your zeal for their welfare, whether you rule them by love or by fear; if, in working for their greater security, you have no other aim than that they should thus attain to him who will be their happiness—then yours will be true virtues, then they will be increased by the help of him whose bounty lavished them on you, and they will be so perfected as to lead you without fail to that truly happy life that is none other than eternal life. In that life, evil will no longer have to be distinguished from good by the virtue of prudence, because there will be no evil there; adversity will not have to be borne with fortitude, because there will be nothing there but what we love; temperance will not be needed to curb our passions, because there will be no enticements to passion there; nor shall we have to practice justice by helping the poor out of our abundance, for there we shall find no poor and no needy. There will be but one virtue there, and it will be the same as the reward of virtue, which the speaker in the sacred writings mentions as the object of his love: “But it is good for me to stick close to my God.” This will constitute the perfect and eternal wisdom, as it will constitute the truly happy life, because to attain it is to attain the eternal and supreme good, and to stick close to God forever is the sum of our good. Let this be called prudence because it will cling most providently to the good that cannot be lost, and fortitude because it will cling most stoutly to the good from which it cannot be parted, and temperance because it will cling most chastely to the good in which there is no corruption, and justice because it will cling most uprightly to the good to which it is deservedly subject.

I will briefly set forth the manner of life according to these virtues, one by one, after I have brought forward, as I promised, passages from the Old Testament parallel to those I have been quoting from the New Testament. For is Paul alone in saying that we should be joined to God so that there should be nothing between to separate us? Does not the prophet say the same most aptly and concisely in the words, “It is good for me to cling to God”? Does not this one word cling express all that the apostle says at length about love? And do not the words “it is good” point to the apostle’s statement, “All things issue in good to them that love God”? Thus in one clause and in two words the prophet sets forth the power and the fruit of love.

There have been some philosophers of this world who have thought that the only happiness is to live according to the flesh, and they have placed humankind’s good in the pleasures of the body. These philosophers were called Epicureans, from a certain Epicurus, their founder and teacher, and any others like them. However, some proud people came along who claimed to distance themselves from the flesh and set all their hopes of happiness on their souls by placing their supreme good in their own virtue. Your religious feelings, clearly, have recognized in yourself the words of the psalm; you know, realize and recognize how the holy psalm mocks “those who trust in their own virtue.” These were the philosophers who were called Stoics. The Epicureans lived according to the flesh, and the Stoics lived according to the soul—neither of the two groups lived according to God.That is why, when the apostle Paul came to the city of the Athenians, where these philosophical schools engaged in feverish study and wrangling, as you can read in the Acts of the Apostles—and I am glad to see you are already ahead of me in what I am saying, with your quick and lively memories—it is written there, “Certain philosophers of the Epicureans and Stoics conferred with him.” Those who were living according to the flesh conferred with him, and those who were living according to the soul conferred with him. He, living according to God, conferred with them. The Epicurean said, “For me to enjoy the flesh is good.” The Stoic said, “For me to enjoy my mind is good.” The apostle said, “For me, though, to cling to God is good.” The Epicurean said, “Blessed is the one who has the enjoyment of the pleasures of his flesh.” The Stoic said, “Blessed, rather, is the one who has the enjoyment of the virtue of his mind.” The apostle said, “Blessed is the one whose hope is the name of the Lord.”
The Epicurean has got it all wrong. I mean, it is simply not true that a person who has the enjoyment of the pleasures of his flesh is blessed. The Stoic, too, is quite mistaken. I mean it is simply not true; it is absolutely incorrect that a person who has the enjoyment of the virtue of his mind is blessed. So, [the psalmist says], “Blessed is the one whose hope is the name of the Lord.” And because those others are vain windbags and liars [he adds], “and who has not paid attention to vanities and lying follies.”
