"The just man shall rejoice in the Lord" [Psalm 64:10]. Now the just man is not sad. For sad were the disciples at the Lord's being crucified; overcome with sadness, sorrowing they departed, they thought they had lost hope. He rose again, even when appearing to them He found them sad. He held the eyes of two men that walked in the way, so that by them he was not known, and He found them groaning and sighing, and He held them until He had expounded the Scriptures, and by the same Scriptures had shown that so it ought to have been done as it was done.  For He showed in the Scriptures, how after the third day it behooved the Lord to rise again. [Luke 24:46] And how on the third day would He have risen again, if from the Cross He had come down?...Therefore let us all rejoice in the Lord, let us all after the faith be One Just Man, and let us all in one Body hold One Head, and let us rejoice in the Lord, not in ourselves: because our Good is not ourselves to ourselves, but He that has made us. Himself is our good to make us glad. And let no one rejoice in himself, no one rely on himself, no one despair of himself: let no one rely on any man, whom he ought to bring in to be the partner of his own hope, not the giver of the hope.

“The just person will take delight in the Lord and hope in him, and all the upright of heart shall be praised.” We have certainly sung this with voice and heart. Christian consciences and tongues have spoken these words to God: The just one will take delight not in the world but in the Lord. “Light has dawned for the just,” it says somewhere else, “and delight for the upright of heart.” You may ask where delight is to be found. Here you have it: “The just one will take delight in the Lord.” And somewhere else: “Delight in the Lord, and he will give you the aims of your heart.” What are we being shown? What is being granted us? What are we being told? To take delight in the Lord. But can you take delight in what you do not see? Or perhaps we do see the Lord? We have that safely promised us; but now “we walk by faith, as long as we are in the body we are away from the Lord.” By faith, not by sight. When will it be by sight? When another thing John says is fulfilled: “Beloved, we are children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be. But we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.” Then there will be great and perfect delight, then joy will be full, when it is no longer hope suckling us with milk but the real thing providing us with solid food.
