Now is the time of mercy, then will be the time of judgment. Why is now the time of mercy? Now he calls to the one who is far away and forgives the sins of the one who returns. He is patient with sinners, until they convert, and once they convert, he forgets the past and promises the future. He exhorts the lazy, consoles the afflicted, teaches the zealous, helps those who struggle. He abandons none of those who labor and cry out to him. He gives to those who give to him; he gives the means by which they might please him. The great time of mercy should not pass in vain, brothers and sisters—it should not pass in vain for us! The judgment will come, and then also there will be repentance, but by then it will be fruitless. “Repentant, they will speak to each other, groaning in anguish of spirit” (these things are written in the book of Wisdom). “What has our arrogance profited us? And what good has our boasted wealth brought us? All this has passed like a shadow.” Let us say now, “All these things pass like a shadow.” Let us say it now, fruitfully, “They will pass,” so we will not have to say then, without fruit, “They have passed.” This is therefore the time of mercy, but there will also be the time of judgment.

“The posterity of the godless will perish.” This is because the posterity of the godless are their works. But we again see that the child of the godless prospers in the world and, at times, becomes righteous and prospers in Christ. Observe therefore how you must understand this, so as to open the roof and come to Christ. Do not understand this carnally, because you would fall into error. But the seed of the godless, all the works of the godless, will perish; they will not bear fruit. For the time being, in fact, they will have some value, but later they will look for what they have done and not find it.
