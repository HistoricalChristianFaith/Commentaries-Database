While the disciples had a reverential love for their master, they were nonetheless affected by human frailty in their feelings toward each other. Each one’s own conscience was known to himself. But as he was ignorant of his neighbor’s, each one’s self-assurance was such that each was uncertain of all the others, and all the others were uncertain of that one.
