“For if our heart should have a bad opinion [of us],” that is, should accuse us within, because we do not do with that intention with which it ought to be done, “God is greater than our heart and knows all things.” You conceal your heart from people; conceal it from God if you can. How will you conceal it from him to whom it was said by a certain sinner, “Where shall I go from your spirit, and from your face where shall I flee?” He was asking where he might flee to escape the judgment of God and did not find [an answer]. For where is God not? “If I ascend into heaven,” he says, “you are there. If I descend into hell, you are present.” Where will you go? Where will you flee? Do you wish to listen to advice? If you wish to flee from him, flee to him! Flee to him by confessing, not by hiding from him. For you cannot hide, but you can confess. Say to him, “You are my refuge,” and let love be nurtured in you, which alone leads to life. Let your conscience bear testimony to you because it is of God. If it is of God, do not wish to boast of it before people because neither the praises of people lift you into heaven nor do their censurings put you down from there. Let him who gives the crown see; let him be witness by whom as Judge you are crowned. God is greater than our heart and knows all things.

For God was everywhere who said, “I fill heaven and earth.” But if this was said of the Father, where could he be without his Word and his Wisdom, “which teaches from end to end mightily, and orders all things sweetly”? But neither could he be anywhere without his Spirit. If, therefore, God is everywhere, then his Spirit is also everywhere. Consequently, the Holy Spirit was also sent to that place where he already was. For he, too, who finds no place to which he could go from the face of God, says, “If I shall ascend into heaven, you are there; if I shall descend into hell, you are present,” wishing it to be understood that God is present everywhere, referred to his Spirit in the preceding verse. For there he spoke as follows: “Where shall I go from your Spirit? And where shall I flee from your face?”

For this reason, of course, it was not enough for Jesus to say, “I will that where I am they also may be,” but he added, “with me.” For to be with him is a great good. For even the wretched can be where he is because wherever anybody at all may be [there] he also is; but the blessed alone are with him, because they will be unable to be blessed except by his action. Or has it not been truly said to God, “If I ascend into heaven, you are there; and if I descend into hell, you are present”? Or on the other hand is Christ not God’s Wisdom, which “reaches everywhere by reason of its purity”?
