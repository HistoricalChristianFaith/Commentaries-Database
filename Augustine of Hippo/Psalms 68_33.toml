Henceforward, as if through prophecy all things had been discoursed of which now we see fulfilled, he exhorts to the praise of Christ, and next He foretells His future Advent. "Kingdoms of earth, sing ye to God, psalm ye to the Lord: psalm ye to God, who has ascended above the Heaven of Heavens to the East" [Psalm 68:33]. Or, as some copies have it, "who has ascended above the Heaven of Heaven to the East." In these words he perceives not Christ, who believes not His Resurrection and Ascension. But has not "to the East," which he has added, expressed the very spot; since in the quarters of the East is where He rose again, and whence He ascended? Therefore above the Heaven of Heaven He sits at the right hand of the Father. This is what the Apostle says, "the Same is He that has ascended above all Heavens." [Ephesians 4:10] For what of Heavens does remain after the Heaven of Heaven? Which also we may call the Heavens of Heavens, just as He has called the firmament Heaven: [Genesis 1:8] which Heaven, however, even as Heavens we read of, in the place where there is written, "and let the waters which are above the Heavens praise the name of the Lord."  And forasmuch as from thence He is to come, [Acts 1:11] to judge quick and dead, observe what follows: "behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power."  He that like a lamb before the shearer of Him was without voice, [Isaiah 53:7] "behold shall give His voice," and not the voice of weakness, as though to be judged; but "the voice of power," as though going to judge. For God shall not be hidden, as before, and in the judgment of men not opening His mouth; but "God shall come manifest, our God, and He shall not be silent."  Why do ye despair, you unbelieving men? Why do ye mock? What says the evil servant? "My Lord delays to come." [Luke 12:45] "Behold, He shall give His voice, the voice of power."
