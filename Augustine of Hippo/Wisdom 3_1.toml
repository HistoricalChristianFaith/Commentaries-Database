To say that God remembers is to say that he acts. Conversely, to say that he forgets is to say that he does not act: not because there is forgetfulness in God (given that he never changes) or remembrance (given that he never forgets). For those, then, who did not know what they were doing, “I have become like a man without support,” when I was “free among the dead.” And for those who did not know what they were doing, I have become “like the slain who sleep in the grave. And they are cast away from your hand.” That is, when they reduced me to such a condition, “they were cast away from your hand.” They thought I was a man without support; rather, it was they who were without the support of your hand. In fact, as it says in another psalm, “they dug a ditch before me, but they fell in it themselves.” I think that the words “and I have been cast away from your hand” are best interpreted in this way, rather than referring to those who sleep in the grave, whom God does not remember. In fact, there are some righteous people among these latter, of whom it is true that he has not remembered them yet, so as to raise them. Nevertheless, of these it is also said, “The souls of the righteous are in the hand of God.” That is, they enjoy the support of the Most High, and they dwell in the protection of the God of heaven. As for the others, however, they were cast away from the hand of God, since they thought that the Lord Jesus Christ was rejected by his hand, so much so that they could number him among the evildoers and kill him.

Where do we think these saints are? In a place where they are doing well. What more do you want? You do not know the place, but consider what it truly is. Wherever they are, they are with God. “The souls of the righteous are in the hands of God; no torment will touch them.” They passed through torments to reach the place without torment. Through narrowness and constriction they reached the place of freedom. Therefore, those who are heading toward such a homeland should not be dismayed if the way is difficult.
