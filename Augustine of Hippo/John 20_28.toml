But when Jesus showed Thomas the very places where he had his doubts, Thomas exclaimed, “My Lord and my God.” He touched his flesh, he proclaimed his divinity. What did he touch? The body of Christ. Was the body of Christ the divinity of Christ? The divinity of Christ was the Word; the humanity of Christ was soul and flesh. Thomas could not touch the soul, but he could perceive it, because the body that had been dead was moving about alive. But that Word is subject neither to change nor to contact, it neither regresses nor progresses, neither fails nor flourishes, because in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” That is what Thomas proclaimed. He touched the flesh, he invoked the Word, because “the Word became flesh and dwelt among us.”
