The Psalm then continues: "His delight was in cursing, and it shall happen to him" [Psalm 109:17]. Although Judas loved cursing, both in stealing from the money bag, and selling and betraying the Lord: nevertheless, that people more openly loved cursing, when they said, "His blood be on us, and on our children."

For in that same Book of Testimonies, in order to justify somehow his assertion that “all are ruled by their own will,” Pelagius10 has cited this passage from the psalm, “And he loved cursing, and it will come to him, and [he] would not have blessing, and it shall be far from him.” But who does not know that this is a fault, not of nature, as God created it, but of the human will, which turned away from God? Even if he had not loved cursing, had desired blessing, and, in this instance, denied that his will was helped by divine grace, the fact is that, in his ingratitude and impiety, he would be abandoned to be ruled by himself. The result of being deprived of divine guidance and brought to ruin is that he would discover through punishment that he was incapable of being ruled by himself.
