"But the transgressors shall be destroyed in the self-same thing"  [Psalm 37:38]. What is meant by, "in the self-same thing"? It means for ever: or all together in one and the same destruction.

"The remainder of the wicked shall be cut off." Now there is "(a remainder) for the man that makes peace:" they therefore who are not peace-makers  are ungodly. For, "Blessed are the peace-makers: for they shall be called the children of God." [MatthewÂ 5:9]
