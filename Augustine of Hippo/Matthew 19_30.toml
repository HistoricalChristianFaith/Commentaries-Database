City of God, book xx, ch. 5: Thus our flesh will be regenerated byincorruption, as our soul also shall be regenerated by faith.
From this passage we learn that Jesus will judge with His disciples; whence He says in another place to the Jews, “Therefore shall they be your judges.” .
Serm., 351, 8: In the number of judges therefore are included all that have left their all and followed the Lord.
City of God, book xx, ch. 5: The same holds good, by reason of this number twelve, of those that are to be judged. For when it is said, “Judging the twelve tribes,” yet is not the tribe of Levi, which is the thirteenth, to be exempt from being judged by them; nor shall they judge this nation alone, and not also other nations.
City of God, book xx, ch. 7: That He says, “An hundred fold,” is explained bythe Apostle, when he says, “As having nothing, and yet possessing all things.” For a hundred is sometimes put for the whole universe.
