"Judge them, O God: let them fall from their own thoughts" [Psalm 5:10]. It is a prophecy, not a curse. For he does not wish that it should come to pass; but he perceives what will come to pass. For this happens to them, not because he appears to have wished for it, but because they are such as to deserve that it should happen. For so also what he says afterwards, "Let all that hope in You rejoice," he says by way of prophecy; since he perceives that they will rejoice. Likewise is it said prophetically, "Stir up Your strength, and come:"  for he saw that He would come. Although the words, "Let them fall from their own thoughts," may be taken thus also, that it may rather be believed to be a wish for their good by the Psalmist, while they fall from their evil thoughts, that is, that they may no more think evil. But what follows, "drive them out," forbids this interpretation. For it can in no way be taken in a favourable sense, that one is driven out by God. Wherefore it is understood to be said prophetically, and not of ill will; when this is said, which must necessarily happen to such as chose to persevere in those sins, which have been mentioned. "Let them," therefore, "fall from their own thoughts," is, let them fall by their self-accusing thoughts, "their own conscience also bearing witness," as the Apostle says, "and their thoughts accusing or excusing, in the revelation of the just judgment of God." [Romans 2:15-16] "According to the multitude of their ungodlinesses drive them out:" [Psalm 5:10] that is, drive them out far away. For this is "according to the multitude of their ungodlinesses,"  that they should be driven out far away. The ungodly then are driven out from that inheritance, which is possessed by knowing and seeing God: as diseased eyes are driven out from the shining of the light, when what is gladness to others is pain to them. Therefore these shall not stand in the morning,  and see. And that expression is as great a punishment, as that which is said, "But for me it is good to cleave to the Lord,"  is a great reward. To this punishment is opposed, "Enter into the joy of Your Lord;" [Matthew 25:21] for similar to this expulsion is, "Cast him into outer darkness." [Matthew 25:30] "Since they have embittered You, O Lord" [Psalm 5:10] "I am," says He, "the Bread which came down from heaven;" [John 6:51] again, "Labour for the meat which wasts not;" [John 6:27] again, "Taste and see that the Lord is sweet."  But to sinners the bread of truth is bitter. Whence they hate the mouth of him that speaks the truth. These then have embittered God, who by sin have fallen into such a state of sickliness, that the food of truth, in which healthy souls delight, as if it were bitter as gall, they cannot bear.
