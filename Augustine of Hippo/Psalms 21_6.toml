"For You shall give Him blessing for ever and ever." This is the blessing which You shall give Him for ever and ever: "You shall make Him glad in joy together with Your countenance" [Psalm 21:6]. According to His manhood, You shall make Him glad together with Your countenance, which He lifted up to You.
