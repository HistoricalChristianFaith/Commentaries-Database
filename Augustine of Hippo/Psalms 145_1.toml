content = '''The title is, "Praise, to David himself." Praise to Christ Himself. And since He is called David, who came to us of the seed of David, yet He was our King, ruling us, and bringing us into His kingdom, therefore "Praise to David himself" is understood to mean, Praise to Christ Himself. Christ according to the flesh is David, because He is the Son of David: but according to His Divine Nature He is the Creator of David, and Lord of David. "I will exalt You, my God, my King; and I will bless Your Name for the age, and age upon age." You see that the praise of God is here begun, and this praise is carried on even to the end of the Psalm.'''
