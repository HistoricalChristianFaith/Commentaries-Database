There are true martyrs and false ones, because there are true and false witnesses. But Scripture says, “The false witness shall not go unpunished.” If the false witness will not escape punishment, neither will the true witness be denied a crown. And it was, indeed, easy to bear witness to the Lord Jesus Christ and the truth, because he is God; but to do so to the death, that was a great work.
