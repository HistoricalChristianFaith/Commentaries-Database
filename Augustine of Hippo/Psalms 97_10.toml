What then do we all, who have assembled before Him, before Him who is exalted far above all gods? He has given us a brief commandment, "O you that love the Lord, see that you hate the thing which is evil!" [Psalm 97:10]. Christ does not deserve that with Him you should love avarice. You love Him: you should hate what He hates. There is a man who is your enemy, he is what you are; you are the work of one Creator, with the same nature: and yet if your son were to speak unto your enemy, and come to his house, and constantly converse with him, you would be inclined to disinherit him; because he speaks with your enemy. And how so? Because you seem to say justly, You are my enemy's friend, and do you seek anything of my property? Attend then. You love Christ: avarice is Christ's foe; why speak with her? I say not, speak with her; why do you serve her? For Christ commands you to do many things, and thou dost them not; she commands you, and thou dost them. Christ commands you to clothe the poor man: and thou dost it not; avarice bids you defraud, and this thou dost in preference. If such be the case, if such you are, do not very confidently promise yourself Christ's heritage. But you say, I love Christ. Hence it appears that you love what is good, if you shall be found to hate what is evil....

I should not pass over without investigating the significance of the phrases, to love God and to love one’s neighbor. A person who loves God will do the following: obey his command in all respects; observe his laws and precepts; attempt to sanctify himself because God is holy, as is written: “Be holy, because I the Lord your God am holy”; fulfill the direction of the prophet: “You that love the Lord, hate evil”; think of nothing but divine and heavenly subjects, for God is a lover of nothing but holiness, justice and piety; do only what God seems to love.

Let us love, let us love freely and without any strings attached. It is God, after all, whom we love. We can find nothing better than God. Let us love him for his own sake, and ourselves and each other in him, but still for his sake. You only love your friend truly, after all, when you love God in your friend, either because God is in him or in order that God may be in him. That is true love and respect; if we love ourselves for any other reason, we are in fact hating rather than loving. “Whoever loves iniquity,” you see—what does he hate? Maybe the man next door, maybe the woman next door? It is his turn to be horrified, for they “hate their own soul.” Love of wickedness means love of your own soul. “You that love the Lord, hate evil.” God is good, what you love is evil, and you love yourself when you are evil; how can you love God, when you still love what God hates?
