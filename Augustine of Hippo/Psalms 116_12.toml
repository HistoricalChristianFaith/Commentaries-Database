"What," he asks, "what reward shall I give unto the Lord, for all the benefits that He has returned unto me?" [Psalm 116:12]. He says not, for all the benefits that He has done unto me but "for all the benefits that He has returned unto me." What deeds then on the man's part had preceded, that all the benefits of God were not said to be given, but returned? What had preceded, on the man's part, save sins? God therefore repays good for evil, while unto Him men repay evil for good; for such was the return of those who said, "This is the heir: come, let us kill him." [Matthew 21:38]

I am certainly obliged to love the Redeemer, and I know what he said to Peter: "Peter, do you love me? Feed my sheep." This was said once, said again, said a third time. Love was being questioned and toil commanded, because where the love is greater, the toil is less. "What shall I pay back to the Lord for all that he has paid back for me?" If I say that what I am paying back is my herding his sheep, even here it is "not I who am doing it but the grace of God with me." So when can I be found to be paying him back, since he gets in first every time? And yet, because we love freely, because we are herding his sheep, we look for a reward.How shall this be? How can "I love freely and that's why I'm herding sheep" be consistent with "I request a reward, because I'm herding sheep"? This could not possibly happen; in no way at all could a reward be sought from one who is loved freely, unless the reward were the very one who is being loved. I mean, if what we are paying back for his having redeemed us is our herding his sheep, what are we paying back for his having made us shepherds? Being bad shepherds, you see—which God preserve us from—is something we are by our own badness; whereas good shepherds—which God grant we may be—is something we can be only by his grace.

Christ loved you before you existed; he created you; he predestined you before the foundation of the world; once created through the agency of your father and mother, he has reared you. It is not your parents, you see, who made you, though they hand on to you their family characteristics. He loved you, he created you, he reared you, he gave himself up for you, he listened to insults for you, he endured wounds for you, he redeemed you with his blood. Aren't you overwhelmed, and won't you say, "What shall I give back to the Lord for all that he has given to me?" What will you give back to the Lord for all that he has given to you? Listen to his saying, "Whoever has loved father or mother more than me is not worthy of me." Listen to him saying it, fear the menace contained in it, love the promise implied in it.What have you given back to the Lord for all that he has given to you? So, all right, you have already given something back, eh? Well, what have you given back? Have you saved him as he has saved you? Have you opened up eternal life for him, as he has done for you? Have you created him, as he did you? Did you make him the Lord as he made you a person? Have you given anything back to him that does not come back to you? If you look frankly at the truth of the matter, you have not given him anything.… "For what do you have that you have not received?" Why don't you find something you can give back to the Lord? Give him back yourself, give him back what he has made. Give him back yourself, not what is yours, his creation, not your perversion.
