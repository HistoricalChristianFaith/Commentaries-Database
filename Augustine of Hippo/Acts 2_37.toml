For on the sending down of the Holy Spirit after the Lordâ€™s passion, and resurrection, and ascension, when miracles were being done in the name of Him whom, as if dead, the persecuting Jews had despised, they were pricked in their hearts; and they who in their rage slew Him were changed and believed; and they who in their rage shed His blood, now in the spirit of faith drank it; they acknowledged their sin, they learned something of the Apostle, that they might not despair of the pardon of the Preacher.
