"The proud man has not dwelt in the midst of my house" [Psalm 101:7]. Understand this of the heart. The proud did not dwell in my heart: no such dwelt in my heart: for he hurried away from me. None but the meek and peaceful dwelt in my heart; the proud dwelt not there, for the unrighteous one dwells not in the heart of the righteous. Let the righteous be distant from you, I know not how many miles and stations:  ye dwell together, if you have one heart. "The proud doer has not dwelt in the midst of my house: he that speaks unjust things has not directed in the sight of my eyes." This is the spotless way, where we understand when the Lord comes unto us.
