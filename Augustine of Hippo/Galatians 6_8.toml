To sow in the spirit is to serve righteousness from faith and with love and not to heed the desires of sin, even though they arise from mortal fleshâ€¦. When we are under grace, we sow in tears, when desires arise from our animal body, which we resist by not consenting, so that we may reap in joy. We reap when, by the reformation of our body, no vexation or peril of temptation comes to trouble us from any physical source.
