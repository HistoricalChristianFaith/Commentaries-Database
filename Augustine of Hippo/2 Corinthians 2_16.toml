Through an evil man divine providence can both punish and comfort. For the impiety of the Jews was the Jews’ downfall and yet provided salvation for the Gentiles. Again, divine providence through a good man can both condemn and help, as the apostle says: “To some we are the scent of life to life, but to others we are the scent of death to death.” But every tribulation is either a punishment of the impious or a testing of the just.… Further, peace and quiet from disruptive times can both profit the good and corrupt the evil.
