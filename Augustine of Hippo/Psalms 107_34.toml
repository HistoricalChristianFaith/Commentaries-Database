"A fruitful land to be saltpools" [Psalm 107:34]. You seek there the faith of Christ, you find not: you seek a prophet, you find not: you seek a sacrifice, you find not: you seek a temple, you find none. Wherefore this? "From the wickedness of them that dwell therein." Behold how He resists the proud: hear how He gives grace to the humble.
