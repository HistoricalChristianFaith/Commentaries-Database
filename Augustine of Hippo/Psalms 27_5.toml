"For He has hidden me in His tabernacle in the day of my evils" [Psalm 27:5]. For He has hidden me in the dispensation of His Incarnate Word in the time of temptations, to which my mortal life is exposed. "He has protected me in the secret place of His tabernacle." He has protected me, with the heart believing unto righteousness.
