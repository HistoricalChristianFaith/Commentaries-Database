We saw the martyr so patiently enduring the most monstrous torments; but his soul was submitting itself to God, because it was from him that his patience came. And lest human frailty should fail through lack of patience and deny Christ, and contribute to the enemy’s joy, he knew to whom he should say, “My God, rescue me from the hand of the sinner, from the hand of the lawbreaker and the wicked, since you are my patience.” In this way, you see, the person who sang these words signified how Christians should ask to be rescued from the hands of their enemies; not, certainly, by suffering nothing but by enduring what they suffer with perfect patience. “Rescue me from the hand of the sinner, from the hand of the lawbreaker and the wicked.” But if you ask how he wants to be rescued, look at what follows: “since you are my patience.” You will find a glorious passion, wherever there is this devout confession, so that “whoever boasts, may boast in the Lord.”

We have been watching a magnificent spectacle with the eyes of faith, the holy martyr Vincent everywhere victorious. He was victorious in his words, victorious in the pains he endured; victorious in his confession, victorious in his tribulations; victorious when burned with fire, victorious when submerged in the waves. When his flesh, which was a kind of tribute to the victorious Christ, was thrown into the sea from the boat, it silently said, “We are cast down but not lost.” Who can have endowed this soldier with such patience but the one who first shed his blood for him? The one to whom it says in the psalm, “Since you are my patience, Lord, my hope from my youth.” A great contest earns great glory; not human or temporal glory, but divine and eternal. Faith is doing battle; and when faith is doing battle, nobody can overthrow the flesh. Because even if it is mangled and torn to shreds, when can anyone perish who has been redeemed by the blood of Christ? A powerful person cannot lose what he has bought with his gold, and can Christ lose what he bought with his blood?
