A person would not have wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of God unless, according to the prophet’s words, he had received “the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, of counsel and of fortitude, of knowledge and of godliness, and of fear of God.” … And a person would not have power and love and sobriety, except by receiving the Spirit of whom the apostle speaks: “We have not received the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sobriety.” So also one would not have faith unless he received the spirit of faith of which the same apostle says: “But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written, ‘I believed, therefore I have spoken,’ we also believe therefore we speak also.” Thus he shows very plainly that faith is not received because of merit but by the mercy of him who has mercy on whom he will, when he says of himself: “I have obtained mercy to be faithful.”

For if Paul had said only “Jesus Christ,” he would have included Jesus Christ according to his divinity, according to his being the Word who was with God, Jesus Christ the Son of God. Yet children cannot receive what is said in this manner. How, therefore, do they who are fed milk receive it? “Jesus Christ,” he said, “and him crucified.” Feed upon what he did for you, and you will grow to know him as he is.Some ascend the ladder, therefore, and some descend on it. Who are those that ascend? They who make progress toward the knowledge of spiritual realities. Who are those that descend? They who, although enjoying as great a knowledge of spiritual realities as is possible for humans, nevertheless descend to the level of children to speak of such things that children can understand, so that those who had been nourished with milk might be made fit and strong enough to receive spiritual food. Isaiah, brothers, was himself among those who descended to us, for the steps upon which he descended are obvious. In reference to the Holy Spirit, he said “the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and fortitude, of knowledge and piety, the Spirit of the fear of God rested upon him,” he began from wisdom and descended toward fear. See how the teacher descended from wisdom toward fear; you who learn, if you are to make progress, must ascend from fear to wisdom. For it is written, “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Listen, therefore, to the psalms.

The Holy Spirit is denoted in Scripture principally by the number seven, whether in Isaiah or in the Apocalypse, where the seven spirits of God are referenced most clearly under the sevenfold operation of one and the same Spirit. The Spirit’s sevenfold operation is also indicated through the prophet Isaiah: “the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and fortitude, of knowledge and piety, the Spirit of the fear of God rested upon him.” This fear of the Lord should be understood as pure, enduring forever.

“The love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.”That the Holy Spirit is suggested by the number seven anybody knows who can read. But listen anyway, those of you who read carelessly, or perhaps cannot read. This is how God presents the Holy Spirit through the prophet Isaiah: “The Spirit,” he says, “of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and fortitude, of knowledge and piety, the Spirit of the fear of God.” This is the sevenfold Spirit who is also called down upon the newly baptized. The law is the Decalogue; the Ten Commandments, you see, were written on tablets, but stone ones still, because of the stubborn hardness of the Jews. After the Spirit came, what does the apostle say? “You yourselves are our letter, not written with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tablets of stone, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart.” Take away the Spirit, the letter kills, because it finds the sinner guilty, doesn’t set him free. That’s why the apostle says, “For we are not sufficient of ourselves to think anything as coming from ourselves; but our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to be ministers of the new covenant, not in the letter, but in the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit brings to life.” So add seven to ten, if you wish to fulfill all justice. When you are commanded by the law to do something, ask the Spirit to help you.

Now in respect of this passage of the apostle, we must be on our guard against supposing that we have not received the spirit of the fear of God, which is undoubtedly a great gift of God, and concerning which the prophet Isaiah says, “The Spirit of the Lord shall rest upon you, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the spirit of knowledge and piety, the spirit of the fear of the Lord.” It is not the fear with which Peter denied Christ that we have received the spirit of, but that fear concerning which Christ himself says, “Fear him who has power to destroy both soul and body in hell; yes, I say to you, ‘Fear him.’ ” This, indeed, he said, lest we should deny him from the same fear which shook Peter; for such cowardice he plainly wished to be removed from us when he, in the preceding passage, said, “Be not afraid of them that kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.” It is not of this fear that we have received the spirit, but of power, and of love and of a sound mind.

It seems to me, therefore, that the sevenfold operation of the Holy Spirit, of which Isaiah speaks, coincides with these stages and maxims. However, the order is different. In Isaiah, the enumeration begins from the higher, while here it begins from the lower; in the former, it starts from wisdom and ends at the fear of God. But “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.” Therefore, if we ascend step by step, as it were, while we enumerate, the first grade is the love of God; the second is piety; the third is knowledge; the fourth is fortitude; the fifth is counsel; the sixth is understanding; the seventh is wisdom. The fear of God coincides with the humble, of whom it is here said, “Blessed are the poor in spirit.”

If we say that faith goes before and that the merit of grace is in it, what merit does a man have before faith so as to receive faith? For, what has he that he has not received? And if he has received it, why does he glory as if he had not received it? Just as a man would not have wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of God unless, according to the prophet’s words, he had received “the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, of counsel and of power, of knowledge and of godliness, and of fear of God.” In the same way, he would not have power and love and sobriety, except by receiving the Spirit of whom the apostle speaks: “We have not received the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of sobriety.” So also he would not have faith unless he received the spirit of faith of which the same apostle says, “But having the same spirit of faith, as it is written: ‘I believed for which cause I have spoken,’ we also believe for which cause we also speak.” Thus he shows very plainly that faith is not received because of merit but by the mercy of him who has mercy on whom he will, when he says of himself: “I have obtained mercy to be faithful.”
