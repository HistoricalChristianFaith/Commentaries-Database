Persecution, therefore, will never be lacking. For, when our enemies from without leave off raging and there ensues a span of tranquillity—even of genuine tranquillity and great consolation at least to the weak—we are not without enemies within, the many whose scandalous lives wound the hearts of the devout.… So it is that those who want to live piously in Christ must suffer the spiritual persecution of these and other aberrations in thought and morals, even when they are free from physical violence and vexation.

What sort of people, though, are those who, being afraid to offend the ones they are talking to, not only don’t prepare them for the trials that are looming ahead but even promise them a well-being in this world which God himself hasn’t promised to the world? He foretells distress upon distress coming upon the world right up to the end, and do you wish the Christian to be exempt from these distresses? Precisely because he’s Christian, he is going to suffer more in this world.
