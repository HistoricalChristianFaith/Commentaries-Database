Because the life of the flesh is the soul, so the blessed life of humankind is God, of whom the sacred writings of the Hebrews say, “Blessed are people whose God is the Lord.” Miserable, therefore, are people who are alienated from God. Yet even this people has a peace of its own that is not to be lightly esteemed, though, indeed, it shall not in the end enjoy it, because it makes no good use of it before the end. But it is our interest that it enjoys this peace meanwhile in this life. As long as the two cities are combined, we enjoy the peace of Babylon. For from Babylon the people of God is so freed that it meanwhile travels in its company. Therefore the apostle also admonished the church to pray for kings and those in authority, assigning as the reason “that we may live a quiet and tranquil life in all godliness and love.” And the prophet Jeremiah, when predicting the captivity that was to befall the ancient people of God and giving them the divine command to go obediently to Babylonia and thus serve their God, counseled them also to pray for Babylonia, saying, “In its peace you will have peace”—the temporal peace that the good and the wicked together enjoy.

Remember then, that Jeconiah, rejected without any fault of his own, ceased to reign and passed into the custody of the Gentiles when the exile to Babylon took place. Now observe the symbol of things to come in the Lord Jesus Christ revealed in advance. For the Jews did not want our Lord Jesus Christ to reign over them, yet they found no fault in him. He was rejected in his own person and in that of his servants also, and so they passed into the custody of the Gentiles as into Babylon symbolically.… How then do the people of Israel, not now in symbol but in truth, pass into the custody of Babylon? Where did the apostles come from? Were they not from the nation of the Jews? Where did Paul come from? He said, “I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.” Many of the Jews then believed in the Lord. From these were the apostles chosen. From these were the more than five hundred brothers, who were allowed to see the Lord after his resurrection. From these were the 120 in the house when the Holy Spirit came down.But what does the apostle in the Acts of the Apostles say, when the Jews refused the word of truth? “We were sent to you, but seeing you have rejected the word of God, see, we turn to the Gentiles.” The true passing over into Babylon, which was prefigured in the time of Jeremiah, took place in the spiritual dispensation of the time of the Lord’s incarnation. But what does Jeremiah say about these Babylonians to those who were passing into their custody? “For in their peace shall be your peace.” When Israel then went into exile in Babylon by Christ and the apostles, that is, when the gospel came to the Gentiles, what did the apostle say, as though by the mouth of Jeremiah in ancient times? “I exhort therefore that, first of all, supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all people. For kings, and for all that are in authority, so that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty.” For they were not Christian kings, yet he prayed for them. Israel then praying in Babylon has been heard. The prayers of the church have been heard, and the kings have become Christian, and you see now fulfilled what was then spoken in symbol: “In their peace shall be your peace,” for they have received the peace of Christ and have ceased persecuting Christians, that now in the secure quiet of peace, the churches might be built up and peoples planted in the garden of God, and that all nations might bring forth fruit in faith and hope and love, which is in Christ.
