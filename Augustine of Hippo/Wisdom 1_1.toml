Christ died for the ungodly and sinners so that we might be called to believe, not by merit but by grace, and thus by believing we might also establish merit. This is why sinners are commanded to believe, because by believing one purges himself from sins. Sinners, in fact, have no idea what they will see by living rightly. This is why"since they cannot see unless they live rightly, and they cannot live rightly unless they believe"it is obvious that they must begin by believing. In this way the commandments, by which those who believe separate themselves from the things of this world, purify their hearts"for only with a pure heart can one see God. "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God." Also, in the words of the prophecy it is sung, "Seek him in sincerity of heart." - "On Eighty-three Varied Questions 68.3"
