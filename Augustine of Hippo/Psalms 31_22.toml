"I said in my ecstasy"  [Psalm 31:22]. Whence that people again speaking says, I said in my fear, when the heathen were raging horribly against me. "I have been cast forth from the sight of Your eyes." For if You had regard to me, You would not suffer me to endure these things. "Therefore You heard, O Lord, the voice of my prayer, when I cried unto You." Therefore putting a limit to correction, and showing that I have part in Your care, You heard, O Lord, the voice of my prayer, when I raised it high  out of tribulation.
