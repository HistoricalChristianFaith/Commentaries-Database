But, because the body of Christ has suffered many most grievous evils for this faith, he says, "I was humbled above measure" [Psalm 119:107]. He does not say, I have humbled myself, so that we must needs understand that humiliation which is commanded; but he says, "I was humbled above-measure;" that is, suffered a very heavy persecution, because he swore and was steadfastly purposed to keep the righteous judgments of God. And, lest in such trouble faith herself might faint he adds, "Quicken me, O Lord, according to Your word:" that is, according to Your promise. For the word of the promises of God is a lantern to the feet, and a light to the paths. Thus also above, in the humiliation of persecution, he prayed that God would quicken him.
