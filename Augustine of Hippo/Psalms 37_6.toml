"And He shall bring forth your righteousness as the light" [Psalm 37:6]. For now, "your righteousness" is hid. Now it is a thing of faith; not yet of sight. You believe something that you may do it. You do not yet see that in which you believe. But when you shall begin to see that, which you believed before, "your righteousness will be brought forth to the light," because it is your faith that was  your righteousness. For "the just lives by faith."
