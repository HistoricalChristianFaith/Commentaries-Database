"The works of His hands are verity and judgment" [Psalm 111:7]. Let verity be held by those who are judged here. Martyrs are here sentenced, and brought to the judgment-seat, that they may judge not only those by whom they have been judged, but even give judgment on angels, [1 Corinthians 6:3] against whom was their struggle here, even when they seemed to be judged by men. Let not tribulation, distress, famine, nakedness, the sword, separate from Christ. For "all His commandments are true;" [Romans 8:35] He deceives not, He gives us what He promised. Yet we should not expect here what He promised; we should not hope for it.
