Does it not strike you when the Lord says in the Gospel, “When the Son of man comes, do you think he will find faith on earth?” Knowing that some would arrogantly attribute this faith to themselves, he immediately said, “To some who seemed to themselves to be just and despised others, he spoke this parable. Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican, etc.”
