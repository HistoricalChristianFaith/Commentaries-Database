Does it not strike you when the Lord says in the Gospel, “When the Son of man comes, do you think he will find faith on earth?” Knowing that some would arrogantly attribute this faith to themselves, he immediately said, “To some who seemed to themselves to be just and despised others, he spoke this parable. Two men went up into the temple to pray: the one a Pharisee and the other a publican, etc.”

His fault wasnot that he gave God thanks, but that he asked for nothing further. Because you are full and abounds, you have no need to say, Forgive us our debts. What then must be his guilt who impiously fights against grace, when he is condemned who proudly gives thanks? Let those hear who say, &#8220;God has made me man, I made myself righteous. O worse and more hateful than the Pharisee, who proudly called himself righteous, yet gave thanks to God that he was so.
Hemight at least have said, &#8220;as many men;&#8221; for what does he mean by &#8220;other men,&#8221; but all besides himself? &#8220;I am righteous, he says, the rest are sinners.&#8221; .
See how he; derives from the Publican near him afresh occasion for pride. It follows, Or even as this Publican; as if he says, &#8220;I stand alone, heis one of the others.&#8221;.
If you look into his words, you will find that he asked nothing of God. He goes upindeed to pray, but instead of asking God, praises himself; and even insults him that asked. The Publican, on the other hand, driven by his stricken conscience afar off, is by his piety brought near.
Why then marvel you, whether God pardons, since He himself acknowledges it. The Publican stood afar off, yet drew near to God. And the Lord was nigh to him, and heard him, For the Lord is on high, yet has he regard to the lowly. He lifted not so much as his eyes to heaven; that he might be looked upon, he looked not himself. Conscience weighed him down, hope raised him up, he smote his own breast, he exacted judgment upon himself. Therefore did the Lord spare the penitent. You have heard the accusation of the proud, you have heard the humble confession of the accused Hear now the sentence of the Judge; Verily I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other.
