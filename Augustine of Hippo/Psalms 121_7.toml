"For the Lord shall preserve you from all evil" [Psalm 121:7]. From offenses in the sun, from offenses in the moon, from all evil shall He preserve you, who is your defence upon the hand of your right hand, who will not sleep nor slumber. And for what reason? Because we are amid temptations: "The Lord shall preserve you from all evil. The Lord preserve your soul:" even your very soul.
