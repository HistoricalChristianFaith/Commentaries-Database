It was in this way, you see, that the psalmist whose feet were shaken blamed himself, because he had started to find fault with God and was already on the point of doing so; but he was almost on the point of it; he was not quite there yet. He did not deny that God knew, but he staggered, as if his feet were shaken. What does it mean to stagger? To doubt. When he blamed himself, though, for not having an upright heart, what did he say? “Why were my feet disturbed? Because I was envious, he said, of sinners, seeing the peace of sinners. Because I saw that the wicked were rich, I envied them; and I said I have lost out on justice, and for no reason have I made my heart just, and washed my hands among the innocent. And while I am in doubt, this is how I have begun to understand.”“This is how I have begun,” he says, “to understand this; there is toil ahead of me.” Great toil, to solve this problem. It really is hard labor. All is well with that one, and he is a bad man; all goes badly with this one, and he is a good man; and over them both is God the judge. So the just judge is giving good things to bad people, bad things to good people. “There is toil ahead of me.” But for how long is the toil there? “Until I enter into the sanctuary of God and understand about the last things.” So if you understand about the last things, you will enjoy the quiet rest of discovery, the toil of inquiry will be over and done with.
