Silently, i.e. speaking in a low voice. For shedid speak, saying, the Master is come, and calls for you.
We may observe that the Evangelist has not said, where, or when, or how, the Lord called Mary, but for brevity’s sake has left it tobe gathered from Martha’s words.
So we see, if she had known of His arrival before, she would not have let Martha go without her. Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.
The Evangelist mentions this to show how it was that so many were present at Lazarus’ resurrection, and witness of that great miracle.
O faithless assembly! While You are yet in the world, Lazarus your friend dies! If the friend cries, what will the enemy suppose? Is it a small thing that they will not serve You upon earth? Lo, hell has taken your beloved.
