"You shall arise, and have mercy upon Sion: for it is time that Thou have mercy upon her" [Psalm 102:13]. What time? "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth His Son, made of a woman, made under the Law." And where is Sion? "To redeem them that were under the Law." [Galatians 4:4-5] First then were the Jews: for thence were the Apostles, thence those more than five hundred brethren, [1 Corinthians 15:6] thence that later multitude, who had but one heart and one soul toward God. [Acts 4:32] Therefore, "the time has come." What time? "Behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the day of salvation." [2 Corinthians 6:2] Who says this? That Servant of God, that Builder, who said, "You are God's building." [1 Corinthians 3:9-11]
