(Quæst. Ev. lib. ii. qu. 63.) It may seem that the account given in Matthew is different, where it is said, "Why askest thou me of good?" which might apply better to the question which he asked, What good shall I do? (Matt. 10.) In this place he both calls Him good, and asks the question about good. It will be best then to understand both to have been said, Why callest thou me good? and, Why askest thou me of good? though the latter may rather be implied in the former.

The Father is good. The Son is good. The Holy Spirit is good. Still, there are not three goods but one good. He said, “No one is good except the one God.” The Lord Jesus Christ did not answer. He feared that the one who in addressing a man had said “good master” might understand him as only a man. He therefore did not say, “No one is good except the Father alone.” He rather said, “No one is good except the one God.”

The young man asked the Lord how to attain to eternal life and heard that he must sell all his goods and distribute them to the poor and have his treasure in heaven. Why else did he go away sad, except that he had, as the Gospel says, great riches? It is one thing not to wish to hoard up what one does not have. It is another thing to scatter what has been accumulated. The former is like refusing food; the latter, like cutting off a limb.
