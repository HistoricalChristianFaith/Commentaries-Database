The Son of man will be the judge here. That form will pass judgment here that had judgment passed on it here. Listen and understand. The prophet had long ago said the same thing: “They will see the one whom they pierced.” They will see the very form that they struck with a lance. He will take his seat as judge, the very one who stood before a judge. He will condemn the truly guilty, the very one who was found falsely guilty. He is the one who will come and it is in the form [of man] that he will come [to judge]. SERMON 127.10.HE IS NOT OUR JUDGE BECAUSE HE IS THE SON OF MAN. AMMONIUS. Some think that it should read, “He gave him authority also to execute judgment because he is the Son of man.” But this connection makes no sense, for he is not our judge “because he is the Son of man,” but rather because he is the Son of God. That is why he is our judge.
