Making no secret that this fate is a penalty inflicted for sin, he adds at once, "For we consume away in Your displeasure, and are troubled at Your wrathful indignation" [Psalm 90:7]: we consume away in our weakness, and are troubled from the fear of death; for we have become weak, and yet fearful to end that weakness. "Another," says He, "shall gird you, and carry you whither you would not:" [JohnÂ 21:18] although not to be punished, but to be crowned, by martyrdom; and the soul of our Lord, transforming us into Himself, was sorrowful even unto death: for "the Lord's going out" is no other than in "death."
