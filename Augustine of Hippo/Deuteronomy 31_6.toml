Pay attention to what comes next: “Without love, a measure of money is sufficient for present needs, because he himself said, ‘I will not forsake you; I will not desert you.’ ” “You were afraid of all kinds of evils, against which you were saving money; count me as your guarantor.” That’s what God says to you. God—not a man, not your equal or you yourself—says to you: “I will not forsake you; I will not desert you.” If a person made such a promise, you would trust him. God makes it, and you hesitate? He made the promise, put it in writing, made out the bond; you needn’t worry at all.
