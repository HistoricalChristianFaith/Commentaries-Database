"Judge me, O Lord, for I have walked in my innocence" [Psalm 26:1]. Judge me, O Lord, for, after the mercy which You first showed  me, I have some desert of my innocence, the way whereof I have kept. "And trusting in the Lord I shall not be moved." And yet not even so trusting in myself, but in the Lord, I shall abide in Him.
