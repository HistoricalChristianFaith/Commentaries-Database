Is he not at the same time a lamb and a lion in both his suffering and his resurrection? Let us discern the lamb in the suffering. “He was,” as we just reminded you, “mute as a lamb before its shearer, and he opened not his mouth.” Let us discern the lion in the suffering. Jacob has said, “Thou hast risen: resting thou hast slept as a lion. Let us discern the lamb in the resurrection. When the Apocalypse is speaking of the everlasting glory of virgins, it says, “They follow the lamb wherever he goes.” Let us discern the lion in the resurrection. The Apocalypse also says, “The lion of the tribe of Judah has overcome to open the scroll.” Why is he a lamb in his suffering? Because, although he was innocent, he suffered death. Why is he a lion in his suffering? Because he slew death when he himself was slain. Why is he a lamb in his resurrection? Because his innocence is everlasting. Why is he a lion in his resurrection? Because his power is everlasting.
