"Their soul abhorred all manner of meat" [Psalm 107:18]. Now they suffer satiety. They are sick of satiety. They are in danger from satiety. Unless perchance you think they could be killed with famine, but cannot with satiety. See what follows. When he had said, "Their soul abhorred all manner of meat," lest you should think them, as it were, safe of their fullness, and not rather see that they would die of satiety: "And they came near," he says, "even unto the gates of death." What then remains? That even when the word of God delights you, thou account it not to yourself; nor for this be puffed up with any sort of arrogance, and having an appetite for food, proudly spurn at those who are in danger from satiety.
