When the Lord was speaking to the Father of those whom he already had as disciples, he said this also among other things: “I pray for them. I pray not for the world but for those whom you have given me.” By the world, he now wishes to be understood those who live according to the lust of the world and who do not stand in the gracious lot of those who were to be chosen by him out of the world. And so he says he prays not for the world but for those whom the Father has given him. For by the very fact of their having already been given to him by the Father, they have ceased belonging to that world for which he refrains from praying. And then he adds, “For they are yours.” The Father did not lose those whom he gave when he gave them to the Son. After all, the Son still goes on to say, “And all mine are yours, and yours are mine.”
