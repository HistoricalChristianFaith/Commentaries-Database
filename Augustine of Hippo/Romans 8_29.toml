Not all who are called are called according to God’s purpose, for the purpose relates to God’s foreknowledge and predestination. God only predestined those whom he knew would believe and follow the call. Paul refers to them as the “elect.” For many do not come, even though they have been called, but no one comes who has not been called.We should understand our Lord as “only begotten” in one sense and as “firstborn” in another. Christ is called “only begotten” because he has no brothers and is the Son of God by nature, the Word in the beginning by whom all things were made. But by his assumption of humanity and by the dispensation of the incarnation, through which even we who are not sons by nature have been called into the adoption of sons, he is said to be the “firstborn” of many brothers. For before him there was no resurrection of the dead … but now after him comes the resurrection of many saints, whom he does not hesitate to call “brothers” because he shares in their common humanity.

There are some who think that in the resurrection all will be men and that women will lose their sex. This view springs from this text and Ephesians: “Until we all attain to perfect manhood.” … For my part, I think that those who believe that there will be two sexes in the resurrection are more sensible.
