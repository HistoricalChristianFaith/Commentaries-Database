" Diapsalma." The Lord render to You according to Your Heart [Psalm 20:4]. The Lord render to You, not according to their heart, who thought by persecution they could destroy You; but according to Your Heart, wherein Thou knew what profit Your passion would have. [John 12:32] "And fulfil all Your counsel." "And fulfil all Your counsel." not only that whereby Thou laid down Your life for Your friends, [John 15:13] that the corrupted grain might rise again to more abundance; [John 12:24] but that also whereby "blindness in part has happened unto Israel, that the fullness of the Gentiles might enter in, and so all Israel might be saved." [Romans 11:25-26]
