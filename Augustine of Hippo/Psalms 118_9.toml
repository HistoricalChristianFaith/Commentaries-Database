text = '''Nor let any one, who may in a certain sense be styled a good angel, be regarded by myself as one in whom I ought to put my trust: for "no one is good, save God alone;" and when a man or an angel appear to aid us, when they do this of sincere affection, He does it through them, who made them good after their measure. "It is" therefore "better to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in princes." For angels also are called princes, even as we read in Daniel, "Michael, your prince."'''
