"Ask of Me, and I shall give You the nations for Your inheritance" [Psalm 2:8]. This has at once a temporal sense with reference to the Manhood which He took on Himself, who offered up Himself as a Sacrifice in the stead of all sacrifices, who also makes intercession for us; so that the words, "ask of Me," may be referred to all this temporal dispensation, which has been instituted for mankind, namely, that the "nations" should be joined to the Name of Christ, and so be redeemed from death, and possessed by God. "I shall give You the nations for Your inheritance," which so possess them for their salvation, and to bear unto You spiritual fruit. "And the uttermost parts of the earth for Your possession." The same repeated, "The uttermost parts of the earth," is put for "the nations;" but more clearly, that we might understand all the nations. And "Your possession" stands for "Your inheritance."
