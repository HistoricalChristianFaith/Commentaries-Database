"From the beginning I have known," he says, "as concerning Your testimonies, that You have grounded them for ever"  [Psalm 119:152]...What are these testimonies, save those wherein God has declared that He will give an everlasting kingdom unto His sons? And since He has declared that He will give this in His only-begotten Son, he said that the testimonies themselves were grounded for ever. For that which God has promised through them, was everlasting. And for this reason the words, "You have grounded them," are rightly thus understood, because they are shown to be true in Christ. [1 Corinthians 3:11] Whence then did the Psalmist know this in the beginning, save because the Church speaks, which was not wanting to the earth from the commencement of the human race, the first-fruits whereof was the holy Abel, himself sacrificed in testimony of the future blood of the Mediator that should be shed by a wicked brother? [Genesis 4:8] For this also was at the beginning, "They two shall be one flesh:" [Genesis 2:24] which great mystery the Apostle Paul expounding, says, "I speak concerning Christ and the Church." [Ephesians 5:32]

150. "From the beginning I have known," he saith, "as concerning Thy testimonies, that Thou hast grounded them for ever" (ver. 152) ...What are these testimonies, save those wherein God hath declared that He will give an everlasting kingdom unto His sons? And since He hath declared that He will give this in His only-begotten Son, he said that the testimonies themselves were grounded for ever. For that which God hath promised through them, was everlasting. And for this reason the words, "Thou hast grounded them," are rightly thus understood, because they are shown to be true in Christ. Whence then did the Psalmist know this in the beginning, save because the Church speaketh, which was not wanting to the earth from the commencement of the human race, the first-fruits whereof was the holy Abel, himself sacrificed in testimony of the future blood of the Mediator that should be shed by a wicked brother? For this also was at the beginning, "They two shall be one flesh:" which great mystery the Apostle Paul expounding, saith, "I speak concerning Christ and the Church."
