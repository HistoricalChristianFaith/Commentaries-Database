Previously, you see, when [Christ] was showing us an example of humility in the flesh, it was said with reference to his passion that the waves of the sea rose mightily against him, to which he yielded voluntarily for our sakes, so fulfilling the prophecy, “I came into the depth of the sea, and the tempest overwhelmed me.” Thus he did not rebut the false witnesses or the savage roar of the crowd, “Have him crucified!” He did not use his power to quell the raging hearts and stop the mouths of the furious mob, but he bore it all with patience. They did to him whatever they wanted, because “he became obedient unto death, even death on a cross.”
