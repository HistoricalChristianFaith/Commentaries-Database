"Your power and Your righteousness" [Psalm 71:19]. That is, that I may tell forth to every generation that is yet to come, Your arm. And what has Your arm effected? This then let me tell forth, that same grace to every generation succeeding: let me say to every man that is to be born, nothing you are by yourself, on God call thou, your own are sins, merits are God's:  punishment to you is owing, and when reward shall have come, His own gifts He will crown, not your merits. Let me say to every generation that is to come, out of captivity you have come, unto Adam you belonged. Let me say this to every generation that is to come, that there is no strength of mine, no righteousness of mine; but "Your strength and Your righteousness, O God, even unto the most high mighty works which You have made." "Your power and Your righteousness," as far as what? Even unto flesh and blood? Nay, "even unto the most high mighty works which You have made." For the high places are the heavens, in the high places are the Angels, Thrones, Dominions, Principalities, Powers: to You they owe it that they are; to You they owe it that they live, to You they owe it that righteously they live, to You they owe it that blessedly they live. "Your power and Your righteousness," as far as what? "Even unto the most high mighty works which You have made." Think not that man alone belongs to the grace of God. What was Angel before he was made? What is Angel, if He forsake him who has created? Therefore "Your power and Your justice even unto the most high mighty works which You have made."
