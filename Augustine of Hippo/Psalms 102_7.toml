...Let us not pass over what is said, or even read, of this bird, that is, the pelican; not rashly asserting anything, but yet not passing over what has been left to be read and uttered by those who have written it. Do ye so hear, that if it be true, it may agree; if false, it may not hold. These birds are said to slay their young with blows of their beaks, and for three days to mourn them when slain by themselves in the nest: after which they say the mother wounds herself deeply, and pours forth her blood over her young, bathed in which they recover life. This may be true, it may be false: yet if it be true, see how it agrees with Him, who gave us life by His blood.  It agrees with Him in that the mother's flesh recalls to life her young with her blood; it agrees well. For He calls Himself a hen brooding over her young. [Matthew 23:37] ...If, then, it be so truly, this bird does closely resemble the flesh of Christ, by whose blood we have been called to life. But how may it agree with Christ, that the bird herself slays her own young? Does not this agree with it? "I will slay, and I will make alive: I will wound, and I will heal." [Deuteronomy 32:39] Would the persecutor Saul [Acts 9:4] have died, unless he were wounded from heaven; or would the preacher be raised up, unless by life given him from His blood? But let those who have written on the subject see to this; we ought not to allow our understanding of it to rest upon doubtful ground.  Let us rather recognise this bird in the wilderness; as the Psalm expresses it, "A pelican in the solitude." I suppose that Christ born of a Virgin is here meant. He was born in loneliness, because He alone was thus born. After the nativity, we come to His Passion....Born in the wilderness, because alone so born; suffering in the darkness of the Jews as it were in night, in their sin, as it were in ruins: what next? "I have watched:" and "have become even as it were a sparrow, that sits alone upon the house-top" [Psalm 102:7]. You had then slept amid the ruins, and had said, "I laid me down, and slept."  What means, "I slept"? Because I chose, I slept: I slept for love of night: but, "I rose again," follows. Therefore "I watched," is here said. But after He watched, what did He? He ascended into heaven, He became as a sparrow by flying; that is, by ascending; "alone on the house-top;" that is, in heaven. He is therefore as the pelican by birth, as the owl by dying, as the sparrow by ascending again: there in the wilderness, as one alone; here in the ruined walls, as one slain by those who could not stand in the building; and here again watching and flying for our sakes alone on the house-top, He there intercedes in our behalf. [Romans 8:34] For our Head is as the sparrow, His body as the turtle-dove. "For the sparrow has found her an house." What house? In heaven, where He does mediate for us. "And the turtle-dove a nest," the Church of God has found a nest from the wood of His Cross, where "she may lay her young," her children.
