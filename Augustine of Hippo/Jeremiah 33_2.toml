“And let them who know your name hope in you” when they shall have ceased hoping in wealth and in the other enticements of this world. For the soul indeed that seeks where to fix its hope, when it is torn away from this world, the knowledge of God’s name seasonably receives. For the mere name of God has now been published everywhere. When you know someone, you know his name. For the name is not a name for its own sake but for that which it signifies. Now it has been said, “The Lord is his name.” Therefore those who willingly submit to God as his servants have known this name.
