After many descriptive phrases it says of the Spirit of wisdom, "Acute, mobile, certain, immaculate." Thus the Wisdom of God is also mobile. Now, if it is mobile, when it dwells in one place, does it perhaps not dwell in another? Or if it is here, does it depart from there? What, then, about speed? Its speed derives from this: that it is always everywhere, and nothing can contain it. But we are incapable of thinking of such things"we are slow. Who could ever think of them? In fact, brothers and sisters, I have said something to you as best I can (if I have in fact understood something), and likewise you have understood as best you can. But what does the apostle say? "To him who can accomplish more than all we can ask or think." What can we deduce from this? That even when we understand, we do not understand how things really are, objectively. Why is this? "The corruptible body weighs down the soul." Therefore, as long as we are on earth we will be cold, whereas speed burns with heat"and all hot things are fast, but what is cold is slow. We are slow, and thus cold, while Wisdom runs at the maximum limit of speed. It is therefore exceedingly hot, and no one can escape its heat. - "Expositions of the Psalms 147.22"
