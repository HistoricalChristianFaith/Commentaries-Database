Therefore, coming with all angels, together with him he shall have the saints also. For plainly says Isaiah also, “He shall come to judgment with the elders of the people.” Those “elders of the people,” then, those called “angels” in this passage, those thousands of many people made perfect coming from the whole world, are called “heaven.”

For not alone he shall come to judgment but with the elders of his people, to whom he has promised that they shall sit upon thrones to judge, who even shall judge angels. These are the clouds Isaiah is speaking of.
