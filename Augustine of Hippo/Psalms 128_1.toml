"Blessed are all they that fear the Lord, and walk in His ways" [Psalm 128:1]. He speaks to many; but since these many are one in Christ, in the next words he speaks in the singular: "For you shall eat the labours of your fruits."...When I speak of Christians in the plural, I understand one in the One Christ. You are therefore many, and you are one; we are many, and we are one. How are we many, and yet one? Because we cling unto Him whose members we are; and since our Head is in heaven, that His members may follow....Let us therefore so hear this Psalm, as considering it to be spoken of Christ: and all of us who cling unto the Body of Christ, and have been made members of Christ, walk in the ways of the Lord; and let us fear the Lord with a chaste fear, with a fear that abides for ever....
