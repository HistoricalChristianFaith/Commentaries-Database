“Your speech (sermo) is truth.” What else did he mean than “I am the truth?” For the Greek Gospel has logos, which is also the word that is found in the passage where it is said, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.” And that Word at least we know to be the only begotten Son of God, which “was made flesh and dwelt among us.” And so, there also might have been put here (as it actually has been put in certain copies) “Your Word is truth,” just as in some copies that other passage is written, “In the beginning was the speech.” But in the Greek without any variation it is logos in both cases. The Father therefore sanctifies in the truth—that is, in his own Word, in his Only Begotten—his own heirs and his [Son’s] co-heirs.
