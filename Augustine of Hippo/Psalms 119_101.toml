But what comes next, does not seem to apply to the Head, but to the Body: "I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I may keep Your words" [Psalm 119:101]. For that Head of ours, the Saviour of the Body Himself, could not be borne by carnal lust into any evil way, so that it should be needful for Him to refrain His feet, as though they would go there of their own accord; which we do, when we refrain our evil desires, which He had not, that they may not follow evil ways. For thus we are able to keep the word of God, if we "go not after our evil lusts," [Sirach 18:30] so that they attain unto the evils desired; but rather curb them with the spirit which lusts against the flesh, [Galatians 5:17] that they may not drag us away, seduced and overthrown, through evil ways.
