"Who is the man that fears the Lord?" from which fear he begins to come to wisdom. "He shall establish a law for him in the way, which he has chosen" [Psalm 25:12]. He shall establish a law for him in the way, which in his freedom he has taken, that he may not sin now with impunity.

12. "Who is the man that feareth the Lord?" from which fear he begins to come to wisdom. "He shall establish a law for him in the way, which he hath chosen" (ver. 12). He shall establish a law for him in the way, which in his freedom he has taken, that he may not sin now with impunity.
