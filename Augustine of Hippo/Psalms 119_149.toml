"Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Your loving-mercy; and quicken Thou me according to Your judgment" [Psalm 119:149]. For first God according to His loving-mercy takes away punishment from sinners, and will give them life afterwards, when righteous, according to His judgment; for it is not without a meaning that it is said unto Him, "My song shall be of mercy and judgment: unto You, O Lord;"  in this order of the terms: although the season of mercy itself be not without judgment, whereof the Apostle says, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord." [1 Corinthians 11:31] ...And the final season of judgment shall not be without mercy, since as the Psalm says, "He crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness." But "judgment shall be without mercy," but "unto those" on the left, "who have not dealt mercy." [James 2:13]
