"Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Your loving-mercy; and quicken Thou me according to Your judgment" [Psalm 119:149]. For first God according to His loving-mercy takes away punishment from sinners, and will give them life afterwards, when righteous, according to His judgment; for it is not without a meaning that it is said unto Him, "My song shall be of mercy and judgment: unto You, O Lord;"  in this order of the terms: although the season of mercy itself be not without judgment, whereof the Apostle says, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord." [1 Corinthians 11:31] ...And the final season of judgment shall not be without mercy, since as the Psalm says, "He crowns you with mercy and loving-kindness." But "judgment shall be without mercy," but "unto those" on the left, "who have not dealt mercy." [James 2:13]

147. "Hear my voice, O Lord, according to Thy loving-mercy; and quicken Thou me according to Thy judgment" (ver. 149). For first God according to His loving-mercy taketh away punishment from sinners, and will give them life afterwards, when righteous, according to His judgment; for it is not without a meaning that it is said unto Him, "My song shall be of mercy and judgment: unto Thee, O Lord;" in this order of the terms: although the season of mercy itself be not without judgment, whereof the Apostle saith, "If we would judge ourselves, we should not be judged of the Lord." ...And the final season of judgment shall not be without mercy, since as the Psalm saith, "He crowneth thee with mercy and loving-kindness." But "judgment shall be without mercy," but "unto those" on the left, "who have not dealt mercy."
