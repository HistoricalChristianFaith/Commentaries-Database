"Give thanks unto the God of Heaven" [Psalm 136:26]. "Give thanks unto the Lord of lords" [Psalm 136:3]. For what he here says, "the God of Heaven," I suppose that he meant to express in other words what He had before said, "the God of gods." For what there he subjoined, he has here also repeated. "Give thanks unto the Lord of lords." "But to us there is but one God," etc., "and one Lord Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by Him;" [1 Corinthians 8:5-6] to whom we confess that "His mercy endures for ever."
