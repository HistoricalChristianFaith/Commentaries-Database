"Jesus answered them, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of my bread, and were filled." Ye seek me for the sake of the flesh, not for that of the Spirit. How many there are that seek Jesus with no other aim than to gain some temporal benefit! One man has a business on hand, he seeks the intercession of the clergy; another is oppressed by some person more powerful than himself, he flies to the Church for refuge: another wishes to have interest made for him with one to whom he has little access himself; one in this way, another in that, the Church is daily full of such people. Jesus is hardly sought for Jesus' sake.
