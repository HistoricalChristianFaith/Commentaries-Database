"How great things He has done to my soul." "To Him with my mouth I have cried" [Psalm 66:17]. And this very thing, he says, has been done to his soul; that to Him with his mouth he should cry, has been done, he says, to his soul. Behold, brethren, Gentiles we were, even if not in ourselves, in our parents. And what says the Apostle? "You know, when Gentiles you were, to idols without speech how ye went up, being led." [1 Corinthians 12:2] Let the Church now say, "how great things He has done to my soul." "To Him with my mouth I have cried." I a man to a stone was crying, to a deaf stock I was crying, to idols deaf and dumb I was speaking: now the image of God has been turned to the Creator thereof. I that was "saying to a stock, My father you are; and to a stone, You have begotten me:" [Jeremiah 2:27] now say, "Our Father, which art in Heaven." [Matthew 6:9] ..."To Him with my mouth I have cried, and I have exalted Him under my tongue." See how in secret He would be uncorrupt that offers marrowed holocausts. This do ye, brethren, this imitate, so that you may say, "Come ye, see how great things He has done to my soul." For all those things of which he tells, by His Grace are done in our soul. See the other things of which he speaks.
