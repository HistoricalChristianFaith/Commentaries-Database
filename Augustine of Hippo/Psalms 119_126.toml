"It is time," he says, "for the Lord to lay to His hand" [Psalm 119:126]. For this is the reading of most copies: not as some have, "O Lord." Now what is this, save the grace which was revealed in Christ at its own time? Of which season the Apostle says, "But when the fullness of time had come, God sent His Son." [GalatiansÂ 4:4] ...But wherefore is it that, seemingly anxious to show the Lord that it was time to lay to His hand, he has subjoined, "They have scattered Your law;" as if it were the season for the Lord to act, because the proud scattered His law. For what means this? In the wickedness of transgression, they have not guarded its integrity. It was needful therefore that the Law should be given to the proud and those presuming in the freedom of their own will, after a transgression of which whosoever were contrite and humbled, might run no longer by the Law, but by faith, to aiding grace. When the Law therefore was scattered, it was time that mercy should be sent through the only-begotten Son of God.
