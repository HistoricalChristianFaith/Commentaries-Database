"Deliver me from mine enemies, O Lord, for unto You have I fled for refuge" [Psalm 143:9]. I who once fled from You, now flee to You. For Adam fled from the Face of God, and hid himself among the trees of Paradise, so that of him was said in the Book of Job, "As a servant that flees from his Lord, and finds a shadow."  He fled from the Face of his Lord, and found a shadow. Woe to him, if he continue in the shade, lest it be said afterward, "All things are passed away like a shadow." [Wisdom 5:9] The rulers of this world, of this darkness, the rulers of the wicked; against these ye wrestle. Great is your conflict, not to see your enemies, and yet to conquer. Against the rulers of this world, of this darkness, the devil, that is, and his angels; not the rulers of that world, whereof is said, "the world was made by Him," but that world whereof is said, "the world knew Him not." [John 1:10] "For unto You have I fled for refuge."...Whither should I flee? "Whither shall I go from Your Spirit?"
