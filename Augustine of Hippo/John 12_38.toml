It is evident here that the arm of the Lord is the Son of God himself. Not that the Father has a human fleshly form. He is called the arm of the Lord because all things were made by him.… If someone had power like this so that, without any motion of his body, what he said was then done, the word of that person would be his arm.… There is no ground here to justify, however, the error of those who say that the Godhead is one person only, because the Son is the arm of the Father, and a person and his arm are not two persons, but one. These people do not understand that the most common things are required to be explained often by applying language to them taken from other things in which there happens to be a likeness.… But some mutter and ask, What fault was it of the Jews if it was necessary that the sayings of Isaiah should be fulfilled when he said, “Lord, who has believed our report and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?” We answer that God, foreseeing the future, predicted by the prophet the unbelief of the Jews, but did not cause it. God does not compel people to sin, because he knows they will sin. He foreknows their sins, not his own.… The Jews committed the sin that he who knows all things foretold they would commit.
