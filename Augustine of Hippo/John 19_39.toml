Joseph and Nicodemus buried him. As some people have explained their names, Joseph means “increased.” Because Nicodemus is a Greek name, many will know that it is a compound of “victory” and “people,” since nikos means “victory” and demos means “people.” So, who was increased by dying if not the one who said, “If the grain of wheat does not die, it remains alone. But if it dies, it is multiplied”? And who by his very dying won a victory over the people who were persecuting him, if not the one who by his rising will sit in judgment on them?

(Tr. cxx) We must not read the words, at the first, first bringing a mixture of myrrh, but attach the first to the former clause. For Nicodemus at the first came to Jesus by night, as John relates in the former part of the Gospel. From these words then we are to infer that that was not the only time that Nicodemus went to our Lord, but simply the first time; and that he came afterwards and heard Christ's discourses, and became a disciple.

We are not to explain the meaning by saying, "first bringing a mixture of myrrh," but by attaching the word "first" to the preceding clause. For Nicodemus had at first come to Jesus by night, as recorded by this same John in the earlier portions of his Gospel. By the statement given us here, therefore, we are to understand that Nicodemus came to Jesus, not then only, but then for the first time; and that he was a regular comer afterwards, in order by hearing to become a disciple.
