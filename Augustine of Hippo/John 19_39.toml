Joseph and Nicodemus buried him. As some people have explained their names, Joseph means “increased.” Because Nicodemus is a Greek name, many will know that it is a compound of “victory” and “people,” since nikos means “victory” and demos means “people.” So, who was increased by dying if not the one who said, “If the grain of wheat does not die, it remains alone. But if it dies, it is multiplied”? And who by his very dying won a victory over the people who were persecuting him, if not the one who by his rising will sit in judgment on them?
