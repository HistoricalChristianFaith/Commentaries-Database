For Nicodemus had at first come to Jesus by night, as recorded by this same John in the earlier portions of his Gospel. By the statement given us here, therefore, we are to understand that Nicodemus came to Jesus, not only then, but he might that he was a regular visitor afterward in order, by hearing, to become a disciple.

Joseph and Nicodemus buried him. As some people have explained their names, Joseph means “increased.” Because Nicodemus is a Greek name, many will know that it is a compound of “victory” and “people,” since nikos means “victory” and demos means “people.” So, who was increased by dying if not the one who said, “If the grain of wheat does not die, it remains alone. But if it dies, it is multiplied”? And who by his very dying won a victory over the people who were persecuting him, if not the one who by his rising will sit in judgment on them?
