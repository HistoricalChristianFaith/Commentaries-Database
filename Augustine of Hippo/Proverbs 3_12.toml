What clearer evidence is there for pointing to God’s grace than in the case where we receive what we ask for in prayer? For if our Lord had said, “Watch that you enter not into temptation,” he would appear to have merely given an admonition to man’s will, whereas when he added the words “and pray,” he made it clear that it is God who helps us so that we do not fall into temptation. It is to human free will that these words have been directed: “Son, do not fall away from the correction of the Lord.”

What here and now is the punishment of those who go astray? Some affliction perhaps, and some scourging that is for the purpose of either correcting or testing. Either, you see, people are corrected for their sins to avoid their incurring, uncorrected, severer punishments, or else their faith is being tested, to see with what endurance or what patience it remains intact under the Father’s chastisement. [In either case,] not grumbling angrily at the Father when he chastises and rejoicing at his caresses; but so rejoicing at his caresses that one also thanks him for chastising; because “he chastises every son whom he receives.”

“Whom the Lord loves, he chastises; and he scourges every son whom he accepts.” … For, it is just that we who were dismissed from the pristine happiness of paradise because of our bold appetite for pleasures should be taken back through the humble endurance of difficulties, fugitives through our own evildoing, returning through suffering evils, there acting contrary to justice, here suffering for justice sake.

It is written, after all, “The Lord disciplines the one he loves, and scourges every son whom he receives.” Let us not fall away, then, under the lash, so that we may rejoice in the resurrection. So true is it, after all, that he scourges every son whom he receives, that he did not spare his only Son but handed him over for us all. So fixing our gaze on him, who was scourged without any sin to deserve it, and who died for our offenses and “rose again for our justification,” let us not be afraid of being cast aside when we are scourged, but rather [let us] be confident that we will be received when we are justified.
