"Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His own people" [Psalm 106:40]. Our translators have been unwilling to use the word anger, for the Greek θυμὸς; though some have used it; while others translate by "indignation" or "mind."  Whichever of these terms be adopted, passion does not affect God; but the power of punishing has assumed this name metaphorically from custom.

29. "Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against His own people" (ver. 40). Our translators have been unwilling to use the word anger, for the Greek qumoj; though some have used it; while others translate by "indignation" or "mind." Whichever of these terms be adopted, passion doth not affect God; but the power of punishing hath assumed this name metaphorically from custom.
