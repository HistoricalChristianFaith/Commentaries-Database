"And You have given me the defence of my salvation, and Your right hand has held me up" [Psalm 18:35]. And the favour of Your grace has held me up. "And Your discipline has directed me to the end." And Your correction, not suffering me to wander from the way, has directed me that whatsoever I do, I refer to that end, whereby I may cleave to You. "And this Your discipline, it shall teach me." And that same correction of Yours shall teach me to attain to that, whereunto it has directed me.
