What order does God impose on you? “Love me. You love gold, you will seek gold, and perhaps you will not find it. Whoever seeks me, I am with him. You will love honor, and perhaps you will not find it. Whoever seeks me, I am with him. Who has loved me and has not attained me?” God says to you, “You wish to make [someone] a patron or a powerful friend of yours; you solicit him through someone else inferior. Love me,” God says to you, “there is no soliciting of me through anyone; love itself makes me present to you.” What is sweeter than this love, brothers? Not without reason you just heard in the psalm, “The unjust have told me of delights, but not as your law, Lord.” What is the law of God? The commandment of God. What is the commandment of God? That new commandment that is called new for the very reason that it renews: “A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another.” Hear that this is the law of God. The apostle says, “Bear one another’s burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ.” This is the consummation of all our works, love. There is the end. Because of this we are running; to this we are running. When we come to it, we shall rest.

The true martyrs are those of whom the Lord says, “Blessed are they who suffer persecution for justice’s sake.” Therefore, it is not those who suffer for the sake of injustice and the impious division of Christian unity, but those who suffer persecution for justice’s sake who are truly martyrs. Hagar suffered persecution from Sarah, yet the one who persecuted was holy and she who suffered was sinful. Is that any reason for comparing the persecution suffered by Hagar to that with which the wicked Saul afflicted holy David? Obviously, there is a very great difference, not because David suffered, but because he suffered for justice’s sake. And the Lord himself was crucified among thieves. But, though they were alike in suffering, they were different in the reason for suffering. Therefore, in the psalm we must understand the voice of the true martyr wishing to be distinguished from false martyrs: “Judge me, O God, and distinguish my cause from the nation that is not holy.” He does not say “distinguish my punishment” but “distinguish my cause.” For the punishment of the wicked can be the same, but the cause of the martyrs is not the same, and their cry is, “They have persecuted me unjustly; help me.” The psalmist thinks himself worthy of being justly helped because they persecuted unjustly, for, if they persecuted justly, he would not be worthy of help but of chastisement.
