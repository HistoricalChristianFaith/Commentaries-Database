Just as a man would not have wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety and fear of God unless, according to the prophet’s words, he had received “the spirit of wisdom and of understanding, of counsel and of fortitude, of knowledge and of godliness, and of fear of God,” and just as he would not have power and love and sobriety, except by receiving the Spirit of whom the apostle speaks, “We have not received the spirit of fear but of power and love and sobriety,” so also he would not have faith unless he received the spirit of faith.
