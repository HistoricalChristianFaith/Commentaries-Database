Why, you have it here in so many words: Look, these are sinners, and prospering always; they have become rich. “Is it to no purpose that I set my heart right or washed my hands among the innocent and was scourged every day?” I worship God; they blaspheme God. For them good fortune, for me misfortune. Where is the justice of it? That is why feet were shaken, that is why steps were almost pulled from under, that is why destruction was looming. Yes, just notice please what a dangerous position he had got into. He adds, “And I said, How did God know? Can there be knowledge in the most High?” Notice what a dangerous position he has got into by looking for earthly good fortune from God as though it were of great value.
