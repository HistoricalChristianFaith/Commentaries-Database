"I said in my trance, All men are liars" [Psalm 116:11]. By trance he means fear, which when persecutors threaten, and when the sufferings of torture or death impend, human weakness suffers. For this we understand, because in this Psalm the voice of Martyrs is heard. For trance is used in another sense also, when the mind is not beside itself by fear, but is possessed by some inspiration of revelation. "But I said in my haste, All men are liars." In consternation he has had regard to his infirmity, and has seen that he ought not to presume on himself; for as far as pertains to the man himself, he is a liar, but by the grace of God he is made true; lest yielding to the pressure of his enemies he might not speak what he had believed, but might deny it; even as it happened to Peter, since he had trusted in himself, and was to be taught that we ought not to trust in man. And if every one ought not to trust in man, surely not in himself; because he is a man. Rightly therefore in his fear did he perceive that every man was a liar; since they also whom no fear robs of their presence of mind, so that they never lie by yielding to the persecutors, are such by the gifts of God, not by their own strength....

Such an individual, then, guards against lying just as against sinning. Sometimes, in fact, the word lie is used for the word sin; whence the saying "Everyone is a liar." So it was said as the equivalent of "Everyone is a sinner." Similarly: "if through my lie the truth of God has abounded." Thus, when he lies as people do, he sins as people do and will be bound by the judgment that says "Everyone is a liar," and "if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us." But when nothing false proceeds from his mouth, it will be in consequence of that grace about which it has been said, "Whoever is born of God does not commit sin." For if this birth alone were in us, no one would sin; when it alone will be in us, no one will sin. But we now are still failing, because we are born corruptible, although, if we walk well there where we have been reborn, day by day our inner person is being renewed. When this corruptible body also puts on incorruption, life will absorb all, and no sting of death will remain. But the sting of death is sin.
