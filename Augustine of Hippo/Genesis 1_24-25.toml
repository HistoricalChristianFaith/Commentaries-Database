We might infer that because the writer says three times “according to their kinds,” our attention is called to three classes. First quadrupeds and creeping things according to their kinds, and here I believe he has indicated what quadrupeds he means, namely, those that belong to the class of creeping things, such as lizards, amphibians, and the like. Thus, in repeating the enumeration of animals, the author did not repeat the name quadrupeds apparently because he included them in the term “creeping things.” With this in view, he did not say simply “creeping things” but rather “all creeping things of earth.” “Of earth” is added because there are also creeping things in the waters, and “all” is added to include those also that move on four feet, the class specifically intended above by the term quadruped. Next, the beasts are another class, indicated also by the expression “according to their kinds,” and they are all those animals, excluding reptiles, that prowl about with fearsome mouths and claws. Finally, the herds make up a third class designated by the phrase “according to their kinds.” These have no such fierce and violent ways as wild beasts, although some may attack with their horns.
