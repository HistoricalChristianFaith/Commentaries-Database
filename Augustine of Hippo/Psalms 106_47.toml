You see, while Jesus did not go to the nations himself, he sent the disciples. That was the fulfillment of what the prophet said, “A people I never knew has served me.” Notice how profound, how clear, how explicit a prophecy this is: “A people I never knew”—that means one I had not presented myself to in person—“has served me.” How? It goes on, “The moment it heard, it obeyed me”; that is, it was not by seeing but by hearing that they came to believe. And it was to call and gather together the nations that the apostle Paul was sent, so fulfilling what we have just been singing, “Gather us from the nations, that we may confess to your name and glory in your praise.” That man Tiny, made into the Greatest, not by his own efforts but by the one he used to persecute, was sent to the nations, a sheep stealer turned shepherd, a wolf turned sheep. That least of the apostles was sent to the nations and labored much among the Gentiles, and it was by means of him that the Gentiles came to believe. His letters are the proof of this.
