There is so little difference between me [i.e., the Son] and him who sent me [i.e., the Father] that he that sees me sees him. Certainly, Christ the Lord sent his apostles … yet none of them dared to say, “He who believes in me.” … We believe an apostle, but we do not believe in an apostle, for it is not an apostle who justifies the ungodly.… An apostle might say, “He who receives me receives him who sent me,” or “He who hears me hears him who sent me,” for the Lord tells them so himself. … For the master is honored in the servant and the father in the son. But then the father is as it were in the son, and the master as it were in the servant. But the Only Begotten could rightly say, “Believe on God, and believe on me,” as what he also says here, “He who believes in me does not believe in me but on him that sent me.” Here he does not deflect the believer’s faith from himself but gives him a higher object than the form of a servant for that faith.
