"The ungodly shall see it, and he shall be angered" [Psalm 112:10]: this is that late and fruitless repentance. For with whom rather than himself is he "angered," when he shall say, "Our pride, what has it profited us? The boastfulness of our riches, what has it given us? [Wisdom 5:8] " seeing the horn of him exalted with honour, who "dispersed abroad, and gave to the poor." "He shall gnash with his teeth, and consume away:" for "there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth." For he will no more bring forth leaves and bloom, as would happen if he had repented in season: but he will then repent, when "the desire of the ungodly shall perish," no consolation succeeding. "The desire of the ungodly shall perish," when "all things shall pass away like a shadow," [Wisdom 5:8-9] when the flower shall fall down on the withering of the grass. "But the word of the Lord that endures for ever," [Isaiah 40:8] as it is mocked by the vanity of the falsely happy, so will laugh at the perdition of the same when truly miserable.

Dearly beloved, whether the Jews receive these divine testimonies with joy or with indignation, nevertheless, when we can, let us proclaim them with great love for the Jews. Let us not proudly glory against the broken branches; let us rather reflect by whose grace it is, and by much mercy, and on what root, we have been ingrafted. Then, not savoring of pride but with a deep sense of humility, not insulting with presumption but rejoicing with trembling, let us say, “Come and let us walk in the light of the Lord,” because his “name is great among the Gentiles.” If they hear him and obey him, they will be among them to whom Scripture says, “Come to him and be enlightened, and your faces shall not be confounded.” If, however, they hear and do not obey, if they see and are jealous, they are among them of whom the psalm says, “The wicked shall see and shall be angry, he shall gnash with his teeth and pine away.” “But I,” the church says to Christ, “as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God for ever, yea forever and ever.”
