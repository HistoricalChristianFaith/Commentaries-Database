"And He shall live, and there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia" [Psalm 72:15]. There would not have been said, "and He shall live" (for of whom could not this be said, though living for ever so brief a space of time on this earth?) unless that life were being recommended to our notice, wherein He "dies no more, and death over Him shall have no more dominion." [Romans 6:9] And thus, "and He shall live," that was despised in death: for, as another Prophet says, "there shall be taken away from the earth the life of Him." [Isaiah 53:8] But what is, "and there shall be given to Him of the gold of Arabia"? For the fact that from thence even the former Salomon received gold, in this Psalm has been in a figure transferred unto another true Salomon, that is, the true Peace-maker. For the former did not have dominion "from the river even unto the ends of the round world."  Thus then has been prophesied, that even the wise men of this world in Christ would believe. But by Arabia we understand the Gentiles; by gold wisdom which does as much excel among all doctrines as gold among metals. Whence has been written, "Receive ye prudence as silver,  and wisdom as proved gold." [Proverbs 8:10] "And they shall pray concerning Himself always." That which the Greek has, περὶ αὐτοῦ, some have interpreted by "concerning Himself," some "for Himself," or "for Him." But what is, "concerning Himself," except perchance that for which we pray, saying, "Your kingdom come"? [Matthew 6:10] For Christ's coming shall make present to believers the kingdom of God. But how to understand "for Him" is difficult; except that when prayer is made for the Church, for Himself prayer is made, because she is His Body. For concerning Christ and the Church has been sent before a great Sacrament, [Ephesians 5:32] "there shall be two in one flesh." But now that which follows, "all the day long," that is, in all time, "they shall bless Him," is sufficiently evident.
