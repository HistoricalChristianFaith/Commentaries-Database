"Bend down Your ear unto Me" [Psalm 31:2]. Hear Me in My humiliation, near at hand unto Me. "Make haste to deliver Me." Defer not to the end of the world, as with all who believe in Me, My separation from sinners. "Be unto Me a God who protects Me." Be unto Me God, and Protector. "And a house of refuge, that You may save Me." And as a house, wherein taking refuge I may be saved.
