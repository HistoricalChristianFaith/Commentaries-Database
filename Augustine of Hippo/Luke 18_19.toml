The Father is good. The Son is good. The Holy Spirit is good. Still, there are not three goods but one good. He said, "No one is good except the one God." The Lord Jesus Christ did not answer. He feared that the one who in addressing a man had said "good master" might understand him as only a man. He therefore did not say, "No one is good except the Father alone." He rather said, "No one is good except the one God."
