De Cons. Ev., iii, 23: “They departed forth of the tomb,” that is, from that spot of the garden which was before the tomb hewn in the rock.
We conclude that they had speech of Angels twice at the sepulchre; when they saw one Angel, of whom Matthew and Mark speak; and again when they saw two Angels, as Luke and John relate. And twice in like manner of the Lord; once at that time when Mary supposed Him to be “the gardener,” and now again when He met them in the way to confirm them by repetition, and to restore them from their faintness.
de Cons. Ev., iii, ult: That the Lord, both by His own mouth, and by the Angel, directs them to seek for Him, not in that place in which He was to show Himself first, but in Galilee, makes every believer anxious to understand in what mystery it is spoken. Galilee is interpreted ‘transmigration,’ or ‘revelation.’
