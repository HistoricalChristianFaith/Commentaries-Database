"All nations compassed me round about, but in the Name of the Lord have I taken vengeance on them" [Psalm 118:10]. "They kept me in on every side, they kept me in, I say, on every side; but in the Name of the Lord have I taken vengeance on them" [Psalm 118:11]. He signifies the toils and the victory of the Church; but, as if the question were asked how she could have overcome so great evils, he looks  back to the example, and declares what she had first suffered in her Head, by adding what follows, "They kept me in on every side:" and the words, "All nations," are with reason not repeated here, because this was the act of the Jews alone. There that very religious nation (which is the body of Christ, and in behalf of which was done all that was done in mortal form with immortal power, by that inward divinity, through the outward flesh), suffered from persecutors, of whose race that flesh was assumed and hung upon the cross.
