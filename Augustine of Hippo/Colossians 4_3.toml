Schisms arise when men say, we are righteous; when they say, we sanctify the unclean, we justify the wicked, we ask, we obtain. But what did John say? “If any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.” You will say, But may not holy men ask on our behalf? May not bishops and rulers ask on behalf of the people? Look at the Scripture, and you will find rulers commending themselves to the people’s prayers. The apostle says to his people, “Praying also for us.” The apostle prays for the people and the people for the apostle. We pray for you, my brothers, but you should also pray for us. Let all the members pray for one another, and let the Head intercede for all. .
