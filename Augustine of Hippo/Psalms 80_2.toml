What is, "Thou that feedest Israel, hearken,  You that conducts Joseph like sheep"? [Psalm 78:1]. He is being invoked to come, He is being expected until He come, He is being yearned for until He come. Therefore may He find "men guiding:" "You  that conducts," he says, "Joseph like sheep:" Joseph himself like sheep. Joseph himself are the sheep, and Joseph himself is a sheep. Observe Joseph; for although even the interpretation of his name does aid us much, for it signifies increase; and He came indeed in order that the grain given to death  might arise manifold; [John 12:24] that is, that the people of God might be increased...."You  that sits    upon the Cherubin." Cherubin is the seat of the glory of God, and is interpreted the fullness of knowledge. There God sits in the fullness of knowledge. Though we understand the Cherubin to be the exalted powers and virtues of the heavens: yet, if you will, you will be Cherubin.  For if Cherubin is the seat of God, hear what says the Scripture: "The soul of a just man is the seat of wisdom." How, you say, shall I be the fullness of knowledge? Who shall fulfil this? You have the means of fulfilling it: "The fullness of the Law is love." [Romans 13:10] Do not run after many things, and strain yourself. The amplitude of the branches does terrify you: hold by the root, and of the greatness of the tree think not. Be there in you love, and the fullness of knowledge must needs follow. For what does he not know that knows love? Inasmuch as it has been said, "God is love." [1 John 4:8] "Appear." For we went astray because You did not appear. "Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasse" [Psalm 80:2]. Appear, I say, before the nation of the Jews, before the people of Israel. For there is Ephraim, there Manasses, there Benjamin. But to the interpretation let us look: Ephraim is fruit-bearing, Benjamin son of right hand, Manasses one forgetful. Appear Thou then before one made fruitful, before a son of the right hand: appear Thou before one forgetful, in order that he may be no longer forgetful, but You may come into his mind that hast delivered him....For weak You were when it was being said, "If Son of God He is, let Him come down from the Cross." [Matthew 27:40] You were seeming to have no power: the persecutor had power over You: and You showed this aforetime, for Jacob too himself prevailed in wrestling, a man with an angel. Would he at any time, except the angel had been willing? And man prevailed, and the angel was conquered: and victorious man holds the angel, and says, "I will not let you go, except you shall have blessed me." [Genesis 32:26] A great sacrament! He both stands conquered, and blesses the conqueror. Conquered, because he willed it; in flesh weak, in majesty strong....Having been crucified of weakness, rise      in power: [2 Corinthians 13:4] "Stir up Your power, and come Thou, to save us."
