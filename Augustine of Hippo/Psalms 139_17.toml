And what follows? "But to me Your friends are made very honourable, O God" [Psalm 139:17]; those very ones, who "wandered in the day, and none was in them," became Your friends, and were made very honourable to me. That bone was made in them in secret after the resurrection of the Lord, and they suffered for His Name, at whose death they had been amazed. "Mightily strengthened were their chieftainships." They became Apostles, they became leaders of the Church, they became rams leading their flocks, "mightily strengthened."
