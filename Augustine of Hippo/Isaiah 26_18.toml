Even now let us rejoice somehow or other in this hope derived from the promises of one most faithful, until that richest of all possible joys arises, when “we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is,” and our joy nobody shall take from us. Of this hope, you see, we have also received already the acceptable and freely given pledge that is the Holy Spirit, who produces in our hearts the unutterable groanings of holy desire. “For we have conceived,” as Isaiah says, “and have brought forth the spirit of salvation.” And, “when a woman is in labor,” the Lord says, “she has sorrow, because her day has come; but when she has brought forth, there is great joy, because a human being has been born into the world.” This will be the joy that nobody will take away from us; on the day when we are brought forth into the eternal light from this conception of faith. So meanwhile let us fast and pray, while it is still the day of bringing forth.
