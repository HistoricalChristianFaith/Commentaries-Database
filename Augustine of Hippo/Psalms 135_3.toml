What reason shall I give why you should praise Him? "Because the Lord is good" [Psalm 135:3]. Briefly in one word is here explained the praise of the Lord our God. "The Lord is good;" good, not in the same manner as the things which He here made are good. For God made all things very good; [GenesisÂ 1:31] not only good, but also very good. He made the sky and earth, and all things which are in them good, and He made them very good. If He made all these things good, of what sort is He who made them?...
