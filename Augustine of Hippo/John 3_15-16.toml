Unless the Father, you see, had handed over life, we would not have had life. And unless life itself had died, death would not have been slain. It is the Lord Christ himself, of course, that is life, about whom John the Evangelist says, “This is the true God and eternal life.” It was he himself that through the prophet had also threatened death with death, saying, “I will be your death, O death; I will be your sting.” This was as though he had said, “I will slay you by dying. I will swallow you up. I will take all your power away from you. I will rescue the captives you have held. You wanted to hold me, though innocent. It is right that you should lose those you had the power to hold.”
