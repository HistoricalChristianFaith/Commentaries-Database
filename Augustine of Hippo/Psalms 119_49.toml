"O remember Your word unto Your servant, wherein You have given me hope" [Psalm 119:49]. Is forgetfulness incident to God, as it is to man? Why then is it said unto Him, "O remember"? Although in other passages of holy Scripture this very word is used, as, "Why have You forgotten me?"  and, "Wherefore forgettest Thou our misery?". ..These expressions are borrowed from moral discourses on human affections; although God does these things according to a fixed dispensation, with no failing memory, nor with an understanding obscured, nor with a will changed. When therefore it is said unto Him, "O remember," the desire of him who prays is displayed, because he asks for what was promised; God is not admonished, as if the promise had escaped from His mind. "O remember," he says, "Your word unto Your servant:" that is, fulfil Your promise to Your servant. "Wherein You have given me hope:" that is, in Your Word, since You have promised, You have caused me to hope.
