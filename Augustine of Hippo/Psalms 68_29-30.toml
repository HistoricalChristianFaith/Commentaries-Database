"From Your Temple in Jerusalem, to You kings shall offer presents" [Psalm 68:29]. Jerusalem, which is our free mother, [Galatians 4:26] because the same also is Your holy Temple: from that Temple then, "to You kings shall offer presents." Whatever kings be understood, whether kings of the earth, or whether those whom "He that is above the heavens distinguishes over the dove silvered;" "to You kings shall offer presents." And what presents are so acceptable  as the sacrifices of praise? But there is a noise against this praise, from men bearing the name of Christian, and having diverse opinions. Be there done that which follows, "Rebuke  the beasts of the cane"  [Psalm 68:30]. For both beasts they are, since by not understanding they do hurt: and beasts of the cane they are, since the sense of the Scriptures they wrest according to their own misapprehension. For in the cane the Scriptures are as reasonably perceived, as language in tongue, according to the mode of expression whereby the Hebrew or the Greek or the Latin tongue is spoken of, or the like; that is to say, by the efficient cause the thing which is being effected is implied. Now it is usual in the Latin language for writing to be called style, because with the stilus it is done: so then cane also, because with a cane it is done. The Apostle Peter says, that "men unlearned and unstable do wrest the Scriptures to their own proper destruction:" [2 Peter 3:16] these are the beasts of the cane, whereof here is said, "Rebuke  the beasts of the cane."
