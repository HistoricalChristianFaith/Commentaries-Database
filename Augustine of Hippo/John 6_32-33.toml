Our Lord Jesus Christ sets Himself above Moses: for Moses durst not say of himself that he gave bread from heaven; but that God gave it. Ye propose to me Moses: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven." Because Moses gave not, but the Lord gave, why do you prefer Moses to me? "But my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven." Well, is this bread that the Father giveth, Moses, or something given by Moses? "For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world." The bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven. This bread the manna signified, this bread the altar of God signifies.

(Tr. xxv. 13.) As if He said, That manna was the type of this food, of which I just now spoke; and which all my miracles refer to. You like my miracles, you despise what is signified by them. This bread which God gives, and which this manna represented, is the Lord Jesus Christ, as we read next, For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.
