Note how what you have heard in the Gospel as something to come has by now already happened. Jesus commends the centurion’s faith, whose flesh was alien but whose spirit was of the household of faith. It was to him that he said, “Many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness.” What sons of what kingdom? He is speaking of the people of the covenant, who received the law. To them the prophets were sent. To them was given the temple and the priesthood. They had celebrated the anticipations of things to come. Yet those things of which they would celebrate in figures they did not acknowledge in actual presence. This is why they shall “be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth.” Odd, isn’t it? That they would be sent away, while the Christians would be called from the east and the west to the heavenly banquet to sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, whose bread is righteousness and whose cup is wisdom.
