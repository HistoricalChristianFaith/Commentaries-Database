What is this, “If you do not believe that I am”? “I am” what? There is nothing added. And because he added nothing … there is much implied in his only saying “I am,” for God had used the same words with Moses, “I am who am.” Who can adequately express what that I AM means? … For all excellence, whatever kind it is, if it is changeable, it does not truly exist. There is no true existence wherever nonexistence also has a place. For whatever can be changed, so far as it is changed, it is not what it was: if it is no longer what it was, a kind of death has therein taken place. Something that was there has been eliminated and exists no more.… For in all actions and movements of ours, yes, in every activity of the creature, I find two indications of time, the past and the future. I seek for the present, but nothing stands still. What I have said is no longer present. What I am going to say is not yet come. What I have done is no longer present. What I am going to do is not yet come. The life I have lived is no longer present. The life I have still to live is not yet come. Past and future I find in every creature-movement. I do not find either past or future in what is abiding. There I only find the unchangeable present that finds no place in the creature. Analyze the idea of mutability, and you will find was and will be: contemplate God, and you will find the is where was and will be cannot exist.… And so, by these words, “If you do not believe that I am,” I think our Lord meant nothing else than this, “If you do not believe that I am” God, “you shall die in your sins.” Well, God be thanked that he said, “If you do not believe” and did not say: If you do not comprehend. For who can comprehend this?
