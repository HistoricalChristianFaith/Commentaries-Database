"Lord, what is man, that You have become known unto him?" [Psalm 144:3]. All is included in "that You have become known unto him." "Or the son of man, that Thou valuest him?" Thou valuest him, that is, You make him of such importance, You count him of such price, You know under what Thou placest him, over what Thou placest him. For valuing is considering the price of a thing. How greatly did He value man, who for him shed the blood of His only-begotten Son! For God values not man in the same way as one man values another: he, when he finds a slave for sale, gives a higher price for a horse than for a man. Consider how greatly He valued you, that you may be able to say, "If God be for us, who can be against us?" And how greatly did He value you, "who spared not His own Son"? "How shall He not also with Him freely give us all things?" [Romans 8:31-32] He who gives this food to the combatant, what keeps He in store for the conqueror?...
