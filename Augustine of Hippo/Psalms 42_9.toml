"I will say unto God, You are my lifter up. Why have You forgotten me?" [Psalm 42:9]. For I am suffering here, even as if You had forgotten me. But You are trying me, and I know that Thou dost but put off, not take utterly from me, what You have promised me. But yet, "Why have You forgotten me?" So cried our Head also, as if speaking in our name. "My God, my God, why have You forsaken me?"  I will say unto God, "You are my lifter up; why have You forgotten me?"
