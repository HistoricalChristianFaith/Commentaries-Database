“Now you are clean through the word that I have spoken to you.” Why doesn’t he say, You are clean through the baptism with which you have been washed, rather than “through the word that I have spoken to you,” except for the fact that in the water also it is the word that cleanses? Take away the word, and the water is neither more nor less than water. The word is added to the element, and there results the sacrament, as if it itself is also a kind of visible word. For he had said also the same thing when washing the disciples’ feet: “He who is washed needs not to wash, except for his feet, but is altogether clean.” And how does water have so great an efficacy, as in touching the body to cleanse the soul, if not by the operation of the word—and that not because it is uttered but because it is believed? For even in the word itself, the passing sound is one thing, the abiding efficacy another. … For Christ, who is the vine with us, and the husbandman with the Father, “loved the church and gave himself for it.” But read the apostle and see what he adds: “That he might sanctify it, cleansing it with the washing of water by the word.” The cleansing, therefore, would on no account be attributed to the fleeting and perishable element were it not for what is added: “by the word.” This word of faith possesses such power in the church of God that through the medium of him who in faith presents and blesses and sprinkles it, he cleanses even the tiny infant, although itself unable as yet with the heart to believe unto righteousness and to make confession with the mouth unto salvation. All this is done by means of the word about which the Lord says, Now you are clean through the word that I have spoken to you.”
