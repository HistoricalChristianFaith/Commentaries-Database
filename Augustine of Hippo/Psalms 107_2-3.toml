"Let them say who are redeemed of the Lord, whom He has redeemed from the hand of their enemies" [Psalm 107:2]. Redeemed indeed it seems was also the people of Israel from the land of Egypt, from the hand of slavery, from fruitless labours, from miry works; yet let us see whether those who say these things, are they who were freed by the Lord from Egypt. It is not so. But who are they? "Those whom He redeemed." Still one might take it also of them, as redeemed from the hand of their enemies, that is, of the Egyptians. Let them be expressed exactly who they are, for whom this Psalm would be sung. "He gathered them from the lands;" these might still be the lands of Egypt, for there are many lands even in one province. Let him speak openly. "From the east and the west, from the north and the sea" [Psalm 107:3]. Now then we understand these redeemed, in the whole circle of the earth. This people of God, freed from a great and broad Egypt, is led, as through the Red Sea, [Exodus 14:22] that in Baptism it may make an end of its enemies. For by the sacrament as it were of the Red Sea, that is by Baptism consecrated with the Blood of Christ, the pursuing Egyptians, the sins, are washed away...."But all these things happened to them in a figure, and were written for our admonition, on whom the ends of the ages have come."

And that is why Jesus fasted when he was tempted, when he was still in need of food before his death. Although he ate and drank when he was glorified, he was not in need of food after his resurrection. On the first occasion, you see, he was demonstrating in himself our pain. On the second he was demonstrating in us his consolation. Both instances occurred within a period of forty days. I mean, he fasted for forty days, when he was being tempted in the desert, as it is written in the Gospel, before his death in the flesh; and again he was with the disciples for forty days, as Peter puts it in the Acts of the Apostles, going out and coming in, eating and drinking4 after his resurrection in the flesh.This number forty seems to signify the course of this age in those who are being called to grace, through the one who did “not come to undo the law but to fulfill it.” There are, after all, ten commandments of the law, now spread by the grace of Christ throughout the world (and the world is four-cornered, and ten multiplied by four makes forty); since “those who have been redeemed by the Lord, from the regions he has gathered them together, from east and west and north and the sea.” And so by fasting for forty days before his death in the flesh, it is as though he was crying out, “Hold yourselves in check from the desires of this world”; while by eating and drinking for forty days after his resurrection in the flesh, it is as though he was crying out, “Behold, I am with you until the end of the world.”
