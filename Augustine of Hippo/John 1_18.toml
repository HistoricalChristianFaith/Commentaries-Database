(de Trin. xiii. c. 24. [xix.]) Or, we may refer grace to knowledge, truth to wisdom. Amongst the events of time the highest grace is the uniting of man to God in One Person; in the eternal world the highest truth pertains to God the Word.

(Ep. to Paulina [Ep. 147. al. 112. c. 5]) What is that then which Jacob said, I have seen God face to face; (Gen. 32.) and that which is written of Moses, he talked with God face to face; (Ex. 33) and that which the prophet Isaiah saith of himself, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne? (Isa. 6.)

(Ep. to Paulina sparsim.) Now it is said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; (Matt. 5:8) and again, When He shall appear, we shall be like unto Him, for we shall see Him as He is. (1 John 3:2) What is the meaning then of the words here: No man hath seen God at any time? The reply is easy: those passages speak of God, as to be seen, not as already seen. They shall see God, it is said, not, they have seen Him: nor is it, we have seen Him, but, we shall see Him as He is. For, No man hath seen God at any time, neither in this life, nor yet in the Angelic, as He is; in the same way in which sensible things are perceived by the bodily vision.

(xii. on Gen. ad litteram c. 27) For unless any in some sense die to this life, either by leaving the body altogether, or by being so withdrawn and alienated from carnal perceptions, that he may well not know, as the Apostle says, whether he be in the body or out of the body, (2 Cor. 12:2) he cannot be carried away, and borne aloft to that vision.

(to Paul. c. iv.) If we say, that the text, No oned hath seen God at any time, (1 Tim. 6:16) applies only to men; so that, as the Apostle more plainly interprets it, Whom no man hath seen nor can see, no one is to be understood here to mean, no one of men: the question may be solved in a way not to contradict what our Lord says, Their Angels do always behold the face of My Father; (Mat. 18:10) so that we must believe that Angels see, what no one, i. e. of men, hath ever seen.

(to Paulina c. 7) Which indeed is true so far, that no bodily or even mental vision of man hath ever embraced the fulness of God; for it is one thing to see, another to embrace the whole of what thou seest. A thing is seen, if only the sight of it be caught; but we only see a thing fully, when we have no part of it unseen, when we see round its extreme limits.

(in Joan. Tr. iii. c. 17) In the bosom of the Father, i. e. in the secret Presence1 of the Father: for God hath not the folde on the bosom, as we have; nor must be imagined to sit, as we do; nor is He bound with a girdle, so as to have a fold: but from the fact of our bosom being placed innermost, the secret Presence of the Father is called the bosom of the Father. He then who, in the secret Presence of the Father, knew the Father, the same hath declared what He saw.

(Tr. iii. c. 18) Yet have there been men, who, deceived by the vanity of their hearts, maintained that the Father is invisible, the Son visible. Now if they call the Son visible, with respect to His connection with the flesh, we object not; it is the Catholic doctrine. But it is madness in them to say He was so before His incarnation; i. e. if it be true that Christ is the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God. The Wisdom of God cannot be seen by the eye. If the human word cannot be seen by the eye, how can the Word of God?

In case anyone might say, “And did not grace and truth come through Moses who saw God?” immediately he adds, “No one has seen God at any time.” And how did God become known to Moses? He became known because the Lord revealed himself to his servant. What Lord? It was the same Christ who sent the law beforehand by his servant so that he might himself come with grace and truth.… And he who knew the Father, being in the secret place of the Father, declared him. “For no one has seen God at any time.” He then came and narrated whatever he saw. What did Moses see? Moses saw a cloud, an angel, a fire. All that is of the creature bore the type of its Lord, but they did not manifest the presence of the Lord himself. For you have it plainly stated in the law, “And Moses spoke with the Lord face to face, as a friend with his friend.” … An angel then spoke with Moses, my brothers, bearing the type of the Lord; and all those things that were done by the angel promised that future grace and truth. Those who examine the law know this well.…But know also this, that all those things that were seen in bodily form were not that substance of God. For we saw those things with the eyes of the flesh—how is the substance of God seen? Interrogate the Gospel: “Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.” There have been those who, deceived by the vanity of their hearts, have said: The Father is invisible, but the Son is visible. What do they mean by visible? If they mean on account of his flesh, because he took flesh, the matter is clear. For of those who saw the flesh of Christ, some believed, some crucified. And those who believed doubted when he was crucified. Unless they had touched the flesh after the resurrection, their faith would not have even been recalled. If, then, the Son was visible because of his flesh, we grant this, and it is the catholic faith. But if before he took flesh, that is, if before he became incarnate they say they saw the Son, they are greatly deluded and making a horrible mistake. For those visible and bodily appearances took place through the creature, in which a type might be exhibited. But there is no way that the substance itself was shown and made known. Listen, beloved, to this easy proof. The wisdom of God cannot be beheld by the eyes. Brothers, if Christ is the wisdom of God and the power of God, if Christ is the Word of God, and if the word of man [humankind] is not seen with the eyes, can the Word of God be seen in this way?

He is Son by nature, we by grace; he is the “only Son,” we are many, because he is born, we are adopted. So while God had a one and only Son, “he did not spare,” as the apostle says, “his very own one and only Son, but gave him up for us all.” What greater medicine could the human race demand or hope for, than that the only Son should be sent, not to live with us, but to die?

We believe in him that he was born of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary. Each birth of his, you see, must be considered wonderful, both that of his divinity and that of his humanity. The first is from the Father without mother, the second from mother without father; the first apart from all time, the second at “the acceptable time”; the first eternal, the second at the right moment; the first without a body “in the bosom of the Father,” the second with a body, which did not violate the virginity of his mother; the first without either sex, the second without a man’s embrace.
