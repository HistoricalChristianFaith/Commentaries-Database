(Tr. xxv. in Joan) He does not say, That ye believe Him, but, that ye believe on Him. For the devils believed Him, and did not believe on Him; and we believe Paul, but do not believe on Paul. To believe on Him is believing to love, believing to honour Him, believing to go unto Him, and be made members incorporate of His Body. The faith, which God requires of us, is that which worketh by love. Faith indeed is distinguished from works by the Apostle, who says, That man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. (Rom. 3:28) But the works indeed which appear good, without faith in Christ, are not really so, not being referred to that end, which makes them good. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth (Rom. 10:4). And therefore our Lord would not separate faith from works, but said that faith itself was the doing the work of God; He saith not, This is your work, but, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him: in order that he that glorieth might glory in the Lord.

(xxv. 12) To eat then that meat which endureth unto everlasting life, is to believe on Him. Why dost thou make ready thy tooth and thy belly? Only believe, and thou hast eaten already. As He called on them to believe, they still asked for miracles whereby to believe; They said therefore unto Him, What sign shewest Thou then, that we may see and believe Thee? What dost Thou work?

(Tr. xxv. s. 12) Or thus; Our Lord sets Himself above Moses, who did not dare to say that He gave the meat which perisheth not. The multitude therefore remembering what Moses had done, and wishing for some greater miracle, say, as it were, Thou promisest the meat which perisheth not, and doest not works equal to those Moses did. He gave us not barley loaves, but manna from heaven.

(Tr. xxv. 13.) As if He said, That manna was the type of this food, of which I just now spoke; and which all my miracles refer to. You like my miracles, you despise what is signified by them. This bread which God gives, and which this manna represented, is the Lord Jesus Christ, as we read next, For the bread of God is He which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world.

(Tr. xxv. 13) As the woman of Samaria, when our Lord told her, Whosoever drinketh of this water shall never thirst, thought He meant natural water, and said, Sir, give me this water, that she might never be in want of it again: in the same way these say, Give us this bread, which refreshes, supports, and fails not.

Therefore they said to Him, "What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?" For He had said to them, "Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto everlasting life." "What shall we do?" they say; by observing what, shall we be able to fulfil this precept? "Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent." This is then to eat the meat, not that which perisheth, but that which endureth unto eternal life. To what purpose dost thou make ready teeth and stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten already.

Faith is indeed distinguished from works, even as the apostle says that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law: and there are works which seem good, without faith in Christ, but they are not really good, because they are not referred to that end which makes works good: "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." And therefore the Lord did not wish to distinguish faith from work, but declared faith itself to be work, for that is the very faith which worketh by love. And He did not say, This is your work, but, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent:" that "he that glorieth may glory in the Lord."

Because, then, He invited them to faith, they still on their part desired to see signs that they might believe. They did not count Him worthy of belief, to whom they themselves bore the witness that He had fed so many thousands with five loaves. Already they had forgotten: they sought meat that perisheth. They said therefore to Him, "What sign showest Thou, that we may see and believe Thee? What dost Thou work? Our fathers did eat manna in the desert, as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat." What is it that I promise? I promise the bread from heaven.

Our Lord Jesus Christ sets Himself above Moses: for Moses durst not say of himself that he gave bread from heaven; but that God gave it. Ye propose to me Moses: "Verily, verily, I say unto you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven." Because Moses gave not, but the Lord gave, why do you prefer Moses to me? "But my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven." Well, is this bread that the Father giveth, Moses, or something given by Moses? "For the bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven, and giveth life unto the world." The bread of God is that which cometh down from heaven. This bread the manna signified, this bread the altar of God signifies.
