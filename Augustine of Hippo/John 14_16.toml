But when Jesus says, “I will ask the Father, and he shall give you another Paraclete,” he intimates that he himself is also a Paraclete. For Paraclete is in Latin called advocatus [advocate]. And it is said of Christ, “We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.”

The apostle says that the Comforter—the title given to the third person of the Trinity—is God. In his epistle to the Corinthians he says, “God, who comforts those who are cast down, comforts us.” The Holy Spirit who comforts those who are cast down is therefore God.… Or if they rather take these words of the apostle as applying to the Father or the Son, let them no longer, then, separate the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son or make the Holy Spirit appear less than the Son, when it is his peculiar [office] to offer comfort.
