"Be not ye like horse or mule, which have no understanding:" and therefore would govern themselves. But says the Prophet, "Hold in their jaws with bit and bridle." Do Thou then, O God, unto them "that will not come near You" [Psalm 32:9], what man does to horse and mule, that by scourges Thou make them to bear Your rule.

To have a soul and not to have an understanding, that is, not to use it or to live according to it, is a beastâ€™s life. For there is in us something bestial by which we live in the flesh, but it must be ruled by the understanding. For the understanding rules from above the impulses of the soul when it moves itself according to the flesh and desires to pour itself out immoderately into carnal delights.
