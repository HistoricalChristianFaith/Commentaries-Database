Let no one think bad of the woman because she called the gardener “sir” (domine) and Jesus “Master” (magistrum).… In the first instance she was honoring a person from whom she was asking a favor. In the second she was recalling the teacher from whom she was learning to distingush the divine from the human. She called one lord (sir) even when she was not his servant so that through him she could come to the Lord whose [servant] she was. She used the word lord in one sense when she said “They have taken away my Lord,” and in anoher sense when she said, “Sir [i.e., lord], if you have carried him away.”
