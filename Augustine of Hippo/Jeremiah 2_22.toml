All those who refuse Christ for another become strangers. And how are they made strangers? Because even that vine, though planted by him, when it had become sour, what did it hear? “Wherefore you have been turned into sourness, O alien vine?” - "Expositions on the Psalms 56.3"

For it is by similitude, and not by any personal propriety, that he is thus called a vine. For when he says, “I am the true vine,” it is to distinguish himself, doubtless, from that vine to which the words are addressed: “How are you turned into sourness, as a strange vine?” For how could that be a true vine that was expected to bring forth grapes and brought forth thorns? - "Tractates on the Gospel of John 80.1"
