Let us direct the mind’s gaze and, with the Lord’s help, let us search out God. The word of the divine canticle is “Seek God and your soul will live.” Let us seek him who is to be found, let us seek him who has been found. He has been hidden so that he may be sought for and found; he is immeasurable so that, even though he has been found, he may be sought for. For this reason it is said elsewhere, “Seek his face always.” For he fills the seeker as far as he has capacity, and he makes the finder more capacious, that he may seek again to be filled when he has begun to increase his capacity.
