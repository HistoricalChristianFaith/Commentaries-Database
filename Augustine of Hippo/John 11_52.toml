“That Jesus should die for the nation. And not for the nation only but that also he should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad” were words added by the Evangelist. Caiaphas had prophesied only about the Jewish nation in which there were sheep of whom our Lord himself had said, “I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” But the Evangelist knew that there were other sheep who were not of this fold but who also had to be brought so that there would be one fold and one shepherd. But he says this in the way of predestination since those who were still unbelieving were neither yet sheep nor children of God.
