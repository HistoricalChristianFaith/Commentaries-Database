(Tr. xxv. in Joan) He does not say, That ye believe Him, but, that ye believe on Him. For the devils believed Him, and did not believe on Him; and we believe Paul, but do not believe on Paul. To believe on Him is believing to love, believing to honour Him, believing to go unto Him, and be made members incorporate of His Body. The faith, which God requires of us, is that which worketh by love. Faith indeed is distinguished from works by the Apostle, who says, That man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. (Rom. 3:28) But the works indeed which appear good, without faith in Christ, are not really so, not being referred to that end, which makes them good. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth (Rom. 10:4). And therefore our Lord would not separate faith from works, but said that faith itself was the doing the work of God; He saith not, This is your work, but, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him: in order that he that glorieth might glory in the Lord.

"Jesus answered and said unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent." This is then to eat the meat, not that which perisheth, but that which endureth unto eternal life. To what purpose dost thou make ready teeth and stomach? Believe, and thou hast eaten already.

Faith is indeed distinguished from works, even as the apostle says that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law: and there are works which seem good, without faith in Christ, but they are not really good, because they are not referred to that end which makes works good: "For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believeth." And therefore the Lord did not wish to distinguish faith from work, but declared faith itself to be work, for that is the very faith which worketh by love. And He did not say, This is your work, but, "This is the work of God, that ye believe on Him whom He hath sent:" that "he that glorieth may glory in the Lord."
