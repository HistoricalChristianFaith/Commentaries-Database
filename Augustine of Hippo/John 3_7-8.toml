A father, a man who will one day die, begets through his wife a son to succeed him; God begets from the church sons, not to succeed him but to remain with him. And [the Gospel] continues: “That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.” Therefore we are born spiritually, and in the Spirit we are born by word and sacrament. The Spirit is present that we may be born. The Spirit is present invisibly from whom you are born, because you too are born invisibly. For [the Gospel] continues and says, “Do not wonder that I have said to you, ‘You must hear his voice but do not know where he comes from or where he goes.” No one sees the Spirit. And how do we hear the voice of the Spirit? A psalm sounds forth: it is the Spirit’s voice. The gospel sounds forth: it is the Spirit’s voice. God’s word sounds forth: it is the Spirit’s voice. “You hear his voice, but do not know where he comes from or where he goes.” But if you too should be born of the Spirit, you will be such that he who is not yet born of the spirit has no idea where you come from or where you go. For he continues and says, “So is everyone who is born of the Spirit.”
