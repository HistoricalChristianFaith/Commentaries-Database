The person of God is one of that number of the blessed of whom it was foretold: “Blessed is the one to whom the Lord has not imputed sin, and in whose mouth is no guile.” For he confesses even sins of the just, asserting that they rather put their hope in the mercy of God than trust in their own justice, and therefore there is no guile in his mouth, or, indeed, in the mouths of all those to whose truthful humility or humble truth he bears witness.
