"And ye are clean, but not all." What this means the evangelist has explained by adding, "For He knew who should betray Him; therefore said He, Ye are not all clean." What can be clearer than this clear light? Let us, therefore, make haste; the reader is quickened by the very clarity of Scripture: our delight is to run with the words. "For He knew who should betray Him." Accordingly, while Judas was being washed, but not cleansed, the Lord's foreknowledge proceeded without any error to the exposure of His betrayer, whom He had not ceased to bear with: for up to this time, even when his feet were being washed, He was bearing with, not deserting him.
