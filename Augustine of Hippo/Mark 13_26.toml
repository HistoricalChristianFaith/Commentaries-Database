This could be taken in two ways: one, that he will come in the church as in a cloud, as he continues to come now according to his word: “Hereafter you shall see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” He comes with great power and majesty because his greater power and majesty will appear in the saints to whom he will give great power, so that they may not be overcome by such persecution. The other way in which he will come will be in his body in which he sits at the right hand of the Father, in which, also, he died and rose again and ascended into heaven.

In his last advent he will come in the clouds to judge the quick and the dead, just as he preached of clouds in his first voice which sounded forth in the gospel: “They will see the Son of man coming in clouds with great power and glory.” What is “then”? Will not the Lord come again in later times, when all the peoples of the earth shall lament? He came first in preaching, and filled the whole wide world. Let us not resist his first coming, that we may not tremble at his second.
