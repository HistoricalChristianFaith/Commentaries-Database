"All the glory of her, the King's daughter, is from within" [Psalm 45:13]. Not only is her robe, outwardly, "of gold, and of various colours;" but He who loved her beauty, knew her to be also beautiful within.  What are those inward charms?  Those of conscience. It is there Christ sees; it is there Christ loves her: it is there He addresses her, there punishes, there crowns. Let then your alms be done in secret; for "all the glory of her, the King's daughter, is from within." "With fringes of gold, clothed with various colours" [Psalm 45:14]. Her beauty is from within; yet in the "fringes of gold" is the diversity of languages: the beauty of doctrine. What do these avail, if them be not that beauty "from within"? "The virgins shall be brought unto the King after her." It has been fulfilled indeed. The Church has believed; the Church has been formed throughout all nations. And to what a degree do virgins now seek to find favour in the eyes of that King! Whence are they moved to do so? Even because the Church preceded them. "The virgins shall be brought unto the King after her. Her near kinswomen  shall be brought unto You." For they that are brought unto Him are not strangers, but her "near kinswomen," that belong to her. And because he had said, "unto the King," he says, turning the discourse to Him, "her near kinswomen shall be brought unto You."
