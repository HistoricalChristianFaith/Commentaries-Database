"Man is made like vanity: his days pass away like a shadow" [Psalm 144:4]. What vanity? Time, which passes on, and flows by. For this "vanity" is said in comparison of the Truth, which ever abides, and never fails: for it too is a work of His Hand, in its degree. "For," as it is written, "God filled the earth with His good things." [Sirach 16:29] What is "His"? That accord with Him. But all these things, being earthly, fleeting, transitory, if they be compared to that Truth, where it is said, "I Am That I Am," [Exodus 3:14] all this which passes away is called "vanity." For through time it vanishes, like stroke into the air. And why should I say more than that which the Apostle James said, willing to bring down proud men to humility, "What is," says he, "your life? It is even a vapour, which appears for a little time, and then vanishes away." [James 4:14] ...Work then, though it be in the night, with your hands, that is, by good works seek God, before the day come which shall gladden you, lest the day come which shall sadden you. For see how safely you work, who art not left by Him whom you seek, "that your Father which sees in secret may reward you openly." [Matthew 6:4] ...

But if this anomalous state of things were uniform in this life, in which, as the sacred Psalmist says, “Man is like to vanity, his days as a shadow that passeth away,”—so uniform that none but wicked men won the transitory prosperity of earth, while only the good suffered its ills,—this could be referred to the just and even benign judgment of God. We might suppose that they who were not destined to obtain those everlasting benefits which constitute human blessedness were either deluded by transitory blessings as the just reward of their wickedness, or were, in God’s mercy, consoled by them, and that they who were not destined to suffer eternal torments were afflicted with temporal chastisement for their sins, or were stimulated to greater attainment in virtue. But now, as it is, since we not only see good men involved in the ills of life, and bad men enjoying the good of it, which seems unjust, but also that evil often overtakes evil men, and good surprises the good, the rather on this account are God’s judgments unsearchable, and his ways past finding out.
