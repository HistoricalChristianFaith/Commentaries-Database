You give alms. You receive alms. You pardon. You are pardoned. You are generous. You are treated generously. Listen to God saying, “Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Give, and things will be given to you.”Keep the poor in mind. I say this to all of you. Give alms, my brothers and sisters, and you won’t lose what you give. Trust God. I’m not only telling you you won’t lose what you do for the poor, but I’m telling you plainly, this is all that you won’t lose…. Come now, let’s see if you can cheer the poor up today. You be their granaries, so that God may give to you what you can give to them, and so that he may forgive whatever sins you have committed. ..

So there is hope in God’s mercy, if our misery is not so barren as to yield no work of mercy. What do you want from the Lord? Mercy. Give, and it shall be given to you. What do you want from the Lord? Pardon. Forgive, and you will be forgiven. ..

“Forgive, and you will be forgiven.” “Give, and it will be given you.” These are the two wings of prayer, on which it flies to God. Pardon the offender what has been committed, and give to the person in need.

The Christian soul understands how far removed he should be from theft of another’s goods when he realizes that failure to share his surplus with the needy is like to theft. The Lord says, “Give, and it shall be given to you. Forgive, and you shall be forgiven.” Let us graciously and fervently perform these two types of almsgiving, that is, giving and forgiving, for we in turn pray the Lord to give us good things and not to repay our evil deeds.

The practice of mercy is twofold: when vengeance is sacrificed and when compassion is shown. The Lord included both of these in his brief sentence: “Forgive, and you shall be forgiven; give, and it shall be given to you.” This work has the effect of purifying the heart, so that, even under the limitations of this life, we are enabled with pure mind to see the immutable reality of God. There is something holding us back, which has to be loosed so that our sight may break through to the light. In connection with this the Lord said, “Give alms, and behold, all things are clean to you.” Therefore the next and sixth step is that cleansing of the heart. .
