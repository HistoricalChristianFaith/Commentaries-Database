"For the Lord shall build up Sion" [Psalm 102:16]. This work is going on now. O you living stones, run to the work of building, not to ruin. Sion is in building, beware of the ruined walls: the tower is building, the ark is in building; remember the deluge. This work is in progress now; but when Sion is built, what will happen? "And He will appear in His glory." That He might build up Sion, that He might be a foundation in Sion, He was seen by Sion, but not in His glory: "we have seen Him, and He had no form nor comeliness." [Isaiah 53:2] But truly when He shall have come with His angels to judge, [Matthew 25:31] shall they not look then upon Him whom they have pierced? [Zechariah 12:10] and they shall be put to confusion when too late, who refused confusion in early and healthful repentance.
