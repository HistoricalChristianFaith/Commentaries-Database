Christ spoke to the Jews only, not to any other nation. In them then was that world that hated Christ and his disciples. And not only in them, but even these latter [i.e., the Gentiles] were shown by him to belong to the same world. What, then, does he mean by the words “If I had not come and spoken unto them, they would not have sin”? Were the Jews then without sin before Christ came in the flesh, because Christ had not spoken to them? Only the greatest fool would think so. By sin here he means not every sin but a certain great sin which includes everyone and which alone hinders the remission of other sins, that is, the sin of unbelief. They did not believe in Christ, who came that they might believe in him. This is the sin, then, they would not have had if Christ had not come. His advent has become as much fraught with destruction to unbelievers as it is with salvation to those who believe.…“But now they have no excuse for their sin.” If those to whom Christ had not come or spoken had no excuse for their sin, why is it said here that these had no excuse, because Christ had come and spoken to them? If the first had excuse, did it do away with their punishment altogether or only mitigate it? I answer that this excuse did not cover all their sin but only this one, that is, that they did not believe in Christ. But they are not of this number to whom Christ came by his disciples and to whom he spoke by them, as he also does at present. For by his church he has come, and by his church he speaks to the Gentiles.

It remains for us to inquire whether those who, prior to the coming of Christ in his church to the Gentiles and to their hearing of his gospel, have been or are now being overtaken by the close of this life—can they have such an excuse? Evidently they can, but this is no reason for them to escape damnation. “For as many as have sinned without the law, shall also perish without the law. And as many as have sinned in the law, shall be judged by the law.” … Such an excuse not only brings them no help but even becomes an additional aggravation. For those who excuse themselves because they did not hear are the ones who “shall perish without the law.”Paul’s discourse was not distinguishing between unbelievers and believers, but between Jews and Gentiles, both of whom are most certainly lost if they do not find salvation in the Savior who came to seek what was lost. Although, one might say that some will have lighter, others more severe punishments in their damnation. Whoever is punished with an exclusion from that happiness that is given to the saints is lost to God. But there is as great a diversity of punishments as there is of sins—although how this is settled is a matter known only to divine Wisdom, something too deep for human conjecture to examine or express.
