"And has brought Me forth into a broad place" [Psalm 18:19]. And since I was enduring the straits of the flesh, He brought Me forth into the spiritual breadth of faith. "He has delivered Me, because He desired Me." Before that I desired Him, He delivered Me from My most powerful enemies (who were envious of Me when I once desired Him), and from them that hated Me, because I do desire Him.
