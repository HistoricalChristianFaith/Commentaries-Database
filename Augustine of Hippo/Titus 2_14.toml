The faithful who are holy and good may be few in comparison with the larger number of the wicked, but … “many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.” God shows to himself “a numerous people, zealous for good works.” … Even when sometimes darkened and, as it were, clouded over by a great number of scandals … still this people shines forth in her strongest members.
