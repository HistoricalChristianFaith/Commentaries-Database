"The right hand of the Lord has brought mighty things to pass" [Psalm 118:16]. What mighty things? Says he. "The right hand of the Lord," he says, "has exalted me." It is a mighty thing to exalt the humble, to deify the mortal, to bring perfection out of infirmity, glory from subjection, victory from suffering, to give help, to raise from trouble; that the true salvation of God might be laid open to the afflicted, and the salvation of men might remain of no avail to the persecutors. These are great things: but what are you surprised at? Hear what he repeats: "The right hand of the Lord has brought mighty things to pass."
