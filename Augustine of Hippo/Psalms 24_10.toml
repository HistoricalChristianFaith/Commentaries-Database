"Who is this King of glory?" What! Do you too, prince of the power of this air, [Ephesians 2:2] marvel and ask, "Who is this King of glory?" "The Lord of powers, He is the King of glory" [Psalm 24:10]. Yea, His Body now quickened, He who was tempted marches above you; He who was tempted by the angel, the deceiver, goes above all angels. Let none of you put himself before us and stop our way, that he may be worshipped as a god by us: neither principality, nor angel, nor power, separates us from the love of Christ. [Romans 8:39] It is good to trust in the Lord, rather than to trust in a prince;  that he who glories, should glory in the Lord. [1 Corinthians 1:31] These indeed are powers in the administration of this world, but "the Lord of powers, He is the King of glory."
