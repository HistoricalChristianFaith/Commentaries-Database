"For You have presented Him with the blessings of sweetness" [Psalm 21:3]. Because He had first quaffed the blessing of Your sweetness, the gall of our sins did not hurt Him. " Diapsalma. You have set a crown of precious stone on His Head."  At the beginning of His discoursing precious stones were brought, and compassed Him about;  His disciples, from whom the commencement of His preaching should be made.
