This grace he has placed in him "in whom we have obtained our lot, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things." And accordingly, just as he likewise brings it about that we should approach him, he brings it about that we not depart from him. For this reason it was said to him by the prophet, "Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, and on the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself, and we depart not from you." This man is certainly not the first Adam, in whom we departed from God, but the second Adam, on whom is placed the hand of God, that we not depart from him. For Christ is complete, with all his members, because of the church, which is his body and his fullness. So when the hand of God is on him, that we not depart from God, then the work of God (for this is what is meant by his hand) reaches indeed to us. For in Christ "we have obtained our lot, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things." Therefore it is by God's hand, not our own, that we depart not from God. This is his hand, I say, who declared, "I will put fear of me into their hearts, that they may not revolt from me."
