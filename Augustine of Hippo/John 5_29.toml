The apostle answers you and says: I know what I am talking about. You say the pagans are delivered from the body of this death, because the last day of this life is coming, and they will be released in due time from the body of this death. The day is also coming “when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice, and those who have done good will come forth to the resurrection of life.” There you have the ones delivered from the body of this death. But he also says, “Those who have done evil will come to the resurrection of judgment.” See, they will return to the body of this death. The body of this death is coming back to the wicked. They will never be released from it. Then it will not be eternal life but eternal death, because it is eternal punishment.
