"O God, my God, look upon me, why have You forsaken  me far from my salvation?" [Psalm 22:1]. Far removed from my salvation: for "salvation is far from sinners."  "The words of my sins." For these are not the words of righteousness, but of my sins. For it is the old man nailed to the Cross that speaks, ignorant even of the reason why God has forsaken him: or else it may be thus, The words of my sins are far from my salvation.
