De Cons. Ev., ii, 78: We gather from Johnâ€™s account, that six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, and thence entered Jerusalem sitting upon theass, after which were done the things related to have been done at Jerusalem. We understand therefore that four days elapsed from His coming to Bethany, to make this two days before the Passover. The difference between the Passover and the feast of unleavened bread is this; the name Passover is given to that one day on which the lamb was slain in the evening, that is, the fourteenth moon of the first month; and on the fifteenth moon, the day that the people came out of Egypt, followed the festival of unleavened bread. But the Evangelists seem touse the terms indifferently.
