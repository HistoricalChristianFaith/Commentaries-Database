What has the Son heard from the Father? Could it be that the Son has heard the Word of the Father? No, the Son is the Word of the Father.… When you conceive a word to speak it, you intend to speak something, and the very conception of that something is already a word in your heart waiting to be expressed. [As, in fact, you have in your heart the word that you speak], so God gave out his Word, that is, he begat the Son. You beget the Word in your heart according to time. God begat outside of time the Son by whom he created all times. While, therefore, the Son is the Word of God and the Son did not speak his own word to us but the word of the Father, he still also wanted to speak himself to us as well when he was speaking the word of the Father. This is what John said, as was appropriate and necessary.

What does this mean when he says, “For not by measure does God give the Spirit”? We find that God does give the Spirit by measure. Listen to the apostle when he says, “According to the measure of the gift of Christ.” To people he gives by measure; to the only Son he does not give by measure. How does he give to people by measure? “To one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit.” … This person has one gift, that person another; and what that person has, this one does not: there is a measure, a certain division of gifts.… But Christ, who gives, receives not by measure.
