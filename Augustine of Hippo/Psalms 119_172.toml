But as he has now learned, and praised God his Teacher, he next wishes to teach. "Yea, my tongue shall declare Your word: for all Your commandments are righteousness" [Psalm 119:172]. When he says that he will declare these things, he becomes a minister of the word. For though God teach within, nevertheless "faith comes from hearing: and how do they hear without a preacher?"  For, because "God gives the increase," [1 Corinthians 3:7] is no reason why we need not plant and water.

169. But as he hath now learned, and praised God his Teacher, he next wisheth to teach. "Yea, my tongue shall declare Thy word: for all Thy commandments are righteousness" (ver. 172). When he saith that he will declare these things, he becometh a minister of the word. For though God teach within, nevertheless "faith cometh from hearing: and how do they hear without a preacher?" For, because "God giveth the increase," is no reason why we need not plant and water.
