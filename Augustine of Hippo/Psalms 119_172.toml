But as he has now learned, and praised God his Teacher, he next wishes to teach. "Yea, my tongue shall declare Your word: for all Your commandments are righteousness" [Psalm 119:172]. When he says that he will declare these things, he becomes a minister of the word. For though God teach within, nevertheless "faith comes from hearing: and how do they hear without a preacher?"  For, because "God gives the increase," [1 Corinthians 3:7] is no reason why we need not plant and water.
