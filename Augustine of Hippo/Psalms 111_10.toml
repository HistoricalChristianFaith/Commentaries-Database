..."The fear of the Lord," therefore, "is the beginning of wisdom." "Understanding is good" [Psalm 111:10]. Who gainsays? But to understand, and not to do, is dangerous. It is "good," therefore, "to those that do thereafter." Nor let it lift up the mind unto pride; for, "the praise of Him," the fear of whom is the beginning of wisdom, "endures for ever:" and this will be the reward, this the end, this the everlasting station and abode. There are found the true commandments, made fast for ever and ever; here is the very heritage of the New Covenant commanded for ever. "One thing," he says, "I have desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life."  For, "blessed are they that dwell in the house" of the Lord: "they will be always praising"  Him; for "His praise endures for ever."

Nobody fulfills these ten commandments by his own strength of character, unless helped by the grace of God. So if nobody fulfills the law by his own strength of character, unless God helps with his Spirit; now call to mind how the Holy Spirit is presented to us under the number seven; as the holy prophet says that a person is to be filled with “the Spirit of God, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, of counsel and courage, of knowledge and piety, with the Spirit of the fear of the Lord.” These seven activities present the Holy Spirit under the number seven; he, coming down on us as it were from above, begins from wisdom and ends with fear. We, however, going up from below, begin from fear and are perfected in wisdom. “The beginning of wisdom,” after all, “is the fear of the Lord.”
