..."The fear of the Lord," therefore, "is the beginning of wisdom." "Understanding is good" [Psalm 111:10]. Who gainsays? But to understand, and not to do, is dangerous. It is "good," therefore, "to those that do thereafter." Nor let it lift up the mind unto pride; for, "the praise of Him," the fear of whom is the beginning of wisdom, "endures for ever:" and this will be the reward, this the end, this the everlasting station and abode. There are found the true commandments, made fast for ever and ever; here is the very heritage of the New Covenant commanded for ever. "One thing," he says, "I have desired of the Lord, which I will require: even that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life."  For, "blessed are they that dwell in the house" of the Lord: "they will be always praising"  Him; for "His praise endures for ever."
