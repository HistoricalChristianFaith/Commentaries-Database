"You have scorned all," or, as it seems more closely translated from the Greek, "You have brought to nought all them that depart from Your righteousnesses: for their thought is unrighteous" [Psalm 119:118]. For this reason he exclaimed, "Help Thou me, and I shall be safe; yea, I will meditate in Your righteousnesses always:" because God brings to nought all those who depart from His righteousnesses. But why do they depart? Because "their thought is," he says, "unrighteous." They advance in that direction, while they depart from God.

For even Job himself is not silent concerning his own sins, and certainly our friend [Hilary] is right in his judgment that humility can by no means be placed on the side of falsehood. Therefore, whatever Job confesses, since he is a true worshiper of God, he undoubtedly confesses it sincerely. And Hilary, when he explains the verse of the psalm, in which it is written, "You have despised all them that fall off from your judgments," says, "For if God were to despise sinners, the judgments would indeed despise everyone, for no one is without sin. But he despises those who fall away from him, who are called apostates." Notice how he does not say that no one was without sin, as if he were speaking of people of the past, but no one is without sin. On this point, as I have said, I have no quarrel. But if someone does not yield to the apostle John, who does not himself say, "if we say that we had no sin," but, "If we say that we have no sin," how will he be ready to yield to Bishop Hilary? I raise my voice in the defense of the grace of Christ, without which no one is justified, as though the free will of our nature were sufficient. Indeed, it is Christ who raises his voice in defense of this; let us submit to him when he says, "Without me you can do nothing."
