It is found, in comparing the narratives of all the Evangelists, that this silence on the part of our Lord Jesus Christ took place more than once, both before the chief priests and before Herod, to whom, as Luke intimates, Pilate had sent him for a hearing, and before Pilate himself. So it was not in vain that the prophecy regarding him had preceded, “As the lamb before its shearer was dumb, so he opened not his mouth,” especially on those occasions when he did not answer his questioners. For although he frequently replied to questions addressed to him, yet because of those questions where he made no reply, the metaphor of the lamb is supplied in order that in his silence he might be accounted not as guilty but innocent. When, therefore, he was passing through the process of judgment, wherever he “opened not his mouth” it was in the character of a lamb that he did so. In other words, he did so not as one with an evil conscience who was convicted of his sins but as one who in his meekness was sacrificed for the sins of others.
