How does He gather? What does He in order to gather? "Who heals the bruised in heart" [Psalm 147:3]. Behold the way in which the dispersions of Israel are gathered, by the healing of the bruised in heart. They who are not of a bruised heart, are not healed. What is to bruise the heart? Let it be known, brethren, let it be done, that you may be able to be healed. For it is told in many other places of Scripture;..."the sacrifice of God is a troubled spirit, a bruised and contrite heart God will not despise." He heals then the bruised in heart, for He draws near unto them to heal them; as is said in another place, "the Lord is near unto them who have bruised their heart."  Who are they that have "bruised their heart"? The humble. Who are they that have not "bruised their heart"? The proud. The bruised heart shall be healed, the puffed up heart shall be dashed down. For for this purpose perhaps is it dashed down, that being bruised it may be healed. Let not our heart then, brethren, desire to be set upright, before it be upright. It is ill for that to be uplifted which is not first corrected....
