We have frequently admonished you, that love was to be understood by that praiseworthy breadth, by means of which, while we do the commandments of God, we feel no straitness. On this account also after saying above in this great Psalm, "Your commandment is exceeding broad:"  in the following verse he shows wherefore it is broad: "what love have I unto Your law, O Lord!" [Psalm 119:97]. Love is therefore the breadth of the commandment. For how can it be that what God commands to be loved, be loved, and yet the commandment itself be not loved? For this itself is the law; "in all the day," he says, "is my study in it."

Now that is to be understood through all time; which is, for ever. By such love lust is driven out: lust, which repeatedly opposes our performing the commandments of the law, when "the flesh lusts against the spirit:" [GalatiansÂ 5:17] against which the spirit lusting, ought so to love the law of God, that it be its study during the whole day....

(ver. 97). Love is therefore the breadth of the commandment. For how can it be that what God commandeth to be loved, be loved, and yet the commandment itself be not loved? For this itself is the law; "in all the day," he saith, "is my study in it." Behold how I have loved it, that in the whole day my study is in it; or rather, as the Greek hath it, "all the day long," which more fully expresses the continuance of meditation. Now that is to be understood through all time; which is, for ever. By such love lust is driven out: lust, which repeatedly opposeth our performing the commandments of the law, when "the flesh lusteth against the spirit:" against which the spirit lusting, ought so to love the law of God, that it be its study during the whole day. ...
