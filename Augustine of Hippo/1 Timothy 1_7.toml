Two walls must adhere to the cornerstone in order to preserve “the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace”—one from the Jews and the other from the Gentiles. We mustn’t let our minds be put off by the great number of reprobate Jews, among whom were the builders; those, that is, who “wished to be teachers of the law,” but as the apostle says about them, “do not understand either what they are saying or the things about which they are making their assertions.” It was as a result of this mental blindness, after all, that they rejected the stone which was put at the head of the corner. But it wouldn’t be put at the head of the corner unless it offered to the two peoples coming from different points a peaceful joining, a coupling of grace.

Therefore, let us not love ourselves but him, and in feeding his sheep let us seek those things that are his, not those things that are ours. For in some inexplicable way whoever loves himself, not God, does not love himself; and whoever loves God, not himself, does himself love himself. For he who cannot live of himself dies, of course, by loving himself. Then he who loves himself so that he may not live does not love himself. But when he from whom comes life is loved, by not loving himself, he who does not love himself—precisely that he may love him from whom he has life—loves himself all the more. Therefore, let those who feed Christ’s sheep not be “lovers of themselves,” that they may not feed them as their own but as his. Let them not wish to acquire their own gains from them, as “lovers of money,” or to be their lords, as “haughty,” or to glory over honors which they take from them, as “proud,” or to go so far as even to create heresies, as “blasphemous,” or to not yield to the holy fathers, as “disobedient to parents.” Let them return evils for goods to those who wish them to perish because they do not wish them to perish, as “ungrateful.” Let them not kill their own souls and those of others, as “wicked.” Let them not sunder the motherly bowels of the church, as “irreligious,” not feel no compassion for the weak, as “without affection,” not attempt to taint the reputation of the saints, as “detractors,” or not fail to rein in their worst desires, as “incontinent.” Let them not engage in lawsuits, as “unmerciful,” or fail to know how to give help, as “without kindness.” Let them not point out to the enemies of the godly the things that they have learned ought to be kept secret, as “traitors.” Let them not disturb the human sense of shame by shameless pursuits, as “licentious,” or fail to understand what they say or assert, as if they were “blinded.” Let them not prefer carnal enjoyments to spiritual joys, as “lovers of pleasures more than of God.”

What, therefore, if the soul and spirit of a human being is given by God himself, whenever it is given; and given, too, by propagation from its own kind? Now this is a position which I neither maintain nor refute. Nevertheless, if it must be defended or confuted, I certainly recommend its being done by clear and certain proofs. Nor do I deserve to be compared with senseless cattle because I avow myself to be as yet incapable of determining the question, but rather with cautious persons, because I do not recklessly teach what I know nothing about. But I am not disposed on my own part to return railing for railing and compare this man with brutes. Rather, I warn him as a son to acknowledge that he is really ignorant of that which he knows nothing about. I warn him not to attempt to teach that which he has not yet learned, lest he should deserve to be compared with those persons whom the apostle mentions as “desiring to be teachers of the law, understanding neither what they say nor the things about which they make assertions.”
