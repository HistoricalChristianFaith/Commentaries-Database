"For our soul is bowed down to the dust" [Psalm 44:25]. Where is it bowed down? "To the dust:" i.e. dust persecutes us. They persecute us, of whom You have said, "The ungodly are not so; but are like the dust, which the wind drives away from the face of the earth."  "Our belly has cleaved to the earth." He seems to me to have expressed the punishment of the extreme of humiliation, in which, when any one prostrates himself, "his belly cleaves to the earth." For whosoever is humbled so as to be on his knees, has yet a lower degree of humiliation to which he can come: but he who is so humbled, that his "belly cleaves to the ground," there is no farther humiliation for him. Should one wish to do still farther, it will, after that point, be not bowing him down, but crushing him. Perhaps then he may have meant this: We are "bowed down very low" in this dust; there is no farther point to which humiliation can go. Humiliation has now reached its highest point: let mercy then come also....
