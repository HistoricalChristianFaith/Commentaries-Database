It is a huge question, my brothers, and to me it certainly appears to be a mystery when God says, “In the mouth of two or three witnesses, let every word be established.” … It is possible, however, that two witnesses may lie. The chaste Susannah was arraigned by two false witnesses.… The whole people spoke against Christ falsely.… How then must we understand the word “By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established,” except as an intimation of the mystery of the Trinity in which there is a perpetual stability of truth? Do you wish to have a good cause? Have two or three witness: the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.… Receive our testimony then [the Trinity says], otherwise you will feel our judgment.… I delay my judgment, [Jesus says]. I do not delay my testimony.
