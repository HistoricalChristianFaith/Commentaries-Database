So, with your indulgence, what I have to say to you is this: do not love the success of this world, and those of you who may have it, do not set your hopes on it. It is false, it is deceptive, it is not really to be had. Well, even if you do have it, do not love it, do not rely on it, and it will not be a pit. “Command the rich of this world,” says the apostle, “command them to be rich [in good works].” But the rich of this world are Christians, they are believers. Command them. To do what? “Not to think highly of themselves or to have their hopes set on the uncertainty of riches.” As the psalm also says, “If riches pour down,” as from a spring where you can draw as much as you want without effort and what you draw will immediately vanish—if they flow, “do not set your heart on them,” where it is flowing. If it is flowing, it is making a flood; you set your heart there, it carries it off.

So, then, that you may continue in prayers night and day, until that consolation comes to you, remember that you are desolate, however much you may abound in the good fortune of worldly wealth. The apostle did not attribute this gift to just any widow, but he says, “She that is a widow indeed and desolate has trusted in the Lord and continues in prayers night and day.” But, note carefully what follows: “But she that lives in pleasures is dead while she is living,” for one lives in the things that he loves, that he chiefly seeks after, by which he believes himself happy. Therefore, what the Scripture says about riches, “If riches abound, do not set your heart on them,” I say to you about pleasures: if pleasures abound, do not set your heart on them. Do not rely too strongly on the fact that they are not lacking to you, that they minister to your satisfaction abundantly, that they flow, so to speak, from a plentiful source of earthly happiness. All these things you must inwardly despise and reject; you must seek after no more of them than is needed to support your bodily health. Because of the necessary activities of this life, health is not to be despised until “this mortal shall put on immortality,” and that is the true and perfect and unending health that is not refreshed by corruptible pleasure when it fails through earthly weakness but is maintained by heavenly strength and made young by eternal incorruptibility. The apostle says, “Do not make provision for the flesh in its desires,” because our care of the flesh must be in view of the exigencies of salvation. “For no one ever hated his own flesh,” as he also says. This seems to be the reason why he rebukes Timothy for too great chastisement of the body and advises him to “use a little wine for his stomach’s sake and his frequent infirmities.”

I am aware of that, and I am saddened by it. You are disturbed, and—as he who is infallible tells us—you are troubled in vain. Yes, you are storing up treasures. Even though we grant that you are successful in every transaction, even though we say nothing about your losses, even though we make no mention of the great risks and the deaths that accompany every profitable transaction (I do not mean corporeal deaths; I mean the deaths that are occasioned by evil designs—for veracity dies so that profits may increase), yet, you are being inwardly stripped bare so that you may be outwardly adorned. Yes, suppose that we ignore those facts and make no reference to certain other facts; suppose that we disregard your reverses and consider only your successes. In that case, you are storing up treasures, profits are pouring in from all sides, money is flowing into your coffers as if in a fountain, and whenever a need arises it is engulfed by abundance. Nevertheless, have you not heard: “If riches abound, do not set your heart on them”? Yes, you are growing rich; so you are not disturbed unprofitably. Nevertheless, you are disturbed in vain. But you ask me, “Why am I disturbed in vain? See, I am filling my coffers, and my storehouses can hardly contain the treasures I am acquiring. How, then, am I disquieted in vain?” Because you are storing up treasures, and you do not know for whom you are gathering them. Or, if you know it, I beseech you to tell me. I would hear you tell me that. So, if you are not disturbed in vain, tell me for whom you are gathering treasures. “For myself,” you reply. Do you dare to say that, although you must die? “For my children,” you reply. Do you dare to say that, since they, too, must die? “It is a pious duty for a parent to store up treasures for his children!” Rather, since a person must die, it is a great vanity for him to store up treasures for those who must die. If it is for yourself, why are you gathering treasures that you must leave behind when you die? This is also the case with regard to your children; they are to succeed you, but they are not to abide forever. I refrain from asking, “For what kind of children?” Perhaps debauchery may squander what avarice has amassed. By loose living, someone else squanders what you have amassed by your labors. But I leave this out of account. Perhaps your children will be upright, not dissolute. Perhaps they will preserve what you will have left and increase what you have saved, not dissipate what you have gathered. If your children do this, if in this regard they imitate you, their father, then they are just as vain as you are. What I was saying to you, I say to them. To your son I put this question: “For whom are you gathering?” To him also I say, “You are storing up treasures, and you do not know for whom you are gathering them.” For just as you do not know, so neither does he. Even if vanity has remained in him, has truth therefore lost its force for him?
