"Look, how wide the east is from the west; so far has He set our sins from us" [Psalm 103:12]. They who know the Sacraments know this; nevertheless, I only say what all may hear.  When sin is remitted, your sins fall, your grace rises; your sins are as it were on the decline, your grace which frees you on the rise. "Truth springs from the earth."  What means this? Your grace is born, your sins fall, you are in a certain manner made new. You should look to the rising, and turn away from the setting.  Turn away from your sins, turn unto the grace of God; when your sins fall, thou rises and profitest....One region of the heaven falls, another rises: but the region which is now rising will set after twelve hours. Not like this is the grace which rises unto us: both our sins fall for ever, and grace abides for ever.
