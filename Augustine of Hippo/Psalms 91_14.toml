These are the words of God to the Church. "Because he has set his love in me, therefore will I deliver him" [Psalm 91:14]. Not only therefore the Head, which now sits in heaven, because He has set His house of defence very high, to which no evil shall happen, neither shall any plague come near His dwelling; but we also who are toiling on earth, and are still living in temptations, whose steps are feared for, lest they fall into snares, may hear the voice of the Lord our God consoling us, and saying to us, "Because he has set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver him: I will set him up, because he has known my name."
