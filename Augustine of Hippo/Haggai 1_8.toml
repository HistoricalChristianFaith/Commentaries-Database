I believe, brothers, that you remarked and committed to memory the title of this psalm. “The conversion,” he said, “of Haggai and Zechariah.” These prophets were not as yet in existence when these verses were sung.… But both, the one within the year after the other, began to prophesy that which seemed to pertain to the restoration of the temple, as was foretold so long before. … “For the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.” Whoever therefore converted himself to the work of this building together, and to the hope of a firm and holy edifice, like a living stone from the miserable ruin of this world, understands the title of the psalm, understands “the conversion of Haggai and Zechariah.” Let him therefore chant the following verses, not so much with the voice of his tongue as of his life. For the completion of the building will be that ineffable peace of wisdom, the “beginning” of which is the “fear of the Lord.” Let him therefore, whom this conversion builds together, begin there.
