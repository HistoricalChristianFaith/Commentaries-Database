He praises these sheep also in the Song of Solomon, speaking of some perfect ones as the teeth of his spouse the holy church.

Separated from the world, to which they were once conformed, they pass over into the members of the church. And rightly therefore are they, through whom such things are done, called teeth like to shorn sheep; for they have laid aside the burdens of earthly cares, and coming up from the bath, from the washing away of the filth of the world by the sacrament of baptism, every one bears twins. For they fulfill the two commandments, of which it is said, “On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets”: 16 loving God with all their heart, and with all their soul and with all their mind, and their neighbor as themselves.
