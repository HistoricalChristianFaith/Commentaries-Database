The Canticle of Canticles sings a sort of spiritual rapture experienced by holy souls contemplating the nuptial relationship between Christ the King and his queen-city, the church. But it is a rapture veiled in allegory to make us yearn for it more ardently and rejoice in the unveiling as the bridegroom comes into view—the bridegroom to whom the canticle sings, “The righteous love you,” and the hearkening bride replies, “There is love in your delights.”

Some great thing it is we are to see, since all our reward is seeing; and our Lord Jesus Christ is that very great sight. He who appeared humble, will himself appear great and will rejoice us, as he is even now seen of his angels.… Let us love and imitate him; let us run after his ointments, as is said in the Song of Solomon: “Because of the sweet smell of your good ointments, we will run after you.” For he came and gave forth a sweet smell that filled the world. Whence was that fragrance? From heaven. Follow then toward heaven, if you do not answer falsely when it is said, “Lift up your hearts.” Lift up your thoughts, your love, your hope, that it may not rot upon the earth.… “For wherever your treasure is, there will be your heart also.”
