Inasmuch as the apostle says to the Hebrews, “A will takes effect only at the death of the one who made it,” he therefore asserts that, with Christ’s death for us, the new covenant has become valid. Its likeness was the old covenant, in which the death of the testator was prefigured in the sacrificial victim. Therefore, if one should ask how it is that we, in the words of the same apostle, are “children and heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ,” since of course the inheritance is made valid by the death of the deceased and since an inheritance cannot be understood in any other way, the answer is this: he himself having in fact died, we have become heirs because we were also called his sons. “The sons of the bridegroom,” he says, “do not fast while the bridegroom is with them.” Therefore we are called his heirs, for he has left the peace of the Church, a peace which we possess in this life, in our possession through faith in the divine plan of salvation revealed in time.
