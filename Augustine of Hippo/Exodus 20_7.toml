The second commandment: “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain; for whoever takes the name of the Lord his God in vain will not be purified.” The name of the Lord our God Jesus Christ is Truth: he himself said, “I am the truth.” So truth purifies; futility defiles. And because whoever speaks the truth speaks from what is God’s—for “whoever speaks falsehood speaks from what is his own”—to speak the truth is to speak reasonably, whereas to speak futility is to make a noise rather than to speak. Rightly, because the second commandment means love of the truth, the opposite of that is love of futility.

You are told “Do not take the name of the Lord your God in vain”; do not regard Christ as a creature because for your sake he put on the creature. And you, you despise him who is equal to the Father and one with the Father.
