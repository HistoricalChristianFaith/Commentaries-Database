In this Samaritan the Lord Jesus Christ wanted us to understand himself. “Samaritan,” you see, means “guardian.” … He could have answered, “I am not a Samaritan, and I do not have a devil.” What he did answer was, “It is not I who have a devil.” What he answered, he refuted; what he kept quiet about, he confirmed. He denied he had a devil, knowing himself to be the expeller of devils; he did not deny that he was the guardian of the weak.
