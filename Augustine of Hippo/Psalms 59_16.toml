"But I will sing of Your power, and I will exult in the morning of Your mercy" [Psalm 59:16]. In the morning when temptations have been overcome, in the morning when the night of this world shall have passed away; in the morning when no longer the lyings in wait of robbers and of the devil and of his angels we dread, in the morning when no longer by the lamp of prophecy we walk, but Himself the Word of God as it were a Sun we contemplate. "And I will exult in the morning of Your mercy." With reason in another Psalm is said, "In the morning I will stand by You, and I will meditate."  With reason also of the Lord Himself the Resurrection was at dawn, that there should be fulfilled that which has been said in another Psalm, "In the evening shall tarry weeping and in the morning exultation."  For at even the disciples mourned our Lord Jesus Christ as dead, at dawn at Him rising again they exulted. "For You have become my taker up, and my refuge in the day of my tribulation."
