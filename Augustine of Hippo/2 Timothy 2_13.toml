God is allpowerful, and, since he is allpowerful, he cannot die, he cannot be deceived, he cannot lie, and, as the apostle says, “he cannot disown himself.” Very much he cannot do, yet he is allpowerful. It is because he cannot do these things for the very reason that he is allpowerful. If he could die, he would not be allpowerful. If he could lie, if he could be deceived, if he could deceive, if it were possible for him to do an injustice, he would not be omnipotent. If it were in him to do any of this, such acts would not be worthy of the Almighty. Absolutely omnipotent, our Father cannot sin.

The only thing the Almighty cannot do is what he does not will, in case anybody should consider it was very rash of me to say that the Almighty “cannot” do something. The blessed apostle said it too, “If we do not believe, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny himself.” But it is because he does not wish to that he cannot do it, because he cannot even have the will to. Justice, after all, cannot have the will to do what is unjust, or wisdom will what is foolish, or truth will what is false.
