Christ, then, and the Church, that is, whole Christ, the Head and the Body, says here, "I will love You, O Lord, My strength" [Psalm 18:1]. I will love You, O Lord, by whom I am strong.

Take care not to let trust in your own strength steal on you, for you are human, and “cursed be everyone who puts his hope in man.” But put your trust fully and with your whole heart in God, and he will be your strength; trust him lovingly and gratefully and say to him humbly and faithfully, “I will love you, O Lord, my strength,” because that very charity of God, when it is perfected in us, “casts out fear.”
