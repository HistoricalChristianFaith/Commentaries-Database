Behold yourselves, O Asaph, congregation of the Lord. "Exult ye unto God our helper" [Psalm 81:1]. You who are gathered together today, you are this day the congregation of the Lord, if indeed unto you the Psalm is sung, "Exult ye unto God our helper." Others exult unto the Circus, you unto God: others exult unto their deceiver, do ye exult unto your helper: others exult unto their god their belly, do ye exult unto your God your helper. "Jubilate unto the God of Jacob." Because ye also belong to Jacob: yea, you are Jacob, the younger people to which the elder is servant. [GenesisÂ 25:23] "Jubilate unto the God of Jacob." Whatsoever ye cannot explain in words, you do not therefore forbear exulting: what you shall be able to explain, cry out: what ye cannot, jubilate. For from the abundance of joys, he that cannot find words sufficient, uses to break out into jubilating; "Jubilate unto the God of Jacob."
