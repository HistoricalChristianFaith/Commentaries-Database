The command to the apostles to be witnesses to him in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and even to the uttermost parts of the earth was not addressed exclusively to those to whom it was immediately spoken. They alone would not be the only ones who would carry such an enormous task to completion. Similarly he seems to be speaking to the apostles very personally when he says: “Behold I am with you even to the end of the world,” yet who does not know that he made this promise to the universal church which will last from now even to the consummation of the world by successive births and deaths?
