...For you have heard, like men accustomed to the watering of the clouds of God, "Your truth" then "is in the circuit of You." But when without persecutions, when without opposition, since it is said, that "He was born for a sign which shall be spoken against"? [Luke 2:34] Since then that nation, where You deigned to be born, and to dwell, was as a land separated from the waves of the heathen, so that it appeared dry and ready for watering with rain, while the rest of the nations were as a sea in the bitterness of their sterility; what do Your preachers who scatter Your truth in circuit of You, when the waves of that sea rage furiously? "Thou rulest the power of the sea" [Psalm 89:9]. For what was the result of the sea raging thus, but the day which we are now keeping holy? It slew Martyrs, scattered seeds of blood, the harvest of the Church sprang up. Safely then let the clouds go forth: let them diffuse Your truth in circuit of You, let them not fear the savage waves. "Thou rulest the power of the sea." The sea swells, buffets, and roars: but "God is faithful, who will not suffer you to be tempted beyond what you are able:" [1 Corinthians 10:13] and so, "Thou stillest the waves thereof when they rise."
