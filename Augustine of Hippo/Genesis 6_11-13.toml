Somebody may say to me, “Was Adam, created by God as the first man in the original state of the world, condemned for lack of faith or for sin?” It was not incredulity but disobedience that was the cause for his condemnation and the reason why all his posterity are punished. Cain too was condemned, not for lack of faith but because he killed his brother. Why need I seek further proof when I read that this whole world was destroyed not for incredulity but for wickedness.
