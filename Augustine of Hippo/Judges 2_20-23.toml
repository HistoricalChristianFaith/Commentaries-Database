Scripture tells you that the nations could have been cut off all at once from the land given to the children of Israel; yet God willed that it should only be little by little. We can think of any number of other things which we admit might have happened or may happen, though we can allege no instance of their occurrence. We should not then deny the possibility of human sinlessness, simply because there is no [sinless] person, save him who is not only man but very God, in whom we can show this perfection actually achieved.
