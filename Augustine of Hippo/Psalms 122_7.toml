"Peace be in your strength" [Psalm 122:7]. O Jerusalem, O city, who art being built as a city, whose partaking is in "The Same:" "Peace be in your strength:" peace be in your love; for your strength is your love. Hear the Song of songs: "Love is strong as death." [Song of Songs 8:6] A great saying that, brethren, "Love is strong as death." The strength of charity could not be expressed in grander terms than these, "Love is strong as death." For who resists death, my brethren? Consider, my brethren. Fire, waves, the sword, are resisted: we resist principalities, we resist kings; death comes alone, who resists it? There is nought more powerful than it. Charity therefore is compared with its strength, in the words, "Love is strong as death." And since this love slays what we have been, that we may be what we were not; love creates a sort of death in us. This death he had died who said, "The world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world:" [Galatians 6:14] this death they had died unto whom he said, "You are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God."

Let them, then, have a bitter sorrow for their former detestable wrongdoing, as Peter had for his cowardly lie, and let them come to the true church, that is, their catholic mother, and let them be clerics or bishops in it with as much service for it as they formerly used against it. We do not begrudge it to them; on the contrary, we embrace them, we beg them, we exhort them, we compel them to come in when we find them in the highways and hedges. Even so, we do not yet persuade some of them that we seek them, not their possessions. When the apostle Peter denied the Savior and wept and remained an apostle, he had not yet received the Holy Spirit who had been promised, but much less have they received him when, severed from the unity of the body to which alone the Holy Spirit gives life, they have maintained the sacraments of the church outside the church and in opposition to the church and have fought a kind of civil war, setting up our own banners and our own arms against us. Let them come; "let there be peace in the strength of Jerusalem," the strength that is charity, as it was said to the holy city: "Let peace be in your strength and abundance in your towers." Let them not rise up against the motherly anxiety that she had and has to gather them in, and with them so many throngs of people whom they deceive or did deceive. Let them not be proud, because she thus welcomes them. Let them not turn to the evil purpose of self-esteem what she does for the good purpose of peace.
