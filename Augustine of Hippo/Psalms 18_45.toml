"The strange children have lied unto Me." Children, not to be called Mine, but rather strange children, to whom it is rightly said, "You are of your father the devil," [John 8:44] have lied unto Me. "The strange children have waxen old" [Psalm 18:45]. The strange children, to whom for their renovation I brought the new Testament, have remained in the old man. "And they have halted from their own paths." And like those that are weak in one foot, for holding the old they have rejected the new Testament, they have become halt, even in their old Law, rather following their own traditions, than God's. For they brought frivolous charges of unwashen hands, [Matthew 15:2] because such were the paths, which themselves had made and worn by long use, in wandering from the ways of God's commands.
