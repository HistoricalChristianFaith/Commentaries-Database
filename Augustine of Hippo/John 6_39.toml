quote='''
They therefore who by God’s unerring providence are foreknown and predestined, called, justified, glorified, even before their new birth, or before they are born at all, are already the children of God and absolutely cannot perish. These truly come to Christ.… By him there is given also perseverance in good even to the end. For it is not given except to those who will not perish since those who do not persevere will perish.
