Blessed Elijah typified our Lord and Savior. Just as Elijah suffered persecution by the Jews, so our Lord, the true Elijah, was condemned and despised by the Jews. Elijah left his own people, and Christ deserted the synagogue; Elijah departed into the wilderness, and Christ came into the world. Elijah was fed in the desert by ministering ravens, while Christ was refreshed in the desert of this world by the faith of the Gentiles. Truly, those ravens that took care of blessed Elijah at the Lord’s bidding prefigured the Gentiles, for on this account it is said concerning the church of the Gentiles, “I am dark and beautiful, O daughter of Jerusalem.” Why is the church dark and beautiful? It is dark by nature, beautiful by grace. Why dark? “Indeed, in guilt I was born, and in sin my mother conceived me.” Why beautiful? “Cleanse me of sin with hyssop, that I may be purified; wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.” Why dark? The apostle says, “I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me prisoner to the law of sin.” Why beautiful? “Who will deliver me from the body of this death? The grace of God through Jesus Christ our Lord.” Truly, the church of the Gentiles was like a raven, when it despised the living and before receiving grace served idols as dead bodies.
