(Cons. Ev. ii. 64.) What Matthew has here represented as being said by the mother, Mark (Mark 10:35) relates that the two sons of Zebedee spake themselves, when she had presented their wish before the Lord; so that from Mark's brief notice it should rather seem, that they, and not she, had said that which was said.

(de Trin i. 12.) Or otherwise; The Lord makes answer to His disciples in His character of servant; though whatever is prepared by the Father is also prepared by the Son, for He and the Father are one.
