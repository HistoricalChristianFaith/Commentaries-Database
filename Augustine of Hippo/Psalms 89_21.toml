"My hand shall hold Him fast, and My arm shall strengthen Him" [Psalm 89:21]: because there was a taking up of man; because flesh was assumed in the Virgin's womb, [Luke 1:31] because by Him who in the form of God is coequal with the Father, the form of a servant was taken, and He became obedient unto death, even the death of the Cross. [Philippians 2:6, 8]
