"How have they become a desolation suddenly?" [Psalm 73:19]. He is wondering at them, understanding unto the last things. "They have vanished." Truly like smoke, which while it mounts upward, does vanish, so they have vanished. How does he say, "They have vanished"? In the manner of one who understands the last things: "they have perished because of their iniquity."
