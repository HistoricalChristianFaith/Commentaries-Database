"Teach me to do Your will, for You are my God" [Psalm 143:10]. Glorious confession! glorious rule! "For Thou," says he, "art my God." To another will I hasten to be re-made, if by another I was made. You are my all, "for You are my God." Shall I seek a father to get an inheritance? "You are my God," not only the Giver of mine inheritance, but mine Inheritance itself. "The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance."  Shall I seek a patron, to obtain redemption? "You are my God." Lastly, having been created, do I desire to be re-created? "You are my God," my Creator, who hast created me by Your Word, and re-created me by Your Word. "Teach Thou me:" for it cannot be that You are my God, and yet I am to be my own master. See how grace is commended to us. This hold fast, this drink in, this let none drive out of your hearts, lest you have "a zeal, of God, but not according to knowledge." [RomansÂ 10:2] Say then this: "Your good Spirit," not my bad one, "Your good Spirit shall lead me into the right land." For my bad spirit has led me into a crooked land. And what have I deserved? What can be reckoned as my good works without Your aid, through which I might obtain and be worthy to be led by Your Spirit into the right land?
