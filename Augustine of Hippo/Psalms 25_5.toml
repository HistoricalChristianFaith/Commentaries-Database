"In Your truth guide me:" avoiding error. "And teach me:" for by myself I know nothing, but falsehood. "For You are the God of my salvation; and for You have I waited all the day" [Psalm 25:5]. For dismissed by You from Paradise, and having taken my journey into a far country, [LukeÂ 15:13] I cannot by myself return, unless Thou meetest the wanderer: for my return has throughout the whole tract of this world's time waited for Your mercy.
