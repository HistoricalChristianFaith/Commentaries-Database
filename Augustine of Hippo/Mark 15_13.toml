Mark, who studies brevity more than any of the Evangelists, has given a concise indication of Pilate’s desire and of his efforts to save the Lord’s life. For, after giving us the statement, “And they cried again, ‘Crucify him’ ” (which makes it clear that they had cried out before for Barabbas to be released), he has appended these words: “Then Pilate continued to say to them, “Why, what evil has he done?” Thus by one short sentence he has given us an idea of matters which took a long time for their transaction.
