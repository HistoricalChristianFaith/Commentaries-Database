"But I shall appear in Your righteousness in Your sight" [Psalm 17:15]. But I, Who have not appeared to them that, with their filthy and darkened heart, cannot see the light of wisdom, "I shall appear in Your righteousness in Your sight."

Why talk about those treasures of wisdom and knowledge, about those divine riches, if not because they are what suffices us? And why talk about that multitudinous sweetness, if not because it is what satisfies us?… In one of the psalms somebody, one of us, or in us, or for us says to him, “I will be satisfied when your glory is revealed.” … He will convert us and show us his face, and “we shall be saved”; we shall be satisfied, and it will suffice us.

When shall we be satisfied?… “When your glory is revealed.” Now though, the glory of our God, the glory of our Christ, is concealed; and with it is concealed ours also. But “when Christ appears, your life, then you too will appear with him in glory.”

What this future glory will be like, however, how richly it will flourish, with what splendor it will blaze out, while we can sing its praises, we cannot possibly explain. Why not? Because we read, “Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor has it come up into the human heart, what things God has prepared for those who love him.” So if that is what has to be said about the eternal good things of heaven, … what must God himself be, who has prepared such great and wonderful things? What, I repeat, must almighty God be like? What but unfathomable, inexpressible, incomprehensible, surpassing all things, beyond all things, apart from all things? He excels, after all, every one of his creatures; he goes far beyond everything he has made; he surpasses the whole universe. I mean, if you are looking for greatness, he is greater; if for beauty, he is more beautiful still; if for delightfulness, he is still more delightful; if for splendor, he is more brilliant; if for justice, he is more just; if for strength, he is stronger; if for fatherly care, he is kinder. Reason, after all, in no way allows us to equate the thing made with its maker or the work with its craftsman.
