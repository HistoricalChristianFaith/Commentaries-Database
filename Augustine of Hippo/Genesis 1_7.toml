The waters were divided so that some were above the firmament and others below the firmament. Since we said that matter was called water, I believe that the firmament of heaven separated the corporeal matter of visible things from the incorporeal matter of invisible things. .

The matter was separated by the interposition of the firmament so that the lower matter is that of bodies and the higher matter that of souls.
