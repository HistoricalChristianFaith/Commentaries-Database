Persevere now in walking by faith in the truth, that you may succeed in coming at a definite and due time to the sight of the same truth. For as the apostle says, “While staying here in the body, we are away from the Lord. For we are walking by faith, not by sight.” We are led to the direct sight and vision of the Father by Christian faith. That is why the Lord says, “No one comes to the Father except through me.”

The one who is himself the Truth and the Word, by whom all things were made, was made flesh so that he might dwell among us. And yet, the apostle still says, “Even though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet from now on we know him no more.” For Christ, desiring not only to give the possession to those who had completed the journey but also to be himself the way to those who were just setting out, determined to take a fleshly body. This is the source of that expression, “The Lord created me in the beginning of his way.” Those who desire to come [to the Father] begin their journey in [the Son]. The apostle, therefore, although still on the way … had already passed over the beginning of the way and had now no further need of it. And yet, everyone who wants to attain to the truth and to rest in eternal life has to start the journey by this way. For Jesus says, “I am the way, and the truth and the life”; that is, by me men and women come. To me they come, in me they rest. For when we come to him, we come to the Father also, because through an equal an equal is known.
