And yet, "they," like a generation crooked and embittering, "added yet to sin against Him" [Psalm 78:17]: that is, not to believe. For this is the sin, whereof the Spirit does convict the world, as the Lord says, "Of sin indeed because they have not believed on Me." [JohnÂ 16:9] "And they exasperated the Most High in drought," which other copies have, "in a place without water," which is a more exact translation from the Greek, and does signify no other thing than drought. Was it in that drought of the desert, or rather in their own? For although they had drank of the rock, they had not their bellies but their minds dry, freshening with no fruitfulness of righteousness. In that drought they ought the more faithfully to have been suppliant unto God, in order that He who had given fullness unto their jaws, might give also equity to their manners. For unto him the faithful soul does cry, "Let my eyes see equity."

12. And yet, "they," like a generation crooked and embittering, "added yet to sin against Him" (ver. 17): that is, not to believe. For this is the sin, whereof the Spirit doth convict the world, as the Lord saith, "Of sin indeed because they have not believed on Me." "And they exasperated the Most High in drought," which other copies have, "in a place without water," which is a more exact translation from the Greek, and doth signify no other thing than drought.

For unto him the faithful soul doth cry, "Let mine eyes see equity."
