In the book of Wisdom it is written, “For this reason there will also be an inquiry into the idols of the peoples.” It could seem as though for a long time God did not consider that idols were worshiped and sacrifices offered to them. Then he who always watches finally made inquiry. He watched in tolerance, he inquired so as to punish. “Into the idols of the peoples,” the book says, “there will be an inquiry, because God’s creatures have become detestable.” The pagans in fact provoke God through his creatures. How do they provoke God through his creatures? Because the carpenter shaped an idol, whereas God had created the wood. The goldsmith shaped an idol, whereas God had created the gold. From an object of yours, do you form something that he might detest? Why, from a creature of God, do you wickedly mold something that he should find detestable? You must form yourself well, so that he will love you. You want to impress your image in wood. Rather, receive within you the image of God. What do you destroy inwardly, and what do you sculpt outwardly? “God’s creatures,” the book says, “have become detestable. They have become a scandal for the souls of human beings and a snare for the feet of fools. Indeed, the beginning of fornication is the love of idols.” If a woman who has many husbands were to merit praise, then let someone who worships many gods also be praised. If a woman who offers herself to men is an adulteress, how much more a soul that worships gods that do not exist? “The beginning of fornication is the love of idols, and their invention a corruption of life.”
