"Praise Him, all you angels of His, praise Him, all His powers" [Psalm 148:2]. "Praise Him, sun and moon; praise Him, all you stars and light" [Psalm 148:3]. "Praise Him, you heaven of heavens, and waters that are above the heavens" [Psalm 148:4]. "Let them praise the Name of the Lord" [Psalm 148:5]. When can he unfold all in his enumeration? Yet he has in a manner touched upon them all summarily, and included all things in heaven praising their Creator. And as though it were said to him, "Why do they praise Him? What has He conferred on them, that they should praise Him?" he goes on, "for He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created." No wonder if the works praise the Worker, no wonder if the things that are made praise the Maker, no wonder if creation praise its Creator. In this Christ also is mentioned, though we seem not to have heard His Name....By what were they made? By the Word? [JohnÂ 1:1-2] How does he show in this Psalm, that all things were made by the Word? "He spoke, and they were made; He commanded, and they were created." No one speaks, no one commands, save by word.
