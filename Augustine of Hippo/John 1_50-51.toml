There is something greater than “I saw you under the fig tree.” [Jesus said, “We shall see greater things than these,”] because it is a greater thing that our Lord has justified us, whom he has called, than that he saw us lying under the shadow of death. For what profit would it have been to us if we had remained where he saw us? Should we not be lying there? And so, what is this greater thing? When have we seen angels ascending and descending upon the Son of man?…Good preachers who preach Christ are like angels of God; that is, they ascend and descend on the Son of man.… Take for instance Paul, who ascended to the third heaven … and descended so far that he even gave milk to babies. … Take for instance the father who is well skilled in speaking, who is such an orator that the forum resounds with his eloquence and the judgment seats shake—if he has a little son, on his return home he puts aside the forensic eloquence to which he had ascended and in child’s language descends to his little one.… If the Lord himself ascended and descended, it is evident that his preachers ascend by imitation and descend by preaching.
