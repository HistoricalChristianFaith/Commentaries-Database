"Remember not the offenses of my youth and of my ignorance" [Psalm 25:7]. The offenses of my presumptuous boldness and of my ignorance reserve not for vengeance, but let them be as if forgotten by You. "According to Your mercy, be mindful of me, O God." Be mindful indeed of me, not according to the anger of which I am worthy, but according to Your mercy which is worthy of You. "For Your goodness, O Lord." Not for my deservings, but for Your goodness, O Lord.
