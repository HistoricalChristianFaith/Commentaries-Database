"For mine iniquity I acknowledge, and my delinquency is before me ever" [Psalm 51:3]. I have not put behind my back what I have done, I look not at others, forgetful of myself, I pretend not to pull out a straw from my brother's eye, when there is a beam in my eye; [Matthew 7:5] my sin is before me, not behind me. For it was behind me when to me was sent the Prophet, and set before me the parable of the poor man's sheep.  For says Nathan the Prophet to David, "There was a certain rich man having very many sheep; but a poor man his neighbour had one little ewe sheep, which in his bosom and of his own food he was feeding: there came a stranger to the rich man, nothing from his flock he took, for the lithe ewe sheep of the poor man his neighbour he lusted; her he slew for the stranger: what does he deserve?" But the other being angry does pronounce sentence: then the king, evidently knowing not wherein he had been taken,  declared the rich man deserving of death, and that the sheep be restored fourfold. Most sternly and most justly. But his sin was not yet before him, behind his back was what he had done: his own iniquity he did not yet acknowledge, and therefore another's he did not pardon. But the Prophet, being for this purpose sent, took from his back the sin, and before his eyes placed it, so that he might see that sentence so stern to have been pronounced against himself.

As we were singing of the Lord, we asked him to turn his face away from our sins and to blot out all our misdeeds. But you can also take note, brothers, of what we heard in the same psalm: "Since I myself acknowledge my misdeed, and my sin is always before me." Now somewhere else he says to God, "Do not turn your face away from me," while here we have just said to him, "Turn your face away from my sins." So since man and sinner are one person, the man says, "Do not turn your face away from me," while the sinner says, "Turn your face away from my sins." So what it amounts to is: "Do not turn your face away from what you have done; turn your face away from what I have done. Let your eye," he says, "distinguish between them, or else the nature may perish because of the flaw. You have done something, I too have done something. What you have done is called nature; what I have done is called a flaw. May the flaw be remedied and thus the nature preserved."
