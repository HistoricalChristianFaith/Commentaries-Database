As it is written, “O God, I will sing you a new song, on a harp of ten strings I will play to you,” we take the harp of ten strings to be the Ten Commandments of the law. Now to sing and play is usually the occupation of lovers. The old person, you see, is in fear; the young is in love. In this way also we distinguish the two testaments or covenants, the old and the new, that the apostle says are allegorically represented by the sons of Abraham, one born of the slave woman, the other of the free; “which,” he says, “are two covenants.” Slavery, surely, goes with fear, freedom with love, seeing that the apostle says, “You have not received the spirit of slavery again in fear, but you have received the spirit of sonship by adoption, in which we cry out, Abba, Father.” And John says, “There is no fear in charity, but perfect charity throws out fear.” So it is charity that sings the new song.True, that slavish fear embodied in the old person can indeed have the harp of ten strings, because that law of the Ten Commandments was also given to the Jews according to the flesh, but it cannot sing to its accompaniment the new song. It is under the law and cannot fulfill the law. It carries the instrument but does not manage to play it; it is burdened, not embellished, with the harp. But any under grace, not under law, they are the ones who fulfill the law, because for them it is not a weight to shoulder but an honor to wear; it is not a rack for their fears but a frame for their love. Fired by the spirit of love, they are already singing the new song on the harp of ten strings.
