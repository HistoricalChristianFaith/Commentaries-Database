"As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him: as one mourning and sorrowful, so I humbled myself" [Psalm 35:14]. Now looks He back to His Own Body: let us now look to this. When we rejoice in prayer, when our mind is calmed, not by the world's prosperity, but by the light of Truth: (who perceives this light, knows what I say, and he sees and acknowledges what is said, "As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him"): even then our soul pleases God, not placed afar off, for, "In Him," says one, "we live and move and have our being," [Acts 17:28] but as a Brother, as a Neighbour, as a Friend. But if it be not such that it can so rejoice, so shine, so approach, so cleave unto Him, and sees itself far off thence, then let it do what follows, "As one mourning and sorrowful, so I humbled Myself. As our Brother, so I pleased Him," said He, drawing near; "As one mourning and sorrowful, so I humbled Myself," said He, removed and set afar off....Did not Peter draw near, when he said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the Living God"? And yet the same man became afar off by saying, "Be it far from You, Lord; this shall not be unto You." Lastly, what said He, his Neighbour, as it were, to him drawing near? "Blessed are you, Simon, Barjona." To him afar off, as it were, and unlike, what said He? "Get behind Me, Satan." [Matthew 16:16-23] To him drawing near, "Flesh and blood," says He, "has not revealed it unto you, but My Father, which is in Heaven." His Light is shed over you, in His Light you shine. But when having become afar off, he spoke against the Lord's Passion, which should be for our Salvation, "Thou savourest not," said He, "the things that be of God, but those that be of men." One rightly placing together both of these says in a certain Psalm, "I said in my ecstasy, I am cast off from before Your Eyes."  In my ecstasy, would he not have said, had he not drawn near; for ecstasy is the transporting of the mind. He poured over himself his own soul, and drew near unto God; and through some cloud and weight of the flesh being again cast down to earth, and recollecting where he had been, and seeing where he was, he said, "I am cast off from before Your Eyes." This then, "As a Neighbour, as our Brother, so I pleased Him," may He grant to be done in us; but when that is not, let even this be done, "As one mourning and sorrowful, so I humbled myself."
