“He deemed it no robbery to be God’s equal, yet he emptied himself and took on the form of a slave.” This was by no means robbery! Who was the robber, then? Adam. And the primordial robber? The being who seduced Adam. How, then, did the devil seize what did not belong to him? “I will set my throne in the north; I shall be like the Most High,” he said. He grabbed for himself something not given to him; that was robbery. The devil tried to usurp what had not been granted to him and thereby lost what he had been given. Then from the cup of his own pride he offered a drink to the humans he was trying to seduce, saying, “Taste it, and you will be like gods.” They too wanted to make a grab at divinity, and they lost their happiness. The devil robbed and paid for it; but Christ declares, “I was discharging a debt, though I had committed no robbery.”As the Lord approached his passion, he testified, “Now the prince of this world (that is, the devil) is coming, and he will find nothing in me (that means, he will find no justification for killing me). But so that the world may know that I am doing my Father’s will, rise, let us leave here.” And he went out to his passion, to pay back where he had committed no robbery. What else does his statement mean—“he will find nothing in me”? He will find no fault. Had the devil found anything missing from his house? Let the devil pursue any robbers he may find; “he will find nothing in me.”
