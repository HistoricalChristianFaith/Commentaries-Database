Therefore whatsoever things God commands (and one of these is “You shall not commit adultery”) and whatsoever things are not positively ordered but are strongly advised as good spiritual counsel (and one of these is, “It is a good thing for a man to not touch a woman”)—all of these imperatives are rightly obeyed only when they are measured by the standard of our love of God and our love of our neighbor in God.
