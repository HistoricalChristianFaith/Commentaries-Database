"I have sworn, and am steadfastly purposed to keep Your righteous judgments" [Psalm 119:106]: as one who walked aright in the light of that lantern, and kept to straight paths. For he calls what he has determined by a sacrament, an oath; because the mind ought to be so fixed in keeping the righteous judgments of God, that its determination should be in the place of an oath. Now the righteous judgments of God are kept by faith; when, under the righteous judgment of God, neither any good work is believed to be fruitless, nor any sin unpunished.

Is anybody, I mean to say, in a position to have both the will and the ability, unless the one who granted us the will by calling us also helps us to have the ability by inspiring us? The fact is, his mercy gets in ahead of us every single time; to call us when we were lacking the will and then to ensure we obtain the ability to do what we will. So let us say to him, "I have sworn and determined to keep the judgments of your justice." I have indeed determined, and promised obedience because you have ordered it; but because "I can see another law in my members fighting back against the law of my mind and taking me prisoner to the law of sin that is in my members," "I have been utterly humbled, Lord; give me life according to your word." Look, "to will is available to me"; therefore, "approve, Lord, the voluntary offering of my mouth," so that your peace may come on earth to people of good will.
