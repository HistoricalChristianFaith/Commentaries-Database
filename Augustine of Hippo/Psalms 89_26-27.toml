"He shall call me, You are My Father, and the lifter up of My salvation" [Psalm 89:26].

"And I will make Him my first-born; higher than the kings of the earth" [Psalm 89:27]. Our Martyrs, whose birthdays we are celebrating, shed their blood on account of these things, which were believed though not yet seen; how much more brave ought we to be, as we see what they believed? For they had not yet seen Christ raised on high among the kings of the earth: as yet princes were taking counsel together against the Lord and His Anointed: what follows in the same Psalm was not then fulfilled, "Be wise now therefore, O you kings: be learned, you that are judges of the earth."  Now indeed Christ has been exalted among the kings of the earth.
