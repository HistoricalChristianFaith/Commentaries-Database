"Take away your gates, you princes" [Psalm 24:7]. All you, that seek rule among men, remove, that they hinder not, the entrances which you have made, of desire and fear. "And be lifted up, you everlasting gates." And be lifted up, you entrances of eternal life, of renunciation of the world, and conversion to God. "And the King of glory shall come in." And the King, in whom we may glory without pride, shall come in: who having overcome the gates of death, and having opened for Himself the heavenly places, fulfilled that which He said, "Be of good cheer, for I have overcome the world." [JohnÂ 16:33]
