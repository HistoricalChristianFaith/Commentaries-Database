It is a small thing for a disciple to come to him; it is a much greater thing to continue in him. Therefore he does not say if you “hear” or “come” or “praise” my Word. He says, “If you continue in my Word.” What do you think, brothers? Is continuing in the Lord hard work or not? If it is hard work, look at the reward. If it is not, you receive the reward for nothing. Let us then continue in him who continues in us.
