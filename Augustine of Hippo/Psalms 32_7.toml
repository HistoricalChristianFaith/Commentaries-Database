"You are my refuge from the pressures, which have compassed me about:" You are my refuge from the pressure of my sins, which has compassed my heart. "O Thou, my Rejoicing, deliver me from them that compass me about" [Psalm 32:7]: in You is my joy: deliver me from the sorrow which my sins bring upon me.
