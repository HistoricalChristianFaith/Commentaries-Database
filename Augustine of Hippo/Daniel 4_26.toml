It is written, as I reminded you a short while ago, “O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you.” … And there are many other teachings in the divine writings that show how much almsgiving and deeds of charity avail for extinguishing and wiping out sins. Accordingly, to those whom he is going to condemn—no, first, on the contrary to those whom he is going to reward with crowns, he is going to impute nothing but their acts of charity, as though to say, “It would be difficult, if I examined you closely, and weighed you in the balance and thoroughly scrutinized your deeds, for me not to find reasons to condemn you; but, ‘Go into the kingdom; for I was hungry and you gave me to eat.’ So you are not going into the kingdom because you never sinned, but because you redeemed your sins with alms deeds.”
