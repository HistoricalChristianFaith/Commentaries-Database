"God, who has girded me with strength" [Psalm 18:32]. God, who has girded me that I might be strong, lest the loosely flowing folds of desire hinder my deeds and steps. "And has made my way undefiled." And has made the way of love, whereby I may come to Him, undefiled, as the way of faith is undefiled, whereby He comes to me.

33. "God, who hath girded me with strength" (ver. 32). God, who hath girded me that I might be strong, lest the loosely flowing folds of desire hinder my deeds and steps. "And hath made my way undefiled." And hath made the way of love, whereby I may come to Him, undefiled, as the way of faith is undefiled, whereby He comes to me.
