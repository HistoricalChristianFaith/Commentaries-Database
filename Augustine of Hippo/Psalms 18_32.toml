"God, who has girded me with strength" [Psalm 18:32]. God, who has girded me that I might be strong, lest the loosely flowing folds of desire hinder my deeds and steps. "And has made my way undefiled." And has made the way of love, whereby I may come to Him, undefiled, as the way of faith is undefiled, whereby He comes to me.
