“The sufferings of the present time cannot be compared with the future glory that will be revealed in us.” But it remains hidden until it is revealed. And precisely because it is hidden, “in the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died.” But, by the fact that it is concealed, does it thus also remain hidden to God, before whom it is precious? “Precious in the eyes of the Lord is the death of his saints.” Consequently, in the face of this hidden mystery we need eyes of faith, so as to believe what we do not see and to suffer courageously, resolutely accepting unjust evils.

“In the eyes of the foolish they seemed to have died, and their end was thought to be a punishment.” “Malice,” in Latin, does not ordinarily have the same meaning that it has in the language used in sacred Scripture. In fact, in Latin one usually calls “malice” that which makes human beings wicked. In the language of the Scripture, however, by “malice” is also meant the evil suffered by human beings. In this passage, therefore, the term should be understood in the sense of “punishment.”

“The Lord abandoned the evil he intended to inflict on his people.” God wanted it to be understood that this evil was a punishment, as is said, “Their end was thought to be an evil.” Similarly, it is said that good and evil come from God, but not according to the evil by which human beings are evil. God in fact is not evil, but he gives bad things to evil people, because he is just.
