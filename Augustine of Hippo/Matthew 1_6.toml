De Cons. Evan., ii, 4: Since in Matthew’s genealogy is showed forth the taking on Him by Christ of our sins, therefore he descends from David to Solomon, in whose mother David had sinned. Luke ascends to David through Nathan, for through Nathan the prophet of God punished David’s sin; because Luke's genealogy is to show the putting away of our sins.
