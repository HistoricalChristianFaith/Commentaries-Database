“If they were capable of sufficient knowledge to account for the universe, how is it that they did not more easily find its Lord?” They are blamed for having spent their time, their activity and their discussions scrutinizing, and in a certain way measuring, what is created. They investigated the movement of the planets, the distance between the stars, the course of the heavenly bodies. Through these studies, they arrived at such a scientific knowledge as to be able to predict eclipses of the sun and the moon, which then occurred on the day and hour predicted, for the length of time and at the exact point in space they had said. What ability! What capacity! But when they were at the point of seeking to know the Creator—who was not far from them—they were unable to find him. If they had found him, they would have had him in themselves.
