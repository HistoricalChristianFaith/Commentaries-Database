For he had said above, “Father, the hour is come; glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.” In this arrangement of the words, he had shown that the Father was first to be glorified by the Son, in order that the Son might glorify the Father. But now he says, “I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work which you gave me to do. And now glorify me.” This seems to be saying that the Son himself had been the first to glorify the Father by whom he then demands to be glorified. We are therefore to understand that he used both words above in accordance with what was future and in the order in which they were future: “Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.” But now, he uses the word in the past tense of what was still in the future when he said, “I have glorified you on the earth: I have finished the work that you gave me to do.” … For in saying that the Father was glorified by [the Son] on the earth but that he himself was glorified by the Father with the Father’s very self, the Son showed them how both glorifications took place. For the Son himself glorified the Father on earth by preaching him to the nations. But the Father glorified the Son with his own self in setting him at his own right hand. But for that very reason, when the Son says afterward in reference to the glorifying of the Father, “I have glorified you,” he preferred putting the verb in the past tense, in order to show that it was already done in the act of predestination, and what was with perfect certainty yet to take place was to be accounted as already done—namely, that the Son, having been glorified by the Father with the Father, would also glorify the Father on the earth.

The proper order of the words is “[the glory] that I had with you before the world was.” … Some have imagined that this should be understood of the human nature assumed by the Word in such a way that it would be converted into the Word and the man were changed into God, or as if the humanity were lost in the Godhead. For no one would say that the Word of God would by that change be doubled or increased.… But we [avoid this error] if we understand [he is speaking of] the predestination of the glory of his human nature, as previously being mortal, becoming immortal with the Father. And we also understand that this had already been done by predestination before the world was, as also in its own time it was done in the world.… Accordingly, when the Son saw that the time of this, his predestined glorification, had now arrived—in order that what had already been done in predestination might also now actually be accomplished—he prayed, “And now, O Father, glorify me with your own self with the glory that I had with you before the world was,” that is, it is time now for me to have that glory at your right hand that I had with you by your predestination.
