"He turned away from burdens his back" [Psalm 81:6]. Who "turned away from burdens his back," but He that cried, "Come unto Me, all you that labour and are heavy laden"? [Matthew 11:28] In another manner this same thing is signified. What the pursuit of the Egyptians did, the same thing do the burdens of sins. As if you should say, From what burdens? "His hands in the basket did serve." By the basket are signified servile works; to cleanse, to manure, to carry earth, is done with a basket,  such works are servile: because "every one that does sin, is the slave of sin;" and "if the Son shall have made you free, then will you be free indeed." [John 8:34-36] Justly also are the rejected things of the world counted as baskets, but even baskets did God fill with morsels; "Twelve baskets" [Matthew 14:20] did He fill with morsels; because "He chose the rejected things of this world to confound the things that were mighty." [1 Corinthians 1:27] But also when with the basket Joseph did serve, he then carried earth, because he did make bricks. "His hands in the basket did serve."
