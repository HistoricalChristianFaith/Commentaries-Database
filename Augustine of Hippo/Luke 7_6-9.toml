Do not imagine that someone cannot please God while he is engaged in military service. Take as an example holy David to whom the Lord gave such high testimony. Many just men of that time were soldiers. The centurion was the soldier who said to the Lord, “I am not worthy that you should enter under my roof, but only say the word and my servant shall be healed.”
