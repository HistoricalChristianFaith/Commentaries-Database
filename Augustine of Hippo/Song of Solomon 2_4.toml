He didn’t abolish love of parents, wife, children, but put them in their right order. He didn’t say, “Whoever loves” but “whoever loves above me.” That’s what the church is saying in the Song of Songs: “He put charity in order for me.” Love your father, but not above your Lord; love the one who begot you, but not above the one who created you.

What is, “Set in order love in me”? Make the proper degrees, and render to each what is his due. Do not put what should come before, below that which should come after it. Love your parents but prefer God to them.
