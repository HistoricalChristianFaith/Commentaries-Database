All of the works of the divine art show in themselves a certain unity, form and order. Each constitutes something of a unity, such as bodily natures and the characters of souls. And they are constituted according to a certain form, like the figures and qualities of bodies or the theories and techniques of the soul. And they follow or have a specific order, like the weights and positions of bodies or the loves and pleasures of the soul. It is necessary, therefore, that knowing the Creator through his works, we rise to the Trinity, of whom the creation, in a sure and just proportion, bears the traces.
