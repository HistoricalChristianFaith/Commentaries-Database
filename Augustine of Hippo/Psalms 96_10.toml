"Tell it out among the nations, that the Lord reigns from the wood:  and that it is He who has made the round world so fast that it cannot be moved" [Psalm 96:10]. What testimonies of the building of the house of God! The clouds of heaven thunder out throughout the world that God's house is being built; and the frogs cry from the marsh,  We alone are Christians. What testimonies do I bring forward? That of the Psalter. I bring forward what you sing as one deaf: open your ears; you sing this; you sing with me, and you agree not with me; your tongue sounds what mine does, and yet your heart disagrees with mine. Do you not sing this? Behold the testimonies of the whole world: "Let the whole earth be moved before His face:" and do you say, that you are not moved? "Tell it out among the heathen, that the Lord has reigned from the wood." Shall men perchance prevail here, and say they reign by wood, because they reign by means of the clubs of their bandits?  Reign by the Cross of Christ, if you are to reign by wood. For this wood of yours makes you wooden: the wood of Christ passes you across the sea. You hear the Psalm saying, "He has set aright the round world, that it cannot be moved;" and you say it has not only been moved since it was made fast, but has also decreased. Do you speak the truth, and the Psalmist falsehood? Do the false prophets, when they cry out, "Lo, here is Christ, and there," [Matthew 24:23] speak truth; and does this Prophet lie? Brethren, against these most open words ye hear in the corners rumours like these; "such an one was a traditor," and, "such an one was a traditor."  What do you say? Are your words, or the words of God, to be heard? For, "it is He who has set aright the round world, that it cannot be moved." I show unto you the round world built: bring your present, and come into the courts of the Lord. You have no presents: and on that account you are not willing to enter. What is this? If God were to appoint unto you a bull, goat, or ram, for a present, you would find one to bring: He has appointed a humble heart, and you will not enter; for you find not this in yourself, because you are swollen with pride. "He has set aright the round world, that it cannot be moved: and He shall judge the people righteously."  Then shall they mourn, who now refuse to love righteousness.
