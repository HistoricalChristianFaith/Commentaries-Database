No evil person does good. And if no evil person does good, how could an evil person make himself good? He who is eternally good can make an evil person good. “Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be healed: save me, and I shall be saved.”

So, the reason that we, being bad, have a good Father is in order that we may not always remain bad. No bad person can make a good one. If no bad person can make a good one, how can a bad person make himself good? The only one who can make a good person out of a bad one is the one who is always good. “Heal me, Lord,” he says, “and I shall be healed; save me, and I shall be saved.”
