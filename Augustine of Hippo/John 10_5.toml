What are we to think? Were all those who heard Christ’s voice sheep? Judas heard, and he was a wolf but wore sheepskin as he followed, laying snares for the Shepherd. And sometimes some of the sheep do not hear him, as for instance those who crucified Christ.… Now you might say, When they did not hear, they were not yet sheep so they must have been wolves at the time; the voice, when they heard it, however, changed them from wolves into sheep.…Still I am disturbed by the Lord’s rebuke to the shepherds in Ezekiel, “Neither have you brought again that which strayed.” He calls it a stray sheep, and yet it never stops being a sheep, although if it strayed, it could not have heard the voice of the Shepherd but the voice of a stranger—the voice of the thief and robber.…
What I say then is this: The Lord knows those that are his. He knows the foreknown, he knows the predestined. … They are the sheep. For a time they do not even know what they are themselves, but the Shepherd knows them. … According to this divine knowledge and predestination, how many sheep are outside, how many wolves within! And how many sheep are inside, how many wolves without!… But these [wolves] are not the sheep, for we speak of those who were predestined—of those whom the Lord knows are his. And yet, even these wolves, as long as they rightly obey, are still listening to the voice of Christ. In fact they are the ones who hear, the others do not. And yet, according to predestination, they are not sheep while the others are.
This is how we solve the difficulty. The sheep do hear the Shepherd’s voice, and they only. When is that? It is when that voice said, “He that endures to the end shall be saved.” No one who is his is indifferent to such a voice; a stranger does not hear it.… But maybe there was someone who treated this voice with disdain and heard it as that of a stranger. If he was predestined, he strayed for the time, but he was not lost forever. He returns to hear what he has neglected, to do what he has heard. For if he is one of those who are predestined, then both his very wandering and his future conversion have been foreknown by God. If he has strayed, he will return to hear that voice of the Shepherd and follow him.
