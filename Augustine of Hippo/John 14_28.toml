Let us, along with the disciples, listen to the Teacher’s words, and not, with strangers, give heed to the wiles of the deceiver. Let us acknowledge the twofold substance of Christ, namely, the divine, in which he is equal with the Father, and the human, in respect to which the Father is greater. And yet at the same time both are not two, for Christ is one. And God is not a quaternity but a Trinity. For as the rational soul and the body form but one man, so Christ, while both God and man, is one. Thus Christ is God, a rational soul and a body. In all of these we confess him to be Christ. We confess him in each. Who, then, is he who made the world? Christ Jesus, but in the form of God. Who is it that was crucified under Pontius Pilate? Christ Jesus, but in the form of a servant. And this is true of the several aspects of which he consists as man. Who is he who was not left in hell? Christ Jesus, but only in respect of his soul. Who was to rise on the third day, after being laid in the tomb? Christ Jesus, but solely in reference to his flesh. In reference, then, to each of these, he is likewise called Christ. And yet, all of them are not two or three but one Christ. On this account, therefore, he said, “If you loved me, you would surely rejoice, because I go to the Father.” For human nature is worthy of congratulation in being so assumed by the only-begotten Word as to be constituted immortal in heaven and, earthly in its nature, to be so sublimated and exalted that, as incorruptible dust, it might take its seat at the right hand of the Father.

Whenever … it seems that the Son is shown to be less than the Father, interpret it as spoken … not to show one is greater or less than the other but … that one has his origin from the other.
