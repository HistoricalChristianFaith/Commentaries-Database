Such, then, should Christ’s apostles be preachers of the gospel and not ones who greet on the road. That is, not ones who look for something else, but those who proclaim the gospel out of genuine brotherly love. Let them come to the house and say, “Peace be to this house.” They do not only say it with their lips, but they pour out what they are full of. They preach peace, and they have peace. They are not like those of whom it is said, “Peace, peace, and there is no peace.” What’s the meaning of “Peace, peace, and there is no peace”? They preach it and do not have it. They praise and do not love it. They say, and they do not do. As for you, though, be sure you accept peace, whether Christ is being proclaimed casually or with sincerity.
