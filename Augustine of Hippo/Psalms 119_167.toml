"My soul has kept Your testimonies, and I have loved them exceedingly:" or, as some copies read, "has loved them," understanding, "my soul" [Psalm 119:167]. The testimonies of God are kept, while they are not denied. This is the office of Martyrs, for testimonies are called Martyria in Greek. But since it profits nothing, even to be burnt with flames without charity, [1 Corinthians 13:3] he adds, "and I have loved them exceedingly."...For he who loves, keeps them in the Spirit of truth and faithfulness. But generally, while the commandments of God are kept, they against whose will they are kept become our foes: then, indeed, His testimonies also must be kept courageously, lest they be denied when the enemy persecutes.
