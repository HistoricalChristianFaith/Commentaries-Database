Remember when he said, “I judge no one”? Now he says, “I have many things to say of you and to judge.” But “I do not judge,” is one thing, “I have to judge” is another. For he had come to save the world, not to judge the world. When he says, “I have many things to say of you and to judge,” he refers to a future judgment when, after he ascended, he would come back to judge the living and the dead.

When he says, “He that sent me is true,” it is as if he said, Therefore I too shall be true in my judgment, because as the Son of the true One, I am the truth.… The Son is the Truth, the Father is true. I inquire which is the greater, but [when I inquire, I] find equality. For the true Father is true not because he contained a part of that truth but because he begat truth in its entirety.
