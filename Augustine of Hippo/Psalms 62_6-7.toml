"For Himself is my God and My Saving One, my Taker up, I will not remove hence" [Psalm 62:6]. Because "Himself is my God," therefore He calls me: "and my Saving One," therefore He justifies me: "and my Taker up," therefore He glorifies me. For here I am called and am justified, but there I am glorified; and from thence where I am glorified, "I will not remove." For a sojourner I am with You on earth as all my fathers were. Therefore from my lodging I shall remove, from my Heavenly home I shall not remove. "In God is my salvation and my glory" [Psalm 62:7]. Saved I shall be in God, glorious I shall be in God: for not only saved, but also glorious, saved, because a just man I have been made out of an ungodly man, by Him justified; [Romans 4:2] but glorious, because not only justified, but also honoured. For "those whom He has predestined, those also He has called." [Romans 8:30] Calling them, what has He done here? "Whom He has called, the same also He has justified; but whom He has justified, the same also He has glorified." Justification therefore to salvation belongs, glorifying to honour. How glorifying to honour belongs, it is not needful to discuss. How justification belongs to salvation, let us seek some proof. Behold there comes to mind out of the Gospel: there were some who to themselves were seeming to be just men, and they were finding fault with the Lord because He admitted to the feast sinners, and with publicans and sinners was eating; to such men therefore priding themselves, strong men of earth very much lifted up, much glorying of their own soundness, such as they counted it, not such as they had, the Lord answered what? "They that are whole need not a Physician, but they that are sick." [Matthew 9:13] Whom calls He whole, whom calls He sick? He continues and says, "I have not come to call just men, but sinners unto repentance." [Matthew 9:12] He has called therefore "the whole" just men, not because the Pharisees were so, but because themselves they thought so to be; and for this reason were proud, and grudged sick men a physician, and being more sick than those, they slew the Physician. He has called whole, however, righteous men, sick, the sinners. My being justified therefore, says that man that leaps over, from Himself I have: my being glorified, from Himself I have: "For God is my salvation and my glory." "My salvation," so that saved I am: "my glory," so that honoured I am. This thing hereafter: now what? "God of my help, and my hope is in God;" until I attain unto perfect justification and salvation. "For by hope we are saved: but hope which is seen, is not hope." [Romans 8:24] ...
