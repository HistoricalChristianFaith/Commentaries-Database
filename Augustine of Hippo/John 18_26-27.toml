See how the prediction of the Physician is fulfilled and the presumption of the sick man is brought to the light. For there is no performance of what Peter had asserted, “I will lay down my life for your sake.” Instead, we see a fulfillment of what Jesus had predicted, “You shall deny me three times.”
