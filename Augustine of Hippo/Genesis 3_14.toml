The serpent is not now questioned but received punishment first, because he cannot confess his sin. One who cannot confess sin has no ground at all for excusing himself. There is no mention now of that condemnation of the devil that is reserved for the last judgment, of which the Lord speaks when he says, “Depart into the eternal fire, which has been prepared for the devil and his angels.” Rather it mentions that punishment of his against which we must be on guard. For his punishment is that he has in his power those who despise the command of God. The words by which sentence is pronounced against him make this clear. The punishment is the greater because he rejoices over this unhappy power, whereas before his fall he was accustomed to rejoice in the sublime truth, in which he did not remain. Hence even the cattle are set ahead of him, not in power but in the preservation of their nature. For cattle did not lose a heavenly happiness that they never had but live their life in the nature that they received. Hence God said to him, “You will creep upon your chest and belly.” We can see this in the snake as well, and the expression is transferred from that visible animal to this invisible enemy of ours. For the term chest signifies “pride” because the strong drives of the soul rule there. The term belly signifies “carnal desire” because that part of the body is recognized as softer. Since by these means he creeps up on those whom he wants to deceive, God said, “You will creep upon your chest and belly.”
