For this reason, charity, which has more regard for the common good than for its own, is said “not to seek the things that are its own.…” Hence, this charity is practiced now in the good works of love, by which it reaches out to give aid in whatever direction it can, and this is its breadth. It bears adversity with longsuffering, and perseveres in what it holds as true, and this is its length. But it does all this in order to attain eternal life which is promised to it on high, and this is its height. This charity, indeed, is hidden in the place where we are founded and, so to speak, rooted in depth. Hence we do not search into the reasons for God’s will, by whose grace we are saved. This has come “not by the works of justice which we have done but according to his mercy.” “For of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth,” and this will of his is hidden.

If the forgiveness of sins were not to be had in the church, there would be no hope of a future life and eternal liberation. We thank God, who gave his church such a gift. Here you are; you are going to come to the holy font, you will be washed in saving baptism, you will be renewed in “the bath of rebirth.” You will be without any sin at all as you come up from that bath. All the things that were plaguing you in the past will be blotted out.

It is true we have not yet risen as Christ has, but we are said to have risen with him on account of the hope which we have in him. So again he says: “According to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of regeneration.” Evidently what we obtain in the washing of regeneration is not the salvation itself but the hope of it. And yet, because this hope is certain, we are said to be saved, as if the salvation were already bestowed.

Little children alone who have performed no deeds of their own, either good or bad, will be condemned solely because of original sin, unless the grace of the Savior has freed them from it through “the laver of regeneration.” All others [are condemned], who have used their free will to add their own sins to original sin, but also for the deliberate acts of their own will. This is so unless they are delivered from the power of darkness and translated to the kingdom of Christ by the grace of God.

For if anyone should ask of me whether we have been saved by baptism, I shall not be able to deny it, since the apostle says, “He saved us by the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit.” But if he should ask whether by the same washing he has already in every way immediately saved us, I shall answer: It is not so. Because the same apostle also says, “For we are saved by hope.”
