The Lord Jesus declares that he is giving his disciples a new commandment, that they should love one another.… But was not this already commanded in the ancient law of God, where it is written, “You shall love your neighbor as yourself”? Why, then, is it called a new one by the Lord, when it is proven to be so old? Is it a new commandment because he has divested us of the old and clothed us with the new person? For it is not indeed every kind of love that renews him that listens to it, or rather yields it obedience, but that love regarding which the Lord, in order to distinguish it from all carnal affection, added, “as I have loved you.” … For this they hear and observe, “A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another,” not as those who are corrupt love one another or as human beings who love one another only in a human way. Instead, they are to love one another as those who are God’s. All of them are to love as children of the Highest, who are siblings, therefore, of his only Son. They are to love with that mutual love by which he loved them when about to lead them on to the goal where all sufficiency should be theirs and where their every desire should be satisfied with good things.

But do not think that that greater commandment that requires us to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our soul and with all our mind is overlooked.… For, if we understand the two commandments correctly, each is implied in the other. One who loves God cannot despise his commandment that he should love his neighbor. And he who loves his neighbor in a heavenly spiritual way, what does he love in that neighbor but God? That is the love that our Lord distinguishes from all human love when he adds, “As I have loved you.” For what was it but God that he loved in us? Not because we had him, but in order that we might have him and that he may lead us on … to where God is all in all.… And so, let each of us so love the other in such a way that by this working of love we make each other the dwelling place of God.
