And therefore we ought not to think of ourselves as having no part in that justice that the Lord himself is referring to, when he speaks “about justice, because I am going to the Father.” After all, we too have risen again with Christ, and with our head we are Christ, for the time being in faith and hope. But our hope will be fulfilled in the final resurrection of the dead. But when our hope is fulfilled or completed, that is when our justification will be completed too. It is the Lord who is going to complete it, and he showed us what we should hope for in his own flesh (that is, in our head), in which he rose again and ascended to the Father. Because this is what Scripture says: “He was handed over for our transgressions and rose again for our justification.” So the world is challenged about sin, in those who do not believe in Christ, and about justice, in those who rise again among the members of Christ.
