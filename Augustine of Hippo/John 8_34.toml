This assertion is important. It is, if one may say so, his oath. “Amen” means true but is not translated. Neither the Greek nor the Latin translator has dared to translate it. It is a Hebrew word, and people have abstained from translating it in order to throw a reverential veil over so mysterious a word. It is not that they wished to lock it up but only to prevent it from becoming despised by being exposed. How important the word is, you may see from its being repeated.… Our Lord has recourse to this mode of enforcing his words, in order to rouse people from their state of sleep and indifference.
