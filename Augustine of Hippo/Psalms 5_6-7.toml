"The man of blood, and the crafty man, the Lord will abominate." [Psalm 5:6] What he said above, "You have hated all that work iniquity, You will destroy all that speak a lie," may well seem to be repeated here: so that one may refer "the man of blood" to "the worker of iniquity," and "the crafty man" to the "lie." For it is craft, when one thing is done, another pretended. He used an apt word too, when he said, "will abominate." For the disinherited are usually called abominated. Now this Psalm is, "for her who receives the inheritance;" and she adds the exulting joy of her hope, in saying, "But I, in the multitude of Your mercy, will enter into Your house" [Psalm 5:7]. "In the multitude of mercy:" perhaps he means in the multitude of perfected and blessed men, of whom that city shall consist, of which the Church is now in travail, and is bearing few by few. Now that many men regenerated and perfected, are rightly called the multitude of God's mercy, who can deny; when it is most truly said, "What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that  You visit    him?  I will enter into Your house:" as a stone into a building, I suppose, is the meaning. For what else is the house of God than the Temple of God, of which it is said, "for the temple of God is holy, [1 Corinthians 3:17] which temple you are"? Of which building He is the cornerstone, [Ephesians 2:20] whom the Power and Wisdom of God coeternal with the Father assumed.
