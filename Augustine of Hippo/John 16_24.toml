Our fullness of joy—and there is nothing greater than this—is to enjoy God in the Trinity, in the image of whom we are made.

So what should we pray for? “Ask in my name.” And he did not say what for, but in his words we can understand what we ought to ask for. “Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full.” Ask, and you will receive, in my name. But what? Not nothing. What though? “That your joy may be full,” which means, ask for what can finally satisfy you. Because sometimes you ask for nothing. “Whoever drinks of this water will be thirsty again.” You lower the bucket of greed into the well, you pull up something to drink, and you will again be thirsty. “Ask, so that your joy may be full,” that is, so that you may be permanently satisfied, not just so as to enjoy yourselves for a time. Ask for what can satisfy you. Utter Philip’s words, “Lord, show us the Father, and that suffices us.” The Lord says to you, “Have I been with you such a long time, and you do not know me? Philip, whoever sees me also sees the Father.” So give thanks to Christ who took our humanity to himself for you in your weakness. And get your stomachs ready to be satisfied with Christ’s divinity.

"Hitherto," He says, "ye have not asked anything in my name. Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full." This that He calls a full joy is certainly no carnal joy, but a spiritual one; and when it shall be so great as to be no longer capable of any additions to it, it will then doubtless be full. Whatever, then, is asked as belonging to the attainment of this joy, is to be asked in the name of Christ, if we understand the grace of God, and if we are truly in quest of a blessed life. But if aught different from this is asked, there is nothing asked: not that the thing itself is nothing at all, but that in comparison with what is so great, anything else that is coveted is virtually nothing. In order, then, that, they may ask in His name, not that which is nothing, but a full joy (since anything different from this that they ask is virtually nothing), He addresses to them the exhortation, "Ask, and ye shall receive, that your joy may be full;" that is, ask this in my name, that your joy may be full, and ye shall receive. For His saints, who persevere in asking such a good thing as this, will in no wise be defrauded by the mercy of God.
