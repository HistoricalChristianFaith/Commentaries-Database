"The health of Your countenance, O God, has taken Me up." For what purpose? In order that no longer I may be poor, no longer sorrowful? "I will praise the name of the Lord with a song, I will magnify Him in praise" [Psalm 69:31]. Now it has been said, this poor One praises the name of the Lord with a song, he magnifies Him in praise. When would He have ventured to sing, unless He had been refreshed from hunger? "I will magnify Him with praise." O vast riches! What jewels of God's praise has he brought out of his inward treasures! These are my riches! "The Lord has given, the Lord has taken away." [Job 1:21] Then miserable he has remained? Far be it. See the riches: "As it has pleased the Lord, so has been done, be the name of the Lord blessed."
