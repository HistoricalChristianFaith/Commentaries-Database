After saying, "I was a child of a noble nature," explaining why he was good-natured, he immediately adds, "A good soul fell to my lot," receiving it, that is, from either the nature or the physical temperament of the father. He then says, "Being good beyond the usual, I entered an unsullied body." " If we wanted to understand these expressions as referring to the Lord with respect to the human nature assumed by the Word, in the same context there are statements that cannot be applied to his sublime person, and especially the following. The same author, in the same book, a little above the passage we are now discussing, professes to have been formed from the blood that comes from the seed of a man. This kind of birth, however, is absolutely different from the birth from the Virgin, since no Christian doubts that she conceived the flesh of Christ without the cooperation of male seed. - "On Genesis 10.17.31-18.32"
