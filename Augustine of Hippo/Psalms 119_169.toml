Let us now hear the words of one praying: since we know who is praying, and we recognise ourselves, if we be not reprobate, among the members of this one praying. "Let my prayer come near in Your sight, O Lord" [Psalm 119:169]: for, "The Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart."  "Give me understanding, according to Your word." He claims a promise. For he says, "according to Your word," which is to say, according to Your promise. For the Lord promised this when He said, "I will inform you."
