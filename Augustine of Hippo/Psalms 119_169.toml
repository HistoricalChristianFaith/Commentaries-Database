Let us now hear the words of one praying: since we know who is praying, and we recognise ourselves, if we be not reprobate, among the members of this one praying. "Let my prayer come near in Your sight, O Lord" [Psalm 119:169]: for, "The Lord is near unto them that are of a contrite heart."  "Give me understanding, according to Your word." He claims a promise. For he says, "according to Your word," which is to say, according to Your promise. For the Lord promised this when He said, "I will inform you."

166. Let us now hear the words of one praying: since we know who is praying, and we recognise ourselves, if we be not reprobate, among the members of this one praying. "Let my prayer come near in Thy sight, O Lord" (ver. 169): for, "The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a contrite heart." "Give me understanding, according to Thy word." He claimeth a promise. For he saith, "according to Thy word," which is to say, according to Thy promise. For the Lord promised this when He said, "I will inform thee."
