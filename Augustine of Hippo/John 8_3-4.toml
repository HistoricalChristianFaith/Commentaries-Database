The Jews, it says, brought a woman, possibly a prostitute, to the Lord, to test him, and they said, “Master, this woman has just now been caught in adultery. In the law of Moses it is written that any woman caught in adultery should be stoned. What do you say?” That is what the tongue said, but it did not acknowledge the Creator. These people had no inclination to pray and say, “Snatch my soul from a deceitful tongue.” It was deceitfully, after all, that they had approached him.This, you see, is what they were intending to do. The Lord had come not to destroy the law but to fulfill it and to forgive sins. So the Jews said to themselves, “If he says ‘Let her be stoned,’ we shall say to him, ‘What has become of your forgiving sins? Aren’t you the one who says “Your sins are forgiven you?” But if he says, ‘Let her go,’ we shall say, ‘What has become of your coming to fulfill the law and not to destroy it?’ ” Notice how deceitful toward God the tongue is.
