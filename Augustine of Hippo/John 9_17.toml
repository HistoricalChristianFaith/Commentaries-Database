There was a division among them as the day divided between the light and the darkness.… They were looking for a way to denigrate the man and cast him out of their synagogue (although he would be found by Christ). However, he declares openly what he thinks. For he said, “He is a prophet.” Not yet anointed in heart, he could not confess the Son of God. Nevertheless, he is not wrong in what he says either, for our Lord even says of himself, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own country.”
