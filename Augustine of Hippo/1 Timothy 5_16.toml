“But none of those reclining at table understood why he said this to him. For some thought that, because Judas held the purse, Jesus says to him, ‘Buy the things that we need for the feast,’ or that he should give something to the poor.” Therefore, the Lord, too, had a purse. Keeping safe the offerings from the faithful, he distributed both to the needs of his people and to others in need. The paradigm for handling church money was thereby established: We should understand that his teaching that one must not take thought of tomorrow was taught for this purpose, that no money should be kept by the saints, but that God should not be served for money and that justice should not be abandoned because of a fear of need. For the apostle too, looking ahead to the future, said, “If any believing woman has widowed relatives, let her provide sufficiently for them so that the church not be burdened, in order that it can have enough for true widows.”
