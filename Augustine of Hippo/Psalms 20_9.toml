"O Lord, save the King:" that He, who in His Passion has shown us an example of conflict, should also offer up our sacrifices, the Priest raised from the dead, and established in heaven. "And hear us in the day when we shall call on You" [Psalm 20:9]. And as He now offers for us, "hear us in the day when we shall call on You."
