Perhaps some of the brethren who are not acquainted with the Greek do not know what the word witnesses is in Greek: and yet it is a term much used by all, and had in religious reverence; for what in our tongue we call witnesses, in Greek are martyrs. Now where is the man that has not heard of martyrs, or where the Christian in whose mouth the name of martyrs dwells not every day and would that it so dwelt in the heart also, that we should imitate the sufferings of the martyrs, not persecute them with our cups! Well then, We have seen and are witnesses, is as much as to say, We have seen and are martyrs. For it was for bearing witness of that which they had seen, and bearing witness of that which they had heard from them who had seen, that, while their testimony itself displeased the men against whom it was delivered, the martyrs suffered all that they did suffer. The martyrs are God's witnesses. It pleased God to have men for His witnesses, that men also may have God to be their witness. We have seen, says he, and are witnesses. Where have they seen? In the manifestation. What means, in the manifestation? In the sun, that is, in this light of day. And how should He be seen in the sun who made the sun, except as in the sun He has set His tabernacle; and Himself as a bridegroom going forth out of his chamber, exulted as a giant to run His course? He before the sun, who made the sun, He before the day-star, before all the stars, before all angels, the true Creator, (for all things were made by Him, and without Him was nothing made,) that He might be seen by eyes of flesh which see the sun, set His very tabernacle in the sun, that is, showed His flesh in manifestation of this light of day: and that Bridegroom's chamber was the Virgin's womb, because in that virginal womb were joined the two, the Bridegroom and the bride, the Bridegroom the Word, and the bride the flesh; because it is written, And they two shall be one flesh; Genesis 2:24 and the Lord says in the Gospel, Therefore they are no more two but one flesh. Matthew 19:6 And Esaias remembers right well that they are two: for speaking in the person of Christ he says, He has set a mitre upon me as upon a bridegroom, and adorned me with an ornament as a bride. One seems to speak, yet makes Himself at once Bridegroom and Bride; because not two, but one flesh: because the Word was made flesh, and dwelt in us. To that flesh the Church is joined, and so there is made the whole Christ, Head and body.

The life itself has been manifested in flesh, so that what can be seen by the heart alone might be seen also by the eyes, in order that hearts might be healed.
