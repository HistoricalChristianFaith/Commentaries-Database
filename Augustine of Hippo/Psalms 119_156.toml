This he saw himself also. For I should not see it, save I saw it in Him, save I were in Him. For these are the words of the Body of Christ, whose members we are. He saw this, I say, and at once added, "Great are Your mercies, O Lord" [Psalm 119:156]. Even our seeking out Your righteousnesses, then, comes of Your mercies. "Quicken me according to Your judgment." For I know that Your judgments will not be upon me without Your mercy.
