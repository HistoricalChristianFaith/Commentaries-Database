"For You are My strength, and My refuge" [Psalm 31:3]. For You are unto Me My strength to bear My persecutors, and My refuge to escape them. "And for Your Name's sake You shall be My guide, and shall nourish Me." And that by Me You may be known to all the Gentiles. I will in all things follow Your will; and, by assembling, by degrees, Saints unto Me, You shall fulfil My body, and My perfect stature.
