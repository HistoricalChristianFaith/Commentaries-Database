“Lord, deliver me from the hand of the sons of foreigners, whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.” And he explains what kind of vanity he means, and what kind of right hand. What he calls the right hand of iniquity is the prosperity of this world. Not because it is never to be found with good people, but because when good people have it they hold it in the left hand, not in the right. They hold everlasting felicity in their right hand, temporal happiness they hold in their left. Greed for eternal things and eternal felicity ought not to be mixed with greed for temporal things, that is to say, for present and temporal felicity. And that is the meaning of “Do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.” So then, “their right hand is a right hand of iniquity.”

Since we know that you are devoted to the public welfare, you must see how plainly the sacred writings show that the happiness of the state has no other source than the happiness of humankind. One of the sacred writers, filled with the Holy Spirit, speaks thus as he prays: “Rescue me out of the hand of strange children, whose mouth has spoken vanity, and their right hand is the right hand of iniquity; whose sons are as new plants in their youth; their daughters decked out, adorned round about after the similitude of a temple; their storehouse full, flowing out of this into that; their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth; their oxen fat. There is no breach of wall nor passage nor crying out in their streets. They have called the people happy that have these things, but happy is the people whose God is the Lord.”You see that a people is not called happy because of an accumulation of earthly good fortune, except by the “strange children,” that is, by those who do not belong to the regeneration by which we become children of God. The psalmist prays to be rescued out of their hand, lest he be drawn by them into that false opinion and into their impious sins. Truly they speak vanity when they “have called the people happy that have these things”—the things that he had listed above, in which that good fortune consisted, the only good fortune that the lovers of this world seek. Therefore, “their right hand is the right hand of iniquity” because they have preferred those things that should have been set aside, as the right hand is preferred to the left. Happiness in life is not to be attributed to the possession of those things; they should be subordinate, not preeminent; they are intended to follow, not to lead. If, then, we were to speak to him who prayed thus and desired to be rescued from the “strange children” who “called that people happy that have these things,” and if we said, “What is your own opinion? What people do you call happy?” he would not say, “Happy is the people whose strength is in their own mind.” If he had said this, he would, it is true, distinguish that people from the former, which made happiness consist in that visible and corporeal good fortune, but he would not yet have passed beyond all the vanities and lying follies, for, as the same writings teach elsewhere, “Cursed be everyone that places his hope in humankind.” Therefore, he ought not to place it in himself, because he himself is a human being. Thus, in order to pass beyond the boundaries of all vanities and lying follies and to place happiness where it truly exists, he says: “Happy is the people whose God is the Lord.”

Now, you know, I think, not only the nature of your prayer but its object, and you have learned this not from me but from him who has deigned to teach us all. Happiness is what we must seek and what we must ask of the Lord God. Many arguments have been fashioned by many people about the nature of happiness, but why should we turn to the many people or the many arguments? Brief and true is the word in the Scripture of God: “Happy is the people whose God is the Lord.” That we may belong to that people and that we may be able to attain to contemplation of him and to eternal life with him, “the end of the commandment is charity from a pure heart and a good conscience, and an unfeigned faith.” Among those same three, hope is put for a good conscience. “Faith therefore, and hope and charity,” lead the praying soul to God, that is, the believing and hoping and desiring soul who attends to what he asks of the Lord in the Lord’s Prayer. Fasting and abstinence from other pleasures of carnal desire—with due regard for our health—and especially almsgiving are great helps to prayer, so that we may be able to say: “In the day of my trouble I sought God with my hands lifted up to him in the night, and I was not deceived.” How is it possible to seek an incorporeal God who cannot be felt with the hands, unless he is sought by good works?
