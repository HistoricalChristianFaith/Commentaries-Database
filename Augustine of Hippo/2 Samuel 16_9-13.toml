By this patience we are supported even when we are in sound health, for, amid the stumbling blocks of this world, our true happiness is deferred.… With this patience holy David endured the insults of one abusing him, and, though he could easily have wreaked vengeance on him, he not only did not do this but even calmed another who was grieved and disturbed on his account and used his royal power to forbid rather than to exercise vengeance. He was not then suffering from any bodily disease or wound. But he did recognize the time of humility and accepted the will of God for whose sake he drank in the bitter reproach with the utmost patience.

And was it not likewise of his own will that the wicked son of Gera cursed King David? And yet what does David say, full of true and deep and pious wisdom? What did he say to him who wanted to strike the reviler? “What,” he said, “have I to do with you, you sons of Zeruiah? Let him alone and let him curse, because the Lord has said to him, ‘Curse David.’ Who, then, shall say, ‘Why have you done so?’ ” And then the inspired Scripture, as if it would confirm the king’s profound utterance by repeating it once more, tells us, “And David said to Abishai, and to all his servants, ‘Behold, my son, who came forth from my body, seeks my life: how much more may this Benjamite do it! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the Lord has bidden him. It may be that the Lord will look on my humiliation and will requite me for his cursing this day.’ ” Now what prudent reader will fail to understand in what way the Lord bade this profane man to curse David? It was not by a command that he bade him, in which case his obedience would be praiseworthy; but he inclined the man’s will, which had become debased by his own perverseness, to commit this sin, by his own just and secret judgment. Therefore it is said, “The Lord said to him.” Now if this person had obeyed a command of God, he would have deserved to be praised rather than punished, as we know he was afterwards punished for this sin. Nor is the reason an obscure one why the Lord told him after this manner to curse David. “It may be,” said the humbled king, “that the Lord will look on my humiliation and will requite me good for his cursing this day.” See, then, what proof we have here that God uses the hearts of even wicked people for the praise and assistance of the good.
