Solomon, it will be remembered, succeeded to the throne during his father David’s lifetime—a kind of succession unique among Jewish kings—for no other reason save to furnish further clear evidence that Solomon is not the man our prophecy proclaims. Nathan says to David, “And when your days shall be fulfilled and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you, which shall proceed out of your bowels, and I will establish his kingdom.” In view of these words, how can anyone think that, because of the later verse, “He shall build a house to my name,” Solomon is the subject of the prophecy and fail to realize that in view of the earlier words, “And when your days shall be fulfilled and you shall sleep with your fathers, I will raise up your seed after you,” a different Peacemaker is promised—one to be raised up not before David’s demise as Solomon was but afterwards? It makes no difference how long was the lapse of time before the destined coming of Jesus Christ. The thing that is beyond question is that he who was promised in such terms to king David was destined to come after his death, the very same who was to build a house for God such as we rejoice to see rising up today, a house not fashioned of timbers and stones but of human beings. It is these people, believers in Christ, whom Saint Paul addresses in these words: “Holy is the temple of God, and this temple you are.”
