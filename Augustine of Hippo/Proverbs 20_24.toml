Do they suppose, accordingly, that God moves the wills of those whom he has wished to the creation of earthly kingdoms but that he does not move them to the attainment of a heavenly kingdom? But I think that it was in reference to the kingdom of heaven, rather than to an earthly kingdom, that it was said … “The steps of a man are guided by the Lord, but how does a mortal understand his own ways?” Let them hear, “Every man seems just to himself, but the Lord directs the hearts.” Let them hear, “As many as were ordained to life everlasting believed.” Let them hear these words, and whatever others I have not quoted, by which it is shown that God prepares and converts people’s wills also for the kingdom of heaven and for eternal life. And think how strange it would be for us to believe that God moves people’s wills for the establishment of earthly kingdoms but that for the attainment of the kingdom of heaven people move their own wills.
