In the second place now giving utterance to an evident prayer, whence it may be perceived that the calling to remembrance of former affliction is not by way of information but prayer; "How long," he says, "O Lord, will You be angry, unto the end? Shall Your jealousy burn like fire?" [Psalm 79:5]. He is evidently asking God not to be angry unto the end, that is, that this so great oppression and tribulation and devastation may not continue even unto the end; but that He moderate His chastening, according to that which is said in another Psalm, "You shall feed us with the bread of tears, and You shall give us to drink of tears in measure."  For the, "how long, O Lord, will You be angry, unto the end?" has been spoken in the same sense as if it had been said, Be not, O Lord, angry unto the end. And in that which follows, "shall Your jealousy burn like fire?" both words must be understood, both, "how long," and, "unto the end:" just as if there had been said, how long shall there burn like fire Your jealousy unto the end? For these two words must be understood in the same manner as that word which was used a little higher up, namely, "they have made." For while the former sentence has, "they have made the dead bodies of Your servants morsels for the fowls of heaven:"  this word the latter sentence has not, wherein is said, "the fleshes of Your saints for the beasts of the earth;" but there is surely understood what the former has, namely, "they have made."

Moreover, the anger and jealousy of God  are not emotions of God; as some do charge upon the Scriptures which they do not understand:  but under the name of anger is to be understood the avenging of iniquity; under the name of jealousy, the exaction of chastity; that the soul may not despise the law of her Lord, and perish by departing in fornication from the Lord. These then in their actual operation in men's affliction are violent; but in the disposal of God they are calm, unto whom has been said, "But You, O Lord of virtues, with calmness dost judge." [Wisdom 12:18] But it is clearly enough shown by these words, that for sins these tribulations do befall men, though they be faithful: although hence may bloom the Martyrs' glory by occasion of their patience, and the yoke of discipline godly endured as the scourge of the Lord. Of this the Maccabees amid sharp tortures,  of this the three men amid flames innocuous, [Daniel 3:21] of this the holy Prophets in captivity, do testify. For although paternal correction most bravely and most godly they endure, yet they do not hide the fact, that these things have befallen them for the deservings of their sins.. ..
