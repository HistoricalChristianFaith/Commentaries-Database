"All the glory of her, the King's daughter, is from within" [Psalm 45:13]. Not only is her robe, outwardly, "of gold, and of various colours;" but He who loved her beauty, knew her to be also beautiful within.  What are those inward charms?  Those of conscience. It is there Christ sees; it is there Christ loves her: it is there He addresses her, there punishes, there crowns. Let then your alms be done in secret; for "all the glory of her, the King's daughter, is from within."
