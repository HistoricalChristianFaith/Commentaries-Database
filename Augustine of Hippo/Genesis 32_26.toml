“Let me go, because it is already morning.” “Morning” we understand as the light of truth and wisdom, through whom all things were made. You will enjoy the morning when this night has gone, that is, the iniquity of this world. That’s when it will be morning, when the Lord comes, in order to be seen by us as he is already seen by the angels. Because “now we see through a mirror in a riddle, but then it will be face to face.” So let us hold fast to this saying, brothers, “Let me go; behold, it is already morning.” But what did he say? “I will not let you go, unless you bless me.” The Lord, you see, does bless us first through the flesh. The faithful know what they receive, that they are blessed through the flesh. And they know that they would not be blessed unless that flesh had been crucified and given for the life of the world. But how is Jacob blessed? In that he got the upper hand with God, in that he held on bravely and persevered and did not lose from his grasp what Adam lost. So let us, the faithful, hold on to what we receive, in order that we may deserve to be blessed.
