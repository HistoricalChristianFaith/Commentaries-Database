"He shall judge the poor of the people, and shall save the sons of the poor" [Psalm 72:4]. The poor and the sons of the poor seem to me to be the very same, as the same city is Sion and the daughter of Sion. But if it is to be understood with a distinction, the poor we take to be the mountains, but the sons of the poor the hills: for instance, Prophets and Apostles, the poor, but the sons of them, that is, those that profit under their authority, the sons of the poor. But that which has been said above, "shall judge;" and afterwards, "shall save;" is as it were a sort of exposition in what manner He shall judge. For to this end He shall judge, that He may save, that is, may sever from those that are to be destroyed and condemned, those to whom He gives "salvation ready to be revealed at the" last time. [1 Peter 1:5] For by such men to Him is said, "Destroy not with ungodly men my soul:"  and, "Judge      me, O God, and sever my cause from the nation unholy."  We must observe also that he says not, He shall judge the poor people, but, "the poor of the people." For above when he had said, "to judge Your people in justice and Your poor in judgment,"  the same he called the people of God as His poor, that is, only the good and those that belong to the right hand side. But because in this world those for the right and those for the left feed together, who, like lambs and goats at the last are to be put asunder; [Matthew 25:32] the whole, as it is mingled together, he has called by the name of the People. And because even here he puts judgment in a good sense, that is, for the purpose of saving: therefore he says, "He shall judge the poor of the people," that is, shall sever for salvation those that are poor among the people. "And He shall humble the false-accuser." No false-accuser can be more suitably recognised here than the devil. False accusation is his business. "Does Job worship God gratis?" [Job 1:9] But the Lord Jesus does humble him, by His grace aiding His own, in order that they may worship God gratis, that is, may take delight in the Lord.  He humbled him also thus; because when in Him the devil, that is, the prince of this world, had found nothing, [John 14:30] he slew Him by the false accusations of the Jews, whom the false-accuser made use of as his vessels, working in the sons of unbelief. [Ephesians 2:2] ...
