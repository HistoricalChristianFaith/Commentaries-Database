Or think of it in this way. When a schoolmaster is the only one in a town, we say loosely, “This person teaches all here to read,” not that all learn from him but that he teaches all who do learn. And in the same way we say that God teaches all to come to Christ: not that all do come but that no one comes in any other way.

See then how the Father draws; not by laying a necessity on a person but by teaching the truth. See how he draws: “They shall all be taught by God.” To draw belongs to God: “Everyone who has heard and has learned of the Father comes to me.” What then? If every person who has heard and learned of the Father comes to Christ, has Christ taught nothing here? What if people saw not the Father teaching but the Son? So then, the Father taught and the Son spoke.… As I teach you by my word, [the Son says], so the Father teaches by his Word.… But the Son himself explains the matter, if we read on: “Not that anyone has seen the Father except him who is from God, he has seen the Father.” … This is as if he said: When I tell you, “Everyone that has heard and learned of the Father,” do not say to yourselves, We have never seen the Father, so how then can we have learned from him? Hear him then in me [Jesus].… I know the Father and am from him, just as a word is from him who speaks it; that is, not the mere passing sound but that which remains with the speaker and draws the hearer.
