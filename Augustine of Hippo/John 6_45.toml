Or think of it in this way. When a schoolmaster is the only one in a town, we say loosely, “This person teaches all here to read,” not that all learn from him but that he teaches all who do learn. And in the same way we say that God teaches all to come to Christ: not that all do come but that no one comes in any other way.
