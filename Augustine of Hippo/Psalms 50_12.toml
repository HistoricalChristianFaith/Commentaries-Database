Who can explain, who expound that which is said to Him in another Psalm, "For my goods  You need    not"?  He has said that He needs not from us any necessary thing. "If I shall be hungry, I will not tell you" [Psalm 50:12]. He that keeps Israel shall neither hunger nor thirst, nor be weary, nor fall asleep.  But, lo! According to your carnality I speak: because you will suffer hunger when you have not eaten, perhaps you think even God does hunger that He may eat. Even though He shall be hungry, He tells not you: all things are before Him, whence He will He takes what is needful for Him. These words are said to convince little understanding; not that God has declared His hunger. Though for our sake this God of gods deigned even to hunger. He came to hunger, and to fill; He came to thirst, and give drink; He came to be clothed with mortality, and to clothe with immortality; He came poor, to make rich. For He lost not His riches by taking to Him our poverty, for, "In him are all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge hidden." [ColossiansÂ 2:3] "If I shall be hungry, I will not tell you. For Mine is the whole world, and the fullness thereof." Do not then labour to find what to give Me, without whom I have what I will.
