"But you hate instruction" [Psalm 50:17]. Thou hatest discipline. When I spare, you sing and praisest: when I chasten, you murmur, as though, when I spare, I am your God: and, when I chasten, I am not your God. "I rebuke and chasten those whom I love." [RevelationÂ 3:19] "But you hate instruction: and hast thrown My sayings behind you." The words that are said through you, you throw behind you. "And you have thrown My sayings behind you:" to a place where they may not be seen by you, but may load you. "And you have thrown My sayings behind you."
