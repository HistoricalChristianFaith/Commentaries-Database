"But you hate instruction" [Psalm 50:17]. Thou hatest discipline. When I spare, you sing and praisest: when I chasten, you murmur, as though, when I spare, I am your God: and, when I chasten, I am not your God. "I rebuke and chasten those whom I love." [RevelationÂ 3:19] "But you hate instruction: and hast thrown My sayings behind you." The words that are said through you, you throw behind you. "And you have thrown My sayings behind you:" to a place where they may not be seen by you, but may load you. "And you have thrown My sayings behind you."

24. "But thou hatest instruction" (ver. 17). Thou hatest discipline. When I spare, thou singest and praisest: when I chasten, thou murmurest: as though, when I spare, I am thy God: and, when I chasten, I am not thy God. "I rebuke and chasten those whom I love." "But thou hatest instruction: and hast thrownMy sayings behind thee." The words that are said through thee, thou throwest behind thee. "And thou hast thrown My sayings behind thee:" to a place where they may not be seen by thee, but may load thee. "And thou hast thrown My sayings behind thee."
