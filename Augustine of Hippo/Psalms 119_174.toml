"I have longed for Your salvation, O Lord" [Psalm 119:174]: even if all our foes be reluctant, let Christ the Salvation of God occur to us: the righteous men of old confess that they longed for Him, the Church longed for His destined coming from His mother's womb, the Church longs for His coming at His Father's right hand. Subjoined to this sentence are the words, "And Your law is my meditation:" for the Law gives testimony unto Christ.
