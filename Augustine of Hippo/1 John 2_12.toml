"I write unto you, little children, because your sins are forgiven you through His name." Therefore, "little children," because in forgiveness of sins ye have your birth. But through whose name are sins forgiven? Through Augustin's? No, therefore neither through the name of Donatus. Be it thy concern to see who is Augustin, or who Donatus: no, not through the name of Paul, not through the name of Peter. For to them that divided unto themselves the Church, and out of unity essayed to make parties, the mother charity in the apostle travailing in birth with her little ones, exposeth her own bowels, with words doth as it were rend her breasts, bewaileth her children whom she seeth borne out dead, recalleth unto the one Name them that would needs make them many names, repelleth them from the love of her that Christ may be loved, and saith, "Was Paul crucified for you? Or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?" What saith he? "I would not that ye be mine, that so ye may be with me: be ye with me; all we are His who died for us, who was crucified for us": whence here also it is said, "Your sins are forgiven you through His name," not through the name of any man.
