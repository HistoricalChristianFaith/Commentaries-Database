"When I called, the God of my righteousness heard me" [Psalm 4:1]. When I called, God heard me, the Psalmist says, of whom is my righteousness. "In tribulation You have enlarged me." You have led me from the straits of sadness into the broad ways of joy. For, "tribulation and straitness is on every soul of man that does evil." [Romans 2:9] But he who says, "We rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation works patience;" up to that where he says, "Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us;"  he has no straits of heart, they be heaped on him outwardly by them that persecute him. Now the change of person, for that from the third person, where he says, "He heard," he passes at once to the second, where he says, "You have enlarged me;" if it be not done for the sake of variety and grace, it is strange why the Psalmist should first wish to declare to men that he had been heard, and afterwards address Him who heard him. Unless perchance, when he had declared how he was heard, in this very enlargement of heart he preferred to speak with God; that he might even in this way show what it is to be enlarged in heart, that is, to have God already shed abroad in the heart, with whom he might hold converse interiorly. Which is rightly understood as spoken in the person of him who, believing on Christ, has been enlightened; but in that of the very Lord Man, whom the Wisdom of God took, I do not see how this can be suitable. For He was never deserted by It. But as His very prayer against trouble is a sign rather of our infirmity, so also of that sudden enlargement of heart the same Lord may speak for His faithful ones, whom He has personated also when He said, "I was an hungered, and you gave Me no meat; I was thirsty, and you gave Me no drink," [Matthew 25:42] and so forth. Wherefore here also He can say, "You have enlarged me," for one of the least of His, holding converse with God, whose "love" he has "shed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghost, which is given unto us." [Romans 5:5] "Have mercy upon me and hear my prayer." Why does he again ask, when already he declared that he had been heard and enlarged? It is for our sakes, of whom it is said, "But if we hope for that we see not, we wait in patience;" [Romans 8:25] or is it, that in him who has believed that which is begun may be perfected?
