"Blessed is the man that fears the Lord: he will have great delight in His commandments" [Psalm 112:1]. God, who alone judges both truthfully and mercifully, will see how far he obeys His commandments: since "the life of man on earth is a temptation," [Job 7:1] as holy Job says. But "He who judges us is the Lord." [1 Corinthians 4:4] ...He therefore will see how far each man profits in His commandments; yet he who loves the peace of this building together, shall have great delight in them; nor ought he to despair, since there is "peace on earth for men of good will." [Luke 2:14]
