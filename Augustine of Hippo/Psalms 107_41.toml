"And He helped the poor out of beggary" [Psalm 107:41]. What means this, brethren? Princes are despised, and the poor helped. The proud are cast aside, and the humble provided for...."And made him households like sheep." Thou understandest one poor man and one beggar of him concerning whom he said, "He has helped the poor out of misery:" this poor man is now many households, this poor man is many nations; many Churches are one Church, one nation, one household, one sheep. These are great mysteries, great types, how profound, how full of hidden meanings; how sweetly discovered, since long hidden.
