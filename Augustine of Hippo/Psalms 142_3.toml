"My tribulation I will proclaim in His sight." There is a repetition, both in the two preceding sentences, and in these which follow: the sentiments are two, but both twice expressed....For, "in His sight," is the same as "before Him;" "I will proclaim my tribulation," is the same as, "I will pour out my prayer." When doest thou this? Being set in the midst of persecution, he says, "while my spirit failed from me" [Psalm 142:3]. Wherefore has your spirit failed, O martyr, set in tribulation? That I may not claim my strength as my own, that I may know that Another works in me the goodness I have. And men perhaps have heard that my spirit has failed within me, and have despaired of me, and have said, "we have taken him captive, we have overpowered him;" "and You have known my paths." They thought me cast down, You saw me standing upright. They who persecuted me and had seized me, thought my feet entangled, "but their feet were entangled, and they fell, but we are risen, and stand upright."  For my eyes are ever unto the Lord, for He shall pluck my feet out of the net.  I have persevered in walking, for "he that shall persevere unto the end, the same shall be saved." [Matthew 10:22] They thought me overpowered, but I continued walking. Where did I walk? In paths which they saw not, who thought me prisoner, in the paths of Your righteousness, in the paths of Your commandments....For every path is a way, but not every way is a path. Why then are those ways called paths, save because they are narrow? Broad is the way of the wicked, narrow the way of the righteous. That which is "the way" is also "the ways," just as "the Church" is also "the Churches," the "heaven" also the "heavens:" they are spoken of in the plural, they are spoken of also in the singular. On account of the unity of the Church it is one Church; "My dove is one, she is the only one of her mother." [Song of Songs 6:8] On account of the congregation of brethren in various places there are many Churches. "The Churches of Judæa which are in Christ rejoiced," says Paul, [Galatians 1:22-23] "and they glorified God in me." Thus he spoke of Churches; and of one Church he thus speaks, "Give none offense, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God."...
