Conversion itself is from the grace of him to whom it is said, “God of hosts, convert us.” Perhaps this must also be understood as done out of the mercy of the heavenly medicine so that people who possessed a proud and wicked will and wanted to establish their own justice might be abandoned for the purpose of being blinded. Perhaps they were blinded for the purpose of stumbling on the stone of stumbling and that their face might be filled with shame. Also, so that humbled they might seek the name of the Lord and not their own justice, by which the proud are puffed up, but God’s justice by which the ungodly are justified? For this benefited many of them for their good, who, pricked with remorse over their own wrongdoing, afterwards believed in Christ; and for these he had even prayed himself, saying, “Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And about this ignorance of theirs the apostle, too, said, “I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.” For then he also added this and said, “For, not knowing God’s justice and seeking to establish their own, they have not submitted themselves to the justice of God.”
