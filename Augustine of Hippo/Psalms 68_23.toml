Likewise, in the same psalm, where it says, "the tongue of your dogs from the enemies by the same," dogs should not always be taken in an evil sense, otherwise the prophet would not blame "dogs not able to bark and loving to dream": 18 doubtless they would be praiseworthy dogs if they both knew how to bark and loved to watch. And certainly those three hundred men—a most sacred number according to the letter of the cross20—would not have been chosen to win the victory because they lapped water as dogs do, unless some great mystery were signified. Good dogs watch and bark to protect their house and their master, their flock and their shepherd. Finally, even here in the praises offered by the church, when a selection is made from this prophecy, it is the tongue of dogs that is mentioned, not their teeth. "The tongue of your dogs," it says, "from the enemies," that is, that those who used to be your enemies and raged against you may become your dogs and may bark for you. It added "from the same" to make them understand that this is not effected by themselves, but "by the same," that is, by his mercy and grace.
