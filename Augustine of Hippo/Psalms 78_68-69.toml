"And He rejected," he says, "the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim  He chose not" [Psalm 78:68]. "And He chose the tribe of Judah" [Psalm 78:69]. He has not said, He rejected the tabernacle of Reuben, who was the first-born son of Jacob; [Genesis 49:3] nor them that follow, and precede Judah in order of birth; so that they being rejected and not chosen, the tribe of Judah was chosen. For it might have been said that they were deservedly rejected; because even in the blessing of Jacob wherewith he blessed his sons, he mentions their sins, [Genesis 49:5] and deeply abhors them; though among them the tribe of Levi merited to be the priestly tribe, whence also Moses was. [Exodus 2:1] Nor has he said, He rejected the tabernacle of Benjamin, or the tribe of Benjamin He chose not, out of which a king already had begun to be; for thence there had been chosen Saul; [1 Samuel 9:1] whence because of the very proximity of the time, when he had been rejected and refused, and David chosen, [1 Samuel 16:1] this might conveniently have been said; but yet was not said: but he has named those especially who seemed to excel for more surpassing merits. For Joseph fed in Egypt his father and his brethren, and having been impiously sold, because of his piety, chastity, wisdom, he was most justly exalted; [Genesis 41:40] and Ephraim by the blessing of his grandfather Jacob was preferred before his elder brother:  and yet God "rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, and the tribe of Ephraim He chose not." In which place by these names of renowned merit, what else do we understand but that whole people with old cupidity requiring of the Lord earthly rewards, rejected and refused, but the tribe of Judah chosen not for the sake of the merits of that same Judah? For far greater are the merits of Joseph, but by the tribe of Judah, inasmuch as thence arose Christ according to the flesh, the Scripture does testify of the new people of Christ preferred before that old people, the Lord opening in parables His mouth. Moreover, thence also in that which follows, "the Mount Sion which He chose," we do better understand the Church of Christ, not worshipping God for the sake of the carnal blessings of the present time, but from afar looking for future and eternal rewards with the eyes of faith: for Sion too is interpreted a "looking out."
