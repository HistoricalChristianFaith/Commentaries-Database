How much power in any case can mortals have? Let mortals hold on to justice; power will be given them when they are immortal. Compared with this, the power of those people who are called powerful on earth is shown to be ridiculous weakness, and “a pit is dug for the sinner” in the very place where the wicked seem to be able to do most. The just person sings, “Happy is the one whom you instruct, Lord, and teach from your law, in order to comfort him in evil days, until a pit is dug for the sinners. For the Lord will not reject his people or forsake his inheritance, until justice turns into judgment, and those who have it are all of an upright heart.” So in this time during which the power of the people of God is being deferred, God will not reject his people or forsake his inheritance, however bitter and humiliating the trials it suffers in its humility and weakness, until the justice that now belongs to the weakness of the godly turns into judgment, that is until it receives the authority to judge, which is being reserved for the just in the end, when power follows in its proper order on the justice that preceded it.

What indeed does holy Scripture say in a psalm to those members who endure the wickedness of this age? “The Lord will not cast off his people.” His people, in truth, toil among the unworthy, among the wicked, among blasphemers, among murmurers, detractors, persecutors, and, if it be allowed, killers. It toils indeed, but “the Lord will not cast off his people, and he will not forsake his own inheritance until justice is turned to judgment.” “Until justice,” which the saints now possess, “is turned to judgment,” when what was said to them will be fulfilled: “You will sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” The apostle possessed justice, but not yet that judgment about which he says, “Do you not know that we shall judge angels?”
