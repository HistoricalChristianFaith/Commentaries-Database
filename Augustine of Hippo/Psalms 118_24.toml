"This is the day which the Lord has made" [Psalm 118:24]. This man remembers that he had said in former Psalms, "Since He has inclined His ear unto me, therefore will I call upon Him as long as I live;"  making mention of his old days; whence he now says, "This is the day which the Lord has made;" that is, wherein He has given me Salvation. This is the day whereof He said, "In an acceptable time have I heard you, and in a day of Salvation have I helped you;" [Isaiah 49:8] that is, a day wherein He, the Mediator, has become the head Stone of the corner. "Let us rejoice," therefore, "and be glad in Him."

We have just been singing to God, "This is the day that the Lord has made." Let us talk about it, seeing that the Lord has presented us with it. This obviously prophetic Scripture wanted us to understand something, some day not of the common sort, not visible to eyes of flesh; not the kind of day that has a sunrise and sunset but a day that could know a dawn but never know a setting. Let us see what the same psalm had said just before: "The stone that the builders rejected, this has been made into the head of the corner. It was made by the Lord; this is wonderful in our eyes." And it continues, "This is the day that the Lord has made." Let us take the cornerstone as introducing us to this day.
