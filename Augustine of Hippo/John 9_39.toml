The day then was divided between light and darkness.… And this is only right since you, O Lord, are the light, you are the day, you deliver us from darkness. Every soul accepts and understands this. But what is this that follows, “And those who see may become blind”? Because you have arrived, shall those who saw now be made blind? Hear what comes next, and maybe you will understand. “Some of the Pharisees” were disturbed by these words “and said to him, ‘Are we also blind?’ ” What had moved them were the words “And those who see may become blind.” “Jesus said to them, … ‘If you were blind, you would have no sin,’ ” that is, if you identified yourselves as blind you would run to the physician.… For I have come to take away sin. But now you say, “We see.” Therefore your sin remains. Why? Because when you say that you see, you are not looking for a physician, and that is why you will remain in your blindness. Therefore, what he has just said before about coming for those who do not see so that they may see concerns those who acknowledge that they do not see and seek a physician so that they may receive their sight. “And those who see may become blind” concerns those who think they can see without looking for a physician, and so they remain in their blindness. He calls this act of division “judgment,” saying, “For judgment I came into this world.” … He is not referring here to that “judgment” when he will judge the living and the dead at the end of the world.
