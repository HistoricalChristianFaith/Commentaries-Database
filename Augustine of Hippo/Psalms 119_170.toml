"Let my request come before Your presence, O Lord: deliver me, according to Your word" [Psalm 119:170]. He repeats what he has asked. For his former words, "Let my prayer come near in Your presence, O Lord:" are like what he says, "Let my request come before Your presence, O Lord:" and the words, "Give me understanding according to Your word," agree with these, "Deliver me according to Your word." For by receiving understanding he is delivered, who of himself through want of understanding is deceived.
