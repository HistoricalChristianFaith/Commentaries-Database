"The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes." I have been enlightened, and with mine eyes I see Him whom with my heart I do not yet see; and He "hath opened mine eyes," and ye know not whence He is! For whose sake, then, if not for yours, hath mine eye been opened? "We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind." Such miracles had taken place, but not on the part of any man; only of God, who made the sun. "If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."
