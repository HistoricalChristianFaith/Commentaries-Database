And he has somewhat against us when we have wronged him; and we have somewhat against him when he has wronged us, in which case there were no need to go tobe reconciled to him, seeing we had only to forgive him, as we desire the Lordto forgive us.

In the spiritual sense therefore we may understand faith as an altar in the inner temple of God, to which the visible altar symbolically points. Whatever gift we offer to God—whether it be prophecy, or doctrine, or prayer, or a hymn, or a psalm, or whatever other spiritual gifts of this kind may come to mind—cannot be acceptable to God unless it is held up by sincere faith and firmly and immovably fixed on it, so that our words may be pure and undefiled.
