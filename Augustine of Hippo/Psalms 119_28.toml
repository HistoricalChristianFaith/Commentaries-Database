Whence the Psalmist, struggling and wearied with the difficulty of obeying them, says, "My soul has slumbered for very heaviness: O establish Thou me with Your word!" [Psalm 119:28]. What means, has slumbered? save that he has cooled in the hope which he had entertained of being able to reach them. But, he adds, "Stablish Thou me with Your word:" that I may not by slumbering fall away from those duties which I feel that I have already attained: establish Thou me therefore in those words of Yours that I already hold, that I may be able to reach unto others through edification.
