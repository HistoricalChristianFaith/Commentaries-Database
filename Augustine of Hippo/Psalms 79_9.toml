Therefore there follows, "Help us, O God, our healing  One" [Psalm 79:9]. By this word which he says, "our healing One," he does sufficiently explain what sort of poverty he has willed to be understood, in that which he had said, "for we have become exceeding poor." For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is necessary. But while he would have us to be aided, he is neither ungrateful to grace, nor does he take away free-will. For he that is aided, does also of himself something. He has added also, "for the glory of Your Name, O Lord, deliver us:" in order that he who glories, not in himself, but in the Lord may glory. [1 Corinthians 1:31] "And be merciful," he says, "to our sins for Your Name's sake:" not for our sake. For what else do our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But "be merciful to our sins, for Your Name's sake." Thus then  You      deliver us, that is,      rescue us from evil things, while  You      both aid us to do justice, and art merciful to our sins, without which in this life we are not. For "in Your sight shall no man living be justified."  But sin is iniquity.  And "if You shall have marked iniquities, who shall stand?"

12. Therefore there followeth, "Help us, O God, our healing One" (ver. 9). By this word Which he saith, "our healing One," he doth sufficiently explain what sort of poverty he hath willed to be understood, in that which he had said, "for we have become exceeding poor." For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is necessary. But while he would have us to be aided, he is neither ungrateful to grace, nor doth he take away free-will. For he that is aided, doth also of himself something. He hath added also, "for the glory of Thy Name, O Lord, deliver us:" in order that he who glorieth, not in himself, but in the Lord may glory. "And merciful be Thou," he saith, "to our sins for Thy Name's sake:" not for our sake. For what else do our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But "merciful be Thou to our sins, for Thy Name's sake." Thus then Thou dost deliver us, that is, dost rescue us from evil things, while Thou dost both aid us to do justice, and art merciful to our sins, without which in this life we are not. For "in Thy sight shall no man living be justified." But sin is iniquity. And "if Thou shalt have marked iniquities, who shall stand?"
