Therefore there follows, "Help us, O God, our healing  One" [Psalm 79:9]. By this word which he says, "our healing One," he does sufficiently explain what sort of poverty he has willed to be understood, in that which he had said, "for we have become exceeding poor." For it is that very sickness, to which a healer is necessary. But while he would have us to be aided, he is neither ungrateful to grace, nor does he take away free-will. For he that is aided, does also of himself something. He has added also, "for the glory of Your Name, O Lord, deliver us:" in order that he who glories, not in himself, but in the Lord may glory. [1 Corinthians 1:31] "And be merciful," he says, "to our sins for Your Name's sake:" not for our sake. For what else do our sins deserve, but due and condign punishments? But "be merciful to our sins, for Your Name's sake." Thus then  You      deliver us, that is,      rescue us from evil things, while  You      both aid us to do justice, and art merciful to our sins, without which in this life we are not. For "in Your sight shall no man living be justified."  But sin is iniquity.  And "if You shall have marked iniquities, who shall stand?"

There, at last, gaze on "In the beginning was the Word." The Word was not, you see, made at some time or other; but it just was in the beginning. Not like creation, of which it is said, "In the beginning God made heaven and earth." As for the Word that was in the beginning, there was no time when it was not. So this that "was in the beginning, and was the Word with God, and the Word itself was God; and all things were made through him, and without him was nothing made"; and in him "what was made is life." This Word came to us. To whom? To us as worthy? Perish the thought! No, but to us as unworthy. After all, "Christ died for the ungodly," and the unworthy, while being worthy himself. We were unworthy, you see, for him to have pity on; but he was worthy to take pity on us, to be told, "Because of your pity, Lord, deliver us." Not because of any previous merits of ours, but "because of your pity, Lord, deliver us; and be lenient with our sins, because of your name," not because of our merit. Obviously, not because of the merit of our sins, but "because of your name." I mean, the merit of our sins, of course, is not reward but revenge. So therefore, "because of your name."
