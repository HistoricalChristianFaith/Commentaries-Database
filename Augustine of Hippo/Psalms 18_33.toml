"Who has made my feet perfect like harts' feet" [Psalm 18:33]. Who has made my love perfect to surmount the thorny and dark entanglements of this world. "And will set me up on high." And will fix my aim on the heavenly habitation, that "I may be filled with all the fullness of God." [EphesiansÂ 3:19]
