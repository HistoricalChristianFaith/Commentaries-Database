"O establish me according to Your word and I shall live: and let me not be disappointed of my hope" [Psalm 119:116]. He who had before said, "You are my taker up," prays that he may be more and more borne up, and be led unto that, for the sake of which he endures so many troubles; trusting that he may there live in a truer sense, than in these dreams of human affairs. For it is said of the future, "and I shall live," as if we did not live in this dead body. While "we await the redemption of our body, we are saved by hope, and hoping for that we see not, we await with patience." [Romans 8:23-25] But hope disappoints not, if the love of God be spread abroad in our hearts through the Holy Spirit which is given unto us. [Romans 5:5] And, as though it were answered him in silence, Thou dost not wish to be disappointed of your hope? Cease not to meditate upon My righteousnesses: and, feeling that this meditation is usually hindered by the weaknesses of the soul, "Help me," he says, "and I shall be safe; yea, I will meditate in Your righteousnesses always" [Psalm 119:117].
