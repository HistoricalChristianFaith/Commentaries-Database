Why do I say this? "For mine enemies have spoken against me, and they that were keeping watch for My soul, have taken counsel together [Psalm 71:10]: saying, God has forsaken Him, persecute Him, and seize Him, for there is no one to deliver Him" [Psalm 71:11]. This has been said concerning Christ. For He that with the great power of Divinity, wherein He is equal to the Father, had raised to life dead persons, on a sudden in the hands of enemies became weak, and as if having no power, was seized. When would He have been seized, except they had first said in their heart, "God has forsaken Him?" Whence there was that voice on the Cross, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"  So then did God forsake Christ, though "God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself," [2 Corinthians 5:19] though Christ was also God, out of the Jews indeed according to the flesh, "Who is over all things, God blessed for ever," [Romans 9:5] — did God forsake Him? Far be it. But in our old man our voice it was, because our old man was crucified together with Him: [Romans 6:6] and of that same our old man He had taken a Body, because Mary was of Adam. Therefore the very thing which they thought, from the Cross He said, "Why have You forsaken Me?" [Matthew 27:46] Why do these men think Me left alone to their evil? What is, think Me forsaken in their evil? "For if they had known, the Lord of glory they had never crucified. [1 Corinthians 2:8] Persecute and seize Him." More familiarly however, brethren, let us take this of the members of Christ, and acknowledge our own voice in these words: because even He used such words in our person, not in His own power and majesty; but in that which He became for our sakes, not according to that which He was, who has made us.
