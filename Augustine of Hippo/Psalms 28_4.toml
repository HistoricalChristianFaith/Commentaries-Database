"Give unto them according to their works" [Psalm 28:4]. Give unto them according to their works, for this is just. "And according to the malice of their affections."  For aiming at evil, they cannot discover good. "According to the works of their hands give Thou unto them." Although what they have done may avail for salvation to others, yet give Thou unto them according to the works of their wills. "Pay them their recompense." Because, for the truth which they heard, they wished to recompense deceit; let their own deceit deceive them.
