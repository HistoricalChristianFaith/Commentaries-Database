See how they already believed in Jesus but Jesus himself did not entrust himself to them. Why? Because they were not yet born again of water and the Spirit. Because of that we have encouraged and do encourage our brothers, the catechumens. For if you should ask them, they have already believed in Jesus. But because they do not yet receive his body and blood, Jesus has not yet trusted himself to them. What are they to do that Jesus may trust himself to them? Let them be born again of water and the Spirit. Let the church, which is pregnant with them, bring them forth. They have been conceived; let them be brought forth into the light. Let them have breasts where they may be nourished. Let them not fear that they may be choked after their birth. Let them not withdraw from their motherâ€™s breasts.
