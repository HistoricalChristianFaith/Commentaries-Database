(de verb. Dom. Serm. 17) One kind of temptation leads to sin, with which God never tempts any one; (James 1:13.) and there is another kind by which faith is tried. (Deut. 13:3.) In this sense it is said that Christ proved His disciple. This is not meant to imply that He did not know what Philip would say; but is an accommodation to men's way of speaking. For as the expression, Who searcheth the hearts of men, does not mean the searching of ignorance, but of absolute knowledge; so here, when it is said that our Lord proved Philip, we must understand that He knew him perfectly, but that He tried him, in order to confirm his faith. The Evangelist himself guards against the mistake which this imperfect mode of speaking might occasion, by adding, For He Himself knew what He would do.

(de Con. Evang. l. ii. c. xlvi) But if our Lord, according to John's account, on seeing the multitude, asked Philip, tempting him, whence they could buy food for them, it is difficult at first to see how it can be true, according to the other account, that the disciples first told our Lord, to send away the multitude; and that our Lord replied, They need not depart; give ye them to eat. (Matt. 25:16) We must understand then it was after saying this, that our Lord saw the multitude, and said to Philip what John had related, which has been omitted by the rest.

(de Con. Evan. l. ii. c. xlvi) The reply, which is attributed to Philip by John, Mark puts in the mouth of all the disciples, either meaning us to understand that Philip spoke for the rest, or else putting the plural number for the singular, which is often done.

(de Con. Evang. ii. c. xlvi) Andrew's suggestion about the five loaves and two fishes, is given as coming from the disciples in general, in the other Evangelists, and the plural number is used.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 1.) He multiplied in His hands the five loaves, just as He produces harvest out of a few grains. There was a power in the hands of Christ; and those five loaves were, as it were, seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 7) Christ is a Prophet, and the Lord of Prophets; as He is an Angel, and the Lord of Angels. In that He came to announce something, He was an Angel; in that He foretold the future, He was a Prophet; in that He was the Word made flesh, He was Lord both of Angels and Prophets; for none can be a Prophet without the word of God.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 1, 2) But let us reflect a little here. Forasmuch as the Divine Substance is not visible to the eye, and the miracles of the divine government of the world, and ordering of the whole creation, are overlooked in consequence of their constancy; God has reserved to Himself acts, beside the established course and order of nature, to do at suitable times; in order that those who overlooked the daily course of nature, might be roused to wonder by the sight of what was different from, though not at all greater, than what they were used to. The government of the world is a greater miracle, than the satisfying the hunger of five thousand with five loaves; and yet no one wonders at this: the former excited wonder; not from any real superiority in it, but because it was uncommon. But it would be wrong to gather no more than this from Christ's miracles: for, the Lord who is on the mounte, and the Word of God which is on high, the same is no humble person to be lightly passed over, but we must look up to Him reverently.

(lib. lxxxiii. Quæst. q. 61. in princ.) The five barley loaves signify the old law; either because the law was given to men not as yet spiritual, but carnal, i. e. under the dominion of the five senses, (the multitude itself consisted of five thousand:) or because the Law itself was given by Moses in five books. And the loaves being of barley is also an allusion to the Law, which concealed the soul's vital nourishment, under carnal ceremonies. For in barley the corn itself is buried under the most tenacious husk. Or, it alludes to the people who were not yet freed from the husk of carnal appetite, which cling to their heart.

(lib. lxxxiv. Quæst. qu. 61) The two fishes again, that gave the pleasant taste to the bread, seem to signify the two authorities by which the people were governed, the Royal, viz. and the Priestly; both of which prefigure our Lord, who sustained both characters.

(Tr. xxiv. 5) The boy who had these is perhaps the Jewish people, who, as it were, carried the loaves and fishes after a servile fashion, and did not eat them. That which they carried, while shut up, was only a burden to them; when opened became their food.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 5) By the act of breaking He multiplied the five loaves. The five books of Moses, when expounded by breaking, i. e. unfolding them, made many books.

(lib. lxxxiii. Quæst. qu. 61) Our Lord by breaking, as it were, what was hard in the Law, and opening what was shut, that time when He opened the Scriptures to the disciples after the resurrection, brought the Law out in its full meaning.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 5) Our Lord's question proved the ignorance of His disciples, i. e. the people's ignorance of the Law. They lay on the grass, i. e. were carnally minded, rested in carnal things, for all flesh is grass. (Isa. 40:6) Men are filled with the loaves, when what they hear with the ear, they fulfil in practice.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 6) And what are the fragments, but the parts which the people could not eat? An intimation, that those deeper truths, which the multitude cannot take in, should be entrusted to those who are capable of receiving them, and afterwards teaching them to others; as were the Apostles. For which reason twelve baskets were filled with them.

The miracles which our Lord Jesus Christ wrought, are indeed divine works, and admonish the human mind to rise from visible things to the knowledge of God. For since He is not of such substance as can be seen with the eyes, and His miracles whereby He governs the whole world, and provides for all creation, tend, by reason of their constant recurrence, to become cheap in men's esteem; so that almost no one deigns to consider the wonderful and stupendous works of God, displayed in every grain of seed: according to His own mercy He has reserved to Himself certain works to do in suitable time beside the wonted course and order of nature; so that men beholding, not greater but uncommon works, should be struck with wonder, for whom daily things had become cheap.

For the government of the whole world is a greater miracle than the satisfying five thousand men with five loaves: and yet at this no one wonders; at the other, men wonder, not because it is greater, but because it is rare. For who now feeds the whole world, but He who out of a few seeds creates the harvests? He wrought, therefore, as God. For by the same power whereby He multiplies the stores of grain from a few seeds, did He multiply in His hands the five loaves. For power was in the hands of Christ, and those five loaves were as seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.

This, then, was done to admonish the senses, that they might rise to understand the mind, and exercise the eyes of the heart, that in visible works they might acknowledge the invisible God. And it was not enough for us to behold in the miracles only that, which pertained to miracles: we must also search out what this miracle, which Christ wrought, tells us and what it means: for whoever marks the works, may understand some meaning of Christ speaking as it were in them; since the miracle itself is, as we may say, a kind of speech.

What, then, think we that five loaves signify? As far as the meaning which commends itself presents itself to my mind, the five loaves are the five books of Moses. With reason are they not wheaten, but barley loaves; because they belong to the Old Testament. And ye know that barley is so formed that we hardly get at the marrow of it; for that marrow is clothed with a coating of husk, and the husk itself is tenacious and coherent, so that it is stripped off with difficulty. Such is the letter of the Old Testament; clothed with the coverings of carnal sacraments: but yet if we get at its marrow, it feeds and satisfies.

A certain boy, then, brought five loaves and two fishes. If we inquire who this boy was, perhaps it was the people of Israel, which, in a childish sense, carried the food, and ate not. For that which they carried, was a burden to them while closed; but when opened, was food for them. Moreover, the two fishes seem to me to signify those two sublime persons of the Old Testament, who were anointed for sanctifying and ruling the people, the Priest and the King. And at length came in the mystery He who was signified by them, He who was pointed out by the marrow of the barley, He who was concealed under the barley's husk. The same came, one person sustaining the two characters, of Priest and of King.

And what are the fragments, but things which the multitude could not eat? Some secret meanings, then, are to be understood, which the multitude cannot receive; what remains but that they be entrusted to those who are able also to teach others, as were the apostles? For which reason, twelve baskets were filled. A wonderful thing was wrought, and a mighty deed; but if one intently consider it, it is as the works of God. He who out of a few grains multiplies the harvests, multiplied the five loaves in His hands.

Now those men having seen the miracle, said, "This is truly the prophet that is coming into the world:" for perhaps this prophet was meant as one in the nature of Moses. For the Lord had said to Moses, "A prophet will I raise up to them from among their brethren like unto thee." Like, namely, in respect of the flesh, not of majesty. And, indeed, this saying of Moses will be found more fully explained in the gospel, when our Lord spoke of His own words being unbelieved: "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me." It was then, "like unto thee:" Moses fed the people in the desert with manna: this prophet fed the people in the desert with bread; and more bread. The miracle was increased, the prophecy was approved.
