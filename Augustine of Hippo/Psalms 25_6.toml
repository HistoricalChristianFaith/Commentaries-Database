"Remember Your compassions, O Lord" [Psalm 25:6]. Remember the works of Your mercy, O Lord; for men deem of You as though You had forgotten. "And that Your mercies are from eternity." And remember this, that Your mercies are from eternity. For Thou never wast without them, who hast subjected even sinful man to vanity indeed, but in hope; [RomansÂ 8:20] and not deprived him of so many and great consolations of Your creation.
