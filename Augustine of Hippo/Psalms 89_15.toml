In all these things shall we not rejoice? Or shall we contain our joy? Or shall words suffice for our gladness? Or shall the tongue be able to express our rejoicing? If therefore no words suffice, "Blessed is the people, O Lord, that knows glad shouting" [Psalm 89:15]. O blessed people! Do you conceive aright, do you understand, glad shouting? For except thou understand glad shouting, you can not be blessed. What do I mean by understanding glad shouting? Whether you know the source of that rejoicing which is beyond words to express. For this joy is not of yourself, since "he that glories, let him glory in the Lord." [1 Corinthians 1:31] Rejoice not then in your own pride, but in God's grace. See that that grace is such, that the tongue fails to express its greatness, and then you understand glad shouting.
