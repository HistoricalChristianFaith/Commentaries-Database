"His glory is great in Your salvation" [Psalm 21:5]. Great indeed is His glory in the salvation, whereby You have raised Him up again. "Glory and great honour shall Thou lay upon Him." But You shall yet add unto Him glory and great honour, when You shall place Him in heaven at Your right hand.

6. "His glory is great in Thy salvation" (ver. 5). Great indeed is His glory in the salvation, whereby Thou hast raised Him up again. "Glory and great honour shalt Thou lay upon Him." But Thou shalt yet add unto Him glory and great honour, when Thou shall place Him in heaven at Thy right hand.
