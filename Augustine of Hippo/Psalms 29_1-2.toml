The Prophet speaks, "Bring unto the Lord, O you Sons of God, bring unto the Lord the young of rams" [Psalm 29:1]. Bring unto the Lord yourselves, whom the Apostles, the leaders of the flocks, have begotten by the Gospel. [1 Corinthians 4:15] "Bring unto the Lord glory and honour" [Psalm 29:2]. By your works let the Lord be glorified and honoured. "Bring unto the Lord glory to His name." Let Him be made known gloriously throughout the world. "Worship the Lord in His holy court." Worship the Lord in your heart enlarged and sanctified. For you are His regal holy habitation.
