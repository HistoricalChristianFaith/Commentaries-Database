Peter accomplished later on by the grace of God what he had previously been unable to do by self-reliance. You see, after the Lord had entrusted him with his, not Peter’s sheep, to feed them, not for himself but for the Lord, he told him about his future martyrdom, which he had forfeited the first time because he had been in much too much of a hurry. “When you are older,” he said, “someone else will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go. He said this, though, to signify by what death he was going to glorify the Lord.” It came about that Peter arrived at his martyrdom, having washed away his denial with his tears. What had been promised him by the Savior could not be taken away from him by the tempter.

He said, “Follow me,” but not in the same way as when he had previously called the disciples. Then too, certainly, he said, “Follow me.” But then it was to school he was summoning them; now it is to the prize giving.
