In a word, therefore, let us all listen, and seriously reflect what great merit there is in having fed Christ when he was hungry—and what sort of a crime it is to have ignored Christ when he was hungry. Repentance for our sins does indeed change us for the better. But even repentance will not appear to be of much use to us if works of mercy do not accompany it. Truth bears witness to this through John, who said to those who came to him, “Bear fruits that befit repentance.” And so those who haven’t produced such fruits have no reason to suppose that by a barren repentance they will earn pardon for their sins.
