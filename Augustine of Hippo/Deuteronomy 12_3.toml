Give no credit to their words, neither be afraid of them. They say that we are enemies of their idols. So be it; may God give them all into our power, as he has already given us what we have broken down. For I say this, beloved, that you may not attempt to overcome those which it is not lawfully in your power to overcome. It is the way of ill-regulated men and the mad Circumcelliones to be violent when they have no power and to be ever eager to die without cause. You heard what we read to you, all of you who were present in the Mappalia: 2 “When the land shall have been given into your power”—he says first “into your power” and so enjoins what is to be done—“then you shall destroy their altars and break in pieces their groves, and hew down all their images.” When the power has not been given us, do not do it; when it is given, do not neglect it.
