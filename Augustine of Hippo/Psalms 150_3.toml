"Praise Him in the sound of the trumpet" [Psalm 150:3]: on account of the surpassing clearness of note of their praise. "Praise Him in the psaltery and harp." The psaltery praises God from things above, the harp praises God from things below; I mean, from things in heaven, and things in earth, as He who made heaven and earth. We have already in another Psalm, explained that the psaltery has that board, whereon the series of strings rests that it may give a better sound, above, whereas the harp has it below.
