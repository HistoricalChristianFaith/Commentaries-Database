“Then they will see the Son of man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty.” As I see it, this could be taken in two ways. One way is that he will come in the church as in a cloud. He continues to come in this way according to his word, “Hereafter you will see the Son of man sitting on the right hand of the power of God, and coming in the clouds of heaven.” He comes with great power and majesty because his greater power and majesty will appear in the saints to whom he will give great power, so that persecution might not overcome them. The other way in which he will come will be in his body in which he sits at the right hand of the Father. In this body, he died, rose again, and ascended into heaven. It is written in the Acts of the Apostles: “When he had said these things, a cloud received him and he was taken up from their sight.” The angels then said, “He shall so come as you have seen him going away.” We have reason to believe that he will come not only in the same body but also in a cloud since he will come as he left, and a cloud received him as he went.

You say that our very suffering forces us to admit that the end is at hand when there is a fulfillment of what was foretold: “men withering away for fear and expectation of what shall come upon the whole world.” You say, “It is plain that there is no country or place in our time that is not harassed or humbled according to the words ‘for fear and expectation of what shall come upon the whole world.’ ” If the evils that the human race now suffers are clear signs that the Lord is about to come now, what becomes of the apostle’s words: “When they shall say, ‘Peace and security’ ”? When the Gospel said, “men withering away for fear and expectation,” it immediately continued, “For the powers of heaven shall be moved. And then shall they see the Son of man coming in a cloud with great power and majesty.”
