Let then our Lord speak; let Christ with us, whole Christ, speak. "Lord, hear my prayer, receive with Your ears my entreaty" [Psalm 143:1]. "Hear" and "receive with ears" are the same thing. It is repetition, it is confirmation. "In Your truth hear me, in Your righteousness." Take it not without emphasis when it is said, "in Your righteousness." For it is a commendation of grace, that none of us think his righteousness his own. For this is the righteousness of God, which God has given you to possess. For what says the Apostle of them, who would boast of their own righteousness? Speaking of the Jews, he says, "they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge." [RomansÂ 10:2] ...You are perverse, because you impute what you have done ill to God, what well to yourself: you will be right, when you impute what you have done ill to yourself, what well to God....Behold, "in Your righteousness hear me." For when I look upon myself, nought else do I find my own, save sin.
