God approves of that alms which is furnished by just labors, as is written: “Honor the Lord with your labors and sacrifice to him with the fruits of your justice.” For God abominates and refuses that alms which is furnished to him at the cost of another’s tears. What profit accrues to you if one person blesses you while many curse you; what good does an alms bring to you when it is furnished from the possessions of another? In truth, need we fear that God does not have the goods with which you may feed his poor without plundering your neighbor?
