Matthew has expressed that this was said not by themselves, but by their mother, since she brought their wishes to the Lord; wherefore Mark briefly implies rather that they themselves, rather than their mother, had used the words.
Then the Lord both according to Mark, and to Matthew, answered them rather than their mother. For it goes on: “But Jesus said unto them,Ye know not what ye ask.”
