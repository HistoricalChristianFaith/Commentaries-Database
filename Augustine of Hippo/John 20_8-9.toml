Here some, by not giving due attention, suppose that John believed that Jesus had risen again. But there is no indication of this from the words that follow. For what does he mean by immediately adding, “For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead”? He could not then have believed that Jesus had risen again when he did not know that he had to rise again. What then did he see? What was it that he believed? It was nothing else but this, that is, that he saw the sepulcher empty and believed what the woman had said, that is, that Jesus had been taken away from the tomb. “For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that he must rise again from the dead.” In the same way also, when they heard of it from the Lord himself—although uttered in the plainest of terms—yet from their custom of hearing him speaking by parables they did not understand and believed that he meant something else.
