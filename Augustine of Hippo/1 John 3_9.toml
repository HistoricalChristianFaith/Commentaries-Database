Hear intently, I do beseech you, because it is no small matter that we have to cope withal: and I doubt not, because you were intent upon it yesterday, that you have with even greater intentness of purpose come together today. For it is no slight question, how he says in this Epistle, Whosoever is born of God, sins not, 1 John 3:9 and how in the same Epistle he has said above, If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. 1 John 1:8 What shall the man do, who is pressed by both sayings out of the same Epistle? If he shall confess himself a sinner, he fears lest it be said to him, Then are you not born of God; because it is written, Whosoever is born of God, sins not. But if he shall say that he is just and that he has no sin, he receives on the other side a blow from the same Epistle, If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Placed then as he is in the midst, what he can say and what confess, or what profess, he cannot find. To profess himself to be without sin, is full of peril; and not only full of peril, but also full of error: We deceive ourselves, says he, and the truth is not in us, if we say that we have no sin. But oh that you had none, and said this! For then would you say truly, and in uttering the truth would have not so much as a vestige of wrong to be afraid of. But, that you do ill if you say so, is because it is a lie that you say, The truth, says he, is not in us, if we say that we have no sin. He says not, Have not had; lest haply it should seem to be spoken of the past life. For the man here has had sins: but from the time that he was born of God, he has begun not to have sins. If it were so, there would be no question to embarrass us. For we should say, We have been sinners, but now we are justified: we have had sin, but now we have none. He says not this: but what says he? If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. And then after a while he says on the other hand, Whosoever is born of God sins not. Was John himself not born of God? If John was not born of God, John, of whom you have heard that he lay in the Lord's bosom; does any man dare engage for himself that in him has taken place that regeneration which it was not granted to that man to have, to whom it was granted to lie in the bosom of the Lord? The man whom the Lord loved more than the rest, John 13:23 him alone had He not begotten of the Spirit?
Mark now these words. As yet, I am urging it upon you, what straits we are put to that by putting your minds on the stretch, that is, by your praying for us and for yourselves, God may make enlargement, and give us an outlet: lest some man find in His word an occasion of his own perdition, that word which was preached and put in writing only for healing and salvation. Every man, says he, that does sin, does also iniquity. Lest haply you make a distinction, Sin is iniquity. Lest you say, A sinner I am, but not a doer of iniquity, Sin is iniquity. And ye know that to this end was He manifested, that He should take away sin; and there is no sin in Him. And what does it profit us, that He came without sin? Every one that sins not, abides in Him: and every one that sins, has not seen Him, neither known Him. Little children, let no man seduce you. He that does righteousness is righteous, even as He is righteous. This we have already said, that the word as is wont to be used of a certain resemblance, not of equality. He that does sin is of the devil, because the devil sins from the beginning. This too we have already said, that the devil created no man, nor begot any, but his imitators are, as it were, born of him. To this end was the Son of God manifested, that He should undo the works of the devil. Consequently, to undo (or loose) sins, He that has no sin. And then follows: Every one that is born of God does not commit sin; for his seed remains in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of God: 1 John 3:9 he has drawn the cord tight!â€” Belike, it is in regard of some one sin that he has said, Does not sin, not in regard of all sin: that in this that he says, Whoso is born of God, does not sin, you may understand some one particular sin, which that man who is born of God cannot commit: and such is that sin that, if one commit it, it confirms the rest. What is this sin? To do contrary to the commandment. What is the commandment? A new commandment give I unto you, that you love one another. John 13:34 Mark well! This commandment of Christ is called, love. By this love sins are loosed. If this love be not kept, the not holding it is at once a grievous sin, and the root of all sins.
Mark well, brethren; we have brought forward somewhat in which, to them that have good understanding, the question is solved. But do we only walk in the way with them that run more swiftly? Those that walk more slowly must not be left behind. Let us turn the matter every way, in such words as we can, in order that it may be brought within reach of all. For I suppose, brethren, that every man is concerned for his own soul, who does not come to Church without cause, who does not seek temporal things in the Church, who does not come here to transact secular business; but comes here in order that he may lay hold upon some eternal thing, promised unto him, whereunto he may attain: he must needs consider how he shall walk in the way, lest he be left behind, lest he go back, lest he go astray, lest by halting he do not attain. Whoever therefore is in earnest, let him be slow, let him be swift, yet let him not leave the way. This then I have said, that in saying, Whosoever is born of God sins not, it is probable he meant it of some particular sin: for else it will be contrary to that place: If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. In this way then the question may be solved. There is a certain sin, which he that is born of God cannot commit; a sin, which not being committed, other sins are loosed, and being committed, other sins are confirmed. What is this sin? To do contrary to the commandment of Christ, contrary to the New Testament. What is the new commandment? A new commandment give I unto you, that you love one another. John 13:34 Whoso does contrary to charity and contrary to brotherly love, let him not dare to glory and say that he is born of God: but whoso is in brotherly love, there are certain sins which he cannot commit, and this above all, that he should hate his brother. And how fares it with him concerning his other sins, of which it is said, If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us? Let him hear that which shall set his mind at rest from another place of Scripture; Charity covers a multitude of sins. 1 Peter 4:8
Charity therefore we commend; charity this Epistle commends. The Lord, after His resurrection, what question put He to Peter, but, Do you love me? John 21:15-17 And it was not enough to ask it once; a second time also He put none other question, a third time also none other. Although when it came to the third time, Peter, as one who knew not what was the drift of this, was grieved because it seemed as if the Lord did not believe him; nevertheless both a first time and a second, and a third He put this question. Thrice fear denied, thrice love confessed. Behold Peter loves the Lord. What is he to do for the Lord? For think not that he in the Psalm did not feel himself at a loss what to do: What shall I render unto the Lord for all the benefits He has done unto me? He that said this in the Psalm, marked what great things had been done for him by God; and sought what he should render to God, and could find nothing. For whatever you would render, from Him did you receive it to render. And what did he find to offer in return? That which, as we said, my brethren, he had received from Him, that only found he to offer in return. I will receive the cup of salvation, and will call upon the name of the Lord. For who had given him the cup of salvation, but He to whom he wished to offer in return? Now to receive the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord, is to be filled with charity; and so filled, that not only you shall not hate your brother, but shall be prepared to die for your brother. This is perfect charity, that you be prepared to die for your brother. This the Lord exhibited in Himself, who died for all, praying for them by whom He was crucified, and saying, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. Luke 23:34 But if He alone has done this, He was not a Master, if He had no disciples. Disciples who came after Him have done this. Men were stoning Stephen, and he knelt down and said, Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. Acts 7:59 He loved them that were killing him; since for them also he was dying. Hear also the Apostle Paul: And I myself, says he, will be spent for your souls. 2 Corinthians 12:15 For he was among those for whom Stephen, when by their hands he was dying, besought forgiveness. This then is perfect charity. If any man shall have so great charity that he is prepared even to die for his brethren, in that man is perfect charity. But as soon as it is born, is it already quite perfect? That it may be made perfect, it is born; when born, it is nourished; when nourished, it is strengthened; when strengthened, it is perfected; when it has come to perfection, what says it? To me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. I wished to be dissolved, and to be with Christ; which is far better: nevertheless to abide in the flesh is needful for you. Philippians 1:21-24 For their sakes he was willing to live, for whose sakes he was prepared to die.
And that you may know that it is this perfect charity which that man violates not, and against which that man sins not, who is born of God; this is what the Lord says to Peter; Peter do you love me? And he answers, I love. He says not, If you love me, show kindness to me. For when the Lord was in mortal flesh, He hungered, He thirsted: at that time when He hungered and thirsted, He was taken in as a guest; those who had the means, ministered unto Him of their substance, as we read in the Gospel. ZacchÃ¦us entertained Him as his guest: he was saved from his disease by entertaining the Physician. From what disease? The disease of avarice. For he was very rich, and the chief of the publicans. Mark the man made whole from the disease of avarice: The half of my goods I give to the poor; and if I have taken any thing from any man, I will restore him fourfold. Luke 19:8 That he kept the other half, was not to enjoy it, but to pay his debts. Well, he at that time entertained the Physician as his guest, because there was infirmity of the flesh in the Lord, to which men might show this kindness; and this, because it was His will to grant this very thing to them that did Him kind service; for the benefit was to them that did the service, not to Him. For, could He to whom angels ministered require these men's kindness? Not even His servant Elias, to whom He sent bread and flesh by the ravens upon a certain occasion 1 Kings 17:4-9 had need of this; and yet that a religious widow might be blessed, the servant of God is sent, and he whom God in secret did feed, is fed by the widow. But still, although by the means of these servants of God, those who consider their need get good to themselves, in respect of that reward most manifestly set forth by the Lord in the Gospel: He that receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous man's reward: and he that receives a prophet in the name of a prophet shall receive a prophet's reward: and whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you, He shall in no wise lose his reward: Matthew 10:41-42 although, then, they that do this, do it to their own good: yet neither could this kind office be done to Him when about to ascend into Heaven. What could Peter, who loved Him, render unto Him? Hear what. Feed my sheep: i.e. do for the brethren, that which I have done for you. I redeemed all with my blood: hesitate not to die for confession of the truth, that the rest may imitate you.
 But this, as we have said, brethren, is perfect charity. He that is born of God has it. Mark, my beloved, see what I say. Behold, a man has received the Sacrament of that birth, being baptized; he has the Sacrament, and a great Sacrament, divine, holy, ineffable. Consider what a Sacrament! To make him a new man by remission of all sins! Nevertheless, let him look well to the heart, whether that be thoroughly done there, which is done in the body; let him see whether he have charity, and then say, I am born of God. If however he have it not, he has indeed the soldier's mark upon him, but he roams as a deserter. Let him have charity; otherwise let him not say that he is born of God. But he says, I have the Sacrament. Hear the Apostle: If I know all mysteries, and have all faith, so that I can remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. 1 Corinthians 13:2
This, if you remember, we gave you to understand in beginning to read this Epistle, that nothing in it is so commended as charity. Even if it seems to speak of various other things, to this it makes its way back, and whatever it says, it will needs bring all to bear upon charity. Let us see whether it does so here. Mark: Whosoever is born of God does not commit sin. We ask, what sin? Because if you understand all sin, it will be contrary to that place, If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. Then let him say what sin; let him teach us; lest haply I may have rashly said that the sin here is the violation of charity, because he said above, He that hates his brother is in darkness, and walks in darkness, and knows not whither he goes, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 1 John 2:11 But perhaps he has said something in what comes afterwards, and has mentioned charity by name? See that this circuit of words has this end, has this issue. Whosoever is born of God, sins not, because His seed remains in him. 1 John 3:9 The seed of God, i.e. the word of God: whence the apostle says, I have begotten you through the Gospel. And he cannot sin, because he is born of God. 1 Corinthians 4:15

If our circumstances are such that we make some progress in this life by the grace of the Savior, when lust declines and love increases, it is in the next life that we reach perfection, when lust is finally extinguished and love is made perfect. That saying, that whoever is born of God does not sin, is undoubtedly meant to apply to that pure love which alone does not sin. The love in us which is increasing and being perfected also belongs to the new birth from God, but as long as lust continues to exist in us it fights against the law of our mind. As a result, the one who is born of God and who does not obey his own lusts can say that it is no longer he who sins but the sin which dwells in him.

How can we avoid sin? By keeping the commandment of Christ. And what is that commandment? It is that we should love. Love, and sin is undone.
