Yet, though the fact that the angels are the work of God is not omitted here, it is indeed not explicitly mentioned; but elsewhere Holy Scripture asserts it in the clearest manner. For in the Hymn of the Three Children in the Furnace it was said, “O all ye works of the Lord bless ye the Lord;” and among these works mentioned afterwards in detail, the angels are named. And in the psalm it is said, “Praise ye the Lord from the heavens, praise him in the heights. Praise ye him, all his angels; praise ye him, all his hosts. Praise ye him, sun and moon; praise him, all ye stars of light. Praise him, ye heaven of heavens; and ye waters that be above the heavens. Let them praise the name of the Lord; for he commanded, and they were created.”

Now, how that celestial and most blessed company is constituted, how the various ranks differ one from the other, so that, while all the citizens share the general name of angel (as we read in the epistle to the Hebrews: “Now to which of the angels has he ever said: ,‘Sit at my right hand’?,” which shows that all are together called angels), still, there are archangels among them; and whether it is these same archangels who are called hosts, and the passage, “Praise him, all you his angels: praise him, all you his hosts” is to mean “Praise him, all you his angels: praise him, all you his archangels”; and what distinction there is among the four names under which the apostle seems to embrace the whole celestial company: “Whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities or powers”—to these questions let those reply who can, if, that is, they can prove their answers true. I acknowledge my own ignorance of these things. I am not even certain on this point, whether the sun and the moon and the other stars belong to this same company, though some believe these to be merely luminous bodies, without either sensation or intelligence.

Wherefore, though light and darkness are to be taken in their literal signification in these passages of Genesis in which it is said, “God said, Let there be light, and there was light,” and “God divided the light from the darkness,” yet, for our part, we understand these two societies of angels,—the one enjoying God, the other swelling with pride; the one to whom it is said, “Praise ye him, all his angels,” the other whose prince says, “All these things will I give Thee if Thou wilt fall down and worship me;” the one blazing with the holy love of God, the other reeking with the unclean lust of self-advancement. And since, as it is written, “God resisteth the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble,” we may say, the one dwelling in the heaven of heavens, the other cast thence, and raging through the lower regions of the air; the one tranquil in the brightness of piety, the other tempest-tossed with beclouding desires; the one, at God’s pleasure, tenderly succoring, justly avenging,—the other, set on by its own pride, boiling with the lust of subduing and hurting; the one the minister of God’s goodness to the utmost of their good pleasure, the other held in by God’s power from doing the harm it would; the former laughing at the latter when it does good unwillingly by its persecutions, the latter envying the former when it gathers in its pilgrims.
