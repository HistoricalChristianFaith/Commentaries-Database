“Neither will I condemn you.” What is this, O Lord? Do you therefore favor sins? Not so, evidently. Mark what follows: “Go and sin no more.” Therefore the Lord did also condemn, but condemned sins, not the sinner. For if he was a patron of sin, he would say, Neither will I condemn you; go, live as you will; be secure in my deliverance, however much you will to sin. I will deliver you from all punishment even of hell, and from the tormentors of the infernal world. He did not say this. Let them pay attention, then, who love his gentleness in the Lord, and let them fear his truth. For “the Lord is sweet and right.” You love him because he is sweet; fear him because he is right. As the meek one he said, “I held my peace,” but as the just one he said, “Shall I always be silent?” “The Lord is merciful and pitiful.” He certainly is. He is also “long suffering” “and very full of pity.” But most fearful is what comes last, “He is true.” For those whom he now bears with as sinners, he will judge as despisers: “Or do you despise the riches of his long suffering and gentleness; not knowing that the forbearance of God leads you to repentance? But you, after your hardness and impenitent heart, treasure up for yourself wrath against the day of wrath and the revelation of the righteous judgment of God who will render to every man according to his deeds.” The Lord is gentle, the Lord is long suffering, the Lord is full of pity; but the Lord is also just, the Lord is also true. He bestows on you an interval for correction, but you love the delay of judgment more than the amendment of your ways. Were you a bad person yesterday? Today be a good person. Have you gone on in your wickedness today? At any rate, change tomorrow. You always expect and make exceedingly great promises to yourself, [presuming on] the mercy of God. It is as if he, who has promised you pardon through repentance, promised you also a longer life. How do you know what tomorrow may bring? Rightly you say in your heart: When I shall have corrected my ways, God will put all my sins away.… God has promised pardon to anyone who amends his life. But show me where God has promised you a long life.
