See how the pillar of greatest strength has at a single breath of air trembled to its foundations. Where now is all that boldness of the one who made promises and who had such overweening confidence in himself beforehand? What now of those words when he said, “Why can’t I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake.” Is this the way to follow the Master—to deny his own discipleship? Is this the way one lays down his life for the Lord—frightened at a maidservant’s voice that might compel us to the sacrifice? But is it any wonder that God foretold what was true, and human beings presumptuously imagined what was false? Assuredly in this denial of the apostle Peter, which had now entered on its first stage, we ought to take notice that not only is Christ denied by one who says that he is not Christ, but by someone also who, while really a Christian, himself denies that he is so. For the Lord did not say to Peter, “You shall deny that you are my disciple” but “you shall deny me.” He denied him, therefore, when he denied that he was his disciple. And what else did such a form of denial imply but a denial of his own Christianity? … How many afterward, not only old men and women who have had long lives already, but even boys and girls—along with an innumerable company of holy martyrs with brave hearts who by a violent death entered the kingdom of heaven—how many end up doing what at that moment Peter was unable to do who received the keys of that kingdom? It is here we see why it was said, “Let these go their way,” when Jesus, who has redeemed us by his own blood, gave himself for us. It was so that the saying that he spoke might be fulfilled, “Of those whom you have given me, I have lost none.” For assuredly, if Peter had gone away after denying the Christ, what else would have awaited him but destruction?
