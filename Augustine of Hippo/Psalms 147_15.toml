"Who sends forth His Word to the earth" [Psalm 147:15]. Behold, on earth we toil, weary, fainting, sluggish, cold: when should we be raised up to the fat of wheat that satisfies, did not He send His Word to the earth, whereby we were weighed down, to the earth, whereby we were hindered from returning? He sent His Word, He deserted us not even in the wilderness, He rained manna from heaven. "Who sends forth His Word to the earth;" and to earth His Word came. How? Or what is His Word?

What is swiftness itself, brethren?  It is everywhere; it is not in part. This belongs to the Word of God, not to be in part, to be everywhere by Himself the Word, whereby He is "the Power of God and the Wisdom of God," [1 Corinthians 1:24] before He had taken flesh upon Him. If we think of God in the Form of God, the Word equal to the Father, this is the Wisdom of God, of which is said, "It reaches from one end to the other mightily." [Wisdom 8:1] What mighty speed! "It reaches from one end to the other mightily."...
