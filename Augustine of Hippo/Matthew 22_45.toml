Here then there is need for caution, lest Christ himself be thought to have denied that he was the Son of David. He did not deny that he was the Son of David, but he probed his detractors on the particular way this can be. You have said that Christ is the Son of David. I do not deny it. But “if David thus calls him Lord, how is he his Son?” Tell me how he could be his son who is also his Lord? They did not answer him but were dumbfounded.Let us then answer them by the explanation given by Christ himself. Where given? Through his apostle. By what source can we prove that Christ himself has explained it? The apostle says, “Would you receive a proof of Christ who speaks in me?” So it is through the apostle’s voice that Christ has allowed this question to be solved. In the first place, do you remember what Christ said, speaking by the apostle to Timothy? “Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, descended from David. This is my gospel.” So it is easy to see that Christ is the Son of David. But how is he also David’s Lord? Let the apostle again tell us of the one who, “though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped.” Acknowledge David’s Lord. If you acknowledge David’s Lord, our Lord, the Lord of heaven and earth, the Lord of the angels, equal with God, in the form of God, how is he David’s Son? Note what follows. The apostle shows you David’s Lord by saying, “Who being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.” And how is he David’s Son? “But he emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men; and being found in human form, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death, even the death of the cross. Therefore God has also highly exalted him.” Christ “of the seed of David,” the Son of David, rose again because “he emptied himself.” How did he empty himself? By taking upon himself that which he was not, not by losing that which he was. He emptied himself. He “humbled himself.” Though he was God, he appeared as a man. He was despised as he walked on earth, he who made the heaven. He was despised as though a mere man, as though of no power. He was not only despised but also killed! He was that stone that was laid aside on the ground, which the Jews stumbled against and were shaken. And what does he himself say? “He who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, but he on whom it falls, it shall grind him to powder.” First he was laid low, and they stumbled against him. He shall come from above, and he will “grind” them that have been shaken “to powder.”
Thus you have heard that Christ is both David’s Son and David’s Lord: David’s Lord always, David’s Son in time. David’s Lord, born of the substance of his Father; David’s Son, born of the Virgin Mary, conceived by the Holy Spirit. Let us hold fast both. The one of them will be our eternal habitation; the other is our deliverance from our present exile.
