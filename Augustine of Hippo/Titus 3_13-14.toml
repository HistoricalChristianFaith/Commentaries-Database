Nevertheless, after the apostle had said in such instruction and advice: “Now such persons we charge and exhort in the Lord Jesus Christ that they work quietly and eat their own bread,” he was mindful of such needs of the holy persons who, although they would obey his commands to work quietly and eat their own bread, would, for many reasons, lack some provision of such necessary commodities. Hence, with foresight he added immediately: “But you, brothers, do not grow tired of well-doing,” so that those who had the means of furnishing sustenance to the servants of God would not grow careless in this respect. Furthermore, when in writing to Titus he said: “Help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way, taking care that nothing be wanting to them.” He continued thus, in order to show why nothing should be lacking in their regard: “And let the people also learn to excel in good works, in order to meet cases of necessity, that they may not be unfruitful.”
