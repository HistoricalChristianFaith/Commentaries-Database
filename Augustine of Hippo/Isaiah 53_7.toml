[Christ] kept silent while he was concealed, because “in humility his judgment was taken away.” He kept silent while he was concealed, because he was thought to be only human. But as God he will come openly; and as our God, he will not keep silent. So what about you? You were saying, “I want him to come.”

Because he has come hidden, our God, that is, Christ, will come manifest. “And he will not keep silence.” What does it mean, “will not keep silence”? Because he had first kept silence. When did he keep silence? He was judged in order that there might be fulfilled that which the prophet had also predicted: “As a sheep he was led to the slaughter, and as a lamb before his shearer, without voice, so he opened not his mouth.” Therefore, if he were unwilling to suffer, he would not suffer. If he did not suffer, his blood would not be poured forth. If his blood would not be poured forth, the world would not be redeemed.
