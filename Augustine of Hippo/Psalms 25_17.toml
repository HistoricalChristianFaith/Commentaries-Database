"The tribulations of my heart have been multiplied" [Psalm 25:17]. The tribulations of my heart have been multiplied by the abounding of iniquity and the waxing cold of love. [MatthewÂ 24:12] "O bring Thou me out of my necessities." Since I must needs bear this, that by enduring unto the end I may be saved, bring Thou me out of my necessities.
