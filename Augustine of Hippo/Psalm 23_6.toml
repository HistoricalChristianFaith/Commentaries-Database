"And Your mercy shall follow me all the days of my life:" that is, as long as I live in this mortal life, not Yours, but mine. "That I may dwell in the house of the Lord  for length of days" [Psalm 23:6]. Now Your mercy shall follow me not here only, but also that I may dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.
