The Son, born from everlasting of the Father, God from God, does not have equality with the Father by growth but by birth. But the Father is not God from the Son; the Son is God from the Father. Therefore in begetting the Son, the Father “gave” him to be God, in begetting he gave him to be coeternal with himself, in begetting he gave him to be his equal. This is that which is “greater than all.” … That which the Father gave him, that is, to be his Word, to be his only begotten Son, to be the brightness of his light. This is what is “greater than all.” This is why no one is able to take his sheep out of his hand, any more than from his Father’s hand.… If by hand we understand power, the power of the Father and the Son is one, even as their Godhead is one.… If we understand the Son as the hand of the Father, we must think so not in a bodily sense, as if God the Father had limbs, but as the Son being he by whom all things were made. People often call other people “hands” when they make use of them for any purpose. And sometimes a person’s work is itself called his hand, because it is made by his hand, as when someone is said to know his own hand when he recognizes his own handwriting.… In this place, however, “hand” signifies the power of the Father and the Son. Otherwise, if we think that “hand” refers to the Son, we shall be in danger of imagining that if the Father has a hand who is his Son, so then Christ must also have a hand that is his son too.
