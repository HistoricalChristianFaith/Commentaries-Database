"Unto You, O Lord, will I cry, and unto my God will I pray" [Psalm 30:8]. And bringing to mind that time of my trouble and misery, and as it were established therein, I hear the voice of Your First-Begotten, my Head, about to die for me, and saying "Unto You, O Lord, will I cry, and unto My God will I pray."
