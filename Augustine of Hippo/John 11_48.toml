Insincerity speaks in the Pharisees: “If we let him go, the Romans will come and take away our nation and place.” It was not the reality of justice that they wished to have but its name, and they desired to hold on dishonestly to the honor owed to just men and women.

They were afraid of losing temporal things with no thought for that which is eternal and so lost both. For the Romans, after our Lord had suffered and was glorified, did come and take away their place and nation, reducing the one by siege and dispersing the other.… Or they were afraid that if all believed in Christ, none would remain to defend the city of God and the temple against the Romans, since they thought that Christ’s teaching was directed against the temple and their laws.
