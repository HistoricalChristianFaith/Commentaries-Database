"My soul is disquieted on account of myself"  [Psalm 42:6]. Is it disquieted on account of God? It is on my own account it is disquieted. By the Unchangeable it was revived; it is by the changeable it is disquieted. I know that the righteousness of God remains; whether my own will remain steadfast, I know not. For I am alarmed by the Apostle's saying, "Let him that thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall." [1 Corinthians 10:12] Therefore since "there is no soundness in me for myself," there is no hope either for me of myself. "My soul is disquieted on account of myself."..."Therefore I remember You, O Lord, from the land of Jordan, and from the little hill of Hermon." From whence did I remember you? From the "little hill," and from the "land of Jordan." Perhaps from Baptism, where the remission of sins is given. For no one runs to the remission of sins, except he who is dissatisfied with himself; no one runs to the remission of sins, but he who confesses himself a sinner; no one confesses himself a sinner, except by humbling himself before God. Therefore it is from "the land of Jordan I have remembered you, and from the hill;" observe, not "of the great hill," that you may make of the "little hill" a great one: for "whoso exalts himself shall be abased, and whoso humbles himself shall be exalted." If you would also ask the meanings of the names, Jordan means "their descent." Descend then, that you may be "lifted up:" be not lifted up, lest you be cast down. "And the little hill of Hermon." Hermon means "anathematizing." Anathematize yourself, by being displeased with yourself; for if you are pleased with yourself, God will be displeased with you. Because then God gives us all good things, because He Himself is good, not because we are worthy of it; because He is merciful, not because we have in anything deserved it; it is from "the land of Jordan, and from Hermon," that I remember you. And because he so remembers with humility, he shall earn his exaltation to fruition,  for he is not "exalted" in himself, who "glories in the Lord."
