"All that the Father giveth me, shall come unto me, and him that cometh to me, I will in nowise cast out." What is this interior, whither or from whence he is not cast out who hath come thither? A great secret this interior is, a sweet mystery: O interior without weariness, without the bitterness of evil thoughts, without the interruption of temptations and sorrows! Is it not that interior, of which it was said to that servant of God who rejoiced, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"? This interior is that into which the Lord Jesus brings him whom He casts not out.

(Tr. xxv. 14) But, because ye have seen Me, and believed not, I have not therefore lost the people of God: All that the Father giveth Me, shall come unto Me; and him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.

(Tr. xxv. 14) That inner place, whence there is no casting out, is a great sanctuary, a secret chamber, where is neither weariness, or the bitterness of evil thoughts, or the cross of pain and temptation: of which it is said, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. (Mat. 25)
