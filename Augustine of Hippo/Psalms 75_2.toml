And he says what? "When I shall have received," he says, "the time,  I will judge justices" [Psalm 75:2]. When shall He judge justices? When He shall have received the time. Not yet is the precise time. Thanks to His mercy: He first preaches justices, and then He judges justices. For if He willed to judge before He willed to preach, who would be found that should be delivered: who would meet Him that should be absolved? Now therefore is the time of preaching: "I will tell," he says, "all Your marvellous works." Hear Him telling, hear Him preaching: for if you shall have despised Him, "when I shall have received the time," He says, "I will judge justices." I forgive, He says, now sins to one confessing, I will not spare hereafter one despising....He has received a time as Son of Man; He does govern times as Son of God. Hear how as Son of Man He has received the time of judging. He says in the Gospel, "He has given to Him power to execute judgment, because Son of Man He is." [John 5:27] According to His nature as Son of God, He has never received power of judging, because He never lacked the power of judging: according to His nature as Son of Man He has received a time, as of being born, and of suffering, as of dying, and of rising again, and of ascending, so of coming and of judging. In Him His Body also says these words, for not without them He will judge. For He says in the Gospel, "You shall sit upon twelve thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel." [Matthew 19:28] Therefore whole Christ says, that is, Head and Body in the Saints, "when I shall have received the time, I will judge justices."
