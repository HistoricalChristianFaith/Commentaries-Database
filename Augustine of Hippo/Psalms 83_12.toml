"All their princes, who said, Let us take to ourselves the sanctuary of God in possession" [Psalm 83:12]. This is that vain noise, with which, as said above, Your enemies have made a murmuring. But what must be understood by "the sanctuary of God," except the temple of God? As says the Apostle: "For the temple of God is holy,  which temple you are." [1 Corinthians 3:17] For what else do the enemies aim at, but to take into possession, that is, to make subject to themselves the temple of God, that it may give in to their ungodly wills?
