But I am surprised that you think it possible for the sound of that voice which said, “You are my Son,” to be produced by the divine will acting on physical nature without the agency of a living being, and you do not think it possible for the physical appearance of any living creature and of movement like that of life to be produced by the divine will in the same way without the agency of any animal life-principle. If created nature obeys God without the actions of a vivifying soul, so that sounds are uttered such as are usually uttered by a living body and the form of articulate speech is brought to the ears, why should it not obey him so that without the agency of a vivifying soul the form and movement of a bird should be presented to the sight by the same power of the Creator?… Therefore, there is no need to inquire how the corporeal appearance of the dove was produced, just as we do not inquire how the words of an articulate body produce their sound. For, if it were possible for a soul not to be the medium by which a voice is said to have been made audible and not as a voice usually is, how much more possible was it when the dove was spoken of that this word should signify merely a physical appearance presented to the eyes without the actual nature of a living creature! These words, also, were said in that sense, “And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a mighty wind coming, and there appeared to them parted tongues as it were of fire,” where a certain phenomenon is said to be “as of a wind” and “as it were” a visible fire, like the natural fire with its customary nature, but it does not seem to mean that natural fire of the customary kind was produced.
