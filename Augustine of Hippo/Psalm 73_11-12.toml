"And they said, How has God known, and is there knowledge in the Most High?" [Psalm 73:11]. See through what thought they pass. Behold unjust men are happy, God does not care for things human. Does He indeed know what we do? See what things are being said. We are inquiring, brethren, "How has God known," etc. (no longer let Christians say it). For how does it appear to you that God knows not, and that there is no knowledge in the Most High? He replies, "Lo! Themselves they are sinners, and in the world they have gotten abundant riches" [Psalm 73:12]. Both sinners they are, and in the world they have gotten abundant riches. He confessed that he willed not to be a sinner in order that he might have riches. A carnal soul for things visible and earthly would have sold its justice. What sort of justice is that which is retained for the sake of gold, as if gold were a more precious thing than justice herself, or as if when a man denies the deposit of another man's goods, he to whom he denied them should suffer a greater loss, than he that denies them to him. The former does lose a garment, the latter fidelity. "Lo! They are themselves sinners, and in the world they have gotten abundant riches." On this account therefore God knows not, and on this account there is no knowledge in the Most High.
