"They shall be delivered unto the hands of the sword" [Psalm 63:10]. In truth, thus it has visibly befallen them, they have been taken by storm by enemies breaking in. "Portions of foxes they shall be." Foxes he calls the kings of the world, that then were when Judæa was conquered. Hear in order that you may know and perceive, that those he calls foxes. Herod the king the Lord Himself has called a fox. "Go," He says, "and tell that fox." [Luke 13:32] See and observe, my brethren: Christ as King they would not have, and portions of foxes they have been made. For when Pilate the deputy governor in Judæa slew Christ at the voices of the Jews, he said to the same Jews, "Your King shall I crucify?" [John 19:15] Because He was called King of the Jews, and He was the true King. And they rejecting Christ said, "We have no king but Cæsar." They rejected a Lamb, chose a fox: deservedly portions of foxes they were made.
