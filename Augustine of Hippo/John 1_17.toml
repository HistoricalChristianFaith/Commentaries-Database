Death was the punishment of sins. The gift of mercy was in the Lord, not the punishment of sin.… And so the chain of sin shall not hold you forever, because the temporal death of your Lord defeated your eternal death. The same is grace, my brothers, the same is truth, because it is not only promised but also made known.This grace was not in the Old Testament, because the law threatened but did not bring aid; commanded but did not heal; made known but did not take away our feebleness. Instead it prepared the way for that physician who was to come with grace and truth. He is the kind of physician who, when about to come to anyone to cure him, might first send his servant so that he might find the sick person bound. He was not healthy; he did not wish to be made healthy and just in case he should be made healthy, he boasted that he was so. The law was sent; it bound him. He finds himself accused, so now he cries out against the bondage. The Lord comes, cures with somewhat bitter and sharp medicines. For he says to the sick, “Bear.” He says, “Endure.” He says, “Do not love the world, have patience, let the fire of continence cure you, let your wounds endure the sword of persecutions.” Were you greatly terrified although bound? He, free and unbound, drank what he gave to you. He first suffered that he might console you, saying, as it were, that which you fear to suffer for yourself, I first suffer for you. This is grace, and great grace. Who can praise it in a worthy manner?
