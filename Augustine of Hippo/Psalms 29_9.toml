"The Voice of the Lord perfecting the stags"  [Psalm 29:9]. For the Voice of the Lord has first perfected them that overcame and repelled the envenomed tongues.  "And will reveal the woods." And then will He reveal to them the darknesses of the Divine books, and the shadowy depths of the mysteries, where they feed with freedom. "And in His temple does every man speak of His glory." And in His Church all born again to an eternal hope praise God, each for His own gift, which He has received from the Holy Spirit.
