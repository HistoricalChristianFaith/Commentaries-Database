“Some of those measures do not succeed,” you say. Is a remedy, then, to be discontinued because the illness of some patients is incurable? You are looking at those who are so hardened that they are not affected by such correction. Concerning these it has been written: “In vain have I struck your children. They have not received correction.” - "Letter 13.93"
