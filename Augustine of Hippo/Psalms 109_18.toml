"Let it be unto him as the cloak which covers him" [Psalm 109:18]. Since he has before spoken of the cloak, why does he repeat it? When he said, "He clothed himself with cursing as with a raiment;" does the raiment with which he is "covered" differ from that with which he is "clothed"? For every man is clothed with his tunic, covered with his cloak; and what is this, save boasting in iniquity, even in the sight of men? "and as the girdle," he says, "that he is always girded withal." Men are girded chiefly that they may be better fit for toil, that they may not be hindered by the folds of their dress. He therefore girds himself with curses, who designs an evil which he has carefully contrived, not on a sudden impulse, and who learns in such a manner to do evil, that he is always ready to commit it.
