They placed their hope in corruptible things, and therefore their hope will become vain, whereas our hope will then become reality. So that God’s promise to us would remain whole, fixed and certain, let us say with hearts full of faith, “Do not destroy in the end.” Do not fear, therefore, that some power might ruin the promises of God. God will not spoil them, because he is true. And there is no one more powerful than him who could cause them to fail.
