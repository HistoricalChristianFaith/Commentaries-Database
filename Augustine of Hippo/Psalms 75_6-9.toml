Thus, after the psalm had said, “Do not lift your horn on high or speak iniquity against God,” it went on immediately. “Since neither from the east nor the west, nor from the mountain deserts; since God is judge he humbles this one and that one he exalts.” He sees two people, that is, two kinds of people. So which two people does he see? One full of pride, the other confessing; one speaking justly, the other speaking unjustly. Who is speaking justly? The one who says “I have sinned.” And who is speaking unjustly? The one who says “It is not I who sinned, it is my luck that sinned, my fate that sinned.” So when you see two people, one speaking equity, the other iniquity, one humble, the other proud, do not be surprised that it goes on to say, “Since God is judge, he humbles this one and that one he exalts.”
