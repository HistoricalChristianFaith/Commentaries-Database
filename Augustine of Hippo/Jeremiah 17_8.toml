No, I say that either before the law, or in the time of the Old Testament, they were freed from sins, not by their own power, because “cursed is everyone who has put his hope in humankind,” and without any doubt those are under this curse whom also the sacred psalm notifies, “who trust in their own strength,” nor by the old covenant that gives birth to bondage … but I say that they were freed by the blood of the Redeemer, who is the one Mediator of God and people, the Christ Jesus. - "Against Two Letters of the Pelagians 1.12"
