As also in twenty-four hours the whole world moves round and receives light, so the mystery of enlightening the world by the Gospel of the Trinity, is hinted at in the seventy-two disciples. For three times twenty-four makes seventy-two. Now as no one doubts that the twelve Apostles foreshadowed the order of Bishops, so also we must know that these seventy-two represented the presbytery, (that is, the second order of priests.) Nevertheless, in the earliest times of the Church, as the Apostolicalwritings bear witness, both were called presbyters, troth also c ailed bishops, the former of these signifying &#8220;ripeness of wisdom,&#8221; the latter, &#8220;diligence in the pastoral care.&#8221;
