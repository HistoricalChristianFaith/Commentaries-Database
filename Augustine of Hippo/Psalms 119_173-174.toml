"Let Your hand be stretched forth (fiat, be made) to save me, for I have chosen Your commandments" [Psalm 119:173]. That I might not fear, and that not only might my heart hold fast, but my tongue also utter Your words: "I have chosen Your commandments," and have stifled fear with love. Let Your hand therefore be stretched forth, to save me from another's hand. Thus God saved the Martyrs, when He permitted them not to be slain in their souls: for "vain is the safety of man"  in the flesh. The words, "Let Your hand be made," may also be taken to mean Christ the Hand of God...Certainly where we read the following words, "I have longed for Your salvation, O Lord" [Psalm 119:174]: even if all our foes be reluctant, let Christ the Salvation of God occur to us: the righteous men of old confess that they longed for Him, the Church longed for His destined coming from His mother's womb, the Church longs for His coming at His Father's right hand. Subjoined to this sentence are the words, "And Your law is my meditation:" for the Law gives testimony unto Christ.
