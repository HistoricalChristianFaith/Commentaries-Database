"For the Lord knows the way of the righteous" [Psalm 1:6]. As it is said, medicine knows health, but knows not disease, and yet disease is recognised by the art of medicine. In like manner can it be said that "the Lord knows the way of the righteous," but the way of the ungodly He knows not. Not that the Lord is ignorant of anything, and yet He says to sinners, "I never knew you." [MatthewÂ 7:23] "But the way of the ungodly shall perish;" is the same as if it were said, the way of the ungodly the Lord knows not. But it is expressed more plainly that this should be not to be known of the Lord, namely, to "perish;" and this to be known of the Lord, namely, to "abide;" so as that to be should appertain to the knowledge of God, but to His not knowing not to be. For the Lord says, "I Am that I Am," and, "I Am has sent me."
