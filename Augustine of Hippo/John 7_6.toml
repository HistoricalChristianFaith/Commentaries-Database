They advised him to pursue glory and not allow himself to remain in concealment and obscurity, appealing to altogether worldly and secular motives.… But our Lord was laying down another road to that very exaltation, that is, humility.… “My time,” he says, that is, the time of my glory when I shall come to judge on high is not yet come; but your time, that is, the glory of the world, is always ready.… And let us, who are the Lord’s body, when insulted by the lovers of this world, say, your time is ready: ours is not yet come.
