"And He blessed them, and they were multiplied exceedingly, and their cattle were not diminished" [Psalm 107:38]. This stands. For "the foundation of God stands sure; because the Lord knows them that are His." [2 Timothy 2:19] They are called "beasts of burden," and "cattle," that walk simply in the Church, yet are useful; not much learned, but full of faith. Therefore, whether spiritual or carnal, "He blessed them."
