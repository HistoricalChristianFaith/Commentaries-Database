And what occupation will she have from then on, her labors being ended? “And her husband will be praised in the gates.” That will be the haven of our labors, to see God and praise God. There they will not say, “Get up, work, clothe the servants, clothe yourself too, put on your best purple, give food to the maids, see that the lamp does not go out, be thorough, get up at night, open your hand to the poor, draw the thread from the distaff to the spindle.” There will not be any works of necessity, because there will not be any necessity. There will not be any works of mercy, because there will not be any misery. You will not break your bread to the poor, because no one will be begging. You will not take in the stranger, because everyone will be living in their own home country. You will not visit the sick, because everyone will be in good health for all eternity. You will not clothe the naked, because everyone will be clothed in eternal light. You will not bury the dead, because everyone will be living life without end.You will not, however, be doing nothing, just because you are not doing any of this. For you will see the One you have desired, and you will praise him without weariness or fatigue. That is the fruit you will receive. Then will come to pass that one thing you have asked for: “One thing I have asked from the Lord, this will I seek: to dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life.” And what will you do there? “To contemplate the delight of the Lord.” And her husband will be praised in the gates. “Blessed are those who dwell in your house, they will praise you forever and ever.”
