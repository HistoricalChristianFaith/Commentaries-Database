“Behold, truly an Israelite in whom there is no guile” is something said neither to Andrew, nor Peter nor to Philip. It was said to Nathanael.… What do we make of it then, brothers? Ought he to have been first among the apostles? Not only is he not found to be first among the apostles, but Nathanael is neither in the middle nor last among the Twelve, Nathanael, to whom the Son of God bore such great witness, saying, “Behold, truly an Israelite in whom there is no guile.”Is the reason asked? As far as the Lord makes known, we find a probable answer. For we ought to understand that Nathanael himself was educated and skilled in the law. Therefore the Lord did not wish to place him among the disciples because he chose unlearned men whereby he might confound the world.
