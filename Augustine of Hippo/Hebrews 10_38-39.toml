“Faith working through love,” comes not so much by fearing punishment as by loving justice. Still, as the soul does not become just except by sharing in the better one who justifies the ungodly—for what has it that it has not received?43—it ought not to glory as if it had not received it, by attributing to itself what comes from God. That is why it was said to him, “Be not high-minded, but fear.” And that fear is also commanded for those who live by faith and are heirs of the new covenant, being “called to freedom.”

“No man living is righteous before you,” yet “the righteous one lives by faith.” The saints are clad in justice, one more, another less; yet no one lives here without sin. In this also, one more, another less, but he is best who has least sin.

What is closer to your ears than a heart that is penitent and a life founded on faith?

Will there be any of us bold enough to say, “I am just”? I assume, after all, that “I am just” amounts to the same thing as “I am not a sinner.” … Here we are with people who have been justified from their sins. We can’t deny it. There remains, however, the struggle with the flesh, there remains the struggle with the world, there remains the struggle with the devil. When you are struggling, you sometimes hit, sometimes you get hit; sometimes you win, sometimes you’re done for; it remains to be seen how you leave the stadium. Because “If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” Again, if we say we have no justice at all, we are telling a lie about God’s gifts. You see, if we have no justice at all, we have no faith either; and if we have not faith, we are not Christians. But if we do have faith, we already have at least some justice. Do you want to know how much that “some” is? The just live by faith. The just, I repeat, live by faith, because they believe what they cannot see.

This justice is the grace of the New Testament, by which the faithful are just while they live by faith until, by the perfection of justice, they are brought to the face-to-face vision, as they are also equally brought to immortality of the body itself by the perfection of salvation. Hence, in another place the apostle says, “So we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We beseech you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.” And then he adds, “For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin”—that is, a sacrifice for sin, for in that law offerings made for sins were called sin—“so that in him we might become the righteousness of God,” that is, in his body, which is the church, of which he is the head, that we may be the justice of God.
