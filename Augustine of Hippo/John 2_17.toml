He then is eaten up with zeal for God’s house who desires to correct all that he sees wrong there. And if he cannot correct it, he endures and mourns.… Let the zeal for God’s house consume every Christian wherever he or she is a member.… In your house you busy yourself in trying to prevent things going wrong. In the house of God, where salvation is offered, ought you to be indifferent?… Do you have a friend? Admonish him gently; a wife or husband? Admonish them too.… Do what you are able, according to your station.
