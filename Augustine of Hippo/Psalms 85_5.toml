"Be not angry with us for ever" [Psalm 85:5]. For by the anger of God we are subject to death, and by the anger of God we eat bread on this earth in want, and in the sweat of our face. [Genesis 3:19] This was Adam's sentence when he sinned: and that Adam was every one of us, for "in Adam all die;" [1 Corinthians 15:22] the sentence passed on him has taken effect after him on us. For we were not yet ourselves, but we were in Adam: therefore whatever happened to Adam himself took effect on us also, so that we should die: for we all were in him....So far as this the sin of your father hurts you not, if you have changed yourself, even as it would not hurt your father if he had changed himself. But that which our stock has received unto its subjection to death, it has derived from Adam. What has it so derived? That frailty of the flesh, this torture of pains, this house of poverty, this chain of death, and snares of temptations; all these things we carry about in this flesh; and this is the anger of God, because it is the vengeance of God. But because it was so to be, that we should be regenerated, and by believing should be made new, and all that mortality was to be removed in our resurrection, and the whole man was to be restored in newness; "For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive;" [1 Corinthians 15:22] seeing this the Prophet says, "Be not angry with us for ever, nor stretch out Your wrath from one generation to another." The first generation was mortal by Your wrath: the second generation shall be immortal by Your mercy....
