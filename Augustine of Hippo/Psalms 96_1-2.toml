Rightly, then, are we stirred by the voice of the psalmist as by the sound of a heavenly trumpet, when we hear, "Sing to the Lord a new canticle; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord and bless his name." Let us recognize, then, and proclaim the "Day born of the day" who became incarnate on this day. The Day is the Son born of the Father, the eternal Day, God of God, Light of Light; he is our salvation, of whom the psalmist says elsewhere, "May God have mercy on us and bless us: may he cause the light of his countenance to shine on us. That we may know your way on earth; your salvation in all nations." The idea expressed in "on the earth" he expanded to "in all nations" and the significance of "your way" he repeated in "your salvation." We recall that the Lord said, "I am the way." And only recently, when the Gospel was read, we heard that the thrice-blessed old man, Simeon, had received a divine promise that he would not experience death until he had seen Christ the Lord and that, when he had taken the infant Christ into his hands and had recognized the mighty little One, he said, "Now dismiss your servant, O Lord, according to your word, in peace, because my eyes have seen your salvation." Gladly, then, let us announce his salvation, this Day born of the eternal Day, let us declare "his glory among the Gentiles, his wonders among all people." He lies in a manger, but he holds the world in his hand; he is nourished at the breast, but he feeds the angels; he is wrapped in swaddling clothes, but he clothes us with immortality; he is suckled but is adored; he does not find room in the inn, but he makes a temple for himself in the hearts of believers. For Strength took on weakness that weakness might become strong. Therefore, let us marvel at rather than despise his human birth; from it let us learn the lowliness that such loftiness assumed for our sake. Then let us enkindle our love so that we may come to his eternal day.
