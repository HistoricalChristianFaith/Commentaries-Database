"I will cry to God most high" [Psalm 57:2]. If most high He is, how hears He you crying? Confidence has been engendered by experience: "to God," he says, "who had done good to me." If before that I was seeking Him, He did good to me, when I cry shall He not hearken to me? For good to us the Lord God has done in sending to us our Saviour Jesus Christ, that He might die for our offenses, and rise again for our justification. [RomansÂ 4:25] For what sort of men has He willed His Son to die? For ungodly men. But ungodly men were not seeking God, and have been sought of God. For He is Most High in such sort, as that not far from Him is our misery and our groaning: because "near is the Lord to them that have bruised the heart."  "God that has done good to me."
