But since St. Luke mentions that great things had been already done by Him, which he knows he had not yet related, what is more evident than that he knowingly anticipated the relation of them. For he had not proceeded so far beyond our Lord's baptismas that he should be supposed to have forgotten that he had not y et related any of those thingsv, which were done in Capernaum.
