Then how does he speak of the earth? He said this about human beings. So far as relates to their being human, they are of earth and speak of the earth. And when human beings speak divine things it is because they are enlightened by God. For if they were not enlightened, they would be earth speaking of earth. God’s grace is one thing, the nature of human beings is another … as the apostle says, “Yet not I, but the grace of God that is with me.” … Thus John, as regards John, is of the earth and speaks of the earth. Whatever you have heard from John that is divine comes from him who enlightens, not him who receives.
