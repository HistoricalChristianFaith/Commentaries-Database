"I have thought upon Your Name, O Lord, in the night-season, and have kept Your law" [Psalm 119:55]. Night is that low estate wherein is the trouble of mortality; night is in the proud who deal exceeding wickedly; night is the fear for the ungodly who forsake the law of the Lord; night is, lastly, the house of this pilgrimage, "until the Lord come, and bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then shall every man have praise of God." [1 Corinthians 4:5] In this night, therefore, man ought to remember the Name of the Lord; "So that he who glories, may glory in the Lord." [1 Corinthians 1:31]
