He next adds: "I am Yours: O save me, for I have sought Your righteousnesses" [Psalm 119:94]. We must not understand lightly the words, "I am Yours." For what is not His?  Why then is it that the Psalmist has commended himself unto God somewhat in a more familiar sense, in these words, "I am Yours: O save me;" save because he wished it to be understood that he had desired to be his own only to his harm, which is the first and the greatest evil of disobedience? And as if he should say, I wished to be my own, and I lost myself: "I am Yours," he says, "O save me, for I have sought Your righteousnesses;" not my own inclinations, whereby I was my own, but "Your righteousnesses," that I might now be Yours.
