Compare [John’s] other words: “The hour is coming, and now is here, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live”—implying that the rest of the dead (who do not hear) will “not come to life.” The added clause, “until the thousand years were finished,” means that during that time “the rest of the dead” did “not come to life” as they should by passing over from death to life. Therefore, in the day of the body’s resurrection, they will go forth from their tombs, not to life but to “judgment,” meaning that condemnation that is called the second death. Anyone at all who will have failed to “come to life” during this millennium, this whole era of the first resurrection, by not hearing “the voice of the Son of God” and by not passing from death to life will certainly, when the second and bodily resurrection comes, pass to the second death, body and soul together.

Anyone who thus participates [in the first resurrection] is one who not only rises from the death of sin but also perseveres in his newfound life. “Over these,” says John, “the second death has no power.” Therefore, it has power over all the others of whom he said above: “The rest of the dead did not come to life till the thousand years were finished.” They may have lived long enough in their bodies, in the period John calls the “thousand years,” but they did not rise from the binding death of their ungodliness. If they had, they would have shared in the first resurrection and thus escaped the power of the second death.

Whoever are not liberated from that mass of perdition (brought to pass through the first man) by the one Mediator between God and humankind, they will also rise again, each in his own flesh, but only that they may be punished together with the devil and his angels. Whether these people will rise again with all their faults and deformities, with their diseased and deformed members—is there any reason for us to labor such a question? For obviously the uncertainty about their bodily form and beauty need not weary us, since their damnation is certain and eternal. And let us not be moved to inquire how their body can be incorruptible if it can suffer—or corruptible if it cannot die. For there is no true life unless it be lived in happiness; no true incorruptibility save where health is unscathed by pain. But where an unhappy being is not allowed to die, then death itself, so to say, dies not; and where pain perpetually afflicts but never destroys, corruption goes on endlessly. This state is called, in the Scripture, “the second death.”
