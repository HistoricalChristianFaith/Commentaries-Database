Ep. 199, 1: The temper of this servant is shown in his behaviour, which is thus expressed by his good Master; his tyranny, “and shall begin to beat his fellow servants,” his sensuality, “and to eat and drink with the drunken.” So that when be said, “My Lord delayeth His coming,” he is not to be supposed to speak from desire to see the Lord, such as was that of him who said, ?My soul is athirst for the living God; when shall I come?” This shows that hewas grieved at the delay, seeing that what was hastening towards him seemed tohis longing desires to be coming slowly.
