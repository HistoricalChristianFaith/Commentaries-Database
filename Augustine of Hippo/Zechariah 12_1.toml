I do not want anyone to tell me that this view [that God condemns innocent souls] should be supported by the passage “who formed the spirit of man in him” and “who made the heart of every one of them.” Something supremely strong and invincible is needed to force me to believe that God condemns any souls without any guilt of theirs. It is either as great a thing, or it is, perhaps greater, to create as to form, yet it is written, “Create a clean heart in me, O God.” This is no argument for thinking that the soul in this passage prays to be made before it had any being. As, therefore, while now existing, it is created by renewal of its justice, so, while now existing, it is formed by the shaping force of doctrine.

Hence we ought to understand this passage so that we do not take the words “he breathed into him the breath of life, and he became a living soul” to mean that a part, as it were, of the nature of God was turned into the soul of man. Thus we are not forced to say that the nature of God is mutable. It is especially in this error that the truth weighs down upon these Manichaeans. For as pride is the mother of all the heretics, they dared to say that the soul is the nature of God. And thus they are under pressure from us when we say to them, “Then the nature of God errs and is unhappy and is corrupted by the stain of vices and sins, or is, as you say, soiled by the filth of the opposing nature,” and other such things that it is wicked to believe about the nature of God. For in another passage Scripture clearly says that the soul was made by almighty God and that it is therefore not a part of God or the nature of God. There the prophet says, “He who formed the spirit for all men made all things,” and in another place it says, “He who formed the spirit of man is in him.” These testimonies clearly prove that the spirit of man was made. In Scripture the rational part of man’s soul by which he differs from the beasts and rules over them by the law of nature is called the spirit of man. On this the apostle says, “No one knows what pertains to man except the spirit of man which is within him.” If these testimonies were not clear proof that the soul of man was made, there would be no lack of those who would say that the spirit of man was not made and who would think that it is the nature of God and say that part of God was changed into it, when there took place that breathing forth by God. Healthy doctrine likewise rejects this, because the spirit of man itself is at times in error and at times thinks wisely; thus it proclaims that it is mutable, and it is in no way permissible to believe this of the nature of God. But there cannot be a greater sign of pride than that the human soul says that it is what God is, while it still groans under such great burdens of vice and unhappiness.
