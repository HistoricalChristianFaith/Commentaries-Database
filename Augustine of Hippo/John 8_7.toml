And then he who had come to forgive sins said, "Whichever of you knows himself to be without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her." What a splendid answer or rather suggestion! If they had been prepared to throw a single stone at the sinner, they would have received the prompt rejoinder, "The judgment you judge with shall be pronounced on you." You have condemned; condemned you shall be.They, however, even if they would not acknowledge their Creator, knew their own consciences. Turning one after the other, they too in their confusion unwilling to look each other in the face, from the eldest to the youngest—that is what the Evangelist said—all went out. The Holy Spirit, you see, had said, "They have all turned aside, all alike have become unprofitable; there is not one who does good, no not even one."

(Tract. xxxiii. 5) He did not say, Stone her not, lest He should seem to speak contrary to the law. But God forbid that He should say, Stone her; for He came not to destroy that which He found, but to seek that which was lost. What then did He answer? He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. This is the voice of justice. Let the sinner be punished, but not by sinners; the law carried into effect, but not by transgressors of the law.
