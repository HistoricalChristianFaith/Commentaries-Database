And then he who had come to forgive sins said, “Whichever of you knows himself to be without sin, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.” What a splendid answer or rather suggestion! If they had been prepared to throw a single stone at the sinner, they would have received the prompt rejoinder, “The judgment you judge with shall be pronounced on you.” You have condemned; condemned you shall be.They, however, even if they would not acknowledge their Creator, knew their own consciences. Turning one after the other, they too in their confusion unwilling to look each other in the face, from the eldest to the youngest—that is what the Evangelist said—all went out. The Holy Spirit, you see, had said, “They have all turned aside, all alike have become unprofitable; there is not one who does good, no not even one.”
