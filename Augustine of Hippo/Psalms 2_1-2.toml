"Why do the heathen rage, and the people meditate vain things?" [Psalm 2:1]. "The kings of the earth have stood up, and the rulers taken counsel together, against the Lord, and against His Christ" [Psalm 2:2]. It is said, "why?" as if it were said, in vain. For what they wished, namely, Christ's destruction, they accomplished not; for this is spoken of our Lord's persecutors, of whom also mention is made in the Acts of the Apostles. [ActsÂ 4:26]
