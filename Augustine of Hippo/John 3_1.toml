He had said above that, when He was at Jerusalem many believed in His Name, when they saw the miracles which He did. Of this number was Nicodemus, of whom we are told; There was a man of the Pharisees, Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
Nicodemus was one of the number who believed, but werenot as yet born again. Wherefore he came to Jesus by night. Whereas those who are born of water and the Holy Spirit, are addressed by the Apostle, You were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord.
What the ground of his belief was, is plain from what immediately follows: For no one can do these miracles that You do, except God be with him. Nicodemus then was one of the many who believed in His Name, when they saw the signs that He did.
Those then are the persons to whom Jesus commits Himself, those born again, who come not in the night to Jesus, as Nicodemus did. Such persons immediately make profession.
