"We have become," he says, "a reproach to our neighbours" [Psalm 79:4]. Therefore precious not in the sight of men, from whom this reproach was, but "precious  in the sight of the Lord is the death of His saints."  "A scoffing and derision:" or, as some have interpreted it, "a mockery to them that are in our circuit." It is a repetition of the former sentence. For that which above has been called, "a reproach," the same has been repeated in, "a scoffing and derision:" and that which above has been said in, "to our neighbours," the same has been repeated in, "to them that are in our circuit." Moreover, in reference to the earthly Jerusalem, the neighbours, and those in the circuit of that nation, are certainly understood to be other nations. But in reference to the free Jerusalem our mother, [Galatians 4:26] there are neighbours even in the circuit of her, among whom, being her enemies, the Church dwells in the circuit of the round world.
