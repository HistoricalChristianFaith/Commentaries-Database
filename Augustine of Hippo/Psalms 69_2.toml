"Fixed I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance" [Psalm 69:2]. What called the clay? Is it those very persons that have persecuted? For out of clay man has been made. [Genesis 2:7] But these men by falling from righteousness have become the clay of the deep, and whosoever shall not have consented to them persecuting and desiring to draw him to iniquity, out of his clay does make gold. For the clay of the same shall merit to be converted into a heavenly form,  and to be made associate of those of whom says the Title of the Psalm, "in behalf of them that shall be changed." But at the time when these were the clay of the deep, I stuck in them: that is, they held Me, prevailed against Me, killed Me. "Fixed" then "I am in the clay of the deep, and there is no substance." What is this, "there is no substance"? Can it be that clay itself is not a substance? What is then, "fixed I am"? Can it be that Christ has thus stuck? Or has He stuck, and was not, as has been said in the book of Job, "the earth delivered into the hands of the ungodly man"? [Job 9:24] Was He fixed in body, because it could be held, and suffered even crucifixion? For unless with nails He had been fixed, crucified He had not been. Whence then "there is no substance"? Is that clay not a substance? But we shall understand, if it be possible, what is, "and there is no substance," if first we shall have understood what is a substance. For there is substance spoken of even of riches, as we say, he has substance, and he has lost substance....

Previously, you see, when [Christ] was showing us an example of humility in the flesh, it was said with reference to his passion that the waves of the sea rose mightily against him, to which he yielded voluntarily for our sakes, so fulfilling the prophecy, "I came into the depth of the sea, and the tempest overwhelmed me." Thus he did not rebut the false witnesses or the savage roar of the crowd, "Have him crucified!" He did not use his power to quell the raging hearts and stop the mouths of the furious mob, but he bore it all with patience. They did to him whatever they wanted, because "he became obedient unto death, even death on a cross."
