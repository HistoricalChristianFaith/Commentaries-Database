"Hear My righteousness, O God, consider My supplication" [Psalm 17:1]. "Hearken unto My prayer, not in deceitful lips:" not going forth to You in deceitful lips. "Let My judgment from Your countenance go forth" [Psalm 17:2]. From the enlightening of the knowledge of You, let Me judge truth. Or at least, let My judgment go forth, not in deceitful lips, from Your countenance, that is, that I may not in judging utter anything else than I understand in You. "Let My eyes see equity:" the eyes, of course, of the heart.
