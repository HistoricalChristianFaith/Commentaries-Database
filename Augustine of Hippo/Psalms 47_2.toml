"For the Lord Most High is terrible" [Psalm 47:2]. The Most High in descending made like one ludicrous, by ascending into Heaven is made terrible. "A great King over all the earth." Not only over the Jews; for over them also He is King. For of them also the Apostles believed and of them many thousands of men sold their goods, and laid the price at the Apostles' feet, [Acts 4:34] and in them was fulfilled what in the title of the Cross was written, "The King of the Jews." [Matthew 27:37] For He is King also of the Jews. But "of the Jews" is little.  "O clap your hands, all you nations: for God is the King of all the earth." For it suffices not Him to have under Him one nation: therefore such great price gave He out of His side, as to buy the whole world.
