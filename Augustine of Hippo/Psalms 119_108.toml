"Make the freewill offerings of my mouth well pleasing, O Lord" [Psalm 119:108]: that is, let them please You; do not reject, but approve them. By the freewill offerings of the mouth are well understood the sacrifices of praise, offered up in the confession of love, not from the fear of necessity; whence it is said, "a freewill offering will I offer You."  But what does he add? "and teach me Your judgments"? Had he not himself said above, "From Your judgments I have not swerved"? How could he have done thus, if he knew them not? Moreover, if he knew them, in what sense does he here say, "and teach me Your judgments"? Is it as in a former passage, "You have dealt in sweetness with Your servant:" presently after which we find, "teach me sweetness"? This passage we explained as the words of one who was gaining in grace, and praying that he might receive in addition to what he had received.
