They did not charge our Lord with healing on the sabbath since he would have replied that if an ox or an ass of theirs had fallen into a pit, would they not have taken it out on the sabbath day. Rather, they addressed the man as he was carrying his bed, as if to say: Even if the healing could not be delayed, why command the work?… He shields himself under the authority of his healer: The one who made me whole is the one who said to me, “Take up your bed, and walk,” meaning: Why should I not receive a command if I also received a cure from him?
