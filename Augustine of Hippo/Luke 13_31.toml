Or these things are understood to have been spoken mystically by Him, so as to refer toHis body, which is the Church. For devils are cast out when the Gentiles having forsaken their superstition, believe in Him. And cures are perfected when according to His commands, after having renounced the devil and this world until the end of the resurrection, (by which asit were the third day will be completed,) the Church shall be perfected in angelical fullness bythe immortality also of the body.
As many as I gathered together, it was done by my all prevailing will, yet your unwillingness, for you were ever ungrateful.
There seems nothing opposed to St. Luke's narrative, in what the multitudes said when our Lord came to Jerusalem, Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, for He had not asyet come thither nor had this yet been spoken.
At Butas Luke does not say to what place our Lord went from thence, so that He should not come except at that time, (for when this was spoken He was journeying onward until He should come to Jerusalem,) He means therefore to refer to that coming of His, when He should appear in glory.
Luke must be understood then as wishing to anticipate here, before his narrative brought our Lordto Jerusalem, or to make Him when approaching the same city, give an answer to those who told Him to beware of Herod, like to that which Matthew says He gave when He had already reached Jerusalem.
