"O God, to my aid make speed" [Psalm 70:1]. For need we have for an everlasting aid in this world. But when have we not? Now however being in tribulation, let us especially say, "O God, to my aid make speed." "Let them be confounded and fear that seek my soul." Christ is speaking: whether Head speak or whether Body speak; He is speaking that has said, "Why do you persecute Me?" [Acts 9:4] He is speaking that has said, "Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of Mine, to Me you have done it." [Matthew 25:40] The voice then of this Man is known to be of the whole man, of Head and of Body: that need not often be mentioned, because it is known. "Be they confounded," he says, "and fear that seek my soul." In another Psalm He says, "I was looking unto the right and saw, and there was not one that would know Me: flight has perished from Me, and there is not one to seek out My soul."  There of persecutors He says, that there was not one to seek out His soul: but here, "Let them be confounded and fear that seek My soul."...And where is that which you have heard from your Lord, "Love ye your enemies, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them that persecute you"? [Matthew 5:44] Behold you suffer persecution, and cursest them from whom you suffer, how do you imitate the Passions of your Lord that have gone before, hanging on the cross and saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." [Luke 23:34] To persons saying such things the Martyr replies and says, you have set before me the Lord, saying, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do:" understand thou my voice also, in order that it may be yours too: for what have I said concerning mine enemies? "Let them be confounded and fear." Already such vengeance has been taken on the enemies of the Martyrs. That Saul that persecuted Stephen, he was confounded and feared. He was breathing out slaughters,  he was seeking some to drag and slay: a voice having been heard from above, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute Me," [Acts 9:4] he was confounded and laid low, and he was raised up to obedience, that had been inflamed unto persecuting. This then the Martyrs desire for their enemies, "Let them be confounded and fear." For so long as they are not confounded and fear, they must needs defend their actions: glorious they think themselves, because they hold, because they bind, because they scourge, because they kill, because they dance, because they insult, and because of all these doings they be some time confounded and fear.  For if they be confounded, they will also be converted: because converted they cannot be, unless they shall have been confounded and shall have feared. Let us then wish these things to our enemies, let us wish them without fear. Behold I have said, and let me have said it with you, may all that still dance and sing and insult the Martyrs "be confounded and fear:" at last within these walls confounded may they beat their breasts!
