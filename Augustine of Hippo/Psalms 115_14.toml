For the great ones, of the house of Aaron, have said, "May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children" [Psalm 115:14]. And thus it has happened. For children that have been raised even from the stones have flocked unto Abraham: [MatthewÂ 3:9] sheep which were not of this fold, have flocked unto him, that there might be one flock, and one shepherd;  the faith of all nations was added, and the number grew, not only of wise priests, but of obedient peoples; the Lord increasing not only their fathers more and more, who in Christ might show the way to the rest who should imitate them, but also their children, who should follow their fathers' pious footsteps.
