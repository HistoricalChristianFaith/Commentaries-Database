Will any one dare to say that God did not foreknow those to whom he would give faith? Or [would anyone dare to say] that God did not foreknow those whom he would give to his Son—those of whom he should lose none? And certainly, if he foreknew these things, he just as certainly foreknew his own kindnesses with which he condescends to deliver us. This is the predestination of the saints—nothing else. In other words, this is the foreknowledge and the preparation of God’s kindnesses whereby they are most certainly delivered—whoever they are that are delivered.

But were the disciples not going to die later? How then was he going to lose them if they died now, unless it was because they did not believe in him yet in such a way as all do who believe and do not perish?
