For they knew that Elijah would precede Christ. For the name of Christ was not unknown to any Jew. They did not think that he was the Christ, but they did not think that Christ would not come at all. When they were hoping that he would come, they were offended at him when he did come and stumbled at him as on a low stone.… They did not see the lowly stone—but what great blindness not to see the mountain!
