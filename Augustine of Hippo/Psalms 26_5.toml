"I have hated the congregation of evil doers." But to arrive at this council of vanity, congregations of evil doers are formed, which I have hated. "And I will not sit with the ungodly"  [Psalm 26:5]. And, therefore, with such a council, with the ungodly, I will not sit, that is, I will not place my consent.  "And I will not sit with the ungodly."
