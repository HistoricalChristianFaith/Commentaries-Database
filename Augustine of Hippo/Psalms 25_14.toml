"The Lord is the stay of them that fear Him" [Psalm 25:14]. Fear seems to belong to the weak, but the Lord is the stay of them that fear Him. And the Name of the Lord, which has been glorified throughout the whole world, is a stay to them that fear Him. "And His testament, that it may be manifested unto them." And He makes His testament to be manifested unto them, for the Gentiles and the bounds of the earth are Christ's inheritance.
