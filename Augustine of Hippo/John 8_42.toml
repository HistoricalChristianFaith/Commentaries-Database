The sending of Christ is his incarnation. But the proceeding forth of the Word from God is an eternal procession.â€¦ From him, then the Son proceeded forth as God, the equal, the only Son, the Word of the Father. And he came to us, for the Word was made flesh that he might dwell among us. His coming indicates his humanity. His staying indicates his divinity. It is his Godhead toward which we make progress, and it is by his humanity that we are able to make that progress.
