Let us by all means admire the courage of the holy martyrs in their sufferings; but in such a way that we proclaim the grace of God. They themselves, after all, certainly did not wish to be praised in themselves but in the one to whom it is said, “In the Lord shall my soul be praised.” Those who understand this are not proud; they ask shyly, they receive joyfully; they persevere, they do not lose any more what they have received. Because they are not proud, they are gentle; and that is why, after saying “In the Lord shall my soul be praised,” he added, “Let the gentle hear and be glad.” Where would feeble flesh be, where would maggots and rottenness be, unless what we have been singing were true: “My soul will submit itself to God, since it is from him that my patience comes”? Now the virtue the martyrs had, in order to endure all the ills inflicted on them, is called patience.

Let the martyr turn his back on the unbelieving and ungrateful flatterer; let him turn his face toward the most generous of bountiful givers and impute his very martyrdom to God, not treating it as something he has offered to God from what is his own. Let him say instead, “In the Lord shall my soul be praised; let the gentle hear and be glad.” And when you say to him, “What do you mean, ‘In the Lord shall my soul be praised?’ So is it not being praised in yourself?”—he responds with, “Shall not my soul subject itself to God? For it is from him that my patience comes.” So why is it13 mine? Because I opened my lap and was happy to receive it; it is from him, and it is mine. Both from him, and also mine; and because it is from him, it is mine all the more safely. It is mine, but it does not come to me from myself. In order really to possess my gift, I acknowledge God as the giver. Because if I do not acknowledge God as the giver, God takes away his good thing, and there only remains my bad thing, through my choice, through my free will.

So: “Nobody is able to refrain from sexual intercourse, unless God grants it.” You have a gift to protect you from such pleasures; since “this was itself a matter of wisdom, to know whose gift this was; nobody is continent unless God grants it.” You have a gift to help you endure pains; since “it is from him,” he says, “my patience comes.” “So hope in him, every assembly of the people.” Hope in him; do not trust in your own powers. Confess your bad things to him; hope for your good things from him. Without his help you will be nothing, however proud you may be. So in order that you may be enabled to be humble, “pour out your hearts before him”; and to avoid remaining wrongly stuck on yourselves, say what comes next: “God is our helper.”
