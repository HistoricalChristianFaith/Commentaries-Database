Ask those freed from unclean spirits, the blind who saw, the dead who came to life again, and, what is greater than all, the fools who were made wise, and let them answer whether Jesus was a malefactor. But they spoke, of whom he had himself prophesied in the psalms, “They rewarded me evil for good.”

But is not this account contradictory to Luke’s, who mentions certain positive charges.… “And they began to accuse him, saying, ‘We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding giving tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.’ ” … According to John, the Jews seem to have been unwilling to bring actual charges, … in order that Pilate might condemn him simply on their authority, asking no questions but taking it for granted that if Jesus was delivered up to him, he was certainly guilty. Both accounts are, however, compatible. Each Evangelist only inserts what he thinks sufficient. And John’s account implies that some charges had been made, when it comes to Pilate’s answer: ‘Then Pilate said to them, “Take him, and judge him according to your law.’ ”
