"Remember, son, that you received good things in your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things." He assigns pain in return for riches, refreshment in return for poverty, flames in return for purple and joy in return for nakedness. The equal balance of the scales will be maintained. The standard of measurement will not be proved false that says, "The measure you give will be the measure you get." The reason he refuses to show mercy to the rich man in his pain is that while he lived the rich man neglected to show mercy. The reason why he ignored the rich man's pleas in his torment is that he ignored the poor man's pleas on earth.
