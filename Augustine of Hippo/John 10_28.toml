This is the pasture of which he spoke before when he said, “And he shall go in and out and find pasture.” … The good pasture is called eternal life. The grass there does not wither, and everywhere it is green and flourishing.… But you are only looking to misrepresent my words because you only think about this present life. When he says, then, “and they shall not perish,” you can hear the undertone of what was said, as if he had said to them: you shall perish eternally because you are not of my sheep.

But of those sheep of which the apostle says, “The Lord knows those that are his” … there is none that the wolf seizes, or the thief steals or the robber kills. Christ is confident of their number since he knows what he gave up for them. It is for this reason that he says, “No one shall pluck them out of my hand.”
