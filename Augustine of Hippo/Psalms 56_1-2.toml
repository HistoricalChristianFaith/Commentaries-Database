And what is the drift of what we have just been singing to the Lord in the psalm? “Have mercy on me, Lord, because man has trampled on me.” “Man” means whoever lives according to merely human criteria. Well, anyway, those who live according to God’s standards are told, “You are gods, and all of you sons of the Most High.” But to the reprobate, who were called to be children of God but preferred rather merely to be human, that is, to live only according to human standards, “you,” it says, “shall die like people and fall like one of the princes.” Surely the fact that we human beings are mortal should serve to teach us our place, not to make us boastful. What does a worm, which is due to die tomorrow, have to boast about?
