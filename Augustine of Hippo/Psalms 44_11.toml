"You have given us like sheep appointed for meat, and hast scattered us among the nations" [Psalm 44:11]. We have been "devoured" by "the nations." Those persons are meant, who, through their sufferings, have by process of assimilation, becomes part of the "body" of the Gentile world. For the Church mourns over them, as over members of her body, that have been devoured.
