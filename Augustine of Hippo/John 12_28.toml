“I have both glorified it,” before I created the world, “and I will glorify it again,” when he shall rise from the dead and ascend into heaven. It may also be otherwise understood. “I have both glorified it” could be understood to refer to when he was born of the Virgin; when he exercised miraculous powers; when the magi, guided by a star in the heavens, bowed in adoration before him; when he was recognized by saints filled with the Holy Spirit. It could further refer to when he was openly proclaimed by the descent of the Spirit in the form of a dove and pointed out by the voice that sounded from heaven; when he was transfigured on the mount; when he performed many miracles, cured and cleansed multitudes, fed so vast a number with a very few loaves, commanded the winds and the waves, and to when he raised the dead. “And I will glorify it again” could refer to when he would rise from the dead, when death would no longer have dominion over him. It can also refer to when he would be exalted over the heavens as God and to when his glory would extend over all the earth.
