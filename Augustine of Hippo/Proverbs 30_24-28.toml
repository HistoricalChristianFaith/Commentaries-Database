Be prudent, and provide for yourself against the future in heaven. Be therefore prudent, copy the ant, as Scripture says, “Store in summer, lest you be hungry in winter.” The winter is the last day, the day of tribulation; the winter is the day of offenses and bitterness. Gather what may be there for you in the future. If you do not, you will perish, being both imprudent and unwise.
