Thanks must be given because many in absolute number are delivered freely by grace, although few compared with those who perish, so that no one may be lifted up as if he deserved it, but that every mouth may be stopped, and one who glories may glory in the Lord. - "On Rebuke and Grace 28"

Let us celebrate joyfully the coming of our salvation and redemption. Let us celebrate the feast day, on which the great and eternal Day came from the great and eternal Day into this so brief and temporal day of ours. He it is who was made for us justice and sanctification and redemption, so that, as it is written, “Whoever boasts should boast in the Lord.” - "Sermon 185.2"

Our turning away from God is our own act, and this is evil will. But our turning to God is not possible, except he rouses and helps us, and this is good will. What do we have that we have not received? But if we received, why do we glory as if we had not received? Therefore, “he that glories must glory in the Lord.” - "On the Merits and Forgiveness of Sins and on Infant Baptism 2.31"
