De Cons. Ev., ii, 51: Mark says Dalmanutha; no doubt the same place under adifferent name; for many copies of the Gospel according to Mark have Magedan.
This Matthew has already given; whence we may store up for our information, that the Lord spoke the same things many times, that where there are contradictions which cannot be explained, it may be understood that the same sayings were uttered on two different occasions.
