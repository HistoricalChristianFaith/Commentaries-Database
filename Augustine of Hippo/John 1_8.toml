How right it was for the Lord to call [John] a lamp. This is what the Lord said about John: “He was a burning and a shining lamp, and you were willing for a time to exult in his light.” What, though, does John the Evangelist say about him? “There was a man sent by God, whose name was John; this man came for witness, to bear witness about the light; that man was not the light.” Who? John the Baptist. Who says this? John the Evangelist. “That man was not the light.” You say “that man was not the light,” while the light itself says about him, “That man was a burning and a shining lamp? “But I know,” he says, “what sort of light I am talking about; a light, I am well aware, in comparison with which a lamp is not a light.” Listen to what comes next: “That was the true light that enlightens everyone coming into this world.” John does not enlighten every person; Christ does. And John recognized himself as a lamp, in order not to be blown out by the wind of pride. A lamp can both be lit and be put out. The word of God cannot be put out; a lamp always can.
