Take care, then, to avoid what the great apostle sets forth so fearfully, and when you feel that you do not understand, make an immediate act of faith in what is divinely revealed, that there is both free will in humans and grace from God; and pray that what you religiously believe you may also wisely understand. Indeed, it is for this very reason that we have free will that we may wisely understand, for, unless our understanding and wisdom were regulated by free will, we should not be commanded in the words of Scripture: “Understand, you senseless among the people; and you fools be wise at last.” The very fact, then, that we are instructed and commanded to understand and be wise is proof of a demand on our obedience, which cannot exist without free will. But, if it were possible for this to be accomplished by free will without the grace of God, namely, that we should understand and be wise, we should not have to say to God, “Give me understanding that I may know your commandments”; nor would it be written in the Gospel, “Then he opened their understanding that they might understand the Scriptures”;8 nor would the apostle James have said, “But if any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God who gives to all people abundantly and upbraids not: and it will be given to him.”

When, then, that man, so learned in the Scriptures, was commenting on the psalm where it says, “Understand, you senseless among the people; and you fools be wise at last. He who has planted the ear, shall he not hear? or he who has formed the eye, does he not consider?” He said, among other things, “This passage is directed chiefly against the anthropomorphists who say that God has members such as we have. For example, God is said to have eyes: the eyes of the Lord look on all things;12 the hand of the Lord makes all things; and it says, “Adam heard the footsteps of the Lord walking in paradise.” They take these expressions literally, and they attribute our human inadequacies to the magnificence of God. But I say that God is all eye, he is all hand, he is all foot. He is all eye because he sees all things; he is all hand because he effects all things; he is all foot because he is everywhere present. See, then, what it says, “He who has planted the ear, does he not hear?” It does not say, “He who has planted, does he not then have an ear?” and it does not say, “Does he not then have eyes?” What does it say? “He who has planted the ear, shall he not hear? He who has formed the eye, does he not consider?” He brought together the members, he gave the faculties.

What is the topmost pinnacle of the building we are striving to construct? How far does the top of our edifice reach? I’ll tell you straightaway: as far as the sight of God. You can see how high that is, what a great thing it is, to see God. Any of you who long for this will understand what I am saying and you are hearing. We have been promised the sight of God, of the true God, of the supreme God. This really is a wonderful thing, to see the one who sees.I mean, those who worship false gods can easily see them, but they see gods who have eyes and do not see. But we have been promised the vision of the God who lives and sees, and so the God we should be yearning to see is the one of whom Scripture says, “Will he who planted the ear not hear? Does he who fashioned the eye not observe?” So does the one who made you something to hear with not hear himself? And does he not see, the one who created the means for you to see with?
In this psalm [the psalmist] very neatly prefaces those words with these: “Understand, therefore, you who are unwise among the people; and you fools, come sooner or later to your senses.” You see, this is why many people do wrong, imagining that they are not noticed by God. It is difficult, of course, for them to believe he cannot see, but they assume he does not want to. You won’t find many people so totally irreligious that they fulfill the text, “The fool has said in his heart, There is no God.” Few hold this crazy idea. Just as there aren’t many people who are deeply religious, so there aren’t many who are totally irreligious. But what I am going to say now is what the crowd says: “Look, do you really think God takes trouble to know what I do in my house, that God cares two cents what I choose to do in my bed?” Well, who is it that says, “Understand, you who are unwise among the people; and you fools, come sooner or later to your senses”? Being a mere human, it takes you quite a lot of trouble to know everything that goes on in your house and to insure that what your slaves say and do gets back to you; but do you imagine it is any trouble like that for God to pay attention to you, seeing that it was no trouble at all for him to create you? Having made your eyes, will he not turn his own on to you? You did not exist, and he created you, to bring you into being. Now that you do exist, will he not care for you, he that summons the things that are not, as though they were?

So this Peter, playing the great part I have suggested to you, is questioned by the Lord after the resurrection, as we had it read to us, and he said to him, “Simon of John”—you see, he was called Simon when he was born; he was the son of John—“Simon of John, do you love me more than these?” Who is doing the questioning? The one who knew everything. Is he like someone who does not know, this one “who has passed on knowledge”? It was not that the Lord wanted to be informed, but that he wanted Peter to confess.

People argue against this evident truth. What else, after all, could you expect from mere people, who savor the things of humankind, but to argue about God against God? I mean, he is God, they are mere individuals. But God “knows the thoughts of people, that they are vain.” With worldly, materialistic people, what they are in the habit of observing entirely governs their manner of understanding. What they are accustomed to see, they can believe; what they aren’t, they can’t. God performs miracles that go beyond what we are accustomed to, because he is God. It is in fact a greater miracle, so many people being born every day who did not previously exist, than a few having risen again, who did exist; and yet this kind of miracle is not seriously considered and appreciated, but being so common is disregarded as uninteresting. Christ rose again; the case is complete and closed. He was body, he was flesh, which hung on the cross, gave up the soul, was placed in the tomb. He presented it alive, seeing he lived in it. Why are we astonished, why don’t we believe? It is God who did it. Reflect on the one who brought it about, and you eliminate all possibility of doubt.
