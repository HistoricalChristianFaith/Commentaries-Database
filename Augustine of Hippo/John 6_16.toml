There is no inconsistency between Matthew and John. Matthew has told us first how Jesus commanded his disciples to embark in the little ship and to go before him to the other side of the lake until he sent the multitudes away, and then he informs us that after the multitudes were sent away [Jesus] went up into a mountain alone to pray. John mentions first that he departed to a mountain alone and then proceeds to say, “And when it became late, his disciples came down to the sea; and when they had entered into a ship, etc.” For who will not perceive that in recapitulating the facts, John has spoken of something as actually done at a later point by the disciples that Jesus had already charged them to do before his own departure to the mountain?

Behold, Jesus is on the mountain, and the disciples are in the ship. He on the mountain is on high, and they on the sea are on the low level. And yet He left them not who was at a distance from them: just as also He leaves not us (for with Him is our hope), even in that we are delayed in this body, until the end of the world come. And with the ship on the sea the blast rose mightily, and they were tormented by the tossing. It cannot be that the faith of Christ is without tempest in this world. Much presumption truly is there in a man if he thinks to live without temptation.

What saith the apostle of the Lord Himself? "Who was made a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec." Melchisedec was a priest, and blessed Abraham. And who was this Melchisedec? "King of Salem." Salem was afterwards called Jerusalem. Therefore before the Jews reigned there, Melchisedec was there a priest of the most high God; of whom in Genesis very great mysteries are spoken. This Melchisedec went out to meet Abraham, and blessed him. He was a priest, for he offered bread and wine to those that had returned from the smiting of the enemy: and there Abraham gave to him tithes. Lo, our Lord, a priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec, because He on earth hath offered that oblation.
