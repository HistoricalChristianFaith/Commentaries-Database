The activity of a soul that aspires to rest in quietness must be humble and gentle, which is appropriate for the follower of Christ the Way. It also should not be lazy or less than fully committed but should instead be committed to running the race to its end. It is, in fact, written, “Do your work thoroughly in a spirit of meekness,” where the admonition, “Do your work thoroughly” is aimed at preventing you from allowing your meekness to degenerate into laziness.
