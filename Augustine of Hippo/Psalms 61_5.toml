"For Thou, O God, hast hearkened to my prayer" [Psalm 61:5]. What prayer? That wherewith he begins: "Hearken, O God, to my supplication."..."You have given inheritance to men fearing Your name." Let us continue therefore in the fear of God's name: the eternal Father deceives us not. Sons labour, that they may receive the inheritance of their parents, to whom when dead they are to succeed: are we not labouring to receive an inheritance from that Father, to whom not dying we succeed; but together with Him in the very inheritance for everlasting are to live?
