"You have prepared a table in my sight, against them that trouble me" [Psalm 23:5]. Now after the rod, whereby, while a little one, and living the natural life, I was brought up among the flock in the pastures; after that rod, I say, when I began to be under the staff, You have prepared a table in my sight, that I should no more be fed as a babe with milk, [1 Corinthians 3:2] but being older should take meat, strengthened against them that trouble me. "You have fattened my head with oil." You have gladdened my mind with spiritual joy. "And Your inebriating cup, how excellent is it!" And Your cup yielding forgetfulness of former vain delights, how excellent is it!
