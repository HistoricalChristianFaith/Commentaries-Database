Students of these revered writings should be advised not only to learn the kinds of expressions in the holy Scriptures, to notice carefully how they are customarily expressed there, and to remember them but also to pray that they may understand them, and this is chiefly and especially necessary. Indeed, in these books which they are studying earnestly, they read that “the Lord gives wisdom; and out of his mouth comes prudence and knowledge.” It is from him that they have received that zeal for study, if it is endowed with piety.
