A good teacher chooses a good life in such a way that he does not also neglect good repute but provides “what may be good not only before God but also before men” insofar as he is able by fearing God and caring for men. In his speech itself he should prefer to please more with the meanings expressed than with the words used to speak them. Nor should he think that anything may be said better than that which is said truthfully. Nor should the teacher serve the words but the words the teacher.
