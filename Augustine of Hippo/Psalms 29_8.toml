"The Voice of the Lord moving the wilderness" [Psalm 29:8]. The Voice of the Lord moving to the faith the Gentiles once "without hope, and without God in the world;" [EphesiansÂ 2:12] where no prophet, no preacher of God's word, as it were, no man had dwelt. "And the Lord will move the desert of Cades." And then the Lord will cause the holy word of His Scriptures to be fully known, which was abandoned by the Jews who understood it not.
