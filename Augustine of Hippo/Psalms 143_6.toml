"I stretched forth," says he, "my hands to You: my soul is as a land without water to You" [Psalm 143:6]. Rain upon me, says he, to bring forth from me good fruit. "For the Lord shall give sweetness, that our land may give her fruit."  "I have stretched forth my hands to You; my soul is as a land without water," not to me, but "to You." I can thirst for You, I cannot water myself.

7. "I stretched forth," saith he, "my hands to Thee: my soul is as a land without water to Thee" (ver. 6). Rain upon me, saith he, to bring forth from me good fruit. "For the Lord shall give sweetness, that our land may give her fruit." "I have stretched forth my hands to Thee; my soul is as a land without water," not to me, but "to Thee." I can thirst for Thee, I cannot water myself.
