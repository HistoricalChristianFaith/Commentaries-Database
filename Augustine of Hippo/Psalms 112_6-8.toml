He therefore who does these things, "shall guide his words with discretion." His deeds themselves are the words whereby he shall be defended at the Judgment; which shall not be without mercy unto him, since he has himself shown mercy. "For he shall never be moved" [Psalm 112:6]: he who, called to the right hand, shall hear these words, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." For no works of theirs, save works of mercy, are there mentioned. He therefore shall hear, "Come, you blessed of My Father;" for, "the generation of the right ones shall be blessed." Thus, "the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance." "He will not be afraid of any evil hearing; for his heart stands fast and believes in the Lord" [Psalm 112:7]. Such as the words which he will hear addressed to those on the left hand, "Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." [Matthew 25:34, 41] He therefore who seeks here not his own things, but those of Jesus Christ, [Philippians 2:21] most patiently endures sufferings, waits for the promises with faith. Nor is he broken down by any temptations: "His heart is established, and will not shrink, until he see beyond his enemies" [Psalm 112:8]. His enemies wished to see good things here, and when invisible blessings were promised them, used to say, "Who will show us any good?"  Let our heart therefore be established, and shrink not, until we see beyond our enemies. For they wish to see good things of men in the land of the dying; we trust to see the good things of the Lord in the land of the living.
