He next says, "Take off Your servant to that which is good, that the proud calumniate me not" [Psalm 119:122]. They drive me on, that I may fall into evil; do Thou take me off to that which is good. They who rendered these words by the Latin,  calumnientur, have followed a Greek expression, not commonly used in Latin. Have the words, Let not the proud calumniate me, the same force, as, Let them "not succeed in calumniating me"?
