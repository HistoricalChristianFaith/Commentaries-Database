And as though to these very persons He were turned, He says, "Who shall give out of Sion salvation to Israel?" [Psalm 53:7]. O you fools, you revile, insult, buffet, besmear with spittings, with thorns ye crown, upon the Cross ye lift up; whom? "Who shall give out of Sion salvation to Israel?" Shall not That Same of whom you have said, "He is not God"? "In God's turning away the captivity of His people." For there turns away the captivity of His people, no one but He that has willed to be a captive in your own hands. But what men shall understand this thing? "Jacob shall exult, and Israel shall rejoice." "Israel;" the true Jacob, and the true Israel, that younger, to whom the elder was servant, [Genesis 25:23] shall himself exult, for he shall himself understand.
