Do not doubt that this duty of ours is a part of religion because God, “with whom there is no iniquity,” whose power is supreme, who not only sees what each one is but also foresees what he will be, who alone cannot err in his judgment because he cannot be deceived in his knowledge, nevertheless acts as the Gospel expresses it, “He makes his sun to rise on the good and bad, and rains on the just and unjust.”
