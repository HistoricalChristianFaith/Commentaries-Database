He added “has given all things into his hands” so that you might know also here with what distinction it is said, “The Father loves the Son.” And why? Doesn’t the Father love John? And yet he has not given all things into his hand. Doesn’t the Father love Paul? And yet he has not given all things into his hand. “The Father loves the Son,” but as a father loves, not as master loves a servant. He loves him as the only Son, not as an adopted son, and so he “has given all things into his hand.” What does “all things” mean? That the Son should be such as the Father is. He begot him to equality with himself—he in whom it was no robbery to be in the form of God and equal to God. “The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.” Therefore, having deigned to send us the Son, let us not imagine that it is something less than the Father that is sent to us. The Father, in sending the Son, sent his other self.
