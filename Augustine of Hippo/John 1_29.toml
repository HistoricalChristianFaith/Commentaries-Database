If the Lamb of God is innocent, and John is the lamb, must he not be innocent? But all men come of that stock of which David sings sorrowing, Behold, I was conceived in wickedness. He then alone was the Lamb, who was not thus conceived; for Hewas not conceived in wickedness, nor in sin did His mother bear Him in her womb, Whom avirgin conceived, a virgin brought forth, because that in faith she conceived, and in faith received.
For He Who took not sin from our nature, He it is Who takes away our sin. Some say, We take away the sins of men, because we are holy; for if he, who baptizes, is not holy, how can he take away the other’s sin, seeing he himself is full of sin? Against these reasoners letus point to the text; Behold Him Who takes away the sin of the world; in order to do away with such presumption in man towards man.
He comes after me, because he was born after me: He is made before me, because He is preferred to me.
Now when our Lord became known, it was unnecessary to prepare a way for Him; for to those who knew Him, He became His own way. And therefore John’s baptism did not last long, but only so long as to show our Lord’s humility. Our Lord received baptism from a servant, in order to give us sucha lesson of humility as might prepare us for receiving the grace of baptism, And that the servant's baptism might not be set before the Lord’s, others were baptized with it; who after receiving it, had to receive our Lord’s baptism: whereas those who first received our Lord's baptism, did not receive the servant’s after.
