It was Christ that was represented by a ram, Christ by a lamb, Christ by a calf, Christ by a goat—everything was Christ. He was represented by the ram because it leads the flock. It was found in the thorns when our father Abraham was ordered to spare his son but not to depart without offering any sacrifice. Isaac was Christ, and the ram was Christ. Isaac carried the wood for sacrificing himself; Christ was burdened with his own cross. The ram was substituted for Isaac; but not of course Christ for Christ. But Christ was in both Isaac and the ram. The ram was caught by its horns in the thorn bush; ask the Jews what they crowned the Lord with that time. He is the lamb: “Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.”
