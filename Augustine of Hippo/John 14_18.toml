After the promise of the Holy Spirit, in case anyone should think that the Lord was to give the Spirit, as it were, in place of himself (implying that he himself would not be with them in the same way), he added the words, “I will not leave you orphans. I will come to you.” Orphani [Greek] are pupilli [orphans] in Latin.… Accordingly, although it was not the Son of God that adopted sons to his Father or willed that we should have by grace that same Father who is his Father by nature, yet in a sense it is paternal feelings toward us that [the Son] himself displays.
