“As in the days of the tree of life, so shall be the days of my people.” Now, anyone who has ever opened the Scriptures knows where God planted the “tree of life.” It was from the fruit of this tree that God excluded Adam and Eve.…Of course, it might be argued that those “days of the tree of life” mentioned by Isaiah are the days that are now being spent by Christ’s church, since the “tree of life” is simply a prophetic figure for Christ, for that Wisdom of God that Solomon had in mind when he said that Wisdom is “a tree of life to them that laid hold on it.”
