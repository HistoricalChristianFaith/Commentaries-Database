And again, in order that he may draw the sound from that sounding-board below, he addresses his soul: he says, "Why are you sorrowful, O my soul, and why do you disquiet me?" [Psalm 43:5].

It is this same that we call "understanding;" which "understanding," indeed, is wanting to the brutes. And this "understanding" whoever neglects in himself, and holds it in less account than the other parts of his nature, and casts it off, just as if he had it not, is addressed in the Psalm, "Be not as the horse and the mule, which have no understanding."  It is our "understanding" then that is addressing our soul. The latter is withered away from tribulations, worn out in anguish,  made "sorrowful" in temptations, fainting in toils.
