It may be also understood in this way: … The good may take it also as addressed to themselves, but not so as to be any source of anxiety. For he was speaking of his bodily presence. For in respect of his majesty, his providence, his ineffable and invisible grace, his own words are fulfilled, “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.” But in respect of the flesh he assumed as the Word … “you will not have him always.” And why is this? Because in respect of his bodily presence he associated for forty days with his disciples, and then, having brought them forth for the purpose of beholding and not of following him, he ascended into heaven and is no longer here. He is there, indeed, sitting at the right hand of the Father. And he is here also, having never withdrawn the presence of his glory. In other words, in respect of his divine presence we always have Christ. In respect of his presence in the flesh it was rightly said to the disciples, “You will not always have me.” In this respect the church enjoyed his presence only for a few days; now it possesses him by faith without seeing him with the eyes. In whichever way, then, it was said, “But me you will not have always,” it can no longer, I suppose, after this twofold solution, remain as a subject of doubt.

We can certainly understand “the poor you have always.” What he has said here is true. When were the poor ever lacking in the church? “But you will not always have me.” What does he mean by this? How are we to understand “you will not always have me”? Do not be alarmed: it was addressed to Judas. Why, then, didn’t he say, “You (sg.) will have” instead of “You (pl.) will have”? [He used the plural form] because Judas is not here just an individual. One wicked man represents the whole body of the wicked.… And so it was said [to Judas], “But you will not always have me.” But what does the “not always” and “always” mean? If you are good, if you belong to the body represented by Peter, you have Christ both now and hereafter: now by faith, by sign, by the sacrament of baptism, by the bread and wine of the altar. You have Christ now, but you will have him always. For, when you have gone from here, you will come to him who said to the robber, “Today you shall be with me in paradise.” But if you live wickedly, you may seem to have Christ now, because you enter the church, sign yourself with the sign of Christ, are baptized with the baptism of Christ, mingle with the members of Christ and approach his altar: now you have Christ, but by living wickedly you will not have him always.
