Therefore the supreme and true wisdom is in that first commandment: “You shall love the Lord your God with your whole heart and with your whole soul.” From this it follows that wisdom is love of God, which is “poured forth in our hearts,” not otherwise than “by the Holy Spirit who is given to us.” But “the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” and “there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear.”

The number three has an intrinsic relation to the mind. This may be understood from the text in which we are commanded to love God in a threefold manner, with the whole heart, with the whole soul, with the whole mind.

For while there remains any remnant of the lust of the flesh, to be kept in check by the rein of continence, God is by no means loved with all one’s soul. For the flesh does not lust without the soul, although it is the flesh which is said to lust, because the soul lusts carnally. In that perfect state the just man shall live absolutely without any sin, since there will be in his members no law warring against the law of his mind. But wholly will he love God, with all his heart, with all his soul and with all his mind, which is the first and chief commandment.
