It could happen that some public official would say to a Christian: “Either you will stop being a Christian, or, if you persist in being one, you shall have no house or property.” That will be the time when those rich men, who had decided to keep their riches in order to win merit with God by using them for good works, will choose to give them up for Christ’s sake rather than Christ for their sake.… Thus they become as men “having nothing, yet possessing all things”— and everlasting life in the world to come, lest by giving up Christ for the sake of riches they be cast into everlasting death.
