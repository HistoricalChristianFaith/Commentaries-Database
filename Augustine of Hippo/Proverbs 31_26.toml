There is mercy on [Jesus’] tongue, and so he teaches the Law mercifully, as was said about wisdom: “But she carries on her tongue the Law and mercy.” Do not fear that you cannot fulfill the Law; flee to mercy.

“She has opened her mouth with care, and imposed order on her tongue,” praising creatures as creatures, the creator as creator, angels as angels, heavenly things as heavenly, earthly things as earthly, men as men, animals as animals. Nothing mixed up, nothing out of order. Not taking the name of the Lord her God in vain, not attributing the nature of a creature to the creator, speaking about everything so methodically that she doesn’t put lesser things above the more important or subordinate the more important to the lesser.
