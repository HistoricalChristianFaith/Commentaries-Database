"Give me understanding, and I shall search Your law, yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart" [Psalm 119:34]. For when each man has searched the law, and searched its deep things, in which its whole meaning does consist; he ought indeed to love God with all his heart, with all his soul, with all his mind; and his neighbour as himself. "For on these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets." [Matthew 22:37-40] This he seems to have promised, when he said, "Yea, I shall keep it with my whole heart."
