He next follows out the history well known in the truth of the holy Scriptures. "When they were in small numbers, very few, and they strangers in the land" [Psalm 105:12]; that is, in the land of Canaan....But some copies have the words "very few, and they strangers," in the accusative case,  the translator having turned the Greek phrase too literally into Latin. If we were to render the whole clause in this way, we must say, "that they were very few, and they strangers;" but the phrase, "while they were," is the meaning of the Greek; and the verb, "to be," takes not an accusative, but a nominative after it.
