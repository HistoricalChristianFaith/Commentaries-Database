"Your word is a lantern unto my feet, and a light unto my paths" [Psalm 119:105]. The word "lantern" appears in the word "light;" "my feet" are also repeated in "my paths." What then means "Your Word"? [John 1:1] Is it He who was in the beginning God with God, that is, the Word by whom all things were made? It is not thus. For that Word is a light, but is not a lantern. For a lantern is a creature, not a creator; and it is lighted by participation of an unchangeable light....For no creature, howsoever rational and intellectual, is lighted by itself, but is lighted by participation of eternal Truth: although sometimes day is spoken of, not meaning the Lord, but that "day which the Lord has made,"  and on account of which it is said, "Come unto Him, and be lightened."  On account of which participation, inasmuch as the Mediator Himself became Man, He is styled lantern in the Apocalypse. [Revelation 21:23] But this sense is a solitary one; for it cannot be divinely spoken of any of the saints, nor in any wise lawfully said of any, "The Word was made flesh," [John 1:14] save of the "one Mediator between God and men." [1 Timothy 2:5] Since therefore the only-begotten Word, coequal with the Father, is styled a light; and man when enlightened by the Word is also called a light, who is styled also a lantern, as John, as the Apostles; and since no man of these is the Word, and that Word by whom they were enlightened is not a lantern;  what is this word, which is thus called a light and a lantern at the same time, save we understand the word which was sent unto the Prophets, or which was preached through the Apostles; not Christ the Word, but the word of Christ, of which it is written, "Faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God"? [Romans 10:17] For the Apostle Peter also, comparing the prophetical word to a lantern, says, "whereunto ye do well that you take heed, as unto a lantern, that shines in a dark place." [2 Peter 1:19] What, therefore, he here says, "Your word" is the word which is contained in all the holy Scriptures.
