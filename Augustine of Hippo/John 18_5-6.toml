With no other weapon than his own solitary voice uttering the words “I am,” he knocked down, repelled and rendered helpless that great crowd, even with all their ferocious hatred and terror of arms. For God lay hidden in that human flesh, and eternal day was so obscured in those human limbs that he was looked for with lanterns and torches to be slain in the darkness. “I am,” he says, and throws the wicked to the ground. What will he do when he comes as judge, who did this when giving himself up to be judged? What will his power be like when he comes to reign, who had this kind of power when he came to die? And now even at the present time Christ is still saying through the Gospel, “I am.” And … the result is the same, as people go backward and fall to the ground because they have abandoned what is heavenly in favor of what is earthly.
