"For they gat not the land in possession by their own sword, neither did their own arm save them; but Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your countenance" [Psalm 44:3]. Your "right hand" is Your Power: Your "arm" is Your Son Himself.  And "the light of Your countenance." What means this, but that You were present with them, in miracles of such a sort that Your presence was perceived. For when God's presence with us appears by any miracle, do we see His face with our own eyes? No. It is by the effect of the miracle He intimates to man His presence. In fact, what do all persons say, who express wonder at facts of this description? "I saw God present." "But Your right hand, and Your arm, and the light of Your countenance; because You pleased in them:"  i.e. so dealt with them, that You were well-pleasing in them: that whoso considered how they were being dealt with, might say, that "God is with them of a truth;" and it is God that moves  them.
