For that church is founded on a rock, as the Lord says: “On this rock I will build my church.” But they build on the sand, as the same Lord says: “Every one who hears these sayings of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” But that you may not suppose that the church that is on a rock is in only one part of the earth and does not extend even to its furthest boundaries, hear its voice groaning from the psalm, amid the evils of it pilgrimage. For it says, “From the end of the earth have I cried to you; when my heart was distressed you did lift me up on the rock; you have led me, you, my hope, have become a tower of courage from the face of the enemy.” See how it cries from the end of the earth.… See how it is exalted on a rock.

It is clear that this obligation and condition of life includes not only those who have responded so well to sound advice that they have sold their goods and distributed them to the poor, and, with their shoulders freed of every worldly burden, bear the light yoke of Christ. They also include the weaker soul, who is less capable of such glorious perfection but who nevertheless remembers that he is a Christian when he hears that he must give up Christ or lose all his possessions. He will rather lay hold on the “tower of strength against the face of the enemy” because, when he was building it by his faith, he took into account the charges with which it could be completed. He embraced the faith with the intention of renouncing this world, not in word only, because, if he bought something he was as one not possessing it, and if he used this world he was as one not using it, not placing his hope in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God.
