For that church is founded on a rock, as the Lord says: “On this rock I will build my church.” But they build on the sand, as the same Lord says: “Every one who hears these sayings of mine and does not do them is like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.” But that you may not suppose that the church that is on a rock is in only one part of the earth and does not extend even to its furthest boundaries, hear its voice groaning from the psalm, amid the evils of it pilgrimage. For it says, “From the end of the earth have I cried to you; when my heart was distressed you did lift me up on the rock; you have led me, you, my hope, have become a tower of courage from the face of the enemy.” See how it cries from the end of the earth.… See how it is exalted on a rock.
