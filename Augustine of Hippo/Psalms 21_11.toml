"Because they turned evils against You." Now this punishment shall be recompensed to them, because the evils which they supposed to hang over them by Your reign, they turned against You to Your death. "They imagined a device, which they were not able to establish" [Psalm 21:11]. They imagined a device, saying, "It is expedient that one die for all:" [JohnÂ 11:50] which they were not able to establish, not knowing what they said.
