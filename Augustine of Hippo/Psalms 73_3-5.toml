But why even this? "For I was jealous," he says, "in the case of sinners, looking on the peace of sinners" [Psalm 73:3]. I observed sinners, I saw them to have peace. What peace? Temporal, transient, falling, and earthly: but yet such as I also was desiring of God. I saw them that served not God to have that which I desired in order that I might serve God: and my feet were moved and my steps were almost overthrown. But why sinners have this, he says briefly: "Because there is no avoidance of their death, and there is a firmament in their scourge" [Psalm 73:4]. Now I have perceived, he says, why they have peace, and flourish on the earth; because of their death there is no avoidance, because death sure and eternal does await them, which neither does avoid them, nor can they avoid it, "because there is no avoidance of their death, and there is a firmament in their scourge." And there is a firmament in their scourge. For their scourge is not temporal, but firm for everlasting. Because of these evil things then which are to be to them eternal, now what? "In the labours of men they are not, and with men they shall not be scourged" [Psalm 73:5]. Does not even the devil himself escape scourging with men, for whom nevertheless an eternal punishment is being prepared?
