Wherefore now we call the proud people happy, for they that work wickedness are built up. It was such complaints as these that compelled the prophet to anticipate, as it were, the last judgment in which the wicked will be so far from even a pretense of happiness that their misery will be apparent to all, whereas the good, untroubled by even transitory sorrow, will enjoy a manifest and unending blessedness. Malachi had already given a similar illustration of the kind of murmurings that wearied the Lord: “Everyone who does evil is [thought to be] good in the sight of the Lord and as such pleases him.” The only point I want to make is that such murmurings against God were the result of an unspiritual interpretation of the law.
