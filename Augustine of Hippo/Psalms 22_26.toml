"The poor shall eat, and be filled" [Psalm 22:26]. The humble and the despisers of the world shall eat, and imitate Me. For so they will neither desire this world's abundance, nor fear its want. "And they shall praise the Lord, who seek Him." For the praise of the Lord is the pouring out of that fullness. "Their hearts shall live for ever and ever." For that food is the food of the heart.
