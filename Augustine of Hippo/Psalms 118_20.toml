But consider how the gates of righteousness are entered into. "These are the gates of the Lord" he says, "the righteous shall enter into them" [Psalm 118:20]. At least let no wicked man enter there, that Jerusalem which receives not one uncircumcised, where it is said, "Without are dogs." [RevelationÂ 22:15] Be it enough, that in my long pilgrimage "I have had my habitation among the tents of Kedar:"  I endured even unto the end the intercourse of the wicked, but "these are the gates of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into them."
