But consider how the gates of righteousness are entered into. "These are the gates of the Lord" he says, "the righteous shall enter into them" [Psalm 118:20]. At least let no wicked man enter there, that Jerusalem which receives not one uncircumcised, where it is said, "Without are dogs." [RevelationÂ 22:15] Be it enough, that in my long pilgrimage "I have had my habitation among the tents of Kedar:"  I endured even unto the end the intercourse of the wicked, but "these are the gates of the Lord: the righteous shall enter into them."

14. But consider how the gates of righteousness are entered into. "These are the gates of the Lord" he saith, "the righteous shall enter into them" (ver. 20). At least let no wicked man enter there, that Jerusalem which receiveth not one uncircumcised, where it is said, "Without are dogs."
