The seven loaves signify the sevenfold working of the Holy Spirit; the four thousand people, the church established under the four Gospels; the seven baskets of fragments, the perfection of the church. This number, you see, stands for perfection extremely often. I mean, how come it says, “Seven times a day shall I praise you”? Is a person going wildly astray who does not praise God that number of times? So what else can be the meaning of “seven times a day shall I praise you,” but “I shall never cease from praising”? You see, when he says seven times he signifies the whole of time; that is why the ages unfold in the weekly round of seven days. So what else can “seven times a day shall I praise you” mean but his “praise is always in my mouth”?

But whom does the church burn as the moon by night? They who have caused schisms. Hear this very same thing stated by the apostle: “Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is scandalized and I am not burned?” How then is there no scandal in him who loves his brother? Because he who loves his brother endures all things for the sake of unity, because in the unity of love is brotherly loving. If some wicked person or other, or someone supposedly or allegedly wicked, offends you, do you desert so many good people? What sort of brotherly loving is it as has appeared in these people? When they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the world. Were there no saints in the world? Or was it possible for them to be condemned by you unheard? But, if you loved your brother, there would be no scandal in you. Hear the psalm, the one that says, “Much peace have they who love your law and there is no scandal to them.” It said that they who love the law of God have much peace and for that reason there is no scandal to them. Those therefore who suffer scandal lose peace. And who did it say do not suffer scandal or do not cause it? Those loving the law of God.
