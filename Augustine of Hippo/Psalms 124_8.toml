..."Our help stands in the Name of the Lord, who has made heaven and earth" [Psalm 124:8]. For if this were not our help, the snare would not indeed remain for ever; but when the bird was once taken, it would be crushed. For this life will pass away; and they who shall have been taken in by its pleasures, and through these pleasures have offended God, will pass away with this life. For the snare will be broken; be ye assured of this: all the sweetness of this present life will no longer exist, when the lot assigned to it has been fulfilled; but we must not be enthralled by it, so that when the net is broken, you may then rejoice and say, "The snare is broken, and we are delivered." But lest you think that you can do this of your own strength, consider whose work your deliverance is (for if you are proud, you fall into the snare), and say, "Our help stands in the Name of the Lord, who has made heaven and earth."...

So this heaven and earth is called the world. In saying “Do not love the world,” he is not disparaging that world; whoever disparages that world, after all, is disparaging the maker of the world. Listen to the world mentioned twice in one place in different senses: it was said of the Lord Christ, “He was in this world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.” The world was made through him: “Our help is in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” The world was made through him: “I lifted up my eyes to the mountains; from where will help come to me? My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.” This world was made by God, and the world did not know him. Which world did not know him? The lover of the world, the lover of the work, the scorner of the workman.
