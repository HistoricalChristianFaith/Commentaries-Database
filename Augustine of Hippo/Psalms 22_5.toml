"They cried unto You, and were saved." They cried unto You, not in the words of sins, from which salvation is far; and therefore were they saved. "They hoped in You, and were not confounded" [Psalm 22:5]. "They hoped in You," and their hope did not deceive them. For they placed it not in themselves.
