But what have you heard about Jerusalem in the Psalms? “For its stones are dear to your servants; its very dust moves them to pity,” “You,” it says, “will arise and have compassion on Zion, for it is time to show favor to it.” When the time came for God to show mercy, the Lamb came. What kind of Lamb is it whom the wolves fear? What kind of Lamb is it who, though killed, kills the lion? For the devil has been called a lion, going about and roaring, seeking someone to devour; by the Lamb’s blood the lion has been conquered. Behold the spectacles of Christians!
