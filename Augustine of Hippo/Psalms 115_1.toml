"Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Your Name give the praise" [Psalm 115:1]. For that grace of the water that gushed from the rock ("now that rock was Christ" [1 Corinthians 10:4]), was not given on the score of works that had gone before, but of His mercy "that justifies the ungodly." [Romans 4:5] For "Christ died for sinners,"  that men might not seek any glory of their own, but in the Lord's Name.
