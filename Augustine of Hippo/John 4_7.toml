In that woman, then, let us hear ourselves, and in her acknowledge ourselves and in her give thanks to God for ourselves.

His “drink” was to do the will of him that sent him. That was why he said, “I thirst; give me to drink,” namely, to work faith in her and to drink of her faith and transplant her into his own body, for his body is the church.
