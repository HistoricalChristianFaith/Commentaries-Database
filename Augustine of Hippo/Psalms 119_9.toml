But in this place the keeping of the words of God, must be understood as the obeying His commandments in deed: for they are kept in memory in vain, if they are not kept in life also. But what is meant by "young man" here? For he might have said, wherewithal shall any one (homo) correct his way? Or, wherewithal shall a man (vir) correct his way? Which is usually put by the Scriptures in such a way, that the whole human race is understood....But in this passage he says neither any one, nor a man, but, "a young man."

Or is it perhaps an admonition at what age we ought chiefly to correct our way; according to what is elsewhere written, "My son, gather instruction from your youth up: so shall you find wisdom till your gray hairs." [Sirach 6:18] There is another mode of interpreting it, by recognising in the expression the younger son in the Gospel, [Luke 15:12, etc. who returned to himself, and said, "I will arise and go to my father." [Luke 15:18] Wherewithal did he correct his way, save by ruling himself after the words of God, which he desired as one longing for his father's bread....
