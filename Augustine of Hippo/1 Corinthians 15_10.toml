Gladly and with the eyes of faith do all in the City of God look up to this great man, Paul, this athlete of Christ, who was anointed by Christ and instructed by him. With him he was nailed to the cross, and through him made glorious. This man was made a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men. He lawfully carried on a great conflict in the theater of this world and strained forward to the prize of his heavenly calling.

Paul did not labor in order to receive grace, but he received grace so that he might labor.

How, then, is Godâ€™s commandment accomplished, even with difficulty, without his help, since if the Lord does not build, the builder is said to have labored in vain.
