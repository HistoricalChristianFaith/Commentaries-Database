"They shall be scattered abroad in order that they may eat" [Psalm 59:15]; that is, in order that they may gain others, in order that into their Body they may change believers. "But if they shall not be filled, they shall murmur." Because above also he had spoken of the murmur of them, saying, "For who has heard?" "And You, O Lord," he says, "shall deride them, saying, Who has heard?"  Wherefore? Because, as nothing You shall count all nations. Let the Psalm be concluded. See ye the Corner [Ephesians 2:20] exulting, now with both walls rejoicing. The Jews were proud, humbled they have been; Gentiles were despairing, raised up they have been: let them come to the Corner, there let them meet, there run together, there find the kiss of peace; from different parts let them come, but with differing not come, those of Circumcision, these of uncircumcision. Far apart were the walls, but before that to the Corner they came: but in the Corner let them hold themselves.
