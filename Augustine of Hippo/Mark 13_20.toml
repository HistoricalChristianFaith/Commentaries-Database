De Con Evan, ii, 77: Matthew says, standing “in the holy place;” but with this verbal difference Mark has expressed the same meaning; for He says “where it ought not” to stand, because it ought not to stand in the holy place.
Epist., cxcix, 9: But Luke, in order to show that the abomination of desolation happened when Jerusalem was taken, in this same place gives the words of our Lord, “And when ye shall see Jerusalem compassed with armies, then know that the desolation thereof is nigh. "It goes on: “Then let them that be in Judaea flee to the mountains.”.
But some persons more fitly understand that the calamities themselves are signified by days, as evil daysare spoken of in other parts of Holy Scripture; for the days themselves are not evil, but what is done in them. The woes themselves therefore are said to be abridged, because through the patience which God gave they felt them less, and then what was great in itself was abridged.
