If Christ cleaved to the church so that they became one flesh, in what way did he “leave” his Father? In what way did he “leave” his mother? He left his Father in the sense that, when he was in the form of God he … emptied himself, assuming the form of a slave. … That means that he left the Father, not by deserting him or withdrawing from him but by coming to humanity in a lowly form in which he temporarily divested his glory with the Father.
