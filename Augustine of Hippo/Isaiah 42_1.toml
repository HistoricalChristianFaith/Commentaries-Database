The passage reads, “Jacob, my son, I will uphold him; Israel, my elect, my soul has assumed him.” … It is true, indeed, that the Vulgate text has “my servant” in place of “Jacob” and “Israel,” but the Septuagint translators preferred to make the meaning more explicit, namely, that the prophecy concerns the “Highest” insofar as he became the “lowliest,” in the form of a servant. Hence they placed the name of that man from whose stock the “form of a servant” was assumed. It was to him that the Holy Spirit was given.
