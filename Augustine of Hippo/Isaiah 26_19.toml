The first part [of the verse] concerns the resurrection of the just, but the last few words may be taken to mean “the bodies of the wicked will fall into the ruin of damnation.” In regard to the resurrection of the just, the attentive reader will notice some distinction. “The dead shall rise” refers to the first resurrection; “those in the graves” refers to the second; and in the following words we may not improperly find a reference to the saints whom the Lord will find alive on earth. As for the word “your dew is their health,” we are not wrong in taking “health” to mean “immortality,” that most perfect health which needs no daily medicine of ordinary food.
