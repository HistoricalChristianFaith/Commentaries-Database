But perhaps it is only what is past that has been described to us: but nothing of the kind is to be hoped for by us for the future. Nay indeed, it is still to be hoped for. "Through You will we winnow away  our enemies" [Psalm 44:5]. Our fathers then have declared to us a work that Thou did "in their days, and in the days of old," that Your hand destroyed the Gentiles: that Thou "cast out the peoples; and planted them." Such was the past; but what is to be hereafter? "Through You we shall winnow away our enemies." A time will come, when all the enemies of Christians will be winnowed away like chaff, be blown like dust, and be cast off from the earth....Thus much of the future. "I will not trust in my bow," even as our fathers did not in "their sword. Neither shall my sword help me" [Psalm 44:6].
