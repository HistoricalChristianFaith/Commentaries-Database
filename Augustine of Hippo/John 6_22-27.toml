(Tr. xxv. 8) Knowledge of the miracle was conveyed to them indirectly. Other ships had come to the place where they had eaten bread; in these they went after Him; Howbeit there came other boats from Tiberias, nigh unto the place where they did eat bread, after that the Lord had given thanks. When the people therefore saw that Jesus was not there, neither His disciples, they also look shipping, and came to Capernaum, seeking for Jesus.

(Tr. xxv. 8) So He Who had fled to the mountain, mixes and converses with the multitude. Only just now they would have kept Him, and made Him king. But after the sacrament of the miracle, He begins to discourse, and fills their souls with His word, whose bodies He had satisfied with bread.

(Tr. xxv. 10) As if He said, Ye seek Me to satisfy the flesh, not the spirit.

(Tr. xxv. 10) Under the figure of food He alludes to Himself. Ye seek Me, He saith, for the sake of something else; seek Me for My own sake.

(Tr. xxv. 10) As He told the woman of Samaria above, If thou knewest Who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water. (c. 4) So He says here, Which the Son of man shall give unto you.

(Tr. xxv. 10) How many there are who seek Jesus, only to gain some temporary benefit. One man has a matter of business, in which he wants the assistance of the clergy; another is oppressed by a more powerful neighbour, and flies to the Church for refuge: Jesus is scarcely ever sought for Jesus' sake.

"Jesus answered them, and said, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye seek me, not because ye saw miracles, but because ye did eat of my bread, and were filled." Ye seek me for the sake of the flesh, not for that of the Spirit. How many there are that seek Jesus with no other aim than to gain some temporal benefit! One man has a business on hand, he seeks the intercession of the clergy; another is oppressed by some person more powerful than himself, he flies to the Church for refuge: another wishes to have interest made for him with one to whom he has little access himself; one in this way, another in that, the Church is daily full of such people. Jesus is hardly sought for Jesus' sake.

"Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto everlasting life." What ye seek of me, ye seek for the sake of something else: seek me for my own sake. For He intimates that that food is Himself, which becomes more evident in what follows. "Which the Son of man shall give unto you, for Him hath God the Father sealed." You think all the while that I am getting up to give you to eat that sort of food, which ye take for the satisfying of hunger, and soon forget. Labor not for that food, but for that which endureth unto life eternal. And when He had said, "shall give," He added, "for Him hath God the Father sealed:" that is, for this the Father sealed, namely, that He might give that food; for what is meant by sealed, but impressed a certain something peculiar to Himself? For to seal, is to put a distinguishing mark upon a thing. Whoever seals a thing, puts a mark on it, lest it be confounded with any other. To seal, then, is to put on a mark. All things God has made are common things: something peculiar He has put upon His Son, namely, has begotten Him equal to Himself, that He might be distinguished, and not be reckoned as one of the whole creation.
