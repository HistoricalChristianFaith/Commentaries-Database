What think we? that our Lord wished to insult this master in Israel? He wished him to be born of the Spirit: and no one is born of the Spirit except he is made humble; for this very humility itis, which makes us to be born of the Spirit. He however was inflated with his eminence as amaster, and thought himself of importance because he was a doctor of the Jews. Our Lord then casts down his pride, in order that he may be born of the Spirit.
That is: If you do not believe that I can raise upa temple, which you have thrown down, how can you believe that men can be regenerated bythe Holy Spirit?
