Speaking further of Christ in the same vein, Malachi says, “Behold, I send my angel, and he shall prepare the way before my face. And presently the Lord, whom you seek, and the angel of the testament whom you desire, shall come into the temple. Behold, he comes, says the Lord of hosts. And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? And who shall stand to see him?” In this text he foretells both comings of Christ, the first and the second—the first where he says, “And presently the Lord shall come into his temple.” This refers to Christ’s body, of which he himself said in the Gospel, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” His second coming is foretold in these words: “ ‘Behold, he comes,’ says the Lord of hosts. ‘And who shall be able to think of the day of his coming? And who shall stand to see him?’ ”

“For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God.” John said this, of course, about Christ that he might diminish himself from him. Why? Did not God send John himself? And didn’t John himself say, “I have been sent before him,” and, “He who sent me to baptize with water,” and about him it was said, “Behold, I send my messenger before you and he will prepare the way”? Does not he too speak the words of God, about whom it was said that he was more than a prophet? Therefore if God also sent John, and he speaks the words of God, how, in regard to the distinction [between himself and Christ], do we know that he said about Christ, “For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God”?

Since then it is evident that many are to judge with the Lord but that others are to be judged, not however on equality but according to their deserts, he will come with all his angels. [At the judgment] before him shall be gathered all nations, and among all the angels are to be reckoned those that have been so perfect, that sitting upon twelve thrones they judge the twelve tribes of Israel. For men are called angels; the apostle says of himself, “As an angel of God you received me.” Of John the Baptist it is said, “Behold, I send my angel before your face, who shall prepare your way before you.”
