“In you, Lord, I have taken refuge. I will never be put to shame.” I am terrified, you say, of that confusion that lasts forever. There is a certain temporal confusion that is useful: the disturbance of a soul that realizes its sins, is horrified by what it sees and in that horror is ashamed and corrects what it is ashamed of. For this reason the apostle says, “But what fruit did you reap then of the things of which you are now ashamed?” He says, then, that those who are already believers should blush not for the gifts they have now but for the sins of the past. The Christian does not fear this confusion. Indeed, if he had not known this confusion, he would know the eternal confusion. What is the eternal confusion? When what is said will take place: “Their iniquities will rise up against them to accuse them.” And the entire herd of the wicked, their accusing iniquities before them, will be on the left, as goats separated from the sheep. They will hear, “Be gone, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels.” They will ask, “Why?” “I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat.” They despised the hungry Christ when they did not feed him. They gave him no drink when he was thirsty or clothes when he was naked. They did not take him in when he was a traveler or visit him when he was sick. They thus despised him. When he begins to point out all these sins, they will be covered with confusion, and this confusion will be eternal.
