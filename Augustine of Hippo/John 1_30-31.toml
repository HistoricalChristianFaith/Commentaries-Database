John received the ministry of baptism so that by the water of repentance he might prepare the way for the Lord, not being himself the Lord. But where the Lord was known, it was superfluous to prepare for him the way, for to those who knew him he himself became the way. Therefore the baptism of John did not last long, but [it lasted long enough] to show our Lord’s humility.… And did the Lord need to be baptized? I instantly reply to any one who asks this question: Was it needful for the Lord to be born? Was it needful for the Lord to be crucified? Was it needful for the Lord to die? Was it needful for the Lord to be buried? If he undertook for us so great a humiliation, might he not also receive baptism?…When the Lord was baptized with the baptism of John, the baptism of John ceased. John was then cast into prison. Afterwards we do not find that anyone is baptized with that baptism.… But if John had baptized the Lord alone, some would have thought that the baptism of John was more holy than that of Christ, as if Christ alone had been found worthy to be baptized with the baptism of John, but the human race with that of Christ.… And thus the baptism of the servant would appear greater than the baptism of the Lord. Others were also baptized with the baptism of John, [however,] so that the baptism of John might not appear better than the baptism of Christ. But the Lord also was baptized so that, through the Lord receiving the baptism of the servant, other servants might not disdain to receive the baptism of the Lord. This then is why John was sent.
