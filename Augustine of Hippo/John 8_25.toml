“Who are you,” that we may believe? He answered, “The beginning.” Here is the existence that [always] is. The beginning cannot be changed. The beginning is self-abiding and all-originating, that is, the beginning, to which it has been said, “But you yourself are the same and your years shall not fail.” … Believe me to be the beginning so that you may not die in your sins. By saying, “Who are you?” they had said nothing else than this, “What shall we believe you to be?” He replied, “The beginning,” that is, Believe me to be “the beginning.”

“In the beginning was the Word.” That through which he made things already was. That is how he made what as yet was not. We can understand it, and rightly understand it, in the sense that heaven and earth were made in the only begotten Word itself. They were, you see, made in that through which they were made. This can be, and be understood as, the beginning in which God made heaven and earth. This Word, after all, is also the wisdom of God, about which it is said, “You have made all things in wisdom.” If God made all things in wisdom and his only begotten Son is without a shadow of doubt the wisdom of God, let us not doubt that whatever we have learned was made through the Son was also made in the Son. The Son himself, after all, is certainly the beginning. When the Jews were questioning him and saying, “Who are you? He answered, “The beginning.” And there [in Genesis] you have, “In the beginning God made heaven and earth.”
