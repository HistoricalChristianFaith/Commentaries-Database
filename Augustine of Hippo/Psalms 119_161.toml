We know what persecutions the body of Christ, that is, the holy Church, suffered from the kings of the earth. Let us therefore here also recognise the words of the Church: "Princes have persecuted me without a cause: and my heart has stood in awe of You" [Psalm 119:161]. For how had the Christians injured the kingdoms of the earth, although their King promised them the kingdom of heaven? How, I ask, had they injured the kingdoms of earth? Did their King forbid His soldiers to pay and to render due service to the kings of the earth? Says He not to the Jews who were striving to calumniate Him, "Render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's, and unto God the things that are God's"? [Matthew 22:21] Did He not even in His own Person pay tribute from the mouth of a fish? [Matthew 17:24-26] Did not His forerunner, when the soldiers of this kingdom were seeking what they ought to do for their everlasting salvation, instead of replying, Loose your belts, throw away your arms, desert your king, that you may wage war for the Lord, answer, "Do violence to no man: neither accuse any falsely: and be content with your wages"? [Luke 3:14] Did not one of His soldiers, His most beloved companion,  say to his fellow soldiers, the provincials,  so to speak, of Christ, "Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers"?  Does he not enjoin the Church to pray for even kings themselves? [1 Timothy 2:1-2] How then have the Christians offended against them? What due have they not rendered? In what have not Christians obeyed the monarchs of earth? The kings of the earth therefore have persecuted the Christians without a cause. They too had their threatening words: I banish, I proscribe, I slay, I torture with claws, I burn with fires, I expose to beasts, I tear the limbs piecemeal.  But heed what he has subjoined: "And my heart has stood in awe of Your word." My heart has stood in awe of these words, [Matthew 10:28] "Fear not them that kill the body," etc. I have scorned man who persecutes me, and have overcome the devil that would seduce me.
