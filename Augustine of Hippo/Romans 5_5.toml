Who can hurt such a man? Who can subdue him? In prosperity he makes moral progress, and in adversity he learns to know the progress he has made. When he has an abundance of mutable goods he does not put his trust in them, and when they are taken away he gets to know whether or not they have taken him captive.

It is through love that we are conformed to God, and being so conformed and made like to him, and set apart from the world, we are no longer confounded by those things which should be subject to us. This is the work of the Holy Spirit.

It is not by ourselves but by the Holy Spirit who is given to us that this charity, shown by the apostle to be Godâ€™s gift, is the reason why tribulation does not destroy patience but rather gives rise to it.
