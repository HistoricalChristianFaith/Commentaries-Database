Lastly, the very thing said by our Saviour on the Cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," [Luke 23:34] is expressed in this Psalm below, "I am counted as one of them that go down into the pit" [Psalm 88:4]: by them who knew not what they were doing, when they imagined that He died like other men, subjected to necessity, and overcome by it. The word "pit" is used for the depth of woe or of Hell. "I have been as a man that has no help."
