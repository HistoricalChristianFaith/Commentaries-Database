The Son of God assumed human nature, and in it he endured all that belongs to the human condition. This is a remedy for humanity of a power beyond our imagining. Could any pride be cured, if the humility of God’s Son does not cure it? Could any greed be cured, if the poverty of God’s Son does not cure it? Or any anger, if the patience of God’s Son does not cure it? Or any coldness, if the love of God’s Son does not cure it? Lastly, what fearfulness can be cured, if it is not cured by the resurrection of the body of Christ the Lord? Let humanity raise its hopes and recognize its own nature: let it observe how high a place it has in the works of God. Do not despise yourselves, you men: the Son of God assumed manhood. Do not despise yourselves, you women: God’s Son was born of a woman. But do not set your hearts on the satisfaction of the body, for in the Son of God we are “neither male nor female.” Do not set your heart on temporal rewards: if it were good to do so, that human nature which God’s Son assumed would have set its heart on this. Do not fear insults, crosses and death: for if they did harm humanity, the humanity that God’s Son assumed would not have endured.
