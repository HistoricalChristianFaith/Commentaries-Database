"Sweet are You, O Lord;" or, as many have it, "Sweet are You, even Thou, O Lord" [Psalm 119:68]. Some also, "Sweet are You," or, "Good are You:" as we have before treated of this word: "and in Your sweetness teach me Your statutes." He truly desires to do the righteousnesses of God, since he desires to learn them in His sweetness from Him unto whom he has said, "Sweet are You, O Lord."
