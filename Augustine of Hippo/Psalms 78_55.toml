"And He cast forth from the face of them the nations." And from the face of His faithful. For nations in a manner are the evil spirits of Gentile errors. "And by lot He divided unto them the land in the cord of distribution." And in us "all things one and the same Spirit does work, dividing severally to every one as He wills." [1 Corinthians 12:11]
