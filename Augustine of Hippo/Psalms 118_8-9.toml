But, when my enemies have been brought to contempt, let not my friend present himself unto me as a good man, so as to bid me repose my hope in himself: for "It is better to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in man" [Psalm 118:8]. Nor let any one, who may in a certain sense be styled a good angel, be regarded by myself as one in whom I ought to put my trust: for "no one is good, save God alone;" [Mark 10:18] and when a man or an angel appear to aid us, when they do this of sincere affection, He does it through them, who made them good after their measure. "It is" therefore "better to trust in the Lord, than to put any confidence in princes" [Psalm 118:9]. For angels also are called princes, even as we read in Daniel, "Michael, your prince." [Daniel 12:1]

Moreover, he will destroy every dominion and authority through the express manifestation of the kingdom of the Father so that all may know that no ruler and no authority, whether they are heavenly or earthly, have possessed any dominion and authority of themselves but by him from whom are all things, not only in respect of their existing but also in respect of their ordering. For in that appearing there will remain no hope for anyone in any ruler or in any person. This is said even now by way of prophecy: “It is good to hope in the Lord rather than to hope in people; it is good to hope in the Lord rather than to hope in princes.” Thus, with this meditation, the soul rises up even now to the kingdom of the Father, neither placing much value in the power of anyone besides him, nor, to its own destruction, flattering itself about its own.
