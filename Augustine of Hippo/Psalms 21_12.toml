"For You shall set them low." For You shall rank them among those from whom in degradation and contempt You will turn away. "In Your leavings  You shall make ready their countenance" [Psalm 21:12]. And in these things that Thou leavest, that is, in the desires of an earthly kingdom, You shall make ready their shamelessness for Your passion.
