"And in this we do know Him, if we keep His commandments." What commandments? "He that saith, I know Him, and keepeth not His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him." But still thou askest, What commandments? "But whoso," saith he, "keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected." Let us see whether this same commandment be not called love. For we were asking, what commandments, and he saith, "But whoso keepeth His word, in him verily is the love of God perfected." Mark the Gospel, whether this be not the commandment: "A new commandment," saith the Lord, "give I unto you, that ye love one another."
