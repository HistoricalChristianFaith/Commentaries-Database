"The Lord of Hosts is with us, the God of Jacob is our taker up" [Psalm 46:11]. Miracles are done among the heathen, full filled is the faith of the heathen; burned are the arms of human presumption. Still are they, in tranquillity of heart, to acknowledge God the Author of all their gifts. And after this glorifying, does He yet desert the people of the Jews? Of which says the Apostle, "I say unto you, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened unto Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in." [Romans 11:25] That is, until the mountains be carried hither, the clouds rain here, the Lord here bows the kingdoms with His thunder, "until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in." And what thereafter? "And so all Israel shall be saved." Therefore, here too observing the same order, "I will be exalted" (says He) "among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth;" that is, both in the sea, and in the earth, that now might all say what follows: "the God of Jacob is our taker up."
