"But You, O Lord, be merciful unto Me" [Psalm 41:10]. This is the person of a servant, this is the person of the needy and poor: for,  "Blessed is he that understands upon the needy and poor One." See, as it was spoken, "Be merciful unto Me, and raise Me up, and I will requite them," so is it done. For the Jews slew Christ, lest they should lose their place. [John 11:48] Christ slain, they lost their place. Rooted out of the kingdom were they, dispersed were they. He, raised up, requited them tribulation, He requited them unto admonition, not yet unto condemnation. For the city wherein the people raged, as a ramping and a roaring lion, crying out, "Crucify Him, Crucify Him," [Luke 23:21] the Jews rooted out therefrom, has now Christians, by not one Jew is inhabited.  There is planted the Church of Christ, whence were rooted out the thorns of the synagogue. For truly this fire blazed "as the fire of thorns."  But the Lord was as a green tree. This said Himself, when certain women mourned Christ as dying...."For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in a dry?" When can a green tree be consumed by the fire of thorns? For they blazed as fire among thorns. Fire consumes thorns, but whatsoever green tree it is applied to, is not easily kindled....Yet lest ye think that God the Father of Christ could raise up Christ, that is, the Flesh of His Son, and that Christ Himself, though He be the Word equal with the Father, could not raise up His own Flesh; hear out of the Gospel, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." [John 2:19] "But," said the Evangelist (lest even after this we should doubt), "He spoke of the temple of His Body. Raise Me up, and I will requite them."
