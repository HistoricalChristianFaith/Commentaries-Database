Of course God listens to sinners. But the man who said that had not yet washed the face of his heart in Siloam. The sacrament had already taken place in his eyes, but the benefit of grace had not yet been achieved in his heart. When did this blind man wash the face of his heart? When, after he had been thrown outside by the Jews, the Lord brought him inside into himself. You see, he found him and said to him, as we heard, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” And he answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?” He could already see him, certainly, with his eyes, but with his heart? Not yet. Wait for it; he will see in a moment. Jesus answered him, “I am, I who am talking to you.” Did he hesitate? He washed his face immediately. After all, Siloam was talking to him, “which is translated as ‘the One sent.’ ” Who is the one sent but Christ who frequently asserted, “I do the will of my Father, who sent me”? So he himself was Siloam. The man blind in heart approached, heard, believed, worshiped, washed his face and saw.
