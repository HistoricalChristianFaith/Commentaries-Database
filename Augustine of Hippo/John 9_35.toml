Of course God listens to sinners. But the man who said that had not yet washed the face of his heart in Siloam. The sacrament had already taken place in his eyes, but the benefit of grace had not yet been achieved in his heart. When did this blind man wash the face of his heart? When, after he had been thrown outside by the Jews, the Lord brought him inside into himself. You see, he found him and said to him, as we heard, “Do you believe in the Son of God?” And he answered, “Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?” He could already see him, certainly, with his eyes, but with his heart? Not yet. Wait for it; he will see in a moment. Jesus answered him, “I am, I who am talking to you.” Did he hesitate? He washed his face immediately. After all, Siloam was talking to him, “which is translated as ‘the One sent.’ ” Who is the one sent but Christ who frequently asserted, “I do the will of my Father, who sent me”? So he himself was Siloam. The man blind in heart approached, heard, believed, worshiped, washed his face and saw.

"Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said unto him, Dost thou believe on the Son of God?" Now He washes the face of the heart. "He answered and said, Who is he, Lord, that I might believe on him?" He had been enlightened, but knew not yet the Enlightener. Now in the cleansing of his heart he beholds Him whom in the cleansing of his eye he already sees. What of Christ? Let us hear Him saying, "And thou hast both seen Him, and it is He that talketh with thee." What sayest thou? What doest thou? Already thou hast washed his face by Thy precept; already thou hast sent him to the pool: he has been washed in Siloam. He is now able to recognize Thee; he says, "Lord, I believe." And would we know how he believes? "And he worshipped Him."
