"Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints sing with joyfulness" [Psalm 132:9]. When Thou risest from the dead, and go unto Your Father, let that royal Priesthood be clothed with faith, since "the righteous lives by faith;" [Romans 1:17] and, receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit, let the members rejoice in the hope of resurrection, which went before in the Head: for to them the Apostle says, "Rejoicing in hope." [Romans 12:12]
