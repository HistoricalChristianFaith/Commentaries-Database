"Let Your priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Your saints sing with joyfulness" [Psalm 132:9]. When Thou risest from the dead, and go unto Your Father, let that royal Priesthood be clothed with faith, since "the righteous lives by faith;" [Romans 1:17] and, receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit, let the members rejoice in the hope of resurrection, which went before in the Head: for to them the Apostle says, "Rejoicing in hope." [Romans 12:12]

9. "Let Thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let Thy saints sing with joyfulness" (ver. 9). When Thou risest from the dead, and goest unto Thy Father, let that royal Priesthood be clothed with faith, since "the righteous liveth by faith;" and, receiving the pledge of the Holy Spirit, let the members rejoice in the hope of resurrection, which went before in the Head: for to them the Apostle saith, "Rejoicing in hope."
