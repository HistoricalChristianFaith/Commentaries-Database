This act of our Lord’s is pointed to in the prophets, though the malignant rulers of the Jews did not see in it any fulfillment of prophecy.… Yes, in that nation though reprobate, though blind, there remained still the daughter of Zion, which is Jerusalem.… It is said to her, “Fear not.” … Acknowledge him whom you praise, and do not tremble when he suffers. That is the blood that shall wipe away your sins and redeem your life.
