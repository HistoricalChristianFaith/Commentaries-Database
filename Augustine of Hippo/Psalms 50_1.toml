"The God," therefore, "of gods, the Lord has spoken"  [Psalm 50:1]. Hath spoken many ways. By Angels He has Himself spoken, by Prophets He has Himself spoken, by His own mouth He has Himself spoken, by His faithful He does Himself speak, by our lowliness, when we say anything true, He does Himself speak. See then, by speaking diversely, many ways, by many vessels, by many instruments, yet He does Himself sound everywhere, by touching, moulding, inspiring: see what He has done. For "He has spoken, and has called the world." What world? Africa, perhaps! For the sake of those that say, the Church of Christ is the portion of Donatus. Africa indeed alone He has not called, but even Africa He has not severed. For He that "has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down," leaving out no parts that He has not called, in His calling has found Africa. Let it rejoice therefore in unity, not pride itself in division. We say well, that the voice of the God of gods has come even into Africa, has not stayed in Africa. For "He has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down." There is no place where may lurk the conspiracies of heretics, they have no place wherein they may hide themselves under the shadow of falsehood; for "there is none that can hide himself from the heat thereof."  He that has called the world, has called even the whole world: He that has called the world, has called as much as He has formed. Why do false christs and false prophets rise up against me? Why is it that they strive to ensnare me with captious words, saying, "Lo! Here is Christ, Lo! He is there!" [MatthewÂ 24:23] I hear not them that point out portions: the God of gods has pointed out the whole: "He" that "has called the world from the rising of the sun unto the going down," has redeemed the whole; but has condemned them that lay false claim to  portions.
