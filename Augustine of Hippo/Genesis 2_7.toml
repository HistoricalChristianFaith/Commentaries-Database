First of all, the fact that God formed man from the mud of the earth usually raises a question about the sort of mud it was or the kind of material the term mud signifies. Those enemies of the Old Book [the Manichaeans], looking at everything in a carnal manner and therefore always being in error, bitingly find fault with this point as well, namely, that God formed man from the mud of the earth. For they say, “Why did God make man from mud? Did he lack a better and heavenly material from which he could make man, that he formed him fragile and mortal from this earthly corruption?” To begin with, they do not understand how many meanings either earth or water has in the Scriptures, for mud is a mixture of earth and water. Also we say that the human body began to waste away and to be fragile and mortal after sin. But the Manicheans abhor in our body only the mortality that we merited as punishment. But even if God made man from the mud of this earth, still what is there that is strange or difficult for God in making the human body such that it would not be subject to corruption if, in obedience to God’s commandment, he had not willed to sin? For we say that the beauty of heaven was made from nothing or from formless matter, because we believe that the Maker is almighty. Why is it strange that the almighty Maker could make the body from some sort of mud of the earth so that before sin it afflicted man with no trouble or need and wasted away from no corruption?

Scripture says, “And he breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living soul.” If up to this point there was only the body, we should understand that the soul was at this point joined to the body. Perhaps the soul had been already made but was still as if in the mouth of God, that is, in his truth and wisdom. But it did not depart from there as if separated by places, when it was breathed forth. For God is not contained by place but is present everywhere.

We ought to understand this passage so that we do not take the words “he breathed into him the breath of life, and man became a living soul” to mean that a part, as it were, of the nature of God was turned into the soul of man.… The nature of God is not mutable, does not err and is not corrupted by the stains of vices and sins.… Scripture clearly says that the soul was made by the almighty God and that it is therefore not a part of God or the nature of God.

After his resurrection, when he first appeared to his disciples, he said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” About this giving, then, it was said, “The Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified.” “And he breathed upon their face.” The One who first gave life to man by breathing and raised him up from the mire and by breathing gave a soul to his members is the same One who breathed upon their face that they might rise up from the slime and renounce filthy works.
