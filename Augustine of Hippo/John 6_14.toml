(Tr. xxiv. s. 7) Christ is a Prophet, and the Lord of Prophets; as He is an Angel, and the Lord of Angels. In that He came to announce something, He was an Angel; in that He foretold the future, He was a Prophet; in that He was the Word made flesh, He was Lord both of Angels and Prophets; for none can be a Prophet without the word of God.

Now those men having seen the miracle, said, "This is truly the prophet that is coming into the world:" for perhaps this prophet was meant as one in the nature of Moses. For the Lord had said to Moses, "A prophet will I raise up to them from among their brethren like unto thee." Like, namely, in respect of the flesh, not of majesty. And, indeed, this saying of Moses will be found more fully explained in the gospel, when our Lord spoke of His own words being unbelieved: "If ye believed Moses, ye would believe me; for he wrote of me." It was then, "like unto thee:" Moses fed the people in the desert with manna: this prophet fed the people in the desert with bread; and more bread. The miracle was increased, the prophecy was approved.
