And that this is the opinion either of all or the best of the Platonists can be ascertained by their writings. And regarding the name itself, if they see fit to call such blessed and immortal creatures gods, this need not give rise to any serious discussion between us, since in our own Scriptures we read, “The God of gods, the Lord hath spoken;” and again, “Confess to the God of gods;” and again, “He is a great King above all gods.” And where it is said, “He is to be feared above all gods,” the reason is forthwith added, for it follows, “for all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.” He said, “above all gods,” but added, “of the nations;” that is to say, above all those whom the nations count gods, in other words, demons. By them he is to be feared with that terror in which they cried to the Lord, “Hast Thou come to destroy us?” But where it is said, “the God of gods,” it cannot be understood as the god of the demons; and far be it from us to say that “great King above all gods” means “great King above all demons.”

Then follows, "Give thanks to the God of gods, for His mercy endures for ever" [Psalm 136:2]. "Give thanks to the Lord of lords, for His mercy endures for ever" [Psalm 136:3]. We may well enquire, Who are these gods and lords, of whom He who is the true God is God and Lord? And we find written in another Psalm, that even men are called gods.  The Lord even takes note of this testimony in the Gospel, saying, "Is it not written in your Law, I have said, You are gods?" [John 10:34] ...It is not therefore because they are all good, but because "the word of God came to them," that they were called gods. For were it because they are all good, He would not thus distinguish between them. He says, "He judges between the gods." Then follows, "How long do ye judge iniquity!"  and the rest, which He says certainly not to all, but to some, because He says it in distinguishing, and yet He distinguishes between the gods.
