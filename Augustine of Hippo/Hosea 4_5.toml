For us too, you see, once the night of this age is done, there will be a resurrection of the flesh for the kingdom; it’s the model or sample of this that has already occurred in our head. That, indeed, is why the Lord wished to rise again at night; because, in the apostle’s words, “God, who commanded the light to shine out of the darkness, has shone in our hearts.” So the Lord represented light shining out of darkness by being born at night and also by rising at night. Light out of darkness, in fact, is Christ out of the Jews, to whom it was said, “I have likened your mother to night.” But in that nation, as it were in that night, the virgin Mary was not night but somehow or other a star of the night; which is why a star also signaled her childbearing, guiding a far distant night, that is the magi from the east, to worship the light. Thus in them too would be realized the command to “the light to shine out of darkness.”

“Day continues according to your ordinance.” For all these things are day: “and this is the day which the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it” and “let us walk honestly as in the day.” “For all things serve you.” He said “all things of some,” “all” which belong to this day “serve you.” For the ungodly, of whom it is said, “I have compared thy mother unto the night,” do not serve you.
