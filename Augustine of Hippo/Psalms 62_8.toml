"Hope ye in Him all the council of the people" [Psalm 62:8]. Imitate ye Idithun, leap over your enemies; men fighting against you, stopping up your way, men hating you, leap ye over: "Hope in Him all the council of the people: pour out before Him your hearts:"...By imploring, by confessing, by hoping. Do not keep back your hearts within your hearts: "Pour out before Him your hearts." That perishes not which you pour out. For He is my Taker up. If He takes up, why do you fear to pour out? "Cast upon the Lord your care, and hope in Him."  What fear ye amid whisperers, slanderers hateful to God, [Romans 1:29-30] where they are able openly assailing, where they are unable secretly lying in wait, falsely praising, truly at enmity, amid them what do you fear? "God is our Helper." Do they anywise equal God? Are they anywise stronger than He? "God is our Helper," be ye without care. "If God is for us, who is against us?" [Romans 8:31] "Pour out before Him your hearts," by leaping over unto Him, by lifting up your souls: "God is our helper."

So: "Nobody is able to refrain from sexual intercourse, unless God grants it." You have a gift to protect you from such pleasures; since "this was itself a matter of wisdom, to know whose gift this was; nobody is continent unless God grants it." You have a gift to help you endure pains; since "it is from him," he says, "my patience comes." "So hope in him, every assembly of the people." Hope in him; do not trust in your own powers. Confess your bad things to him; hope for your good things from him. Without his help you will be nothing, however proud you may be. So in order that you may be enabled to be humble, "pour out your hearts before him"; and to avoid remaining wrongly stuck on yourselves, say what comes next: "God is our helper."
