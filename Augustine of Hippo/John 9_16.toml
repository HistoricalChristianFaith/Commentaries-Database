Those [Pharisees] who neither saw nor had yet been anointed said, “This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath.” On the contrary, he kept it because he was without sin; to observe the sabbath spiritually is to have no sin. And this is what God admonishes us when he commends the sabbath, saying, “You shall do no servile work.” … Our Lord tells us above what servile work is: “Whoever commits sin is the servant of sin.” But these men, who neither could see nor were anointed, observed the sabbath carnally but profaned it spiritually.
