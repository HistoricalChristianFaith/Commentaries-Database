“I go away,” he said, “and you shall seek me,” not from any longing for me but in hatred. For after his removal from human sight, he was sought for both by those who hated him and those who loved him; by the former in a spirit of persecution, by the latter with the desire of seizing him.… Accordingly, because the former sought it in this wrong way, with a perverted heart, what did he add next? “You shall seek me, and”—not to let you suppose that you will seek me for good—“you shall die in your sin.” Dying in one’s sins happens to those who seek Christ wrongly. It happens to those who hate the one through whom alone salvation could be found. For while those whose hope is in God should not render evil even for evil, these men were rendering evil for good. The Lord therefore announced to them beforehand and in his foreknowledge uttered the sentence that they should die in their sin. And then he adds, “Where I am going, you cannot come.” He said the same to the disciples also in another place. And yet he did not say to them, “You shall die in your sin.” But what did he say? He said the same as he did to these men: “Where I am going, you cannot come.” He did not take away hope but foretold delay. For at the time when the Lord said this to the disciples, they were not able to come where he was going, yet they were to come afterwards. But these men would never come. And so in his foreknowledge he said to them, “You shall die in your sin.”
