He will make me clearly known by pouring love into the hearts of believers and making them spiritual and thus able to see that the Son whom they had known before only according to the flesh—and who they thought was only a man like themselves—was equal to the Father. Or at least, when his love filled them with boldness and cast out fear, they would proclaim Christ to men and women, and in this way they would spread Christ’s fame throughout the whole world.… For what they were going to do in the power of the Holy Spirit, this the Holy Spirit says he does himself.
