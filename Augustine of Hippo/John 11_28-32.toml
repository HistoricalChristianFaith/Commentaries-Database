(Tr. xlix. 16) Silently, i. e. speaking in a low voice. For she did speak, saying, The Master is come, and calleth for thee.

(Tr. xlix. 16) We may observe that the Evangelist has not said, where, or when, or how, the Lord called Mary, but for brevity's sake has left it to be gathered from Martha's words.

(Tr. xlix. non occ.) So we see, if she had known of His arrival before, she would not have let Martha go without her.
Now Jesus was not yet come into the town, but was in that place where Martha met Him.

(Tr. xlix. 16) The Evangelist mentions this to show how it was that so many were present at Lazarus' resurrection, and witness of that great miracle.
Then when Mary was come where Jesus was, and saw Him, she fell down at His feet.

(de Verb. Dom. s. lii) O faithless assembly! Whilst Thou art yet in the world, Lazarus Thy friend dieth! If the friend dies, what will the enemy suppose? Is it a small thing that they will not serve Thee upon earth? lo, hell hath taken Thy beloved.
