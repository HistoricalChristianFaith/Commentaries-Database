Now will He speak openly of the same Sacrament, whereby He was carried in His Own Hands. "O taste and see that the Lord is good" [Psalm 34:8]. Does not the Psalm now open itself, and show you that seeming insanity and constant madness, the same insanity and sober inebriety of that David, who in a figure showed I know not what, when in the person of king Achis they said to him, How is it?  When the Lord said, "Except a man eat My Flesh and drink My Blood, he shall have no life in him"? [John 6:53] And they in whom reigned Achis, that is, error and ignorance, said; what said they? "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" [John 6:52] If you are ignorant, "Taste and see that the Lord is good:" but if you understand not, you are king Achis: David shall change His Countenance and shall depart from you, and shall quit you, and shall depart.
