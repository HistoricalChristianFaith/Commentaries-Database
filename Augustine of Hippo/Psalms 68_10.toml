"Your animals shall dwell therein" [Psalm 68:10]. "Yours," not their own; to You subject, not for themselves free; for You needy, not for themselves sufficient. Lastly, he continues, "You have prepared in Your own sweetness for the needy, O God." "In Your own sweetness," not in his meetness. For the needy he is, for he has been made weak, in order that he may be made perfect: he has acknowledged himself indigent, that he may be replenished. This is that sweetness, whereof in another place is said, "The Lord shall give sweetness, and our land shall give her fruit:"  in order that a good work may be done not for fear, but for love; not for dread of punishment, but for love of righteousness. For this is true and sound freedom. But the Lord has prepared this for one wanting, not for one abounding, whose reproach is that poverty: of which sort in another place is said, "Reproach to these men that abound, and contempt to proud men."  For those he has called proud, whom he has called them that abound.
