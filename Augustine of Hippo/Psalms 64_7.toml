"Arrows of infants have been made the strokes of them" [Psalm 64:7]. Where is that savageness? Where is that roar of the lion, of the people roaring and saying, "Crucify, Crucify"?  Where are the lyings in wait of men bending the bow? Have not "the strokes of them been made the arrows of infants"? You know in what manner infants make to themselves arrows of little canes. What do they strike, or whence do they strike? What is the hand, or what the weapon? What are the arms, or what the limbs?

12. "Arrows of infants have been made the strokes of them" (ver. 7). Where is that savageness? where is that roar of the lion, of the people roaring and saying, "Crucify, Crucify"? Where are the lyings in wait of men bending the bow? Have not "the strokes of them been made the arrows of infants"? Ye know in what manner infants make to themselves arrows of little canes. What do they strike, or whence do they strike? What is the hand, or what the weapon? what are the arms, or what the limbs?
