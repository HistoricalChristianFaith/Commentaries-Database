"Behold, now, bless ye the Lord, all you servants of the Lord" [Psalm 134:1], "who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God" [Psalm 134:2]. Why has he added, "in the courts"? Courts mean the wider spaces of a house. He who stands in the courts is not straitened, is not confined, in some fashion is enlarged. Remain in this enlargement, and you can love your enemy, because you love not things in which an enemy could straiten you. How can you be understood to stand in the courts? Stand in charity, and you stand in the courts. Breadth lies in charity, straitness in hatred.
