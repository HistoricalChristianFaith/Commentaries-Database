What is the woman? The flesh of Christ. What is the lamp? "I have prepared a lamp for my anointed." Therefore we were sought in order that we might be found; having been found, we speak. Let us not be proud because, before we were found, if we were not sought for, we would have been lost. Therefore let not those whom we love and whom we wish to win over to the peace of the catholic church say to us, "Why do you want us? Why do you seek us if we are sinners?" We seek you precisely that you may not be lost; we seek you because we were sought; we wish to find you because we were found.
