The one whose spirit has been entrusted to God clings to God. God is faithful and will not allow him to be tempted above that which he is able but will make with the temptation a way of escape also, so that he may be able to endure and not be turned back in the day of battle. The one who, instead, glories in himself and not in God—even though he might make a big spectacle out of stretching and bending his bow—is the one who is destined to turn and run in the day of battle. His spirit is not faithful to God, and therefore the Spirit of God is not with him. And, as it is written, “Anyone who has not believed in God will not be protected.”
