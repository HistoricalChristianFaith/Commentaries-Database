“My doctrine,” he says, “is not mine, but his that sent me.” This is the first profundity. For he seems as if in a few words to have spoken contrary things. For he does not say, “This doctrine is not mine” but “My doctrine is not mine.” If it is not yours, then how is it yours? If it is yours, then how is it not yours? For you say both “my doctrine” and “not mine.” For if he had said this doctrine is not mine, there would have been no question.… The subject of inquiry, then, is that which he says: “My, not mine.” This appears to be contrary. What does he mean by “my” and “not mine”? If we carefully look at what the holy Evangelist himself says in the beginning of his Gospel, “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,” this is where the solution of this question hangs. What then is the doctrine of the Father, but the Father’s Word? Therefore, Christ himself is the doctrine of the Father, if he is the Word of the Father. But since the Word cannot be of no one but [must be] of someone, he said both “his doctrine,” namely, himself, and also “not his own” because he is the Word of the Father. For what is so much “yours” as “yourself”? And what is so much not yours as yourself, if what you are is of another?… Therefore, to speak briefly, beloved, it seems to me that the Lord Jesus Christ said, “My doctrine is not mine,” meaning the same thing as if he said, “I am not from myself.”
