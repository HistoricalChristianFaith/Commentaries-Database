Remember the rod of correction and discipline, and do not get conceited and proud when you have been filled with the good things of God's gifts and start grumbling against him; because in his anger he will shatter you with it like a potter's vessel.

"You shall rule them with a rod of iron," with inflexible justice, and "You shall break them like a potter's vessel" [Psalm 2:9]; that is, "You shall break" in them earthly lusts, and the filthy doings of the old man, and whatsoever has been derived and inured from the sinful clay.
