But to the others what? "But You, O God, shall bring them down unto the pit of corruption" [Psalm 55:23]. The pit of corruption is the darkness of sinking under. When blind leads blind, they both fall into a ditch. [Matthew 15:14] God brings them down into the pit of corruption, not because He is the author of their own guilt, but because He is Himself the judge of their iniquities. "For God has delivered them unto the desires of their heart." [Romans 1:24] For they have loved darkness, and not light; they have loved blindness, and not seeing. For behold the Lord Jesus has shone out to the whole world, let them sing in unity with the whole world: "For there is not one that can hide himself from the heat of Him."  But they passing over from the whole to a part, from the body to a wound, from life to a limb cut off, shall meet with what, but going into the pit of corruption?
