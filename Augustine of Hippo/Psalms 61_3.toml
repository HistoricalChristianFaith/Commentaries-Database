It is clear that this obligation and condition of life includes not only those who have responded so well to sound advice that they have sold their goods and distributed them to the poor, and, with their shoulders freed of every worldly burden, bear the light yoke of Christ. They also include the weaker soul, who is less capable of such glorious perfection but who nevertheless remembers that he is a Christian when he hears that he must give up Christ or lose all his possessions. He will rather lay hold on the "tower of strength against the face of the enemy" because, when he was building it by his faith, he took into account the charges with which it could be completed. He embraced the faith with the intention of renouncing this world, not in word only, because, if he bought something he was as one not possessing it, and if he used this world he was as one not using it, not placing his hope in the uncertainty of riches but in the living God.
