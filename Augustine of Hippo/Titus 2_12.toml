But there is a great and general fasting, which is perfect fasting, to abstain from the iniquities and illicit pleasures of the world: “that, denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we may live soberly and justly and godly in this world.” What reward does the apostle add to this fasting? He continues and says, “Looking for that blessed hope and the manifestation of the glory of the blessed God and Savior, Jesus Christ.” Therefore, in this world we celebrate, so to speak, a Lent of abstinence when we live well, when we abstain from iniquities and illicit pleasures. But because this abstinence will not be without a wage, we look for “that blessed hope.” In that hope, when reality shall have come to pass from hope, we shall receive a denarius as a wage.

Paul must receive, embrace and observe, without any reserve, those commandments of the law which help to form the character of the faithful, such as that “denying ungodliness and worldly desires, we should live soberly and justly and godly in this world” and “Thou shalt not covet,” chosen by the apostle as the part of the law worthy of the greatest commendation; and also the commandments about loving God and our neighbor, as set forth in the law without any figure or mystery.… But whatever progress he makes in them he must not attribute it to himself but to “the grace of God by Jesus Christ our Lord.” Letters 196.2.8.Fulgentius of Ruspe: The apostle Paul exclaims in a similar way: “Be imitators of God as his dear children.” What will we reply to these words, brethren, or what excuse will we be able to have? If someone tells you that you should imitate the powers which our Lord exercised, there is a reasonable excuse for you, because not everyone is given the grace to exercise those powers and to work miracles. But to live piously and chastely, to preserve charity with all men, with God’s help is possible for everyone.
