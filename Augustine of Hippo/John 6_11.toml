(Tr. xxiv. s. 1.) He multiplied in His hands the five loaves, just as He produces harvest out of a few grains. There was a power in the hands of Christ; and those five loaves were, as it were, seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.

(Tr. xxiv. s. 5) By the act of breaking He multiplied the five loaves. The five books of Moses, when expounded by breaking, i. e. unfolding them, made many books.

(lib. lxxxiii. Quæst. qu. 61) Our Lord by breaking, as it were, what was hard in the Law, and opening what was shut, that time when He opened the Scriptures to the disciples after the resurrection, brought the Law out in its full meaning.

For who now feeds the whole world, but He who out of a few seeds creates the harvests? He wrought, therefore, as God. For by the same power whereby He multiplies the stores of grain from a few seeds, did He multiply in His hands the five loaves. For power was in the hands of Christ, and those five loaves were as seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.
