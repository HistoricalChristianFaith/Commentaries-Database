The testimonies of God are kept, while they are not denied. This is the office of Martyrs, for testimonies are called Martyria in Greek. But since it profits nothing, even to be burnt with flames without charity, [1 Corinthians 13:3] he adds, "and I have loved them exceedingly."...For he who loves, keeps them in the Spirit of truth and faithfulness. But generally, while the commandments of God are kept, they against whose will they are kept become our foes: then, indeed, His testimonies also must be kept courageously, lest they be denied when the enemy persecutes. After the Psalmist, then, had declared that he had done both these things, he ascribes unto God his having been enabled to do so, by adding, "because all my ways are in Your sight." He says therefore, "I have kept Your commandments and Your testimonies; because all my ways are in Your sight" [Psalm 119:168]. As much as to say, Had You turned away Your face from me, I should have been confounded, nor could I keep Your commandments and testimonies. "I have kept them," then, because "all my ways are in Your sight." With a look favouring and aiding man, he meant it to be understood that God sees his ways: according to the prayer, "O hide not Thou Your face from me.". ..
