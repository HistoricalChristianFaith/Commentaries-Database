"An alien I have become to My brethren, and a stranger to the sons of My mother" [Psalm 69:8]. To the sons of the Synagogue He became a stranger...Why so? Why did they not acknowledge? Why did they call Him an alien? Why did they dare to say, we know not whence He is? "Because the zeal of Your House has eaten Me up:" that is, because I have persecuted in them their own iniquities, because I have not patiently borne those whom I have rebuked, because I have sought Your glory in Your House, because I have scourged them that in the Temple dealt unseemly: [John 2:15] in which place also there is quoted, "the zeal of Your House has eaten Me up." Hence an alien, hence a Stranger; hence, we know not whence He is. They would have acknowledged whence I am, if they had acknowledged that which You have commanded. For if I had found them keeping Your commandments, the zeal of Your House would not have eaten Me up. "And the reproaches of men reproaching You have fallen upon Me." Of this testimony Paul the Apostle has also made use (there has been read but now the very lesson), and says, "Whatsoever things aforetime have been written, have been written that we might be instructed." [Romans 15:4] ...Why "You"? Is the Father reproached, and not Christ Himself? Why have "the reproaches of men reproaching You fallen upon Me"? Because, "he that has known Me, has known the Father also:" [John 14:9] because no one has reviled Christ without reviling God: because no one honours the Father, except he that honours the Son also. [John 5:23]
