First we had to be persuaded how much God loved us, in case out of sheer despair we lacked the courage to reach up to him. Also we had to be shown what sort of people we are that he loves, in case we should take pride in our own worth and so bounce even further away from him and sink ever more under our own strength. So he dealt with us in such a way that we could progress rather in his strength; he arranged it so that the power of love should be brought to perfection in the weakness of humility. This is the meaning of the psalm where it says, “O God, you are setting apart a voluntary rain for your inheritance, and it has been weakened; but you have perfected it.” What he means by voluntary rain is nothing other than grace, which is not paid out as earned but given gratis; that is why it is called grace. He was not obliged to give it because we deserved it; he gave it voluntarily because he wished to. Knowing this, we will put no trust in ourselves, and that is what to be weakened means. He however perfects us—as he said to the apostle Paul, “my grace is enough for you; strength is made perfect in weakness.” So we needed to be persuaded how much God loves us, and what sort of people he loves; how much case we despaired, what sort in case we grew proud.
