But since, on the ground that the Mediator between God and humanity, the man Christ Jesus, has become head of the church, they are his members. Therefore he says in the words that follow, “And for their sakes I sanctify myself.” For what does he mean by the words “and for their sakes I sanctify myself” but I sanctify them in myself, since they also are myself? For those of whom he speaks in this way are, as I have said, his members. And the head and body are one Christ. … And to be assured of the certainty of this in the present passage, listen to what follows. For after saying, “and for their sakes I sanctify myself”—to let us understand that he thereby meant that he would sanctify them in himself—he immediately added, “that they also may be sanctified in the truth.” And what else is this but in me, in accordance with the fact that the truth is that Word in the beginning that is God?
