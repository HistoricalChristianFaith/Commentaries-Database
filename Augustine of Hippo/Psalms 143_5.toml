But we too were there. He goes to the members. "I have called to mind the days of old" [Psalm 143:5]. Did He "call to mind the days of old," by whom every day was made? No, but the body speaks, each one who has been justified by His grace, who dwells in Him in love and devout humility, speaks and says, "I have meditated upon all Your works:" plainly because You have made all things good, and nothing would have stood fast, which was not established by You.

Think not then that you yourself doest anything, save in so far as you are evil...."Work out your own salvation," says the Apostle, "with fear and trembling." [Philippians 2:12-13] If we do work out our own salvation, wherefore with fear, wherefore with trembling, when what we work is in our own power? Hear wherefore with fear and trembling: "for it is God that works in you both to will and to do, of His good pleasure." Therefore "with fear and trembling," that it may delight our Maker to work in the lowly valley....
