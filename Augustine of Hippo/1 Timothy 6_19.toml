Through love of this true life you ought to consider yourself desolate in this world, no matter what happiness you enjoy. That is the true life in comparison with which this other, which is so much loved, is not to be called life, however pleasant and prolonged it may be. Similarly, that is the true comfort which God promised by the prophet saying, “I will give them true comfort, peace upon peace.” Without this comfort there is more grief than consolation to be found in earthly comforts, whatever they may be.
