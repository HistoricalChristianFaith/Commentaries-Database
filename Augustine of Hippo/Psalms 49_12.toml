"And man though he was in honour perceived not, he was compared to the beasts without sense, and was made like to them" [Psalm 49:12]....They ought, on the contrary, to have made ready for themselves an eternal house in good works, to have made ready for themselves everlasting life, to have sent before them expenditure, to have followed their works, to have ministered to a needy companion, to have given to him with whom they were walking, not to have despised Christ covered with sores before their gate, who has said, "Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these My brethren, you have done it unto Me." [Matthew 25:40] However, "man being in honour has not understood." What is, "being in honour"? Being made after the image and likeness of God, man is preferred to beasts. For God has not so made man as He made a beast: but God has made man for beasts to minister to: is it to his strength then, and not to his understanding? Nay. But he "understood not;" and he who was made after the image of God, "is compared to the beasts without sense, and is made like them." Whence it is said elsewhere, "Be not like to horse and mule, in which there is no understanding."

The true honor of humankind is to be the image and the likeness of God that is preserved only in relation to him by whom it is impressed. Thus, he clings to God so much the more, the less he loves what is his own. But through the desire of proving his own power, a person by his own will falls down into himself, as into a sort of center. Since he, therefore, wishes to be like God under no one, then as a punishment he is also driven from the center, which he himself is, into the depths, that is, into those things in which the beasts delight; and thus, since the likeness to God is his honor, the likeness to the beasts is his disgrace.

Read and understand these words, that you may rather with a humble spirit guard against the reproach yourself, than arrogantly throw it out against another person.
