[The word] pascha is not, as some think, a Greek word, but a Hebrew one; yet most conveniently there occurs in this name a certain congruity between the two languages. Because in Greek [the word for] “to suffer” is paschein. For this reason “pascha” has been thought of as a passion, as though this name has been derived from [a Greek word for] “suffering.” But in its own language, that is, in Hebrew, “pascha” means “a passing over.” For this reason the people of God celebrated the pascha for the first time when, fleeing from Egypt, they “passed over” the Red Sea. So now that prophetic figure has been fulfilled in truth when Christ is led as a sheep to the slaughter. By his blood, after our doorposts have been smeared [with it], that is, by the sign of his cross, after our foreheads have been marked [with it], we are freed from the ruin of this world as though from the captivity or destruction in Egypt. And we effect a most salutary passing over when we pass over from the devil to Christ and from this tottering world to his most solidly established kingdom. And therefore we pass over to God who endures so that we may not pass over with the passing world.
