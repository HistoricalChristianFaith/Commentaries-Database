We have just been singing to God, “This is the day that the Lord has made.” Let us talk about it, seeing that the Lord has presented us with it. This obviously prophetic Scripture wanted us to understand something, some day not of the common sort, not visible to eyes of flesh; not the kind of day that has a sunrise and sunset but a day that could know a dawn but never know a setting. Let us see what the same psalm had said just before: “The stone that the builders rejected, this has been made into the head of the corner. It was made by the Lord; this is wonderful in our eyes.” And it continues, “This is the day that the Lord has made.” Let us take the cornerstone as introducing us to this day.
