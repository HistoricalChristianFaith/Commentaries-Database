But in this faith, though the heathen rage furiously, and the people imagine a vain thing:  though the flesh be slain while it preaches You: "My soul shall live, and shall praise You: and Your judgments shall help me" [Psalm 119:175]. These are those judgments, which it was time should begin at the house of the Lord. [1 Peter 4:17] But "they will help me," he says. And who cannot see how much the blood of the Church has aided the Church? How great a harvest has risen in the whole world from that sowing?
