Psalm 79 [LXX] is similarly titled “For the things that shall be changed.” In this psalm, among other things, is written, “look down from heaven and see; visit this vineyard and perfect what your right hand has planted and on the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself.” This is the vineyard of which it is said, “You have brought a vineyard out of Egypt.” Christ did not plant another; by his coming he changed that one into a better vineyard. Accordingly, we find in the Gospel: “He will utterly destroy those evil men, and will let out the vineyard to other vine dressers.” The Gospel does not say, “He will uproot and will plant another,” but “this same vineyard he will let out to other vine dressers.” The city of God and congregation of the children of promise must be filled with the same community of saints by the death and succession of mortal beings and at the end of the world will receive its due immortality in all people. This same thought is expressed differently by means of the fruitful olive tree in another psalm, which says, “But I as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God, have hoped in the mercy of God forever, yea, for ever and ever.” It was not because the unbelievers and the proud had been broken away and the branches were on that account unfruitful and the wild olive of the Gentiles was ingrafted that the root of the patriarchs and prophets died. Isaiah says, “For if your people, O Israel, shall be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved,” but through him about whom the psalm says, “and on the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself,” and about whom is reiterated, “Let your hand be on the man of your right hand: and on the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself. And we depart not from you.” Through this Son of man, Christ Jesus, and from his remnant, that is, the apostles and the many others from among the Israelites who have believed in Christ as God, and with the increasing number of Gentiles, the holy vineyard is being completed. Thus, in the passing of the old rites and in the institution of the new, the title of the psalm, “For the things that shall be changed,” is fulfilled.

This grace he has placed in him “in whom we have obtained our lot, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things.” And accordingly, just as he likewise brings it about that we should approach him, he brings it about that we not depart from him. For this reason it was said to him by the prophet, “Let your hand be on the man of your right hand, and on the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself, and we depart not from you.” This man is certainly not the first Adam, in whom we departed from God, but the second Adam, on whom is placed the hand of God, that we not depart from him. For Christ is complete, with all his members, because of the church, which is his body and his fullness. So when the hand of God is on him, that we not depart from God, then the work of God (for this is what is meant by his hand) reaches indeed to us. For in Christ “we have obtained our lot, being predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things.” Therefore it is by God’s hand, not our own, that we depart not from God. This is his hand, I say, who declared, “I will put fear of me into their hearts, that they may not revolt from me.”
