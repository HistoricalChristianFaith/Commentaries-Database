See that he was God, equal with the Father. My brothers, the apostle says, “who raised him from the dead.” About whom is he speaking? About the Father. He says, “He became obedient unto death, even to death on a cross. For this reason, God also has raised him from the dead and has given him the name that is above every name.” The Lord was raised up again and exalted. He raised him up again. Who? The Father, to whom he said in the Psalms, “Raise me up, and I shall requite them.” Therefore the Father raised him up again. Did he [the Son] not raise himself? But what does the Father do without the Word? What does the Father do without his only One? For hear that he also was God: “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” Did he say, “Destroy the temple which the Father will raise up in three days”? But just as when the Father raises up, the Son, too, raises up; so also when the Son raises up, the Father, too, raises up, because the Son said, “I and the Father are one.”
