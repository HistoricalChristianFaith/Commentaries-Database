The apostle says, “God commends his charity toward us, because when as yet we were sinners, Christ died for us. Much more now that we are justified in his blood shall we be saved through him from the wrath.” Of this wrath he says, “We were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.” Of this wrath Jeremiah says, “Cursed be the day when I was born.” Of this wrath holy Job says, “Let the day perish wherein I was born.” Of this wrath the same Job says again, “Man born of a woman, living for a short time, is filled with many miseries.”
