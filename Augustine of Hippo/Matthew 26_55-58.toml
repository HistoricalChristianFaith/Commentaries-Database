(Cons. Ev. iii. 6.) They that had laid hold on Jesus led Him away to Caiaphas the High Priest. But He was first taken to Annas, father-in-law to Caiaphas, as John relates. And He was taken bound, there being with that multitude a tribune and cohort, as John also records. (John 18:12.)

(Qu√¶st. Ev. i. 46.) And also that the Church should follow, i. e. imitate, the Lord's Passion, but with great difference. For the Church suffers for itself, but Christ for the Church.
