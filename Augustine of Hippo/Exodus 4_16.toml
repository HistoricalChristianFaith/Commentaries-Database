One should notice that when Moses is sent to the people, God does not say to him, “Behold, I gave you as a god to the people, and your brother will be your prophet,” but he says, “[Your brother] will speak to the people for you.” For Scripture had said, “He will be your mouth, and you will be to him as God.” It did not say, “You are god to him.” But to Pharaoh Moses is said to be given as god, and according to analogy, Aaron is a prophet of Moses, but to Pharaoh. Here it is suggested to us that prophets of God say what they hear from him. A prophet of God is nothing but one who speaks the words of God to men—those who either cannot hear God or do not deserve to.
