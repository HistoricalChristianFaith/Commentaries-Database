Let no man, set in Christ's body, imagine these words to be alien from himself, since in truth it is the whole body of Christ placed in this humble state that speaks: "O consider my humiliation, and deliver me: for I forget not Your law" [Psalm 119:153]. In this place we cannot understand any law of God so suitably, as that whereby it is immutably determined that "every one that exalts himself, shall be abased; and every one that humbles himself; shall be exalted."
