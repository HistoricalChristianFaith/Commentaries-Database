"Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord:" one nation is blessed, belonging to the heavenly city, which has not chosen save the Lord for their God: "And the people whom He has chosen for His own inheritance" [Psalm 33:12]: and which not of itself, but by the gift of God, has been chosen, that He by possessing it may not suffer it to be uncared for and miserable.

12. "Blessed is the nation whose God is the Lord:" one nation is blessed, belonging to the heavenly city, which hath not chosen save the Lord for their God: "And the people whom He hath chosen for His own inheritance" (ver. 12): and which not of itself, but by the gift of God, hath been chosen, that He by possessing it may not suffer it to be uncared for and miserable.
