It is then whole Christ who speaks. "I will exalt You, O Lord, for You have taken Me up" [Psalm 30:1]. I will praise Your high Majesty, O Lord, for You have taken Me up. "You have not made Mine enemies to rejoice over Me." And those, who have so often endeavoured to oppress Me with various persecutions throughout the world, You have not made to rejoice over Me.
