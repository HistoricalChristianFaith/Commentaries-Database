Next follows, "His seed shall be mighty upon earth" [Psalm 112:2]. The Apostle witnesses, that the works of mercy are the seed of the future harvest, when he says, "Let us not be weary in well doing, for in due season we shall reap;" [Galatians 6:9] and again, "But this I say, He which sows sparingly, shall reap also sparingly." [2 Corinthians 9:6] But what, brethren, is more mighty than that not only Zacchaeus should buy the kingdom of Heaven by the half of his goods, [Luke 19:8] but even the widow for two mites, [Mark 12:42] and that each should possess an equal share there? What is more mighty, than that the same kingdom should be worth treasures to the rich man, and a cup of cold water to the poor?

Your fourth question is, "Why David said, 'His seed shall be mighty on the earth, the generation of the righteous shall be blessed,' when we know that the children of the just were and are cursed and those of the unjust were and are blessed." I answer this question from an exposition of the same psalm that I gave to the people. For, "Blessed is the one who fears the Lord; he shall delight exceedingly in his commandments." God, who alone judges rightly and mercifully, shall see how much he excels in his commandments, since, as holy Job says, "The life of [a person] on earth is a warfare." And again it is written, "For the corruptible body is a load on the soul, and the earthly habitation presses down the mind that muses on many things." But he who judges us is the Lord, and we should not judge before the time until the Lord shall come and bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the heart. Then shall each person have praise from God. Therefore, [God] shall see how much each person excels in his commandments, yet each person shall delight exceedingly who truly loves the peace of the cobuilding, nor should each person despair now, since "in his commandments he shall delight exceedingly," and there will be "peace in the land to men of good will."
