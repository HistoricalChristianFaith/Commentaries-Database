If you are born of the Spirit, you too shall be like the Spirit, that is, that one who is not born of the Spirit does not know where you come from or where you go.

Do we think that the Lord meant to insult this master of the Jews? The Lord knew what he was doing. He wanted the man to be born of the Spirit. No one is born of the Spirit if he is not humble, for humility itself makes us born of the Spirit since “the Lord is near to those who are of a broken heart.” The man was puffed up with his mastery, and it appeared of some importance to him that he was a teacher of the Jews. Jesus pulled down his pride so that he might be born of the Spirit.
