"I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice and sing" [Psalm 132:16]. We are now at the end of the Psalm; attend for a short space, Beloved. "I will clothe her priests with salvation, and her saints shall rejoice and sing." Who is our salvation, save our Christ? What means, therefore, "I will clothe her priests with salvation"? "As many of you as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ." [Galatians 3:27] "And her saints shall rejoice and sing." Whence shall they rejoice and sing? Because they have been clothed with salvation: not in themselves. For they have become light, but in the Lord; for they were darkness before. [Ephesians 5:8] Therefore he has added, "There will I raise up the horn of David" [Psalm 132:17]: this will be David's height, that trust be put in Christ. For horn signifies height: and what sort of height? Not carnal. Therefore, while all the bones are wrapped up in flesh, the horn goes beyond the flesh. Spiritual altitude is a horn. But what is spiritual loftiness, save to trust in Christ? Not to say, It is my work, I baptize;  but, "He it is who baptizes." [John 1:33] There is the horn of David: and that you may know that there is the horn of David, heed what follows: "I have ordained a lantern for mine Anointed." What is a lantern? You already know the Lord's words concerning John: "He was a burning and a shining light." [John 5:35] And what says John? "He it is who baptizes." Herein therefore shall the saints rejoice, herein the priests shall rejoice: because all that is good in themselves, is not of themselves, but of Him who has the power of baptizing. Fearlessly therefore does every one who has received baptism come unto His temple; because it is not man's, but His who made the horn of David to flourish.
