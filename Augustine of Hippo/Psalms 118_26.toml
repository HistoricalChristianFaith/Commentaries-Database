"Blessed be He that comes in the Name of the Lord" [Psalm 118:26]. Cursed, therefore, is he that comes in his own name; as He says in the Gospel: "if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive." [John 5:43] "We have blessed you out of the house of God." I believe that these are the words of the great to the little, of those great ones, to wit, who in spirit commune with God the Word, who is with God, as they may in this life; and yet temper their discourse for the sake of the little ones, so that they may sincerely say what the Apostle says: "For whether we be beside ourselves, it is to God: or whether we be sober, it is for your cause. For the love of Christ constrains us." [2 Corinthians 5:13-14] They bless the little children from the inner house of the Lord, where that praise fails not age after age: consider therefore what they proclaim from thence.
