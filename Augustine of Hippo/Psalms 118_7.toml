text = '''Hear therefore what follows: "The Lord is my helper: therefore shall I despise mine enemies." From what class soever my enemies may arise, whether from the number of evil men, or from the number of evil angels; in the Lord's help, unto whom we chant the confession of praise, unto whom we sing Allelujah, they shall be despised.'''
