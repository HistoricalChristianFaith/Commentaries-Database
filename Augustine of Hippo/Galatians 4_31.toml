Let us consider whether we should say that the righteous people of old were children of the slave woman or the free. But God forbid that they should be the slave woman’s. If therefore they are the free woman’s, they belong to the new covenant in the Holy Spirit, whose lifegiving power the apostle contrasts with “the letter that kills.”
