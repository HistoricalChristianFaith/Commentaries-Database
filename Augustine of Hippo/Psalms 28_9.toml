"Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance" [Psalm 28:9]. I intercede therefore, after My Flesh has flourished again, because You have said, "Desire of Me, and I will give You the heathen for Your inheritance;"  "Save Your people, and bless Your inheritance:" for "all Mine are Yours." [JohnÂ 17:10] "And rule them, and set them up even for ever." And rule them in this temporal life, and raise them from hence into life eternal.
