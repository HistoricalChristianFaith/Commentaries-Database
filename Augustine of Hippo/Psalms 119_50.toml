"The same is my comfort in my humiliation" [Psalm 119:50]. Namely, that hope which is given to the humble, as the Scripture says: "God resists the proud, but gives grace unto the humble."  Whence also our Lord Himself says with His own lips, "For whosoever exalts himself shall be abased; and he that humbles himself shall be exalted."  We well understand here that humiliation also, not whereby each man humbles himself by confessing his sins, and by not arrogating righteousness to himself; but when each man is humbled by some tribulation or mortification which his pride deserved; or when he is exercised and proved by endurance; [Sirach 2:4-5] whence a little after this Psalm says, "Before I was troubled, I went wrong."...And the Lord Jesus, when He foretold that this humiliation would be brought upon His disciples by their persecutors, did not leave them without a hope; but gave them one, whereby they might find comfort, in these words: "In your patience shall you possess your souls;" and declared even of their very bodies, which might be put to death by their enemies, and seemingly be utterly annihilated, that not a hair of their heads should perish. [Luke 21:17-18] This hope was given to Christ's Body, that is, to the Church, that it might be a comfort to Her in her humiliation....This hope He gave in the prayer which He taught us, where He enjoined us to say, "Lead us not into temptation:" [Matthew 6:13] for He in a manner implicitly promised that He would give to His disciples in their danger that which He taught them to ask for in their prayers. And indeed this Psalm is rather to be understood to speak of this hope: "For Your word has quickened me." Which they have rendered more closely who have put not "word," but "utterance." For the Greek has λόγιον, which is "utterance;" not λόγος, which is "word."
