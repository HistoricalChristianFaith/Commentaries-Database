"And You have girded me with strength to the war" [Psalm 18:39]. And the loose desires of my flesh have You bound up with strength, that in such a fight I may not be encumbered. "You have supplanted under me them that rose up against me." You have caused them to be deceived, who followed upon me, that they should be brought under me, who desired to be over me.
