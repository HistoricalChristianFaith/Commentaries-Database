Petilianus said, “We must consider, I say, and declare how far the treacherous traditor5 is to be considered dead while he was still living. Judas was an apostle when he betrayed Christ; and the same man was already dead, having spiritually lost the office of an apostle, being destined afterwards to die by hanging himself, as it is written: “I have sinned,” he says, “ ‘ in that I have betrayed innocent blood’; and he departed, went out, and hanged himself.” The traitor perished by the rope: he left the rope for others like himself, of whom the Lord Christ cried aloud to the Father, “Father, those that you gave me I have kept, and none of them is lost, but the son of perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled.” For David of old had passed this sentence on him who was to betray Christ to the unbelievers: “Let another take his office. Let his children be fatherless and his wife a widow.” See how mighty is the spirit of the prophets, that it was able to see all future things as though they were present, so that a traitor who was to be born hereafter should be condemned many centuries before. Finally, that the said sentence should be completed, the holy Matthias received the bishopric of that lost apostle. Let no one be so dull, no one so faithless, as to dispute this: Matthias won for himself a victory, not a wrong, in that he carried off the spoils of the traitor from the victory of the Lord Christ.
