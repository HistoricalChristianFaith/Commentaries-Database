That he will gather his elect from the four winds means from the whole world. For Adam himself, as I have shown, signifies in Greek the whole world, with the four letters (a, d, a, m). As the Greeks think of these matters, the four quarters of the world have these initial letters, Anatole (east), Dysis (west), Arktos (north), and Mesembria (south). Adam after the fall has been scattered over the whole world. He was in one place, but fell, and as if crushed in tiny pieces, his progeny filled the whole world. But the mercy of God is gathering together the fragments from every side and is forging them together by the fire of love, and making one what was pulverized. That incomparable artist knew just how to do this. So let no one despair. This indeed is a great work of art. But reflect upon who the artist is. The very one who made shall restore. The one who formed shall reform. Where finally shall we come to know righteousness and truth? He will gather together his elect with him to the judgment, and the rest will be separated out.

De Civ. Dei, xx, 19: For then shall Satan be unchained, and work through Antichrist in all his power, wonderfully indeed, but falsely. But a doubt is often raised whether the Apostle said “signs and lying wonders,” because he is to deceive mortal sense, by phantoms, so as to appear to do what he does not, or because those wonders themselves, even though true, are to turn men aside to lies, because they will not believe that any power but a Divine power could do them, being ignorant of the power of Satan, especially when he shall have received such power as henever had before. But for whichever reason it is said, they shall be deceived by those signs and wonders who deserve to be deceived.
Epist., 78: For He did not onlyforetel to His disciples the good things which He would give to His saints and faithful ones, but also the woes in which this world was to abound, that wemight look for our reward at the end of the world with more confidence, from feeling the woes in like manner announced as about to precede the end of the world.
Epist., cxcix, 11: For since it was said by the Angels to the Apostles, “He shall so come in like manner as yehave seen Him go into heaven,” rightly do we believe that He willcome not only in the same body, but on a cloud, since He is to come as He went away, and a cloud received Him as He was going.
de Trin., i, 13: For the vision of the Son of Man is shown even to the bad, but the vision of the form of Godto the pure in heart alone, “for they shall see God.” And because the wicked cannot see the Son of God, as He is in the form of God, equal to the Father, and at the same time both just and wicked are to see Him as Judge of the quick and dead, before Whom they shall be judged, it was necessary that the Son of Man should receive power to judge. Concerning the execution of which power, there is immediately added, “And then shall He send He angels.”
