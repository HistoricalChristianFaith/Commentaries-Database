(Tr. xxiv. s. 6) And what are the fragments, but the parts which the people could not eat? An intimation, that those deeper truths, which the multitude cannot take in, should be entrusted to those who are capable of receiving them, and afterwards teaching them to others; as were the Apostles. For which reason twelve baskets were filled with them.

And what are the fragments, but things which the multitude could not eat? Some secret meanings, then, are to be understood, which the multitude cannot receive; what remains but that they be entrusted to those who are able also to teach others, as were the apostles? For which reason, twelve baskets were filled. A wonderful thing was wrought, and a mighty deed; but if one intently consider it, it is as the works of God. He who out of a few grains multiplies the harvests, multiplied the five loaves in His hands.
