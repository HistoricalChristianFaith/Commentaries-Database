“He smelled his clothes and said, ‘Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of an abundant field, which the Lord has blessed.’ ” This field is the church. Let’s prove that the church is a field. Listen to the apostle telling the faithful: “You are God’s tilled field; you are God’s building.” Not only is the church a field, but also God is the tiller of the field. Listen to the Lord himself: “I am the vine, you the branches, and my Father is the vinedresser.” Toiling in this field as a laborer and hoping for an eternal reward, the apostle claims no credit for himself, except a laborer’s due. “I planted,” he says, “Apollo watered, but God gave the increase. And so neither the one who plants is anything, nor the one who waters, but God who gives the increase.” Notice how Paul safeguards humility to make sure of belonging to Jacob, to that field which is the church, and of not losing the robe whose scent was as the smell of an abundant field. He does not pass over to the pride of Esau, materialistic in thought and abounding in arrogance. So the smell of the field comes from the garment of the son. But this field is nothing in itself. That’s why he added, “which the Lord has blessed. And the Lord will give you from the dew of heaven above and from the fruitfulness of the earth, and quantities of corn and wine. And nations will serve you, and you shall be lord of your brother, and the sons of your father shall pay you homage. Whoever curses you shall be cursed, and whoever blesses you shall be blessed.” That is the blessing of Jacob. If Esau had not been blessed too, there would be no problem. But he is blessed too, not with this blessing, and yet one not altogether different from this one.

What advice does Rebekah give? That Jacob should take the skins of the kids and go to his father. The father is expecting the elder and blesses the younger. The Old Testament has the Jews in mind according to its literal meaning, and by the spiritual understanding of it, it is a blessing to Christians. Would your holinesses please concentrate on this great mystery, this great sacrament.Isaac says, “Your brother came with guile” about a man without guile. Isaac undoubtedly knew what was happening since he had the spirit of prophecy, and he himself was acting symbolically. He stakes everything on the sublime truths being symbolically, sacramentally enacted. For if he hadn’t known what he was doing, he would surely have been angry with his son for deceiving him. The elder comes and says, “Here, father, eat; I have done just as you ordered me.” He says, “Who are you?” He replies, “I am your elder son, Esau.” “And who is the one,” Isaac says, “at whose hands I have already eaten, and I blessed him, and blessed he shall be?” He seemed to be angry; Esau was expecting from his lips some sort of curse upon his brother. While he is expecting a curse, Isaac confirms the blessing. What splendid anger, what marvelous indignation! But he knew the mystery being enacted. The blindness of his bodily eyes stood for the mental blindness of the Jews. But the eyes of his heart were able to see the sublimity of the mysteries being unfolded.
