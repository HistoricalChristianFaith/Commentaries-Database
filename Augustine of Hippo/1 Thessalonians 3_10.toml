But every discourse on this topic, where one’s goal is that what is said may not only be believed but also understood and known, is burdensome for those still spiritually immature. These the apostle says are carnal, needing to be nourished with milk, as they do not have the strength to perceive such things and are more easily frustrated than fed. Because of this it happens that spiritual men do not in all circumstances refuse to discuss these things with the carnal, on account of the Catholic faith, which must be preached to all. Yet, having the desire to transmit some degree of truth to understandings not capable of a secure grasp, they take care to transmit these in a way that does not cause their discourse to be regarded with disdain and the truth contained therein to be completely ignored. Thus, in order to continue to nourish them despite their immaturity, [the apostle], writing to the Colossians, says, “Even if I am absent in body, in spirit I am with you, rejoicing and beholding your order and that which is lacking to your faith in Christ.” And to the Thessalonians, “Night and day,” he says, “more abundantly praying that we may see your face and may supply the things that are lacking to your faith.” .

Let the admonition of the most blessed apostle not depart from your hearts, “If anyone preaches to you a gospel besides that which you have received, let him be anathema.” He did not say “more than you received” but “besides that which you have received.” For if he said the former, he himself would be prejudging himself, who desired to come to the Thessalonians that he might supply what things were lacking to their faith. But he who supplies adds to what was smaller, he does not take away what was there. But he who goes beyond the rule of faith does not go forward in the way but goes back to the way. .
