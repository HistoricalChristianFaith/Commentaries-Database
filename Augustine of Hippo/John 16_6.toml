Or, whereas they had asked him before where he was going and he had replied that he was going where they would not come, now he promises that he will go in such a way that no one will ask him where he goes. For a cloud received him [in broad daylight]. When he ascended up to heaven, they questioned him not in words but followed with their eyes. … But our Lord saw what effect his words would produce on their minds. Not having yet that inward consolation that the Holy Spirit was to impart, they were afraid to lose the outward presence of Christ. And so, when they could no longer doubt from his own words that they were going to lose him, their human affections were saddened by the loss of their visible object. But he knew that it would be for their good because that inward sight that the Holy Spirit would use to console them was the better sight.
