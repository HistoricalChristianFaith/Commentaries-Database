"The man of My peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of My bread, has enlarged his heel against Me" [Psalm 41:9]: has raised up his foot against Me: would trample upon Me. Who is this man of His peace? Judas. And in him did Christ trust, that He said, "in whom I trusted"? Did He not know him from the beginning? Did He not before he was born know that he would be? Had He not said to all His disciples, "I have chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil"? [John 6:70] How then trusted He in him, but that He is in His Members, and that because many faithful trusted in Judas, the Lord transferred this to Himself?..."The man of My peace, in whom I trusted, which did eat of My bread." How showed He him in His Passion? By the words of His prophecy: by the sop He marked Him out, that it might appear said of him, "Which did eat of My bread." [John 13:26] Again, when he came to betray Him, He granted him a kiss, [Matthew 26:49] that it might appear said of him, "The man of My peace."
