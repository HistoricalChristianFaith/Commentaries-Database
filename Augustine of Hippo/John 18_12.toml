They took him: someone to whom they had never found access. For he continued [as] the day while they remained as darkness. Neither had they listened to the words “Come unto him, and be enlightened.” For if they had approached him in this way, they would have taken him, not with their hands for the purpose of murder but with their hearts for the purpose of a welcome reception. Now, however, when they laid hold of him in this way, their distance from him was vastly increased. And they bound the one who could have freed them. And perhaps there were those among them who then fastened their fetters on Christ, and yet were afterward delivered by him and could say, “You have loosed my bonds.”
