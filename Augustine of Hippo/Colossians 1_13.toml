“And he threw him,” says John, “into the abyss,” meaning, clearly, that he cast the devil into the abyss, and the “abyss” symbolizes the innumerable multitude of the impious, in whose hearts there is a great depth of malignity against the church of God…. Now because he is bound and shut up by this ban, the devil is prohibited and inhibited from leading astray the nations which belonged to Christ but were in time past led astray by him or held in his grip. For God chose those nations before the foundation of the world, to “rescue them from the power of darkness and transfer them to the kingdom of his beloved Son,” as the apostle says. .

Because in Greek “to suffer” is paschein, for this reason Pascha has been thought of as a passion, as though this name has been derived from “suffering.” But in its own language, that is, in Hebrew, Pascha means a “passing over.” For this reason the people of God celebrated the Pascha for the first time when, fleeing from Egypt, they passed over the Red Sea…. And we effect a most salutary passing over when we pass over from the devil to Christ, and from this tottering world to his most solidly established kingdom. And therefore we pass over to God who endures so that we may not pass over with the passing world. Concerning this grace conferred upon us, the apostle, praising God, says, “Who has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us over into the kingdom of the Son of his love.”

From this power of evil angels nothing delivers man but the grace of God, of which the apostle speaks, “Who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of the Son of his love.” Israel’s own story illustrates this figure, when they were delivered from the power of the Egyptians and translated into the kingdom of the land of promise flowing with milk and honey, which signifies the sweetness of grace.
