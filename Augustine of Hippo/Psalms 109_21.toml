"O deliver me, for I am needy and poor" [Psalm 109:21]. Need and poverty is that weakness, through which He was crucified. [2 Corinthians 13:4] "And my heart is disturbed within me." This alludes to those words which He spoke when His Passion was drawing near, "My soul is exceeding sorrowful, even unto death." [Matthew 26:38]
