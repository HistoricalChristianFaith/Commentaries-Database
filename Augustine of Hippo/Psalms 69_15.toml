"Let not the tempest of waters drown Me" [Psalm 69:15]. But already he had been drowned. "I have come into the depth of the sea," you have said, and "the tempest has drowned Me,"  you have said.

He has lost confession, really dead he is, and there is fulfilled in him that which elsewhere is spoken of, "From a dead man, as from one that is not, there perishes confession." [Sirach 17:28] ...
