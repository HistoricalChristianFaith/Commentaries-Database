Nor is there any real contradiction between John’s “all who are in the tombs” and Daniel’s “many” in place of “all.” As an illustration of this, notice how, in one place, God said to Abraham, “I have made you the father of many nations” and in another, “In your descendants all the nations of the earth shall be blessed.”
