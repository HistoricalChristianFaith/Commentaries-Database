What is signified by the fact that Peter dared to come to him upon the water? Peter indeed has the principal role in the church. And what is the meaning of those other words: “Lord, if it is you, bid me come to you on the water,” if not, Lord, if you are truthful and never lie at all, let your church be glorified also in this world, for prophecy declared this about you? Let it walk upon the water, and it shall come to you, to whom it was said, “The rich among the people shall entreat your favor.”
