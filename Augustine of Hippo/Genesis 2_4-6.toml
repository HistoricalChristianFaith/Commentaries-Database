Why after mentioning heaven and earth does this passage add “vegetation of the field and food” while remaining silent about so many other things that are in heaven and earth or even the sea, unless it wants “vegetation of the field” to be understood as an invisible created thing such as the soul? For “field” is often used figuratively in Scripture to represent the world.… Further on it adds “before they were upon the earth,” which means “before the soul sinned.” For once the soul was soiled with earthly desires, it was as if the soul was born on the earth, or its essence derived from the earth.

Now God also makes the vegetation of the field, but by raining upon the earth; that is, he makes souls become green again by his word. But he waters them from the clouds, that is, from the writings of the prophets and apostles.

The gentle face of the earth, that is, the dignity of the earth, may be correctly viewed as the mother of the Lord, the Virgin Mary, who was watered by the Holy Spirit, who is signified in the Gospel by the term water.
