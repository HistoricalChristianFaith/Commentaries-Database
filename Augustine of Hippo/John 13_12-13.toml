"So after He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments, and was set down again, He said unto them, Know ye what I have done to you?" The Lord is now beginning to explain what He did; and what He had promised to Peter, that he should know afterwards, is now to have its fulfillment. "Ye call me Master and Lord; and ye say well, for so I am." In the Proverbs of Solomon it is said, "Let another man praise thee, and not thine own lips;" for it is a dangerous thing for a man to praise himself who has still to be on his guard against pride. But He who is exalted above all things, however He may extol Himself, does not raise Himself too high: for God cannot adequately proclaim Himself. But what wise man can brook it that one who is only a man should be called "Lord"? But what we cannot brook in man, we ought to brook in God. He is no arrogant man, but the faithful God: nor flatters He Himself as men do who know themselves, but speaks only in accordance with truth; and that we may know, He who knows, makes Himself known. Were He to hold His tongue when it was possible to be arrogant, it would be hiding from us what we need. And therefore: "Ye call me," He says, "Master and Lord: and ye say well, for so I am."
