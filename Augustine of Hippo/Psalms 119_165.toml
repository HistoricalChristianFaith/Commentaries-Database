"Great is the peace," he says, "that they have who love Your law: and there is no offense to them" [Psalm 119:165]. Does this mean that the law itself is not an offense to them that love it, or that there is no offense from any source unto them that love the law? But both senses are rightly understood. For he who loves the law of God, honours in it even what he does not understand; and what seems to him to sound absurd, he judges rather that he does not understand, and that there is some great meaning hidden: thus the law of God is not an offense to him...

But whom does the church burn as the moon by night? They who have caused schisms. Hear this very same thing stated by the apostle: "Who is weak and I am not weak? Who is scandalized and I am not burned?" How then is there no scandal in him who loves his brother? Because he who loves his brother endures all things for the sake of unity, because in the unity of love is brotherly loving. If some wicked person or other, or someone supposedly or allegedly wicked, offends you, do you desert so many good people? What sort of brotherly loving is it as has appeared in these people? When they accuse the Africans, they have deserted the world. Were there no saints in the world? Or was it possible for them to be condemned by you unheard? But, if you loved your brother, there would be no scandal in you. Hear the psalm, the one that says, "Much peace have they who love your law and there is no scandal to them." It said that they who love the law of God have much peace and for that reason there is no scandal to them. Those therefore who suffer scandal lose peace. And who did it say do not suffer scandal or do not cause it? Those loving the law of God.
