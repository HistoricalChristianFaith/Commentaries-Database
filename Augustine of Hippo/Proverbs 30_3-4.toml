“Surely,” you say, “you will be kind enough to tell me whether Solomon truly said, ‘God has no son.’ ” This is quickly answered: not only did he not say, “God has no son,” but he did say that God has a Son. Wisdom speaking through him says, “Before all the hills, he begot me,” and what is Christ but the wisdom of God? Again, in a certain passage in Proverbs, he says, “God has taught me wisdom, and I have known the science of the saints. Who has ascended up into heaven and descends? Who has held the wind in his bosom? Who has changed the water as a garment? Who has held all the borders of the earth? What is his name? and what is the name of his son?”
