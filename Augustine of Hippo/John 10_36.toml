Perhaps someone may be saying, If the Father sanctified him, was there then a time when he was not sanctified? He sanctified in the same way as he begat him. For in the act of begetting he gave him the power to be holy, because he begat him in holiness. For if that which is sanctified was unholy before, how can we say to God the Father, “Hallowed be thy name”?
