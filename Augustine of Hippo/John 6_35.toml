"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst." "He that cometh to me," is the same as, "he that believeth in me;" and "shall never hunger," the same thing as "shall never thirst:" by both is signified that eternal fulness, where is no want. Ye desire the bread from heaven; ye have it before you, and ye eat not.

(Tr. xxv. 14) He that cometh to Me, i. e. that believeth on Me, shall never hunger, has the same meaning as shall never thirst; both signifying that eternal society, where there is no want.
