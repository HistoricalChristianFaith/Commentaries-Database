Understand that the woman did not have a lawful husband but had rather formed an illicit union with someone who was not her lawful husband.… And, just in case the woman might suppose that the Lord knew about this because he had learned this from someone—and not because he knew it by his own divinity—[he says], Listen to something that you have not said, “For you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband.”
