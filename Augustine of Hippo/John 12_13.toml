See how great the fruit of his preaching was and how large a flock of the lost sheep of the house of Israel heard the voice of their Shepherd.… “On the next day many people that came to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem, took branches of palm trees.” … The branches of palms are psalms of praise for the victory that our Lord was about to obtain by his death over death and his triumph over the devil, the prince of death, by the trophy of the cross.

What a cross of mental suffering the Jewish rulers must have endured when they heard such a great multitude proclaiming Christ as the King! But what honor was it to the Lord to be King of Israel? How great was it for the King of eternity to become the King of humanity? Christ was not the King of Israel so that he could exact tribute, put swords in his soldiers’ hands and subdue his enemies by open warfare. He was King of Israel in exercising kingly authority over their souls, in consulting for their eternal interests, in bringing into his heavenly kingdom those whose faith, hope and love were centered in himself. For the Son of God, the Father’s equal, the Word by whom all things were made, in his good pleasure to be King of Israel was a demotion not a promotion, a sign of his pity not an increase of his power. For he who was called on earth the King of the Jews is in heaven the King of angels.
