Thus at times all the sayings of the ancient covenant of the sacred Scriptures are designated together by the name of law. For the apostle cites the testimony from the prophet Isaiah, where he says, “In other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people,” and yet he had prefaced this by saying, “In the law it is written.”
