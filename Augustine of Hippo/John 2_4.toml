Although the Evangelist himself mentions Jesus’ mother by her very name, Jesus nevertheless addresses her with the words “Woman, what have I to do with you?” But here he is not pushing her away from himself since he had received flesh from her. Rather, his purpose is to convey the conception of his divinity, which is especially appropriate at this time when he is about to change the water into wine. This is the divinity that had made that “woman” [Mary] rather than being made in her.

There is … nothing that would compel us to deny the mother of the Lord occasioned by the words spoken by him, “Woman, what have I to do with you? My hour is not yet come.” Rather, he admonishes us to understand that, in respect of his being God, there was no mother for him. [When he spoke to her] it was as he was preparing to demonstrate of his personal majesty in the turning of water into wine. But as regards his being crucified, he was crucified in respect of his being man. And that was the hour that had not come as yet.
