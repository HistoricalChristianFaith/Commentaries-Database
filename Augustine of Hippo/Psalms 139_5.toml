"Behold Thou, Lord, hast known all my last doings, and the ancient ones" [Psalm 139:5]. You have known my latest doings, when I fed swine; You have known my ancient doings, when I asked of You my portion of goods. Ancient doings were the beginnings to me of latest ills: ancient sin, when we fell; latest punishment, when we came into this toilsome and dangerous mortality. And would that this may be "latest" to us; it will be, if now we will to return. For there is another "latest" for certain wicked ones, to whom it shall be said, "Go ye into everlasting fire." [MatthewÂ 25:41] ..."You have fashioned me, and hast laid Your hand upon me." "Fashioned me," where? In this mortality; now, to the toils whereunto we all are born. For none is born, but God has fashioned him in his mother's womb; nor is there any creature, whereof God is not the Fashioner. But "You have fashioned me" in this toil, "and laid Your hand upon me," Your avenging hand, putting down the proud. For thus healthfully has He cast down the proud, that He may lift him up humble.
