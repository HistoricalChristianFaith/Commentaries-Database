Lastly, he adds, "All Your commandments are truth: they have persecuted me unjustly; O be Thou my help" [Psalm 119:86]. And the whole sense depends upon the foregoing: "How many are the days of Your servant: when will You be avenged of them that persecute me?"  For that they may persecute me, they have related to me these pleasant tales; but I have preferred Your law to them, which on that account has pleased me more, because all Your commandments are true; not as in their discourses, where vanity abounds. And for this reason "they have persecuted me falsely," because in me they have persecuted nothing save the truth. Therefore help Thou me, that I may struggle for the truth even unto death; because this is at once Your commandment, and therefore it is also the truth.
