(Tr. xxiv. s. 1, 2) But let us reflect a little here. Forasmuch as the Divine Substance is not visible to the eye, and the miracles of the divine government of the world, and ordering of the whole creation, are overlooked in consequence of their constancy; God has reserved to Himself acts, beside the established course and order of nature, to do at suitable times; in order that those who overlooked the daily course of nature, might be roused to wonder by the sight of what was different from, though not at all greater, than what they were used to. The government of the world is a greater miracle, than the satisfying the hunger of five thousand with five loaves; and yet no one wonders at this: the former excited wonder; not from any real superiority in it, but because it was uncommon. But it would be wrong to gather no more than this from Christ's miracles: for, the Lord who is on the mounte, and the Word of God which is on high, the same is no humble person to be lightly passed over, but we must look up to Him reverently.

The miracles which our Lord Jesus Christ wrought, are indeed divine works, and admonish the human mind to rise from visible things to the knowledge of God. For since He is not of such substance as can be seen with the eyes, and His miracles whereby He governs the whole world, and provides for all creation, tend, by reason of their constant recurrence, to become cheap in men's esteem; so that almost no one deigns to consider the wonderful and stupendous works of God, displayed in every grain of seed: according to His own mercy He has reserved to Himself certain works to do in suitable time beside the wonted course and order of nature; so that men beholding, not greater but uncommon works, should be struck with wonder, for whom daily things had become cheap.

For the government of the whole world is a greater miracle than the satisfying five thousand men with five loaves: and yet at this no one wonders; at the other, men wonder, not because it is greater, but because it is rare. For who now feeds the whole world, but He who out of a few seeds creates the harvests? He wrought, therefore, as God. For by the same power whereby He multiplies the stores of grain from a few seeds, did He multiply in His hands the five loaves. For power was in the hands of Christ, and those five loaves were as seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.

This, then, was done to admonish the senses, that they might rise to understand the mind, and exercise the eyes of the heart, that in visible works they might acknowledge the invisible God. And it was not enough for us to behold in the miracles only that, which pertained to miracles: we must also search out what this miracle, which Christ wrought, tells us and what it means: for whoever marks the works, may understand some meaning of Christ speaking as it were in them; since the miracle itself is, as we may say, a kind of speech.
