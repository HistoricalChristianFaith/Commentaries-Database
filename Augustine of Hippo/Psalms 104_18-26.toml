In case any of us should struggle with this, there are just two commands: God and neighbor; the one who made you, and the one he made you to be with. No one has told you “Love the sun, love the moon, love the earth and everything that has been made.” These are the things in which God is to be praised, the Maker to be blessed. “How magnificent are your works!” we say; “in wisdom you have made them all.” They are yours, you have made them all. Thanks be to you! But you have made us over all of them. Thanks be to you! For we are your image and likeness. Thanks be to you! We have sinned, we have been sought. Thanks be to you! We have been negligent, we have not been neglected. Thanks be to you! When we despised you, we were not despised; in case we should have forgotten your divinity and should lose you, you even took upon yourself our humanity. Thanks be to you! When and where can there not be thanks?

This Word, through which heaven and earth were made, this Word was not itself made. I mean, if it was made, through what was it made? “All things were made through it.” So if whatever has been made was made through the Word, the Word itself, clearly, through which all things were made, was not made. One more point: the narrator of the works of creation, God’s servant Moses, says, “In the beginning, God made heaven and earth.” He made heaven and earth in the beginning. By what means did he make it? Through the Word. Did he also make the Word? No; well what, then? “In the beginning was the Word”;23 that through which he made things already was; that is how he made what as yet was not. We can understand it, and rightly understand it, in the sense that heaven and earth were made in the only-begotten Word itself. They were made in, you see, that through which they were made. This can be, and be understood as, the beginning in which God made heaven and earth. This Word, after all, is also the wisdom of God, about which it is said, “You have made all things in wisdom.” If God made all things in wisdom, and his only-begotten Son is without a shadow of doubt that wisdom of God, let us not doubt that whatever we have learned was made through the Son, was also made in the Son. The Son himself, after all, is certainly the beginning. When the Jews were questioning him and saying, “Who are you? he answered, The beginning.” There you have, “In the beginning, God made heaven and earth.”

I will not contest the point, chiefly because it gives me the liveliest satisfaction to find the Trinity celebrated in the very beginning of the book of Genesis. For having said “In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,” meaning that the Father made them in the Son (as the psalm testifies where it says, “How manifold are Thy works, O Lord! in Wisdom hast Thou made them all”), a little afterwards mention is fitly made of the Holy Spirit also.

“All things” then, my brothers, “all things”—each and every one—“were made through him, and without him was nothing made.” But how were all things made through him? “That which was made, in him is life.” Now this can be taken as follows: “That which was made in him, is life.” And if we express the sentence in this way, everything is life. For what was not made in him? For he himself is the wisdom of God, and in the psalm it is said, “You have made all things in wisdom.” If, then, Christ is the wisdom of God and the psalm says, “You have made all things in wisdom,” as all things were made through him, so they were made in him.

And because God, when he created him, was certainly not ignorant of his future malignity, and foresaw the good which he Himself would bring out of his evil, therefore says the psalm, “This leviathan whom Thou hast made to be a sport therein,” that we may see that, even while God in his goodness created him good, he yet had already foreseen and arranged how he would make use of him when he became wicked.

There is a passage, too, in the Book of Job, of which the devil is the subject: “This is the beginning of the creation of God, which he made to be a sport to his angels,” which agrees with the psalm, where it is said, “There is that dragon which Thou hast made to be a sport therein.” But these passages are not to lead us to suppose that the devil was originally created to be the sport of the angels, but that he was doomed to this punishment after his sin. His beginning, then, is the handiwork of God; for there is no nature, even among the least, and lowest, and last of the beasts, which was not the work of Him from whom has proceeded all measure, all form, all order, without which nothing can be planned or conceived. How much more, then, is this angelic nature, which surpasses in dignity all else that he has made, the handiwork of the Most High!
