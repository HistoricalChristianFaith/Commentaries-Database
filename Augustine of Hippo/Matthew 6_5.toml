And here also it is not the being seen of men that is wrong, but doing these things for the purpose of being seen of men; and it is superfluous to make the same remark so often, since there is just one rule to be kept, from which we learn that what we should dread and avoid is not that men know these things, but that they be done with this intent, that the fruit of pleasing men should be sought after in them. Our Lord Himself, too, preserves the same words, when He adds similarly, Verily I say unto you, They have received their reward; hereby showing that He forbids this—the striving after that reward in which fools delight when they are praised by men.

(ubi sup.) Not that the mere being seen of men is an impiety, but the doing this, in order to be seen of men.

(ubi sup.) The privity of other men is to be so far shunned by us, as it leads us to do any thing with this mind that we look for the fruit of their applause.
