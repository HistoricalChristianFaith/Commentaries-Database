"Not," saith he, "of works, lest any man boast. For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works" For a man worketh not righteousness save he be justified: but by "believing on Him that justifieth the ungodly," he beginneth with faith; that good may not by preceding show what he hath deserved, but by following what he hath received. ...
