In the Passover a lamb is killed, representing Christ of whom it is said in the Gospel, “Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!” In the Passover the bones of the lamb were not to be broken. And on the cross the bones of the Lord were not broken. The Evangelist, in reference to this, quotes the words “a bone of him shall not be broken.” The posts were marked with blood to keep away destruction, as people are marked on their foreheads with the sign of the Lord’s passion for their salvation.
