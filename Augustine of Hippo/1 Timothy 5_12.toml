The apostle mentions evil, unmarried women who are gossipers and busybodies and says that this vice springs from idleness. “And further,” he says, “being idle, they learn to go about from house to house, and are not only idle, but gossipers as well as busybodies, mentioning things they ought not.” He had previously said of these, “But refuse younger widows, for when they have wantonly turned away from Christ, they wish to marry and are to be condemned because they have broken their first pledge,” that is, they did not persevere in what they had first vowed. However, he does not say “They marry” but “They wish to marry,” for it is not the love of their noble vow which prevents many of them from marrying but fear of outright indecency. This itself springs from pride by which human displeasure is more dreaded than the divine displeasure.
