We have sung a psalm: “Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a quarry to their teeth.” A proper expression of gratitude for the gifts of God. “Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a quarry to their teeth.” It is certainly the voice of gratitude, and a very fitting gratitude. And when can human gratitude ever match such divine gifts? When the blessed martyr shed his sacred blood in this place, I do not know whether there was as big a crowd here of people raging against him, as there is now a multitude of people praising him. I repeat—I am delighted, after all, to see in the house of the Lord the people converging so religiously on this place and to compare times with times—which is why I say again and repeat, and so far as I can I devoutly commend to your consideration; when the blessed martyr shed his blood in this place, I do not know whether there was such a big crowd here raging against him as there now is a multitude of people praising him.But even if there was, “blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a quarry to their teeth.” When they killed, they imagined they had conquered; they were being conquered by the people who were dying, and they rejoiced. If they were being conquered, they were naturally raging. So the raging crowd has departed, and the praising multitude has taken its place. Let them say, let them say, the praising multitude, “Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a quarry to their teeth.” Whose teeth? The teeth of the enemies, the teeth of the godless, the teeth of those persecuting Jerusalem, the teeth of Babylon, the teeth of the enemy city, the teeth of the crowd gone stark, staring mad in their villainy, the teeth of a crowd persecuting the Lord, forsaking the Creator, turning to the creature, worshiping things made by hand, ignoring the one by whom they were made. “Blessed is the Lord, who has not given us as a quarry to their teeth.”
