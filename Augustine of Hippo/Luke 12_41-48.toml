Many people abuse for their own impious purposes his tardiness in coming. The bad slave says, “My master is taking his time.” He starts beating his fellow slaves and getting drunk with the bad ones. His master will come on a day he does not know, and at an hour he is unaware of, and will cut him off. You see, it is the body of ministers and prelates who give their fellow slaves their food in due season. “He will separate him off,” it says. He has good ones and bad ones. “He separates the good from the bad.” “He will assign his portion with the hypocrites.” He will not do this to the whole ministry, because in it too there are those who are longing for the Lord to come. In its ranks are also to be found the group of which it is said, “Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, finds so doing.” “He will come and separate him.”

Now if those ignorant of the law are in a worse condition than those who know the law, how can this saying of our Lord in the Gospel be true? “That servant who knew his master’s will but did not make ready or act according to his will shall receive a severe beating. But he who did not know and did what deserved a beating shall receive a light beating.” You see that this passage shows clearly a person who knows sins more seriously than one who does not know. Yet we must not on this account take refuge in the darkness of ignorance so as to find there an excuse for our conduct. Not to know is one thing; unwillingness to know is another.
