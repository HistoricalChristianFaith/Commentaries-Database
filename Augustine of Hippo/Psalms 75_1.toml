"We will confess to You, O Lord, we will confess to You, and will invoke Your name" [Psalm 75:1]. Do not invoke, before thou confess: confess, and invoke. For Him whom you are invoking, unto yourself you call. For what is it to invoke, but unto yourself to call? If He is invoked by you, that is, if He is called to you, unto whom does He draw near? To a proud man He draws not near. High indeed He is, one lifted up attains not unto Him. In order that we may reach all exalted objects, we raise ourselves, and if we are not able to reach them, we look for some appliances or ladders, in order that being exalted we may reach exalted objects: contrariwise God is both high, and by the lowly He is reached. It is written, "Nigh is the Lord to them that have bruised the heart."  The bruising of the heart is Godliness, humility. He that bruises himself is angry with himself. Let him make himself angry in order that he may make Him merciful; let him make himself judge, in order that he may make Him Advocate. Therefore God does come when invoked. Unto whom does He come? To the proud man He comes not....Take heed therefore what ye do: for if He knows, He is not unobservant.  It is better therefore that He be unobservant than known. For what is that same being unobservant, but not knowing? What is, not to know? Not to animadvert. For even as the act of one avenging animadversion is wont to be spoken of. Here one praying that He be unobservant: "Turn away Your face from my sins."  What then will you do if He shall have turned away His face from you? A grievous thing it is, and to be feared, lest He forsake you. Again, if He turn not away His face, He animadverts. God knows this thing, God can do this thing, namely, both turn away face from one sinning, and not turn away from one confessing....Confess therefore and invoke. For by confessing you purge the Temple, into which He may come, when invoked. Confess and invoke. May He turn away face from your sins, not turn away from you: turn away face from that which you have wrought,  not turn away from that which He has Himself wrought.  For you, as man, He has Himself wrought, your sins you have yourself wrought....

Here we have just been singing “We will confess to you, O God, we will confess and call on your name.” What does confessing to God mean but humbling oneself before God, not arrogating to oneself any merits? For “we have been saved by his grace,” as the apostle says, “not by works, lest anyone should exalt himself; for it is by his grace that we have been saved.” You see, there was not any preexistent good life that he could look down at from up above and admire and love and say, “Come on, let us go down and help these people, because they are leading good lives.” He was displeased with our lives, he was displeased with everything we were making of ourselves, but he was not displeased with what he had made in us. So he will condemn what we have made, and what he has made he will save. He will condemn the evil deeds of men and women and save the men and women themselves.

So he gave us the way of humility. If we keep to it we shall confess to the Lord, and not without reason shall we sing, “We will confess to you, O God, we will confess and call on your name.” It is rather shameless to call on his name if you do not confess to him. First confess, in order to prepare a dwelling place for the one you are calling on, that is to say calling in. After all, your heart is full of wickedness. But confession sweeps out the uncleanness you are cluttered up with inside and cleans the house into which the one you are calling in is coming. But anyone who calls him in before confessing is deliberately insulting him by asking him in. If you would not dare invite some holy person into your house unless you had first cleaned it out, in case something should offend his eyes, will you have the nerve to call in the name of God into your heart full of wickedness, unless you have first swept out all the iniquity inside by confession?
