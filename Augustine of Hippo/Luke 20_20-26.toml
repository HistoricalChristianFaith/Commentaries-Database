These same enemies saw the miracles of the Lord, and they said, “Tell us by what authority you are doing these things.” They questioned him with hostile intentions, so that if he admitted what his authority was, they could hold him as guilty of blaspheming. He acted in the same way as over the coin, when they wanted to accuse him falsely. If he said, “Let tribute be paid to Caesar,” it would be as though he had cursed the people of the Jews, making them subject and tributary to a foreign power. If he had said, “It should not be paid,” they could trump up a charge against him before Caesar’s friends and administrators that he was forbidding its payment. He, though, said, “Show me a coin. Whose image and inscription does it carry?” They answered, “Caesar’s.” He said, “So pay to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.” That amounts to saying, “If Caesar can require his image in a coin, cannot God require his image in a human being?”
