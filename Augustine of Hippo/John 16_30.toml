Why do they say this to someone who knew all things, instead of saying, “you don’t need for anyone to ask you”? It would have been more appropriate to have said, You don’t need to ask anyone. And yet we know that both of these were done, that is, that our Lord both asked questions and was asked. But this is soon explained. For both were for the benefit not of himself but of those whom he asked questions or by whom he was asked. He asked questions of people not in order to learn himself but to teach them. And in the case of those who asked questions of him, such questions were necessary for them in order to gain the knowledge they wanted. But they were not necessary for him to tell him what that was, because he knew what the inquirer wanted before the question was put to him.… And so, to know people’s thoughts beforehand was no great thing for the Lord, but to the minds of babes it was a great thing: “By this we know that you came forth from God.”
