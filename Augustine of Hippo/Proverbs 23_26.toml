If you don’t give yourself, you will lose yourself. Charity herself speaks through wisdom and tells you something to save you from panicking at being told, “Give yourself.” If anyone wanted to sell you a farm he would say to you, “Give me your gold,” and if it was something else, “Give me your coppers,” “Give me your silver.” Now listen to what charity says to you, speaking through the mouth of wisdom: “Give me your heart, son. Give me,” she says. Give her what? “Your heart, son.” It was ill when it was with you, when you kept it to yourself. You were being pulled this way and that by toys and trifles and wanton, destructive loves. Take your heart away from all that. Where are you to drag it to, where are you to put it? “Give me your heart,” she says. “Let it be mine, and it won’t be lost to you.”
