God searches our heart and perceives that it is there where our treasure is, that is, in heaven.… He alone perceives what in our inward conscience each of us thinks and delights in. Delight is the end of care because our whole goal in life is to reach what we think and care about most and attain it. God, who searches the heart, therefore sees our cares.… And when he finds that our cares incline neither to the lust of the flesh, nor to the lust of the eyes, nor to the pride of life … but to the joys of things eternal, which are spoiled by no change, he provides direction for the righteous. - "Expositions of the Psalms 7.9"
