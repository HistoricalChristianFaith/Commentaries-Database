"With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought and shall be led into the Temple of the King" [Psalm 45:15]. The "Temple of the King" is the Church itself: it is the Church itself that enters into "the Temple of the King." Whereof is that Temple constructed? Of the men who enter the Temple? Who but God's "faithful" ones are its "living stones"? [1 Peter 2:4] "They shall be led into the Temple of the King." For there are virgins without the Temple of the King, the nuns among the heretics:  they are virgins, it is true; but what will that profit them, unless they be led into the "Temple of the King"? The "Temple of the King" is in unity: the "Temple of the King" is not ruinous, is not rent asunder, is not divided. The cement  of those living stones is "charity."
