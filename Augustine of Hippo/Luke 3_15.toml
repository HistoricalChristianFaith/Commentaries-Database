Matthew says, Whose shoes I am not worthy to bear. If therefore it is worth while to understand any difference in these expressions, wecan only suppose that John said one at one time, another at another, or both together, To bear his shoes, and to loose the latchet of his shoes, so that though one Evangelist may have related this, the others that, yet all have related the truth. But if John intended no more when he spoke of the shoes of our Lord but His excellence and his own humility, whether he said loosing the latchet of the shoes, or bearing them, they have still kept the same sense who bythe mention of shoes have in their own words expressed the same signification of humility.
