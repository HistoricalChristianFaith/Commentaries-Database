Like Cain, who in envy and pride killed his just brother, they have been marked with a sign so that no one may kill them. Indeed, this fact can be quite definitely noted in Psalm 59, where Christ, speaking according to his human nature, says, “My God has made revelation to me concerning my enemies: do not kill them lest they forget your law.” Strangely enough, by means of this people, enemies of the Christian faith, proof has been furnished to the Gentiles as to how Christ was foretold, lest, perhaps, when the Gentiles had seen how manifestly the prophecies were fulfilled, they should think that the Scriptures were made up by the Christians, since things that they perceived as accomplished facts were read aloud as foretold about Christ. Therefore, the sacred books are handed down by the Jews, and thus God, in regard to our enemies, makes clear to us that he did not kill them, that is, he did not annihilate them from the face of the earth so that they might not forget his law, for by reading it and by observing it, though only outwardly, they keep it in mind and thus bring judgment on themselves and furnish testimony to us.
