The apostle said, “With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin,” not by giving my members over to committing iniquities but only by feeling lust, without however giving a hand to unlawful lust. So when he said, “With the mind I serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin,” he went on to add, “There is therefore no condemnation now for those who are in Christ Jesus.” For those who are in the flesh there is condemnation; for those who are in Christ Jesus no condemnation. In case you should assume this is going to be the case after becoming a Christian, that is why he added “now.”
What you must look forward to afterward is not even to have any lust in you which you have to contend with, which you have to combat, which you must not consent to, which you have to curb and tame; look forward to its simply not being there afterward. I mean to say, if what is now contending with us from its base in this mortal body is going to be there afterward, the taunt “Where, death, is your striving?” will be untrue. So let us be quite clear about what it is going to be like afterward. Then, you see, will come about the word that is written: “Death has been swallowed up in victory. Where, death, is your striving? Where, death, is your sting? For the sting of death is sin; but the power of sin, the law.” Because desire was increased, not extinguished, by being forbidden. The law gave sin power by simply commanding through the letter without assisting through the spirit. - "Sermon 155.2"
