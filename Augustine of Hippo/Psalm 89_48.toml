"What man is he that shall live, and shall not see death?" [Psalm 89:48]. For being raised from the dead He dies no more, and death has no more dominion over Him. [Romans 6:9] And as in another Psalm it is said, "You shall not leave my soul in Hell, neither shall Thou suffer Your Holy One to see corruption,"  the Apostolic teaching takes up this testimony, and in the Acts of the Apostles [Acts 2:29] thus argues against the unbelieving; Men and brethren, we know that the patriarch David is dead and buried, and his flesh has seen corruption. Therefore it cannot be said of him, "neither shall Thou suffer Your Holy One to see corruption." Of whom then is it said? "What man is he that shall live, and shall not see death?" Perhaps there is no man such. Nay, but "who is it?" is said to make you inquire, not despair. But perhaps there may be some man "that shall live, and shall not see death," and yet perhaps he did not speak of Christ, who died? There is no man "that shall live, and shall not see death," except Him who died for mortals. That you may be assured that it is said of Him, consider the sequel; "What man is he that lives, and shall not see death?" Did He never die then? He did. How then shall He live, and never see death? "He shall deliver His own soul from the hands of Hell." He is spoken of alone indeed, in that He alone of all others "shall live, and shall not see death: He shall deliver His own soul from the hand of Hell," because although the rest of His faithful shall rise from the dead, and shall themselves live for evermore, without seeing death; yet they shall not themselves deliver their own souls from the hands of Hell. He who delivers His own soul from the hands of Hell, Himself delivers those of His believers: they cannot do so of themselves. Prove that He delivers His own soul. "I have power to lay down My life, and I have power to take it again. No man takes 'it from Me;' for I Myself slept, but I lay it down of Myself, and take it again,"  because it is He Himself who delivers His own soul from the hands of Hell.
