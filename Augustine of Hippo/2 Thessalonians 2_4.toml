He who speaks on his own seeks his own glory. This will be that one who is called the Antichrist, "exalting himself," as the apostle says, "above all that is called God and that is worshiped." Indeed, the Lord, announcing that he would seek his own glory, not the glory of the Father, said to the Jews, "I have come in the name of my Father, and you have not received me; another will come in his own name, this one you will receive." He signified that they would receive the Antichrist, who would seek the glory of his own name, puffed up, hollow, and so not enduring but in fact ruinous. But our Lord Jesus Christ offered us a great example of humility.
