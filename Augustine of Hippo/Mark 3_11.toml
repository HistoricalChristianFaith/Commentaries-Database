Both the devils and the faithful confessed Christ. “Thou art Christ, the Son of the living God,” said Peter. “We know who thou art. Thou art the Son of God,” said the devils. I hear a similar confession, but I do not find a similar charity. In one there is love, in another fear. He is lovely to those who are sons. He is terrible to those who are not sons.

The “faith that works by love,” is not the same faith that demons have. “For the devils also believe and tremble,” but do they love? If they had not believed, they would not have said: “You are the holy one of God” or “You are the Son of God.” But if they had loved, they would not have said: “What have we to do with you?”
