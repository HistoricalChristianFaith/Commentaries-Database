"They have prevented Me in the day of My affliction" [Psalm 18:18]. They have first injured Me, in the time when I am bearing a mortal and toilsome body. "And the Lord has become My stay." And since the stay of earthly pleasure was disturbed and torn up by the bitterness of misery, the Lord has become My stay.
