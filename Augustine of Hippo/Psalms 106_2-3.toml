"Shall make" them "heard," he says; that is, cause that they be heard; showing, that the mighty acts of the Lord and His praises are so to be spoken of, that they may be preached to those who hear them. But who can make "all," heard? Is it that as the next words are, "Blessed are they that always keep judgment, and do righteousness in every time" [Psalm 106:3]; he perhaps meant those praises of His, which are understood as His works in His commandments?

"Who will do all His praises heard?" that is, who, when he has heard them, does all His praises? Which are the works of His commandments. As far as they are done, although all which are heard are not performed, He is to be praised, who "works in us both to will and to do of His good pleasure."
