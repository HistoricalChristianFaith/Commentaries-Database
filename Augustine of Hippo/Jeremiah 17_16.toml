The Lord has indeed made every day—not only has made but also continues to make. I mean, he makes every day as follows: he makes his sun rise on the good and the bad and sends rain on the just and the unjust. So we are not to imagine that this ordinary kind of day, which is common to good and bad alike, is meant in this place, where we heard, “This is the day that the Lord has made.” What particular sort of day can it be when it says, “Let us exult and be joyful in it”? What sort, but a good one? What sort, but a very choice, lovable, desirable one, the sort about which Jeremiah said, “And I have not yearned for the day of men, you know it well”?
