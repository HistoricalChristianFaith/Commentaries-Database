De Con., iii, 6: Matthew, however, does not say that Jesus answered, “I am,” but, “Thou has said.” But Mark shewsthat the words “I am” were equivalent to “Thou hast said. "There follows: “And ye shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.”.
We must understand by this, that the Lord suffered these things till morning, in the house of the High Priest, whither He had first been brought.
