"There is Benjamin the younger in a trance" [Psalm 68:27]. There is Paul the last of the Apostles, who says, "For even I am an Israelite, out of the seed of Abraham, out of the tribe of Benjamin." [Philippians 3:5] But evidently "in a trance," all men being amazed at a miracle so great as that of his calling. For a trance is the mind's going out: which thing sometimes chances through fear; but sometimes through some revelation, the mind suffering separation from the corporal senses, in order that that which is to be represented may be represented to the spirit. Whence even thus may be understood that which here has been written, namely, "in a trance;" for when to that persecutor there had been said  from Heaven, "Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me:" [Acts 9:4] there being taken from him the light of the eyes of flesh, he made answer to the Lord, whom in spirit he saw, but they that were with him heard the voice of him replying, though seeing no one to whom he was speaking. Here also the trance may be understood to be that one of his, whereof he himself speaking, says, that he knew a man caught up even unto the third Heaven; but whether in the body, or whether out of the body, he knew not: [2 Corinthians 12:2] but that he being caught up into Paradise, heard ineffable words, which it was not lawful for a man to speak. "Princes of Juda the leaders of them, princes of Zabulon, princes of Nephthalim." Since he is indicating the Apostles as princes, wherein is even "Benjamin the younger in a trance," in which words that Paul is indicated no one doubts; or when under the name of princes there are indicated in the Churches all men excelling and most worthy of imitation: what mean these names of the tribes of Israel?...For the names are Hebrew: whereof Juda is said to be interpreted confession, Zabulon habitation of strength, Nephthalim my enlargement. All which words do intimate to us the most proper princes of the Church, worthy of their leadership, worthy of imitation, worthy of honours. For the Martyrs in the Churches hold the highest place, and by the crown of holy worth they do excel. But however in martyrdom the first thing is confession, and for this is next put on strength to endure whatsoever shall have chanced; then after all things have been endured, straits being ended, breadth follows in reward. It may also thus be understood; that whereas the Apostle chiefly commends these three things, faith, hope, love; [1 Corinthians 13:13] confession is in faith, strength in hope, breadth in love. For of faith the substance is, that with the heart men believe unto righteousness, but with the mouth confession be made unto salvation. [Romans 10:10] But in sufferings of tribulations the thing itself is sorrowful, but the hope is strong. For, "if that which we see not we hope for, through patience we wait for it." [Romans 8:25] But breadth the shedding abroad of love in the heart does give. For "love perfected casts out fear:" which fear "has torment," [1 John 4:18] because of the straits of the soul....
