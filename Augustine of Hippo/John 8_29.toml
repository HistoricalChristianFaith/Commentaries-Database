And though both are together, yet one is sent, the other sends. For the mission is the incarnation. And the incarnation is of the Son only, not of the Father.… He says then, “He that sent me,” meaning by whose Fatherly authority I am made incarnate.

The Father sent the Son but did not withdraw from him. For there is no way that the Father was not wherever he sent the Son. For is there anywhere the maker of all things could not be who said, “I fill heaven and earth.” … And Christ adds the reason why his Father did not leave him: “For I always do those things that please him.” That equality always exists: not from any particular beginning and then onwards, but without beginning and without end. For divine generation has no beginning in time since time itself was created by the Only Begotten.
