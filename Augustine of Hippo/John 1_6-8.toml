(Tr. ii. c. 2) What is said above, refers to the Divinity of Christ. He came to us in the form of man, but man in such sense, as that the Godhead was concealed within Him. And therefore there was sent before a great man, to declare by his witness that He was more than man. And who was this? He was a man.

(Tr. ii) And how could he declare the truth concerning God, unless he were sent from God.

(Tr. ii) What was he called? whose name was John?

(Tr. ii. c. 6) Wherefore came he? The same came for a witness, to bear witness of the Light.
