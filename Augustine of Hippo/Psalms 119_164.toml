Such was, assuredly, the conduct of the Psalmist, who says, "Seven times a day do I praise You, because of Your righteous judgments" [Psalm 119:164]. The words "seven times a day," signify "evermore." For this number is wont to be a symbol of universality; because after six days of the divine work of creation, a seventh of rest was added; [Genesis 2:2] and all times roll on through a revolving cycle of seven days. For no other reason it was said, "a just man falls seven times, and rises up again:" [Proverbs 24:16] that is, the just man perishes not, though brought low in every way, yet not induced to transgress, otherwise he will not be just. For the words, "falls seven times," are employed to express every kind of tribulation, whereby man is cast down in the sight of men: and the words, "rises up again," signify that he profits from all these tribulations. The following sentence in this passage sufficiently illustrates the foregoing words: for it follows, "but the wicked shall fall into mischief." Not to be deprived of strength in any evils, is therefore the falling seven times, and the rising again of the just man. Justly has the Church then praised God seven times in a day for His righteous judgments; because, when it was time that judgment should begin at the house of God, [1 Peter 4:17] she did not faint in all her tribulations, but was glorified with the crowns of Martyrs.

The seven loaves signify the sevenfold working of the Holy Spirit; the four thousand people, the church established under the four Gospels; the seven baskets of fragments, the perfection of the church. This number, you see, stands for perfection extremely often. I mean, how come it says, "Seven times a day shall I praise you"? Is a person going wildly astray who does not praise God that number of times? So what else can be the meaning of "seven times a day shall I praise you," but "I shall never cease from praising"? You see, when he says seven times he signifies the whole of time; that is why the ages unfold in the weekly round of seven days. So what else can "seven times a day shall I praise you" mean but his "praise is always in my mouth"?
