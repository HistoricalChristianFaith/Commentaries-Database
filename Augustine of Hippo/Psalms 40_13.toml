"Be pleased, O Lord, to deliver me" [Psalm 40:13]. As if he were saying, "'If You will, You can make me clean.' [MatthewÂ 8:2] Be pleased to deliver me. O Lord, look upon me to help me." Look,  that is, on the penitent members, members that lie in pain, members that are writhing under the instruments of the surgeon; but still in hope.
