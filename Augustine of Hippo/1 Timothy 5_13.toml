Marriage is a good in all the things which are proper to the married state. And these are three: it is the ordained means of procreation, it is the guarantee of chastity, it is the bond of union. In respect of its ordination for generation the Scripture says, “I will therefore that the younger women marry, bear children, guide the house.” As regards its guaranteeing chastity, it is said of it, “The wife has not power over her own body, but the husband; and likewise also the husband has not power over his own body, but the wife. And considered as the bond of union, “What God has joined together, let no one put asunder.”
