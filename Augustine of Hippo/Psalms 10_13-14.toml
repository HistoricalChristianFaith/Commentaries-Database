Accordingly understanding now the manifest judgment, and in exultation at it, they say, "Wherefore has the ungodly angered God?" [Psalm 10:13]; that is, what has it profited him to do so great evil? "For he said in his heart, He will not require it." Then follows, "For You see toil and considerest anger, to deliver them into Your hands" [Psalm 10:14]. This sentence looks for distinct explanation, wherein if there shall be error it becomes obscure. For thus has the ungodly said in his heart, God will not require it, as though God regarded toil and anger, to deliver them into His hands; that is, as though He feared toil and anger, and for this reason would spare them, lest their punishment be too burdensome to Him, or lest He should be disturbed by the storm of anger: as men generally act, excusing themselves of vengeance, to avoid toil or anger.
