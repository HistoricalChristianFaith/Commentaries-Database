But you say to me, “What am I going to do? If there will be no use for my members there, what am I going to do?” Does existing, seeing, loving, praising seem idleness to you? Behold! These holy days that are celebrated after the resurrection of the Lord signify the life that is to come after our resurrection. For just as the forty days before Easter symbolized the life full of suffering in this mortal period of distress, so these joyful days point to the future life, where we are destined to reign with the Lord. The life that is signified by the forty days before Easter is our burden now; the life that is symbolized by the fifty days after Easter is not possessed now but is an object of hope and is loved while it is hoped for. By that very love we praise God, who promised this eternal life to us, and our praises are Alleluias. For what does “Alleluia” mean? It is a Hebrew word signifying “praise God,” allelu meaning “praise” and Ia meaning “God.” Therefore, by our “Alleluia” we cry out, “Praise God,” and we arouse one another to praise God. We sing praises to God, we chant our “Alleluias” with hearts attuned to harmony far better than with the chords of the lyre. When we have sung our praises, impelled by our weakness we withdraw to refresh our bodies. Why do we do this, except because we are faint? Furthermore, the weakness of the flesh is so great and the annoyance of this life so oppressive that everything, no matter how great it be, eventually leads to aversion. When these days were drawing to a close, how we longed for those of the coming year, and with how much eagerness we approached them after a lapse of time! But, if we were given the command “Sing Alleluias without ceasing,” we would excuse ourselves. Why? Because in our weariness we would not be able to do so, because even in the face of such a good we would be overcome by our distaste. There [in the risen life] no weakness, no aversion will exist. Stand and give praise, you “who stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God.” Why do you question what you are going to do there? The psalmist says, “Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord; they shall praise you forever and ever.”
