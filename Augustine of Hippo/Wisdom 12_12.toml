The liberating grace of God appeals to us on every page of Scripture, so that we would entrust ourselves to it. And this psalm, of which we have begun to speak, by your leave, sings of it. May the Lord help us, so that grace would be given us to understand it as we should and to describe it according to your needs. In this, the love and the fear of God greatly urge us on. The fear of God, because he is just. The love of God, because he is merciful. "Who, in fact, could remonstrate with him" if he were to condemn the godless? How great, then, is his mercy when he justifies the godless! - "Expositions of the Psalms 70.1.1"
