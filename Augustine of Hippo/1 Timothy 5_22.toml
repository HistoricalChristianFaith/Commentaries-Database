If the church partakes of the sins which were forbidden by the apostle, then it must be considered to consent to them.

The apostle writes to Timothy: “Practice self-control.” It’s a command; it’s an order; it has to be listened to; it has to be carried out. But unless God comes to our help, we get stuck. We try, indeed, to do it by willpower, and the will makes some effort. It shouldn’t, though, rely on its ability unless it is assisted in its debility.
