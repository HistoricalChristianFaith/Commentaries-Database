"Because I kept silence, my bones waxed old:" because I made not with my mouth "confession unto salvation," [RomansÂ 10:10] all firmness in me has grown old in infirmity. "Through my roaring all the day long" [Psalm 32:3]: when I was ungodly and a blasphemer, crying against God, as though defending and excusing my sins.
