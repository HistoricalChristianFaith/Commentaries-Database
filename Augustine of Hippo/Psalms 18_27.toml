"For You will make whole the humble people" [Psalm 18:27]. Now this seems froward to the froward, that You will make whole those who confess their sins. "And You will humble the eyes of the proud." But them that are "ignorant of God's righteousness, and seek to establish their own," [RomansÂ 10:3] You will humble.
