De Con Evan, ii, 70: Matthew indeed subjoins that they answered and said, “He will miserably destroy those wicked men,” which Mark here says was not their answer, but that the Lord after putting the question, as it were answered Himself. But we may easily understand either that their answer was subjoined without the insertion of, “they answered,” or “they said,” which at the same time was implied; or else, that their answer, being the truth, was attributed to the Lord, since Healso Himself gave this answer concerning them, being the Truth.
