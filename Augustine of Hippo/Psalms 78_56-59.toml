"And He made to dwell in their tabernacles the tribes of Israel." In the tabernacles, he says, of the Gentiles He made the tribes of Israel to dwell, which I think can better be explained spiritually, inasmuch as unto celestial glory, whence sinning angels have been cast forth and cast down, by Christ's grace we are being uplifted. For that generation crooked and embittering, inasmuch as for these corporal blessings they put not off the coat of oldness, "Did tempt" yet, "and provoked the high God, and His testimonies they kept not [Psalm 78:56]: and they turned them away, and they kept not the covenant, like their fathers" [Psalm 78:57]. For under a sort of covenant and decree they said, "All things which our Lord God has spoken we will do, and we will hear." [Exodus 19:8] It is a remarkable  thing indeed which he says, "like their fathers:" while throughout the whole text of the Psalm he was seeming to speak of the same men as it were, yet now it appears that the words did concern those who were already in the land of promise, and that the fathers spoken of were of those who did provoke in the desert. "They were turned," he says, "into a crooked," or, as some copies have it, "into a perverse bow" [Psalm 78:58]. But what this is does better appear in that which follows, where he says, "And unto wrath they provoked Him with their hills" [Psalm 78:59]. It does signify that they leaped into idolatry. The bow then was perverted, not for the name of the Lord, but against the name of the Lord: who said to the same people, "You shall have none other Gods but Me." [Exodus 20:3] But by the bow He does signify the mind's intention. This same idea, lastly, more clearly working out, "And in their graven idols," he says, "they provoked Him to indignation."
