"Preserve  My Soul, for I am holy" [Psalm 86:2]. I know not whether any one could say this, "I am holy," but He who was in the world without sin: He by whom all sins were not committed but remitted.  We own it to be His voice saying, "Preserve  My Soul, for I am holy;" of course in that form of a servant which He had assumed. For in that was flesh, in that, was also a Soul. For He was not, as some  have said, only Flesh and the Word: but Flesh and Soul also, and the Word, and all this, One Son of God, One Christ, One Saviour; in the form of God equal to the Father, in the form of a servant the Head of the Church. When therefore I hear, "for I am holy," I recognise His voice: yet do I exclude my own? Surely He speaks inseparably from His body when He speaks thus. Shall I then dare to say, "For I am holy"? If holy as making holy, and as needing none to sanctify, I should be proud and false: but if holy as made holy, as it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy," [Leviticus 19:2] then the body of Christ may venture, and that one Man "crying from the end of the earth,"  may venture with his Head, and under his Head, to say, "For I am holy." For he has received the grace of holiness, the grace of Baptism, and of remission of sins. [1 Corinthians 6:11] ...Say unto your God, I am holy, for You have sanctified me: because I received, not because I had: because You gave, not because I deserved. For on another side you are beginning to do an injury to our Lord Jesus Christ Himself. For if all Christians who are faithful and have been baptized in Him have put Him on, as the Apostle says, "As many as are baptized in Christ have put on Christ:" [Galatians 3:27] if they have been made members of His body, and say that they are not holy, they do injury to their Head, of whom they are members, and yet not holy. Look thou where you are and from your Head assume dignity. For thou were in darkness, "but now light in the Lord." [Ephesians 5:8] "You were sometime darkness," he says: but did ye remain darkness? Was it for this the Enlightener came, that you might still remain darkness, or that in Him ye might become light? Therefore, every Christian by himself, therefore also the whole body of Christ, may say, it may cry everywhere, while it suffers tribulations, various temptations and offenses, it may say, "Preserve  my soul, for I am holy: my God, save Your servant, that puts his trust in You." See thou, that holy man is not proud, since he puts his trust in God.
