"Gather to Him His righteous" [Psalm 50:5]. The voice divine and prophetic, seeing future things as if present does exhort the Angels gathering. For He shall send His Angels, and before Him shall be gathered all nations. [Matthew 25:32] Gather to Him His righteous. What righteous men save those that live of faith and do works of mercy? For those works are works of righteousness. You have the Gospel: "Beware of doing your righteousness before men to be seen of them." [Matthew 6:1] And as if it were inquired, What righteousness? "When therefore you do alms," He says. Therefore alms He has signified to be works of righteousness. Those very persons gather for His righteous: gather those that have had compassion on the "needy," that have considered the needy and poor:  gather them, "The Lord preserve them, and make them to live;" "Gather to Him His righteous: who order His covenant above sacrifices:" that is, who think of His promises above those things which they work. For those things are sacrifices, God saying, "I will have mercy more than sacrifice."  "Who keep His covenant more than sacrifice."
