He and his brothers were in the habit of making fun of the prophets. I imagine and have no doubt at all that he talked with his brothers about the prophets. He talked about their urging us to do good and forbidding us to do wrong, and their frightening us with torments to come and promising rewards to come. He made fun of all this and said with his brothers, “What life is there after death? What does rottenness in the grave remember? What do ashes feel? Everyone is carried there and buried. Whoever came back from there and was heard?” That is the reason, as he remembered his words, that he wanted Lazarus to go back to his brothers, so that now they would not say, “Whoever came back from there?” This also has a very suitable and proper answer. This man, you see, seems to have been a Jew. That is why he said, “Father Abraham.” He got an excellent and fitting answer. “If they do not listen to Moses and the prophets, they will not be convinced even if one should rise from the dead.” This was fulfilled with the Jews, because they did not listen to Moses and the prophets, nor did they believe Christ when he rose. Had he not foretold this to them before, “If you believed Moses, you would also believe me”? Sermon
