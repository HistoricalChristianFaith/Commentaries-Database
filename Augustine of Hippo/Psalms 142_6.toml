"Give heed unto my prayer, for much have I been humbled" [Psalm 142:6]. Humbled by persecutors, humbled in confession. He humbles himself out of the sight of man: he is humbled by enemies in their sight. Therefore is he lifted up by Him both visibly and invisibly. Invisibly are the martyrs already lifted up; visibly shall they be lifted up, "when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption" in the resurrection of the dead; when this very part of him, against which alone her persecutors could rage, shall be renewed. "Fear not them that kill the body, but cannot kill the soul." [Matthew 10:28] And what perishes? What kill they?...Why then are you anxious about the rest of your members, when you shall not lose even a hair?  "Deliver me from them that persecute me." From whom do you think that he prays to be delivered? From men who persecuted him? Is it so? Are merely men our enemies? We have other enemies, invisible, who persecute us in another way. Man persecutes, that he may slay the body; another persecutes, that he ensnare the soul. [Ephesians 2:2] ...There are then other enemies of ours too, from whom we ought to pray God to deliver us, lest they lead us astray, either by crushing us with troubles of this world, or alluring us by its enticements. Who are these enemies? Let us see whether they are plainly described by any servant of the Lord, by any soldier, now perfected, who has engaged with them. Hear the Apostle saying, "We wrestle not against flesh and blood:" [Ephesians 6:12] as though he would say, Turn not your hatred against men; think not them your enemies; think not that it is by their hostility you are being bruised; these men whom you fear are flesh and blood...."For they are strengthened over me." Who said, "they are strengthened over me"? The Body of Christ cries out; it is the voice of the Church; the members of Christ cry out, "Much has the number of sinners increased." "Because iniquity has abounded, the love of many waxes cold." [Matthew 24:12]
