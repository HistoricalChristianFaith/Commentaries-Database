"How great troubles have You shown to me, many and evil!" [Psalm 71:20]. Deservedly, proud servant. For you have willed perversely to be like your God, who had been made after the image of your Lord. [Genesis 1:27] Would you have it to be well with you, when withdrawing from that good? Truly God says to you, if you withdraw from Me, and it is well with you, I am not your good. Again, if He is good, and in the highest degree good, and of Himself to Himself good, and by no foreign good thing good, and is Himself our chief good; by withdrawing from Him, what will you be but evil? Also if He is Himself our blessedness, what will there be to one withdrawing from Him, except misery? Return thou then after misery, and say, "O Lord, who is like You? How great troubles have You shown to me, many and evil!"
