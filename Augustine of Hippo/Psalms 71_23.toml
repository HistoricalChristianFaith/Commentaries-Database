Again hear this because of that same "again" and "again." "My lips shall exult when I shall psalm to You" [Psalm 71:23]. Because lips are wont to be spoken of both belonging to the inner and to the outward man, it is uncertain in what sense lips have been used: there follows therefore, "And my soul which You have redeemed." Therefore regarding the inward lips having been saved in hope, brought back from the bottomless places of the earth in faith and love, still however waiting for the redemption of our body, we say what? Already he has said, "And my soul which You have redeemed."
