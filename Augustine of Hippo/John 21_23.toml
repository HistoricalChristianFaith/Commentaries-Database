But still, as I began to say, if some deny the death of Moses, whom Scripture itself, in the very passage where we read that his sepulcher could nowhere be found, explicitly declares to have died. How much more may occasion be taken from these words where the Lord says, “Thus do I wish him to stay till I come,” to believe that John is sleeping but still alive beneath the ground? In fact, we have a tradition about him (which is found in certain apocryphal scriptures) that he was present, in good health, when he ordered a sepulcher to be made for himself. And that, when it was dug and prepared with all possible care, he laid himself down there as in a bed and became immediately dead. And yet, as those think who so understand these words of the Lord, [he was] not really dead but only lying like one in such a condition. And while he was considered “dead” he was actually buried [according to this tradition] when asleep and that he will so remain until the coming of Christ, making known meanwhile the fact of his life by the bubbling up of the dust, which is believed to be forced by the breath of the sleeper to ascend from the depths to the surface of the grave. I think it quite superfluous to contend with such an opinion. For those may see for themselves who know the locality whether the ground there does or has done to it what is said regarding it, because, in truth, we too have heard of it from those who are not altogether unreliable witnesses.
