De Cons. Evan. ii, 29: This account of the two blind men and the dumb daemon isread in Matthew only. The two blind men of whom the others speak are not the same as these, though something similar was done with them. So that even if Matthew had not also recorded their cure, we might have seen that this present narrative was of a different transaction. And this we ought diligently to remember, that many actions of our Lord are very much like one another, but areproved not to be the same action, by being both related at different times bythe same Evangelist. So that when we find cases in which one is recorded by one Evangelist, and another by another, and some difference which we cannot reconcile between their accounts, we should suppose that they are like, but not the same, events. Herein He teaches us not to return accusations to them that accuse us, but kindness. For he that ceases to do good because of accusation, shows that his good has been done because of men. But if for Godâ€™s sake you do good to your fellow-servants, you will not cease from doing good whatever they do, that your reward may be greater.
