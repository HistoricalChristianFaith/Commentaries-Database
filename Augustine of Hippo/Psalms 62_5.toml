What are You doing, O Idithun, Body of Christ, leaping over them? What are You doing amid all these things? What will You do? Will you faint? Will You not persevere even unto the end? Will You not hearken, "He that shall have persevered even unto the end, the same shall be saved," [Matthew 10:22] though for that iniquity abounds, the love of many shall wax cold? [Matthew 24:12] And where is it that You have leaped over them? Where is it that Your conversation is in Heaven? [Philippians 3:20] But they cleave unto earthly things, as though earthborn they mind the earth, and are earth, the serpent's food. [Genesis 3:14] What do you amid these things?..."Nevertheless, to God my soul shall be made subject" [Psalm 62:5]. And who would endure so great things, either open wars, or secret lyings-in-wait? Who would endure so great things amid open enemies, amid false brethren? Who would endure so great things? Would a man? And if a man would, would a man of himself? I have not so leaped over that I should be lifted up, and fall: "To God my soul shall be made subject: for from Himself is my patience." What patience is there amid so great scandals, except that "if for that which we do not see we hope, through patience we look for it"? [Romans 8:25] There comes my pain, there will come my rest also; there comes my tribulation, there will come my cleansing also. For does gold glitter in the furnace of the refiner? In a necklace it will glitter, in an ornament it will glitter: let it suffer however the furnace, in order that being cleansed from dross it may come into light. This is the furnace, there is there chaff, there gold, there fire, into this blows the refiner: in the furnace burns the chaff, and the gold is cleansed; the one into ashes is turned, of dross the other is cleansed. The furnace is the world, the chaff unrighteous men, the gold just men; the fire tribulation, the refiner God: that which therefore the refiner wills I do; wherever the Maker sets me I endure it. I am commanded to endure, He knows how to cleanse. Though there burn the chaff to set me on fire, and as if to consume me; that into ashes is burned, I of dross am cleansed. Wherefore? Because "to God my soul shall be made subject: for from Himself is my patience."

Let us by all means admire the courage of the holy martyrs in their sufferings; but in such a way that we proclaim the grace of God. They themselves, after all, certainly did not wish to be praised in themselves but in the one to whom it is said, "In the Lord shall my soul be praised." Those who understand this are not proud; they ask shyly, they receive joyfully; they persevere, they do not lose any more what they have received. Because they are not proud, they are gentle; and that is why, after saying "In the Lord shall my soul be praised," he added, "Let the gentle hear and be glad." Where would feeble flesh be, where would maggots and rottenness be, unless what we have been singing were true: "My soul will submit itself to God, since it is from him that my patience comes"? Now the virtue the martyrs had, in order to endure all the ills inflicted on them, is called patience.

Let the martyr turn his back on the unbelieving and ungrateful flatterer; let him turn his face toward the most generous of bountiful givers and impute his very martyrdom to God, not treating it as something he has offered to God from what is his own. Let him say instead, "In the Lord shall my soul be praised; let the gentle hear and be glad." And when you say to him, "What do you mean, 'In the Lord shall my soul be praised?' So is it not being praised in yourself?"—he responds with, "Shall not my soul subject itself to God? For it is from him that my patience comes." So why is it mine? Because I opened my lap and was happy to receive it; it is from him, and it is mine. Both from him, and also mine; and because it is from him, it is mine all the more safely. It is mine, but it does not come to me from myself. In order really to possess my gift, I acknowledge God as the giver. Because if I do not acknowledge God as the giver, God takes away his good thing, and there only remains my bad thing, through my choice, through my free will.
