"For, lo, the kings of the earth are gathered together" [Psalm 48:4]. Behold now those sides of the North, see how they come, see how they say, "Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord: and He will teach us His way, and we will walk in it." [Isaiah 2:3] "And have come together in one." In what one, but that "corner-stone"? [Ephesians 2:20]
