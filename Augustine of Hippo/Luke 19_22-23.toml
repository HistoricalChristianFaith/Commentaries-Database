We are well aware of the threats made by the Lord's merciful "greed." He is everywhere seeking a profitable return on his money. He says to the lazy servant, who wished to pass judgment on something he could not see, "Wicked servant, out of your own mouth I condemn you. You said I am a difficult man, reaping where I have not sown, gathering where I have not scattered. So you knew all about my greed. You, then, should have given my money to the stockbrokers. When I came, I would have demanded it with interest." We could only lay out our Lord's money. He is the one who will demand the interest on it, not only from this man but also from all of us.
