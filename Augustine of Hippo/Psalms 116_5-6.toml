"Gracious is the Lord, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful" [Psalm 116:5]. He is gracious, righteous, and merciful. Gracious in the first place, because He has inclined His ear unto me; and I knew not that the ear of God had approached my lips, till I was aroused by those beautiful feet, that I might call upon the Lord's Name: for who has called upon Him, save he whom He first called? Hence therefore He is in the first place "gracious;" but "righteous," because He scourges; and again, "merciful," because He receives; for "He scourges every son whom He receives;" nor ought it to be so bitter to me that He scourges, as sweet that He receives. For how should not "The Lord, who keeps little ones" [Psalm 116:6], scourge those whom, when of mature age, He seeks to be heirs; "for what son is he whom the father chastens not?" [HebrewsÂ 12:6-7] "I was in misery, and He helped me." He helped me, because I was in misery; for the pain which the physician causes by his knife is not penal, but salutary.
