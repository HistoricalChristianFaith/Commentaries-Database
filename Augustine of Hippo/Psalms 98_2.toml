"The Lord has made known His salvation" [Psalm 98:2]. This very right hand, this very arm, this very salvation, is our Lord Jesus Christ of whom it is said, "And all flesh shall see the salvation of God;" [Luke 3:6] of whom also that Simeon who embraced the Infant in his arms, spoke, "Lord, now let Your servant depart in peace; for my eyes have seen Your salvation." [Luke 2:28-30] "The Lord has made known His salvation." To whom did He make it known? To a part, or to the whole? Not to any part specially. Let no man betray, no man deceive, no man say, "Lo, here is Christ, or there:" [Matthew 24:23] the man who says, Lo, He is here, or there, points to some particular spots. To whom "has the Lord declared His salvation"? Hear what follows: "His righteousness has He openly showed in the sight of the heathen." Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ is the right hand of God, the arm of God, the salvation of God, and the righteousness of God.
