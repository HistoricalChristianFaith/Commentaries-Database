"For the Word of the Lord is right:" for the Word of the Lord is right, to make you that which of yourselves ye cannot be. "And all His works are done in faith" [Psalm 33:4]: lest any think that by the merit of works he has arrived at faith, when in faith are done all the works which God Himself loves.
