Ep. 199, 22: That now from the Evangelic and Prophetic signs that we see cometo pass, we ought to look that the Lord’s coming should be nigh, who is there that denies? For daily it draws ever more and more near, but of the exact time it is said, “It is not for you to know the times or the seasons.” What he spoke was not false, and yet how many years have elapsed, how much more may we not say that the Lord’s coming is at hand now, that so great an accession of time has been made?
