"In God I will praise my discourses, in God I have  hoped: I will not fear what flesh does to me" [Psalm 56:4]. Wherefore? Because in God I will praise my discourses. If in yourself you praise your discourses: I say not that you are not to fear; it is impossible that thou have not to fear. For your discourses either false you will have, and therefore your own, because false: or if your discourses shall be true, and you shall deem yourself not to have them from God but of yourself to speak; true they will be, but you will be false: but if you shall have known that you can say nothing true in the wisdom of God, in the faith of the Truth, save that which from Him you have received, of whom is said, "For what have you which you have not received?" [1 Corinthians 4:7] Then in God you are praising your discourses, in order that in God you may be praised by the discourses of God...."In God I have hoped, I will not fear what flesh does to me." Were you not the same that a little before wast saying, "Have pity on me, O Lord, for man has trodden me down; all day long warring he has troubled me"?  How therefore here, "I will not fear what flesh does to me"? What shall he do to you? Thou yourself a little before hast said, "Hath trodden me down, has troubled me." Nothing shall he do, when these things he shall do? He has had regard to the wine which flows from treading, and has made answer, Evidently he has trodden down, evidently has troubled; but what to me shall he do? A grape I was, wine I shall be: "In God I have hoped, I will not fear what flesh does to me."
