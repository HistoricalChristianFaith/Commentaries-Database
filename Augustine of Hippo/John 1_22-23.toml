The voice came before the Word. How can the voice be before the Word?… We have heard that Christ is the Word; let us hear that John is the voice. When he was asked, “You then, who are you?” he answered, “I am the voice of one crying in the desert.” So if Christ is the Word, John the voice, John was taken over as the voice in order that the Word might be spoken to us. And that the Word might come to us, the voice preceded it. That is why it is both true that Christ was before John in eternity, and that all the same, he had not to be born first, unless John came to us before the Word as the voice. So there is going to be a time when we shall see the Word as he is seen by the angels; now, however, let us make progress in the Word, so that we may remain with him forever.
