"The Lord brings the counsel of the heathen to nought;" of them that seek not His Kingdom, but kingdoms of their own. "He makes the devices of the people of none effect:" of them that covet earthly happiness. "And reproves the counsels of princes" [Psalm 33:10]: of them that seek to rule over such peoples.
