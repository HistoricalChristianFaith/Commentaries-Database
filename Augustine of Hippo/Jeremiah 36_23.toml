Doubtless you are not unaware that in the early history of the chosen people the sacrilege of idolatry was committed and a prophetic book burned by a scornful king. But the crime of schism would not be punished more severely than any of these acts unless it were considered more grievous. Surely you remember how the earth opened and swallowed up alive the authors of schism and how fire coming down from heaven destroyed those who followed them. But neither the making and adoring of an idol nor the burning of a sacred book deserve to meet such vengeance.
