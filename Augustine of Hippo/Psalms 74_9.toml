Let us see therefore in this place now the understanding of Asaph, let us see if he profits by tribulation. Observe what he says: "Our signs we have not seen, no longer is there prophet, and us He will not know as yet" [Psalm 74:9]. Behold those Jews who say that they are not known as yet, that is, that they are yet in captivity, that not yet they are delivered, do yet expect Christ. Christ will  come, but He will come as Judge; the first time to call, afterwards to sever. He will come, because He has come,  and that He will come is evident; but hereafter from above He will come. Before you He was, O Israel. You were bruised because you stumbled against Him lying down: that you may not be ground to powder, observe Him coming from above. For thus it was foretold by the prophet: "Whoever shall stumble upon that stone shall be bruised, and upon whomsoever it shall have come, it shall grind him to powder."  He does bruise when little, He shall grind to powder when great. Now your signs you see not, now there is no prophet: and you say, "and us He will not know as yet:" because yourselves know not Him as yet. "No longer is there a prophet; and us He will not know as yet."
