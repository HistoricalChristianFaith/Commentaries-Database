So there you are, I have said a few words to prevent the boats from sinking. Something much more dreadful happened at that catch of fish, and that is that the nets were broken. The nets were broken, heresies arose. What else, after all, are schisms, but tears of the fabric? The first catch of fish has to be endured and tolerated in such a way that nobody grows weary, even though it is written, “Weariness has taken hold of me because of sinners who forsake your law.” It is the boat crying out that it is being overloaded by the mob, as though the boat itself is giving voice to these words, “I have become weary because of sinners who forsake your law.” Even if you are being overloaded, always see to it that you do not sink. Bad people are to be put up with now, not to be separated and cut off. “Mercy and judgment we shall sing to the Lord.” First of all mercy is extended, and later on judgment is exercised; separation will happen at the judgment. Now may the good person listen to me and become better; may the bad person too listen and become good, while it is the time for repentance, not for sentence.
