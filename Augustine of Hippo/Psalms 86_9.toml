"All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord" [Psalm 86:9]. He has announced the Church: "All nations." If there is any nation which God has not made, it will not worship Him: but there is no nation which God has not made; because God made Adam and Eve, the source of all nations, thence all nations sprang. All nations therefore has God made. When was this said? When before Him there worshipped none but a few holy men in one people of the Hebrews, then this was said: and see now what it is which was said: "All nations that You have made," etc. When these things were spoken, they were not seen, and they were believed: now that they are seen, why are they denied? "All nations that You have made shall come and worship before You, O Lord, and shall glorify Your Name."
