What of this fact, that God in so many passages commands that all his precepts be kept and carried out? How can he command if there is no free choice? And what of that “blessed man” about whom the psalmist says that “his will has been according to the law of the Lord”? Does he not make it perfectly clear that it is by the will that a man takes his stand on the side of God’s law? Finally, there are many commandments that in one way or another refer by name to the will. For example, “Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.” And there are similar passages, such as, “Do not become like the horse and the mule, who have no understanding”; and, “Do not cast off the counsels of your mother”;6 and, “Be not wise in your own conceit”; and, “Do not fall away from the correction of the Lord”;8 and, “Neglect not the law”; and, “Do not refrain from helping the needy”; and, “Plan no evil against your friends”;10 and, “Mind not the deceit of a woman”; and, “He would not understand that he might do well”;12 and, “They were unwilling to take correction.” What do such numerous passages from the books of the Old Testament show, except that a person’s will is possessed of free choice?
