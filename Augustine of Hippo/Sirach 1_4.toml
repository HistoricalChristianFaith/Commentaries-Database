quote='''
Wisdom was created before all thingsâ€”not certainly that Wisdom that is clearly coeternal and equal to you, our God, his Father, and by whom all things were created and in whom, as the Beginning, you created heaven and earth. Rather, truly, it was that wisdom that has been created, namely, the intellectual nature that, in the contemplation of light, is light. For this is called wisdom, although it is created. But as great as the difference is between the Light that enlightens and that which is enlightened, so great is the difference between the Wisdom that creates and that which has been created. It is just as great as the difference between the Righteousness that justifies and the righteousness that has been made by justification.
