But what adds he? "The Lord will delight in them that fear Him, and in them that hope in His mercy" [Psalm 147:11]. A robber is feared, and a wild beast is feared, and an unjust and powerful man is much feared. "The Lord will delight in them that hope in His mercy." Behold, Judas, who betrayed our Lord, feared, but he did not hope in His mercy....It is well indeed that you have feared, but only if you trusted in His mercy, whom you have feared. He in despair "went and hanged himself." In such wise then fear the Lord, that you trust in His mercy....
