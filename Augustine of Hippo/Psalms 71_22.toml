"For I will confess to You in the vessels of a Psalm Your truth" [Psalm 71:22]. The vessels of a Psalm are a Psaltery. But what is a Psaltery? An instrument of wood and strings.  What does it signify? There is some difference between it and a harp:...there seems to be signified by the Psaltery the Spirit, by the harp the flesh. And because he had spoken of two bringings back of ours from the bottomless places of the earth, one after the Spirit in hope, the other after the body in substance; hear thou of these two: "For I will confess to You in the vessels of a Psalm Your truth." This after the Spirit: concerning the body what? "I will psalm to You on a harp, Holy One of Israel."
