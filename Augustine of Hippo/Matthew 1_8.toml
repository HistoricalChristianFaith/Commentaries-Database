Hilsr. Amast. V. et N. Test. q. 85: Or, Ochozias, Joash, and Amasias, were excluded from the number, because their wickedness was continuous and without interval. For Solomon was suffered to hold the kingdom for his father's deserts, Roboam for his son's. But these three doing evil successively were excluded. This then is an example how a race is cut off when wickedness isshewn therein in perpetual succession. "And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begatAchaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias. ”And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manassesbegat Amon; and Amon begat Josias.”
