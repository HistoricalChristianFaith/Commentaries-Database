..."They have humbled Your people, O Lord; and have troubled Your heritage" [Psalm 94:5]. "They have murdered the widow, and the fatherless: and slain the proselyte" [Psalm 94:6]; that is, the traveller, the pilgrim: the comer from far, as the Psalmist calls himself. Each of these expressions is too clear in meaning to make it worth while to dwell upon them.
