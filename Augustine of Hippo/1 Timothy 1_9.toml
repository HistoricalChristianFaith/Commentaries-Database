“The law is not made for the righteous,” and yet “the law is good, if one uses it lawfully.” Now by connecting together these two seemingly contrary statements, the apostle warns and urges his reader to sift the question and solve it. For how can it be that “the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,” if what follows is also true: “Knowing this, that the law is not made for the righteous”? For who but a righteous man lawfully uses the law? Yet it is not for him that it is made, but for the unrighteous.… The unrighteous man therefore lawfully uses the law, that he may become righteous. But when he has become so, he must no longer use it as a vehicle, for he has arrived at his journey’s end—or rather (that I may employ the apostle’s own simile, which has been already mentioned) as a schoolmaster, seeing that he is now fully instructed.
