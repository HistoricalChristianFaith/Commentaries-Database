What of others? For all are not so conquered as to be converted and believe: many continue in obstinacy, many preserve in heart the spirit of going before, and if they exert it not, yet they labour with it, and finding opportunity bring it forth. Of such, what follows? "Let them be as dust before the wind." "Not so are the ungodly, not so; but as the dust which the wind drives away from the face of the earth." The wind is temptation; the dust are the ungodly. When temptation comes, the dust is raised, it neither stands nor resists. "Let them be as dust before the wind, and let the Angel of the Lord trouble them."
