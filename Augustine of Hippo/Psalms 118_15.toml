"The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous" [Psalm 118:15]; where they who raged against their bodies thought there was the voice of sorrow and destruction. For they did not know the inward joy of the saints in their future hope. Whence the Apostle also says, "As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing;" [2 Corinthians 6:10] and again, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also." [Romans 5:3]

9. "The voice of joy and health is in the dwellings of the righteous" (ver. 15); where they who raged against their bodies thought there was the voice of sorrow and destruction. For they did not know the inward joy of the saints in their future hope. Whence the Apostle also saith, "As sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing;" and again, "And not only so, but we glory in tribulations also."
