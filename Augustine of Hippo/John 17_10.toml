It is sufficiently apparent how it is that all that belongs to the Father belongs also to the Son because the Son himself is also God and, born of the Father, is the Father’s equal. It is not in the sense in which the elder son is told, “You are always with me, and all that I have is yours.” For that was said of all those creatures that are inferior to the holy rational creature21 and are certainly subordinate to the church.… But here it means that even the rational creature itself is included, which is subject only to God, so that all beneath the rational heavenly creature are also subject to him. Since then such a creature belongs to God the Father, it would not at the same time be the Son’s unless he were equal to the Father.… For it is impossible that the saints, of whom this is said, should belong to anyone except the one who created and sanctified them. And for the same reason, everything also that is theirs must of necessity be the Son’s also to whom they themselves belong. Since, then, they belong both to the Father and to the Son, they demonstrate the equality of those to whom they equally belong. But when he says, speaking of the Holy Spirit, “All things that the Father has are mine; therefore I said that he shall take of mine and shall show it unto you,” he referred to those things that pertain to the divinity of the Father and in which he is equal to him in having all that he has because he adds, “he [the Holy Spirit] shall receive of mine.” And the Holy Spirit would never receive from a creature what was subject to the Father and the Son.
