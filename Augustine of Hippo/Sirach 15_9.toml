quote='''
The old song sings about sexual lust, the new song sings of divine love. If your song is moved by lust, then you are singing an old song. Let the words of the new song resonate in your mouth, but if you are sinner there is no such thing as beautiful praise on your lips. It is best to be renewed and chastened than to continue singing the same old song. If, in fact, you have become a new person, even if you remain silent and your singing never reaches human ears, your heart elevates the new inner song15 so that it reaches the ear of God who has restored you. You love, and, even if you are silent, your love is itself a voice that sings to God.
