If, because of the sorrows the soul has conceived by its love of the world, we are not yet able to taste how sweet the Lord is, let us at least believe what the divine authority wanted said in the holy Scriptures regarding his Son, “born,” as the apostle says, “of the seed of David according to the flesh.” In fact, as it is written in the Gospel, “Everything was made through him, and without him nothing was made.” He is the one who had compassion on our weakness, a weakness that we merited, not by his work but by our will. “Indeed, God created human beings for immortality” and gave them free will. A person would not be excellent if he were to observe God’s commandments out of necessity and not through his own will.
