"He will not be afraid of any evil hearing; for his heart stands fast and believes in the Lord" [Psalm 112:7]. Such as the words which he will hear addressed to those on the left hand, "Depart into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." [Matthew 25:34, 41] He therefore who seeks here not his own things, but those of Jesus Christ, [Philippians 2:21] most patiently endures sufferings, waits for the promises with faith. Nor is he broken down by any temptations.
