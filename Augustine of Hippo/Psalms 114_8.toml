"Who turned the hard rock into standing waters, and the flint stone into springing wells" [Psalm 114:8]. For He melted Himself, and what may be called His hardness to water those who believe in Him, that He might in them become "a fountain of water gushing forth unto everlasting life;" [John 4:14] because formerly, when He was not known, He seemed hard. Hence they who said, "This is an hard saying, who can bear it?" [John 6:60] were confounded, and waited not until He should flow and stream upon them when the Scriptures were revealed. The rock, that hardness, was turned into pools of water, that stone into fountains of waters, when on His resurrection, "He expounded unto them, commencing with Moses and all the prophets, how Christ ought to suffer thus;" [Luke 24:26-27] and sent the Holy Ghost, of whom He said, "If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink." [John 7:37]
