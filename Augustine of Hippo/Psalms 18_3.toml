"With praise will I call upon the Lord, and I shall be safe from Mine enemies" [Psalm 18:3]. Seeking not My own but the Lord's glory, I will call upon Him, and there shall be no means whereby the errors of ungodliness can hurt Me.

There you have something you can do. Praising, callâ€”but remember it is the Lord you praise and call on. Because if you praise yourself, you will not be saved from your enemies. Praising, call on the Lord, and you will be saved from your enemies.
