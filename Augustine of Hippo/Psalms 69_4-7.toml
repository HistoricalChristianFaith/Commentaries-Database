Just as it was said to Jesus, “Why, then, will you die if you have not committed a sin that deserves the death penalty?” Immediately he answered, “I do what the Father has commanded me so that the world may know that I love the Father. Arise, let us go.” Where? To the place where he, who had done nothing deserving of death, would be handed over to death. The Father had commanded that he should die—he about whom it had been prophesied, “I must repay what I did not take.” He was the one who was about to suffer death without deserving it and [thereby] redeem us from the penalty of death. Adam, however, had committed sin when he reached out his hand to the tree [to pick the forbidden fruit]; he presumptuously deceived himself that he could seize the name of divinity that cannot be shared with or given to anyone [except one who is God]; divinity was conferred on the Son of God by nature, not by robbery.

Psalm 68 [LXX] also includes in its title the words “for the things that will be entirely changed.” This psalm sings of the passion of our Lord Jesus Christ, assuming to himself even certain words of his members, that is, of his faithful. For he himself did not have any sin, but he carried our sins; thus the psalm says “and my offenses are not hidden from you.” Here is written and foretold what we read in the Gospel as having happened: “And they gave me gall for my food, and in my thirst they gave me vinegar to drink.” In him, therefore, the old events have been changed that the title of the psalm predicted were to be changed.
