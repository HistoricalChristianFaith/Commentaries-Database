Again, the two which follow are the same. "In his snare he will humble him," is craft [Psalm 10:10]. "He shall decline and fall, while he shall have domination over the poor," is violence. For a "snare" naturally points to "lying in wait:" but domination most openly conveys the idea of terror. And well does he say, "He will humble him in his snare." For when he shall begin to do those signs, the more wonderful they shall appear to men, the more those Saints that shall be then will be despised, and, as it were, set at nought: he, whom they shall resist by righteousness and innocence, shall seem to overcome by the marvels that he does. But "he shall decline and fall, while he shall have domination over the poor;" that is, while he shall inflict whatsoever punishments he will upon the servants of God that resist him.
