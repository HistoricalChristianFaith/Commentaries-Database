Next he adds: "I will keep Your ordinances" [Psalm 119:8]....But what is it that follows? "O forsake me not even exceedingly!" or, as some copies have it, "even too much," instead of, "even exceedingly."  But since God had left the world to the desert of sins, He would have forsaken it "even exceedingly," if so powerful a cure had not supported it, that is, the grace of God through our Lord Jesus Christ; but now, according to this prayer of the body of Christ, He forsook it not "even exceedingly;" for, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself." [2 Corinthians 5:19] ...
