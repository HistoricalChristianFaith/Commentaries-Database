It talks of a mountain, and the mountain is veiled to the party of Donatus.… The holy Daniel saw a vision and wrote down what he saw, and he said that he had seen a stone hewn out of a mountain without hands. It is Christ, coming from the nations of the Jews, which was also a mountain, you see, because it has the kingdom.… What is the mountain over which the heretics stumbled? Listen to Daniel again: “And that stone grew and became a great mountain, such that it filled all the face of the earth.” How right the psalm is to say to Christ the Lord as he rises again, “Be exalted over the heavens, O God, and let your glory be over the whole earth.” What is your glory over the whole earth? Over the whole earth is your church, over the whole earth your bride.

“His holy hill” is his holy church. It is that mountain which, according to Daniel’s vision, grew from a very small stone till it overtook the kingdoms of the earth and grew to such a size that it “filled the face of the earth.”
