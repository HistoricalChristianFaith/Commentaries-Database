Therefore, it is good for a person to say truthfully and with the full strength of his free will, "I will provide you with my strength," because the man who thought he could keep it without the help of him who gave it went abroad into a far country and wasted his substance, living riotously. But, worn down by the wretchedness of a harsh slavery, he returned to himself and said, "I will arise and go to my father." But how could he have had this good thought if the most merciful Father had not whispered it to him in secret? It was because he understood this that the minister of the New Testament said, "Not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God." Consequently, when the psalmist also had said, "I will provide you with my strength," lest he should attribute to himself the fact that he was keeping it, and as if he recalled to mind that "except the Lord keep the city, they watch in vain that keep it," and that "he shall neither slumber nor sleep that keeps Israel," he added the reason of his being able to keep it, or, rather, the guard by whom it is kept and said, "For you, O God, are my protector."
