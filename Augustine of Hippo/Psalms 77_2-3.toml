..."My soul has refused to be comforted" [Psalm 77:2]. So great weariness did here possess me, that my soul did close the door against all comfort. Whence such weariness to him? It may be that his vineyard has been hailed on, or his olive has yielded no fruit, or the vintage has been interrupted by rain. Whence the weariness to him? Hear this out of another Psalm. For therein is the voice of the same: "weariness has bowed me down, because of sinners forsaking Your law."  He says then that he was overcome with so great weariness because of this sort of evil thing; so as that his soul refused to be comforted. Weariness had well near swallowed him up, and sorrow had ingulfed him altogether beyond remedy, he refuses to be comforted. What then remained?  In the first place, see whence he is comforted. Had he not waited for one who might condole with him?. .."I have been mindful of God, and I have been delighted" [Psalm 77:3]. My hands had not wrought in vain, they had found a great comforter. While not being idle, "I have been mindful of God, and I have been delighted." God must therefore be praised, of whom this man being mindful, has been delighted, and has been comforted in sorrowful case, and refreshed when safety was in a manner despaired of: God must therefore be praised. In fine, because he has been comforted, in continuation he says, "I have babbled." In that same comfort being made mindful of God, I have been delighted, and have "babbled." What is, "I have babbled"? I have rejoiced, I have exulted in speaking. For babblers they are properly called, that by the common people are named talkative, who at the approach of joy are neither able nor willing to be silent. This man has become such an one. And again he says what? "And my spirit has fainted."

But now in that part of the reading that sounded most recently in your ears, what did you hear Thomas saying? “I won’t believe, unless I touch.” And the Lord says to this Thomas, “Come, touch, put your hands into my side, and do not be incredulous but believing.” “I,” he is saying, “if you do not think it is enough for me to offer myself to your eyes, am also offering myself to your hands. Perhaps, you see, you are one of those who sing in the psalm, ‘In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord with my hands in the night in his presence.’ ” Why was he seeking with his hands? Because he was seeking in the night. What does that mean, was seeking in the night? He was carrying the darkness of unbelief in his heart.
