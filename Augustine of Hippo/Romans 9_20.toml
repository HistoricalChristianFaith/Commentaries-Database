As long as you are just a creature, says Paul, like this lump of clay, and you have not been led to spiritual things, so that as a spiritual man you might judge all things and be judged by no one, it is right for you to hold back from this kind of inquiry and not to answer back to God. For everyone who wants to know Godâ€™s plan ought first to be received into his friendship, and this is only possible for spiritual people who already bear the image of the heavenly.
