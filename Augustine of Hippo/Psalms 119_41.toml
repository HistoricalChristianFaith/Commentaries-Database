"And let Your loving mercy come also unto us, O Lord" [Psalm 119:41]. This sentence seems annexed to the foregoing: for he does not say, Let it come unto me, but, " And let it come unto me."...What then does he here pray for, save that through His loving mercy who commanded, he may perform the commandments which he has coveted? For he explains in some degree what he meant by adding, "even Your salvation, according to Your word:" that is, according to Your promise. Whence the Apostle desires us to be understood as the children of promise: [Romans 9:8] that we may not imagine that what we are is our own work, but refer the whole to the grace of God....Christ Himself is the Salvation of God, so that the whole body of Christ may say, "By the grace of God I am what I am." [1 Corinthians 15:10]
