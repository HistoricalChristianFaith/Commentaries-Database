This he says not because of any inequality between the Word of God and the Holy Spirit but because the presence of the Son of man among them would impede the coming of the [Spirit]. For the Holy Spirit did not humble himself, as the Son did, by taking on him the form of a servant. It was necessary therefore that the form of the servant should be removed from their eyes. For so long as they looked on that form, they thought that Christ was no more than what they saw him to be.

For what does this mean, “If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you. But if I depart, I will send him to you”? Was it that he could not send him while located here himself? Who would venture to say so? Neither was it that the other [i.e., the Spirit] had withdrawn from where he was or that he had come from the Father in such a way that he did not still remain with the Father. And still further, how could he, even when having his own dwelling on earth, be unable to send him, who we know came and remained upon him at his baptism? And even more so, how could this be the case when we know that the Son was never separable from [the Spirit]? What does it mean, then, “If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you?” It means that you cannot receive the Spirit so long as you continue to know Christ after the flesh.

It is as if he said plainly, If I do not withdraw my body from your eyes, I cannot lead you to the understanding of the invisible through the comforting Spirit.

The Holy Spirit the Comforter has brought us this blessing: that the form of the servant, received from the Virgin’s womb, being once removed from the sight of our bodily eyes, we might start to focus the attention of purified minds on the very form of God in which he remained equal to the Father even when he had graciously appeared in the flesh.

But with Christ’s bodily departure, both the Father and the Son, as well as the Holy Spirit, were spiritually present with them. For if Christ had left them so that the Holy Spirit replaced him rather than dwelling along with him, what would have become of his promise, “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world” and, I and the Father “will come to him and will make our dwelling with him”? He had also promised that he would send the Holy Spirit in such a way that he would be with them forever. Jesus knew, however, that though they were presently in a carnal condition, they would undoubtedly possess in a more comprehensive way both the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit. But we should in no way think that the Father is present without the Son and the Holy Spirit or [vice versa].… Wherever any one of them is, there also is the Trinity, one God.
