So "He gave them unto compassions, in the sight of all that had taken them captive" [Psalm 106:46]. That they might not be vessels of wrath, but vessels of mercy. [Romans 9:22-23] The compassions unto which He gave them are named in the plural for this reason, I imagine, because each one has a gift of his own from God, one in one way, another in another.
