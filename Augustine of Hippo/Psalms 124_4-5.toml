..."When their fury was enraged upon us." They are now in anger, they now openly rage: "perchance the water had drowned us" [Psalm 124:4]. By water he means ungodly nations: and we shall see what sort of water in the following verses. Whoever had consented unto them, water would have overwhelmed him. For he would die by the death of the Egyptians, he would not pass through after the example of the Israelites. For you know, brethren, that the people of Israel passed through the water, by which the Egyptians were overwhelmed. [ExodusÂ 14:22-29] But what sort of water is this? It is a torrent, it flows with violence, but it will pass by...Hence He, our Head, first drinks, of whom it is said in the Psalms, "He shall drink of the torrent in the way: therefore shall He lift up His head." For our Head is already exalted, because He drank of the torrent by the way; for our Lord has suffered. If therefore our Head has been already raised up, why does the body fear the torrent? Without doubt, because the Head has been raised, the body also will say hereafter, "Our soul has passed over the torrent. Perhaps our soul has passed over the water without substance" [Psalm 124:5]. Behold, what sort of water he was speaking of, "The water perchance had overwhelmed us." But what means, "without substance"?
