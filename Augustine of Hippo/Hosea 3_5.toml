But let us hear what Hosea goes on to say: “And after this the children of Israel shall return and shall seek the Lord their God and David their king; and they shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the last days.” You will never find a prophecy plainer than this, for the name King David means Christ, who, as Paul says, “was born according to the flesh of the offspring of David.” Further on still, Hosea foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day, but in the mysterious way that is proper to prophecy. He says, “He shall heal us after two days, and on the third day we shall rise up again.” This is the theme underlying the words of Paul: “Therefore if you have risen with Christ, seek the things that are above.”
