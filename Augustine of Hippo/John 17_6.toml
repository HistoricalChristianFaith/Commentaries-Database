If he speaks of the disciples only with whom he had eaten supper, this has nothing to do with that glorifying of which he spoke above and whereby the Son glorified the Father. For what glory is it to be known to twelve or eleven mortal creatures? But if by the men who were given to him out of the world, he means all those who should believe in him afterward and populate his great church, which was to be made up of all nations, this is without doubt the glory whereby the Son glorifies the Father.… “I have made known your name” … is similar to what he had said a little earlier, “I have glorified you on the earth,” where the past is used for the future both there and here.… But what follows shows that he is speaking here of those who were already his disciples, not of all who should afterward believe on him.… At the beginning of his prayer then … our Lord is speaking of all believers, all to whom he should make known the Father, and this is how he would glorify him. For after saying, “that your Son also may glorify you,” he immediately showed how that was to be done by adding, “As you have given him power over all flesh that he should give eternal life to as many as you have given him.”

But what are we to make of the words “whom you have given me out of the world,” for it was said that they were not of the world? But this they were by regeneration, not by generation [i.e., by nature]. And what is meant by “they were yours, and you gave them to me”? Was there a time when they belonged to the Father and not to his only-begotten Son? Did the Father ever have anything without the Son? God forbid. But there was a time when the Son of God possessed something which that same Son as man did not possess. For he has not yet become man when he possessed all things in common with the Father. And so, by saying “they were yours,” the Son of God does not separate himself from the Father but only attributes all his power to him from whom he is and has this power.… In saying, therefore, “and you gave them to me,” he intimated that he had received as man the power to have them, seeing that he who was always omnipotent, was not always man. And so, while he seems rather to have attributed his receiving of them to the Father, since [Christ] is whatever he is because his existence is from [the Father], yet Christ also gave them to himself, that is, Christ, God with the Father, [gave them] to Christ as man who is not with the Father.… Those whom God the Son chose along with the Father out of the world, the very same Son as man received out of the world from the Father. For the Father would not have given them to the Son if he had not chosen them.
