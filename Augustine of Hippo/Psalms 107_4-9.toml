"They wandered in the wilderness, in a dry place, they found not the way of a city to dwell in" [Psalm 107:4]. We have heard a wretched wandering; what of want? "Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them" [Psalm 107:5]. But wherefore did it faint? For what good? For God is not cruel, but He makes Himself known, in that it is expedient for us, that He be entreated by us fainting, and that aiding us He be loved. And therefore after this wandering, and hunger, and thirst, "And they cried unto the Lord in their trouble, and He delivered them out of their distress" [Psalm 107:6]. And what did He for them, as they were wandering? "And He led them in the right way" [Psalm 107:7]. They found not the way of a city to dwell in, with hunger and thirst they were vexed and faint, "and He led them into the right way, that they might go into a city to dwell in." How He helped their hunger and thirst, He says not, but even this expect ye: "Let them confess unto the Lord His mercies, and His wonders towards the children of men" [Psalm 107:8]. Tell them, you that are experienced, to the inexperienced; ye that are already in the way, already directed towards finding the city, already at last free from hunger and thirst. "Because He has satisfied the empty soul, and filled the hungry soul with good things" [Psalm 107:9].
