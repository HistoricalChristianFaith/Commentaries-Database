"O sing unto the Lord a new song; sing unto the Lord, all the earth"  [Psalm 96:1]. If all the earth sings a new song, it is thus building while it sings: the very act of singing is building: but only, if it sings not the old song. The lust of the flesh sings the old song: the love of God sings the new....Hear why it is a new song: the Lord says, "A new commandment I give unto you, that you love one another." [John 15:12] The whole earth then sings a new song: there the house of God is built. All the earth is the house of God. If all the earth is the house of God,  he who clings not to all the earth, is a ruin, not a house; that old ruin whose shadow that ancient temple represented. For there what was old was destroyed, that what was new might be built up....The Apostle binds us together into this very structure, and fastens us when bound together in that unity, saying, "Forbearing one another in love; endeavouring to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace." [Ephesians 4:2-3] Where there is this unity of Spirit, there is one stone; but one stone formed out of many. How one formed out of many? By forbearing one another in love. Therefore the house of the Lord our God is in building; it is this that is being wrought, for this are these words, for this these readings, for this the preaching of the Gospel over the whole world; as yet it is in building. This house has increased greatly, and filled many nations: nevertheless, it has not yet prevailed through all nations: by its increase it has held many, and will prevail over all: and it is gainsaid by those who boast of their being of its household, and who say, it has already lost ground. It still increases, still all those nations which have not yet believed are destined to believe; that no man may say, will that tongue believe? will the barbarians believe? What is the meaning of the Holy Spirit having appeared in the fiery tongues, [Acts 2:3] except that there is no tongue so hard that it cannot be softened by that fire? For we know that many barbarous nations have already believed in Christ: Christ already possesses regions where the Roman empire has never yet reached; what is as yet closed to those who fight with the sword, is not closed to Him who fights with wood. For "the Lord has reigned from the wood."  Who is it who fights with wood? Christ. With His cross He has vanquished kings, and fixed upon their forehead, when vanquished, that very cross; and they glory in it, for in it is their salvation. This is the work which is being wrought, thus the house increases, thus it is building: and that you may know, hear the following verses of the Psalm: see them labouring upon, and constructing the house. "O sing unto the Lord all the earth."

And how many more they have joined, by being given birth to by [the church]? How many members have adhered to the head and are adhering now? And these have been baptized, and others will be baptized, and after us will come others. Then, I say, at the end of the world the stones will attach themselves to the foundation, living stones, holy stones, so that at the end the whole building may be built up out of that church; indeed out of this very church, which is now singing the new song, while the house is being built. That, you see, is what this psalm says, "when the house was being built after the captivity." What does it say? "Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth." What a great house it is! But when does it sing the new song? While it is being built? When is it dedicated? At the end of time? Its foundation has already been dedicated, because he has ascended into heaven and dies no more. When we too have risen again, so as never to die anymore, that is when we too will be dedicated.

As a door leads into a house, so the title of a psalm leads into understanding. Now this one has a heading as follows: "When the house was being built after the captivity." You ask what house; the psalm shows you straightaway: "Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord, all the earth." There you are, that is what house it is. When the whole earth sings a new song, it is the house of God. It is built by singing, its foundations are believing, it is erected by hoping, it is completed by loving. So it is being built now, but it is dedicated at the end of the world. Let the living stones, then, come flocking together to the new song, come flocking all together and be fitted together into the fabric of God's temple. Let them recognize their Savior and receive him as their occupant.

The rebaptizing Donatists should not think they belong to the new song. They cannot sing the new song, seeing that with insufferable impiety they have cut themselves off from the church that God willed to exist in every land. After all, the same prophet says somewhere else, "Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord every land." So anyone who refuses to sing with every land and does not withdraw from the old man, does not sing the new song and does not play on the ten-stringed harp, because he is an enemy of charity, which alone is the fullness of the law and which we say is contained in the ten commandments that pertain to love of God and of neighbor.

The baptized have, then, something to do in themselves, that is, in the temple of God that is first built and dedicated at the end. It is built after the captivity, as the title of the psalm indicates: when the enemy who had taken them captive has been expelled. There is something noteworthy in the order of the psalms. The psalm of the dedication of the house precedes in order of numbering the psalm of the building of the house. The psalm of the dedication comes first, because the psalmist is singing of the house of which its Architect says, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." The later psalm, when the house was being built after the captivity, foretold the church. Moreover, its opening words are "Sing to the Lord a new song, sing to the Lord all the earth." Let no one foolishly think that a baptized person is already perfect, therefore, merely because it has been said, "For holy is the temple of God, and this temple you are," and, "Do you not know that your members are the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God?"
