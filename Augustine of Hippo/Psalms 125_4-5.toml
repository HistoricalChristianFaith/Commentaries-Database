Therefore, the devil and his angels, by turning from the light and warmth of charity and going over to pride and envy, were made numb as by an icy hardness. Therefore they are figuratively located in the north. Thus, while the devil weighed down the human race, the future grace of the Savior was spoken of in the Canticle of Canticles thus: “Arise, O north wind, and come, O south wind, blow through my garden and let the aromatical spices thereof flow.” Arise, you who did rush in, who does weigh on the conquered, who does oppress those whom you own, arise, that those whose souls you have pressed on and bowed down may be relieved of your weight and may lift up their heads. “And come, O south wind,” he says, calling on the spirit of grace, breathing from the south, as from a warm and luminous quarter, “that the aromatical spices may flow.” Hence the apostle says, “We are the good odor of Christ in every place.” Hence, also, it says in another psalm, “Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as a stream in the south”; doubtless, the captivity in which they were held under the devil, as under the north wind, where they were chilled by abounding iniquity, and were, so to speak, frozen. Hence, also, the Gospel says, “And because iniquity has abounded, the charity of many shall grow cold.” But, truly, when the south wind blows, the ice is melted and the streams flow; that is, when their sins are forgiven the people flock to Christ by charity. Hence, also, it is written elsewhere, “And your sins are melted away as the ice in the fair, warm weather.”
