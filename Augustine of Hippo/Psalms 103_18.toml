"And His righteousness upon children's children" [Psalm 103:18]. He speaks of reward, "upon children's children." How many servants of God are there who have not children, how much less children's children? But He calls our works our children; the reward of works, our "children's children." "Even upon such as keep His covenant." Let men beware that all may not conceive what is here said to belong to themselves: let them choose, while they have the choice. "And keep in memory His commandments to do them." You were already disposed to flatter yourself, and perhaps to recite to me the Psalter, which I have not by heart, or from memory to say over the whole Law. Clearly you are better in point of memory than I, better than any righteous man who does not know the Law word for word: but see that thou keep the commandments. But how should you keep them?

Applicable to this difference is what has been written: "And to those who retain his commandments in memory, that they may do them." For many retain them in memory that they may despise them or even deride and attack them. The words of Christ do not abide in those who in a way barely touch him [and] do not take firm hold of him. And therefore [these words] will not be a benefit for those people but a witness [against them]. And because [the words] are in them in such a way that they do not abide in them, for this reason [those people] are bound by them so that they may be judged in accordance with them.
