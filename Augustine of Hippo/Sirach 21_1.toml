We know that repentance over one’s sins renews a person, making him better, but it will result in nothing more if it does not result in works of mercy. Truth testifies the same thing through the mouth of John when against those who were approaching him he said, “Generation of vipers! Who made you to believe that you could escape from the coming wrath? Produce fruit therefore in keeping with repentance, and do not say to yourselves, ‘We are descendants of Abraham,’ because I assure you that God is able to raise up children of Abraham from these stones. The ax is already at the root of the trees, ready to cut; every tree that does not yield good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” This is the fruit about which he had said in the preceding phrase, “Produce fruits in keeping with repentance.” Anyone who does not produce such fruits has no reason to believe that an unfruitful penance will merit the forgiveness of sins. And what these fruits are, the same John indicates, because after he had said these things, “The crowds questioned him, saying, ‘What shall we do?’ ” that is, what are these fruits that he was pressing them to produce. “And he answered, ‘Whoever possesses two cloaks should give one to the person who has none, and he should do the same with his provisions.’ ” It is an unambiguous, clear, explicit answer. So what is the meaning of what he said first, “Every tree that does not yield fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire,” except what those who are on his left are going to hear to whom he says, “Be gone into the eternal fire, for I was hungry and you gave me nothing to eat.” It is not enough therefore just to stop sinning if we neglect repairing the guilt of the past. In fact, Scripture says, “Son, have you sinned? Sin no more.” However, if you think that this alone will make him safe, “and about the past” he quickly adds, “pray that the guilt of your transgressions may be pardoned.” But what good does such praying do for you if you do not become worthy to be heard by not yielding fruits worthy of repentance, so that you are not cut down like a barren tree and thrown into the fire? If you want to be heard when you pray for your sins, “Forgive, and you will be forgiven; give, and it will be given to you.”
