"Then again called they the man that had been blind, and said unto him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner." Give God the praise: Deny what thou hast received. This, in truth, is not to give God the praise, but rather to blaspheme God. "Give God the praise." "We know that this man is a sinner. He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see."

"Then said they to him again, What did he to thee? how opened he thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye hear it again?" See how bold one becomes who is filled with light; see how the blind was not afraid of the Jews his parents fear. To wit, they interrogated him as to what good they might gain from his answers; not, of course, that they might themselves receive sight, but that they might draw him to say something that might furnish them with the means of accusing him, namely Christ, because he made clay and anointed the blind man's eyes.

"Will ye also be his disciples?" What means this "also," save as if he said, Already I am: will ye also be? Contumely to them, health to the man. "They reviled him, and said, Be thou his disciple: we are Moses' disciples. We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not whence he is." "We know that God spake unto Moses." And whence know ye that? Because Moses wrote of Me, as the Lord Himself said; and Moses, did I believe, ye would believe Me also: for Moses wrote of me. Thus, then, the servant was believed, the Lord despised; and yet, in truth, the Lord was believed from whom this same servant was believed.

"The man answered and said unto them, Why, herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know not whence he is, and yet he hath opened mine eyes." I have been enlightened, and with mine eyes I see Him whom with my heart I do not yet see; and He "hath opened mine eyes," and ye know not whence He is! For whose sake, then, if not for yours, hath mine eye been opened? "We know that God heareth not sinners; but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth His will, him He heareth. Since the world began was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind." Such miracles had taken place, but not on the part of any man; only of God, who made the sun. "If this man were not of God, he could do nothing."

"They answered and said unto him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou teach us? And they cast him out." What was their casting him out but driving him from their society? What cared he for that? They who expelled him could make him no consul: they expelled him; Christ received him. In fact, then, brethren, it was their anger to which his blessing was due.
