You see, if there is faith in you, Christ is living in you. You heard the psalm: "I have believed, therefore have I spoken." It was impossible for him both to believe and remain dumb. It is being ungrateful to the one who fills you, if you do not pour out; so the fuller you are, the more you ought to pour out. A fountain, you see, is being born in you of a kind that is able to flow, unable to dry up: "It will become in him a fountain of water leaping up to eternal life." You need have no qualms about preaching, because you are not lying about the fountain of truth; you have received what comes bubbling off your tongue. I mean, if you want to say something of your very own, you will be liars. That is what is said in this very psalm: "I said in my ecstasy, Everyone is a liar." What is "Everyone is a liar?" Every Adam a liar. Strip yourself of Adam, and put on Christ, and you won't be a liar.

So this is what Scripture wished to demonstrate, that every human being, absolutely every single one precisely as human, is a liar. You see, what makes us liars is what we have of our own, and all we have of our very own is the capacity to be liars; not that we cannot be true but that we cannot be true in virtue of what we are in ourselves. Therefore, in order to be true, "I believed, wherefore I also spoke." Deprive him of "I believed"—"everyone is a liar." For when he moves away from the truth of God, he will remain in his lying, because whoever "speaks a lie speaks from what is his own." Say therefore, "What shall I give back to the Lord for everything he has given to me?" After all, "it was in my panic that I said"—and what I said was true—"everyone is a liar." But he gave me back not punishment for lying but good for evil, and by justifying the wicked he made of a liar a speaker of the truth.
