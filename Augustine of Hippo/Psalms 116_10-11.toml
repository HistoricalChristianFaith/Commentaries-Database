We believe that the Lord Jesus Christ was born of a virgin, came in the flesh, suffered, arose, ascended into heaven; we now believe that all of this has been fulfilled, as you hear words of past time. With us in the company of this faith are also those ancestors who believed that he would be born of a virgin, would suffer, would arise, would ascend into heaven. For the apostle pointed to them when he said, “But having the same spirit of faith, as has been written, ‘I have believed and because of this I have spoken,’ we also believe, and because of this we also speak.” The prophet said, “I have believed, and because of this I have spoken.” The apostle says, “We also believe, and because of this we also speak.” But, that you may know that the faith is one, hear him saying, “Having the same spirit of faith, we also believe.”

The same angel comes to Mary, announces to her that Christ is going to be born of her in the flesh, and Mary says something of the same kind. Zachariah, you see, had said, “How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced in years.” And he is told, “Behold, you shall be dumb, and you will not be able to speak until the day when these things are fulfilled, because you have not believed my words.” And he was given the punishment of dumbness, earned by his unbelief. What had the prophet said about John? “The voice of one crying in the desert.” Zachariah is dumb, and he is going to beget the voice. It was because he did not believe that he was made speechless; rightly was he struck dumb, until the voice should be born. After all, if it rightly says, or rather because it certainly does rightly say in the holy psalm “I have believed, therefore have I spoken”; then because Zachariah did not believe, he very properly did not speak.

So it was the same Lord Christ, not only as Word but also as “mediator between God and humanity the man Christ Jesus,” in whom the ancient fathers believed. They also handed on this same faith to us by their proclamation of it and by their prophesying. That is why the apostle says, “Since we have the same spirit of faith, of which it was written: I have believed, therefore have I spoken.” So, “having the same spirit of faith,” he says, of which it was written by the ancients, “I have believed, therefore have I spoken,” “we too believe, therefore we too speak.”

You see, if there is faith in you, Christ is living in you. You heard the psalm: “I have believed, therefore have I spoken.” It was impossible for him both to believe and remain dumb. It is being ungrateful to the one who fills you, if you do not pour out; so the fuller you are, the more you ought to pour out. A fountain, you see, is being born in you of a kind that is able to flow, unable to dry up: “It will become in him a fountain of water leaping up to eternal life.” You need have no qualms about preaching, because you are not lying about the fountain of truth; you have received what comes bubbling off your tongue. I mean, if you want to say something of your very own, you will be liars. That is what is said in this very psalm: “I said in my ecstasy, Everyone is a liar.” What is “Everyone is a liar?” Every Adam a liar. Strip yourself of Adam, and put on Christ, and you won’t be a liar.

So this is what Scripture wished to demonstrate, that every human being, absolutely every single one precisely as human, is a liar. You see, what makes us liars is what we have of our own, and all we have of our very own is the capacity to be liars; not that we cannot be true but that we cannot be true in virtue of what we are in ourselves. Therefore, in order to be true, “I believed, wherefore I also spoke.” Deprive him of “I believed”—“everyone is a liar.” For when he moves away from the truth of God, he will remain in his lying, because whoever “speaks a lie speaks from what is his own.” Say therefore, “What shall I give back to the Lord for everything he has given to me?” After all, “it was in my panic that I said”—and what I said was true—“everyone is a liar.” But he gave me back not punishment for lying but good for evil, and by justifying the wicked he made of a liar a speaker of the truth.

Such an individual, then, guards against lying just as against sinning. Sometimes, in fact, the word lie is used for the word sin; whence the saying “Everyone is a liar.” So it was said as the equivalent of “Everyone is a sinner.” Similarly: “if through my lie the truth of God has abounded.” Thus, when he lies as people do, he sins as people do and will be bound by the judgment that says “Everyone is a liar,” and “if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” But when nothing false proceeds from his mouth, it will be in consequence of that grace about which it has been said, “Whoever is born of God does not commit sin.” For if this birth alone were in us, no one would sin; when it alone will be in us, no one will sin. But we now are still failing, because we are born corruptible, although, if we walk well there where we have been reborn, day by day our inner person is being renewed. When this corruptible body also puts on incorruption, life will absorb all, and no sting of death will remain. But the sting of death is sin.
