"Let Israel now confess that He is good, and that His mercy endures for ever" [Psalm 118:2]. "Let the house of Aaron now confess that His mercy endures for ever" [Psalm 118:3]. "Yea, let all now that fear the Lord confess that His mercy endures for ever" [Psalm 118:4]. You remember, I suppose, most beloved, what is the house of Israel, what is the house of Aaron, and that both are those that fear the Lord. For they are "the little and the great,"  who have already in another Psalm been happily introduced into your hearts: in the number of whom all of us should rejoice that we are joined together, in His grace who is good, and whose mercy endures for ever; since they were listened to who said, "May the Lord increase you more and more, you and your children;"  that the host of the Gentiles might be added to the Israelites who believed in Christ, of the number of whom are the Apostles our fathers, for the exaltation of the perfect and the obedience of the little children; that all of us when made one in Christ, made one flock under one Shepherd, and the body of that Head, like one man, may say, "I called upon the Lord in trouble, and the Lord heard me at large" [Psalm 118:5]. The narrow straits of our tribulation are limited: but the large way whereby we pass along has no end. "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" [RomansÂ 8:33]
