How can the apostle say: “Giving thanks to God the Father, who makes us suitable for a share of the lot of the saints in light, who has snatched us from the power of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved son,” unless the will that liberates us is not ours but his? Letters.

See, then, how it can come to pass that a man may have the baptism of Christ and still not have the faith or the love of Christ; how it is that he may have the sacrament of holiness and still not be reckoned in the lot of the holy. With regard to the mere sacrament itself, it makes no difference whether someone receives the baptism of Christ where the unity of Christ is not.

The lament in the Psalms, indeed, is absolutely true: “Behold in iniquity was I conceived, and in sins did my mother nourish me in her womb.” Again, there is what is written, that there is none clean in God’s sight, not even an infant whose life has lasted but a day on the earth. So these are the exception, and it is to exceed our limited human measure to wish to inquire about the rank they may deserve in that “lot of the saints in light” which is promised for the future.
