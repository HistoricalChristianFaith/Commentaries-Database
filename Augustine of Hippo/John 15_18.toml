But look here, the one that persecutes is called the world. Let us find out whether the one that suffers persecution is also called the world. Or are you completely deaf to the voice of Christ saying—or rather of holy Scripture testifying, “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself”? “If the world hates you,” he said, “know that it first hated me.” There you are, the world hates.… Which world? “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.” The world condemned persecutes; the world reconciled suffers persecution. The world condemned includes whatever is outside and apart from the church; the world reconciled is the church. “For the Son of man,” he says, “did not come to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him.”
