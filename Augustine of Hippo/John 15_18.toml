But look here, the one that persecutes is called the world. Let us find out whether the one that suffers persecution is also called the world. Or are you completely deaf to the voice of Christ saying—or rather of holy Scripture testifying, "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself"? "If the world hates you," he said, "know that it first hated me." There you are, the world hates.… Which world? "God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself." The world condemned persecutes; the world reconciled suffers persecution. The world condemned includes whatever is outside and apart from the church; the world reconciled is the church. "For the Son of man," he says, "did not come to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him."

But alongside of this love we ought also patiently to endure the hatred of the world. For it must of necessity hate those whom it perceives recoiling from that which is loved by itself. But the Lord supplies us with special consolation from His own case, when, after saying, "These things I command you, that ye love one another," He added, "If the world hate you, know that it hated me before [it hated] you." Why then should the member exalt itself above the head? Thou refusest to be in the body if thou art unwilling to endure the hatred of the world along with the Head. "If ye were of the world," He says, "the world would love its own." He says this, of course, of the whole Church, which, by itself, He frequently also calls by the name of the world: as when it is said, "God was in Christ, reconciling the world unto Himself." And this also: "The Son of man came not to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved." And John says in his epistle: "We have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous: and He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but also [for those] of the whole world." The whole world then is the Church, and yet the whole world hateth the Church. The world therefore hateth the world, the hostile that which is reconciled, the condemned that which is saved, the polluted that which is cleansed.
