On account of this law the younger suffered persecution from the elder, so that the younger says what follows: "Trouble and hardship have taken hold upon me: yet is my meditation in Your commandments" [Psalm 119:143]. Let them rage, let them persecute; as long as the commandments of God be not abandoned, and, after those commandments, let even those who rage be loved.
