Let us try to find out who is the opponent with whom we should agree, fearing that he might deliver us to the judge, and the judge deliver us to the officer. Let us try to find him and be in agreement with him. If you are committing a sin, your adversary is the word of God. For instance, perhaps you may like to get drunk. It says to you, “Do not do that.” You may like to frequent the circus and indulge in frivolities. It says to you, “Do not do that.” You may like to commit adultery. The word of God says to you, “Do not do it.” In whatever sins you wish to follow your own will, it says to you, “Do not do that.” It is the enemy of your will until it becomes the assurance of your salvation. Oh, what an honest and helpful enemy!
