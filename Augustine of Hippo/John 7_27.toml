This notion did not arise without foundation. We find indeed that the Scriptures said of Christ, “He shall be called a Nazarene” and thus predicted where he would come from.… And the Jews again told Herod, when he inquired, that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judah and adduced the testimony of the prophet. … How then did this notion of the Jews arise, that, when Christ came, no one would know where he came from? It arose from this reason, that is, that the Scriptures asserted both. As man, they foretold where Christ would come from. As God, he was hidden from the profane but revealed himself to the godly.… This notion they had taken from Isaiah, “Who shall declare his generation?”
