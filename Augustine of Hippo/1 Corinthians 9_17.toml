Up to now I am so far restored in that glory that I confess I am ignorant not only how near I come to it but even whether I shall come to it at all. It is true I am a dispenser of eternal salvation along with my other innumerable fellow servants. “For if I do this thing willingly, I have a reward.” To be a dispenser of that salvation by word and sacrament is not at all the same as to be a partaker of it. Letter , To Audax.
