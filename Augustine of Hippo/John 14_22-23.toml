Judas the holy, not the impure, the follower, not the persecutor of our Lord, asks why Jesus will make himself known to his own but not to the world.… Jesus answers that is because the one loves him and the other does not.… The saints are distinguished from the world by that love that moves those who are of one mind to dwell together in a house. In this house Father and Son make their home and impart that very love to those whom they shall also honor at last with this promised self-manifestation that the disciple asked his master about.

God is not too grand to come, he is not too fussy or shy, he is not too proud—on the contrary he is pleased to come if you do not displease him. Listen to the promise he makes. Listen to him indeed promising with pleasure, not threatening in displeasure, “We shall come to him,” he says, “I and the Father.” To the one he had earlier called his friend, the one who obeys his precepts, the keeper of his commandment, the lover of God, the lover of his neighbor, he says, “We shall come to him and make our abode with him.”
