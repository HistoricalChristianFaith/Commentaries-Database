Now this man was a Gentile—he was, after all, a centurion. The Jewish nation already had troops of the Roman Empire among them. This man was in command of troops there, to the extent that a centurion could be in command. He was under authority, and he had authority. As a subordinate, he was obedient; as having subordinates, commanding.… Even if the Lord did not enter bodily into this man’s house, yet he was already so present in majesty that he healed his faith and his servant. Yet the same Lord had appeared in bodily presence among his own covenant people. He was not born in some other country. He did not suffer or walk or endure his human sufferings or do wonders in some other nation. None of all this took place in other nations. Yet through the centurion the prophecy was fulfilled that was spoken of him: “A people whom I have not known has served me.” And how did the centurion know him? By “obeying me with the hearing of the ear.”
