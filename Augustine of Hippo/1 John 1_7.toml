Let us not say that we have fellowship with Him, if we walk in darkness. If we walk in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship one with another. 1 John 1:7 Let us walk in the light, as He is in the light, that we may be able to have fellowship with Him. And what are we to do about our sins? Hear what follows, And the blood of Jesus Christ His Son shall purge us from all sin. Great assurance has God given! Well may we celebrate the Passover, wherein was shed the blood of the Lord, by which we are cleansed from all sin! Let us be assured: the handwriting which was against us, Colossians 2:14 the bond of our slavery, the devil held, but by the blood of Christ it is blotted out. The blood, says he, of His Son shall purge us from all sin. What means, from all sin? Mark: lo even now, in the name of Christ whom these here have now confessed, who are called infants, have all their sins been cleansed. They came in old, they went out new. How, came in old, went out new? Old men they came in, infants they went out. For the old life is old age with all its dotage, but the new life is the infancy of regeneration. But what are we to do? The past sins are pardoned, not only to these but to us; and after the pardon and abolition of all sins, by living in this world in the midst of temptations, some haply have been contracted. Therefore what he can, let man do; let him confess himself to be what he is, that he may be cured by Him who always is what He is: for He always was and is; we were not and are.
