What then? If "confession and beauty are before Him: holiness and greatness in His sanctification" [Psalm 96:7]. This we declare, when we are building the house; behold, it is already declared unto the heathen; what ought the heathen to do, to whom those who have cleared away the wood have declared the Lord's honour? He now says to the heathen themselves, "Ascribe unto the Lord, O you kindreds of the people: ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour." Ascribe them not unto yourselves: because they also who have declared it unto you, have not declared their own, but His honour. Do ye then "ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour;" and say, "Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us: but unto Your Name give the praise."  Put not your trust in man. If each of you is baptized, let him say: He baptizes me, of whom the friend of the Bridegroom said, "He baptizes with the Holy Ghost."  For when you say this, you ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour: "Ascribe unto the Lord worship and honour."
