But the Lord wishes God the Father to be understood when he says, “I speak that which I have seen with my Father.” I have seen the truth; I speak the truth because I am the truth. For if the Lord speaks the truth that he has seen with the Father, he has seen himself—he speaks himself because he himself is the truth of the Father, which he saw with the Father. For he is the Word—the Word that was with God.

As of this moment, he has not yet named their father. A little above he referred to Abraham, but this referred to their lineage, not to their similarity of life. He is about to speak of that other father of theirs who neither begat them nor created them to be people. But they were still that father’s children in as far as they were evil, not in as far as they were people. In other words, they were his children because of how they imitated him, not because they were created by him.
