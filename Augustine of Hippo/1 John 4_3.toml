"And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God: and this is the antichrist, of whom ye have heard that he should come; and even now already is he in this world." Therefore he saith in the Gospel: "Whoso shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven." What is this breaking? What this teaching? A breaking in the deeds and a teaching as it were in words. "Thou that preachest men should not steal, dost thou steal?" Therefore he that steals breaks or undoes the commandment in his deed, and as it were teaches so: "he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven," i.e. in the Church of this present time. Of him it is said, "What they say do ye; but what they do, that do not ye."

"But he that shall do, and shall teach so, shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven." From this, that He has here said, fecerit, "shall do," while in opposition to this He has there said solverit, meaning non fecerit, "shall not do, and shall teach so" - to break, then, is, not to do - what doth He teach us, but that we should interrogate men's deeds, not take their words upon trust?
