You do not know when that last hour is going to come and yet you say, “I am reforming.” When are you going to reform? When are you going to change? “Tomorrow,” you say. Behold, how often you say, “Tomorrow, tomorrow.” You have really become a crow. Behold, I say to you that when you make the noise of a crow, ruin is threatening you. For that crow whose cawing you imitate went forth from the ark and did not return.
