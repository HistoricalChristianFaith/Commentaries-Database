"If camps stand together against me, my heart will not fear." But if the multitude of gain-sayers conspire to stand together against me, my heart will not fear, so as to go over to their side. "If war rise up against me, in this will I trust" [Psalm 27:3]. If the persecution of this world arise against me, in this petition, which I am pondering, will I place my hope.
