"The heavens are yours, the earth also is Yours" [Psalm 89:11]. From You, over Your earth they rain. Yours are the heavens, by whom is preached Your truth in circuit of You; "Yours is the earth," which has received Your truth in circuit of You; and what has resulted from that rain? "You have laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is." "You have created the north and the seas" [Psalm 89:12]. For nothing has any power against You, against its Creator. The world indeed may rage through its own malice, and the perversity of its will; does it nevertheless pass over the bound laid down by the Creator, who made all things? Why then do I fear the north wind? Why do I fear the seas? In the north indeed is the devil, who said, "I will sit in the sides of the north; I will be like the Most High;" [Isaiah 14:13-14] but You have humbled, as one wounded, the proud one. Thus what You have done in them has more force for Your dominion, than their own will has for their wickedness. "You have created the north and the seas."
