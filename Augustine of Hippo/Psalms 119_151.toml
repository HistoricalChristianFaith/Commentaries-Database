Lastly, it follows, "You are near at hand, O Lord, and all Your ways are truth" [Psalm 119:151]. Even in their troubles, it has been a wonted confession of the saints, to ascribe truth unto God, because they suffer them not undeservedly. So did Queen Esther, [Esther 14:6-7] so did holy Daniel, [Daniel 9:4, 16] so did the three men in the furnace,  so do other associates in their sanctity confess. But it may be asked, in what sense it is here said, "All Your ways are truth;" since in another Psalm it is read, "All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth."  But towards the saints, All the ways of the Lord are at once mercy and truth: since He aids them even in judgment, and thus mercy is not wanting; and in having mercy upon them, He performs that which He has promised, so that truth is not wanting. But towards all, both those whom He frees, and those whom He condemns, all the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth; because where He does not show mercy, the truth of His vengeance is displayed. For He frees many who have not deserved, but He condemns none who has not deserved it.
