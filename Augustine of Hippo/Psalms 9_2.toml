"I will be glad and exult in You" [Psalm 9:2]. Not any more in this world, not in pleasure of bodily dalliance, not in relish of palate and tongue, not in sweetness of perfumes, not in joyousness of passing sounds, not in the variously coloured forms of figure, not in vanities of men's praise, not in wedlock and perishable offspring, not in superfluity of temporal wealth, not in this world's getting, whether it extend over place and space, or be prolonged in time's succession: but, "I will be glad and exult in You," namely, in the hidden things of the Son, where "the light of Your countenance has been stamped on us, O Lord:"  for, "You will hide them," says he, "in the hiding place of Your countenance."  He then will be glad and exult in You, who tells all Your marvels. And He will tell all Your marvels (since it is now spoken of prophetically), "who came not to do His own will, but the will of Him who sent Him." [JohnÂ 6:38]
