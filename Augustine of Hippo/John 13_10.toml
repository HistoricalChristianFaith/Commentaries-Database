(Tr. lvi. 4) Clean all except the feet. The whole of a man is washed in baptism, not excepting his feet; but living in the world afterwards, we tread upon the earth. Those human affections then, without which we cannot live in this world, are, as it were, our feet, which connect us with human things, so that if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves. (1 John 1:8) But if we confess our sins, He who washed the disciples' feet, forgives us our sins even down to our feet, wherewith we hold our converse with earth.

(Ad. Seleuc. Ep. c. viii.) From what is here said, we understand that Peter was already baptized. Indeed that He baptized by His disciples, shows that His disciples must have been baptized, either with John's baptism, or, which is more probable, Christ's. He baptized by means of baptized servants; for He did not refuse the ministry of baptizing, Who had the humility to wash feet.

(Tr. lvi. 4) Or, the disciples when washed had only to have their feet washed; because while man lives in this world, he contracts himself with earth, by means of his human affections, which are as it were his feet.

"He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit." It may seem perhaps to certain ones that the Lord really intended to say that what needed washing was only the feet; that as those were clean who already had been washed, their hands and head had no need to be washed, and only their feet, wherewith they trod on the ground. But if we accept this explanation, Peter ought to have received Him; for those who are baptized with Christian baptism, are understood to be washed every whit, their hands and head included; and yet, without doubt, they ought afterwards to have their feet washed. But while it is by no means unfitting for such a meaning as this to be given to it by us, the deeper one, which I think ought principally to be attended to, is this: that the Lord said, "He that is washed needeth not save to wash his feet," because a man has, of course, his feet washed in baptism as part of his whole body; but afterwards, as man must needs live in this world, he treads on the ground with his human affections, so that it may be said that his feet are defiled thereby; and thus it is, that in the Lord's prayer we say, "Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors." For the sins that are remitted to us in baptism, if we have committed any, no longer hurt us in any way; and yet, because they were before remitted, we ought still to pray in the same way, and to say, "Forgive us our debts." For a man, though baptized, in living this mortal life, passes not his time without sin. Hence, though regeneration has already cleansed the whole of man, yet as man must needs live in this world, he treads on the ground with his human affections, so that his feet become defiled.

Therefore, what ought we to understand, brethren, but that in holy baptism a man has all of him washed, not all save his feet, but every whit? and yet, while thereafter living in this human state, he treads on the ground. And thus our human feelings themselves, without which we cannot live in this mortal state, are, as it were, our feet, wherewith we are brought into sensible contact with human affairs; and are so in such a way, that if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. And every day, therefore, is He who intercedeth for us, washing our feet: and that we, too, have daily need to be washing our feet, that is, ordering aright the path of our spiritual footsteps, we acknowledge even in the Lord's prayer, when we say, "Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors."
