We heard the apostle telling us, “We are ambassadors for Christ, exhorting you to be reconciled with God.” He would not be exhorting us to be reconciled unless we had been enemies. So the whole world was the Savior’s enemy, the captor’s friend; that is, God’s enemy, the devil’s friend. And the whole human race, like this woman, was bent over and bowed down to the ground. There is someone who already understands these enemies, and he cries out against them and says to God, “They have bowed my soul down.” The devil and his angels have bowed the souls of men and women down to the ground; that is, have bent them forward to be intent on temporal and earthly things and stop them from seeking the things that are above.
