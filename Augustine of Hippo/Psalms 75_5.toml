If you say that, you will not be singing to no purpose, “I said, Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.” If God is blamed for the evil that you do and you take credit for the good, then you are speaking wickedly against God. Listen to what the psalm has to say on this point: “Do not lift your horn on high or speak wickedly against God.” The iniquity you were speaking against God is this, that you were wishing to attribute everything good to yourself and everything bad to him. By lifting up the horn of pride, you were speaking wickedly against God. With humility you speak justly. And what is the equity you speak with humility? “I said, Lord, have mercy on me; heal my soul, for I have sinned against you.”
