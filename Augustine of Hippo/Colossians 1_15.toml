For according to the form of God he is “the beginning who also speaks to us,” in which beginning God “made the heavens and the earth,” but according to the form of a slave he is “the bridegroom coming out of his chamber.” According to the form of God he is “the firstborn of every creature, and he himself is before all creatures, and in him all things hold together,” and according to the form of a slave he is “the head of the body, the church.” .

In parents and children there would be found an image and an equality and a likeness if the age difference were lacking. For the child’s likeness has been derived from the parent, so that the likeness may rightly be called an image…. In God, however, the conditions of time do not obtain, for God cannot be thought of as having begotten in time the Son through whom he has created the times. Hence it follows that not only is [the Son] his image, because he is from [God], and the likeness, because the image, but also the equality is so great that there is not even a temporal distinction standing in the way between them.
