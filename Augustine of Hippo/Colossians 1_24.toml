And when as a preacher of Christ he was now suffering from others what he had done himself as a persecutor, “that I may fill up,” he said, “in my flesh what is lacking from the afflictions of Christ”; thus showing that what he was suffering was part and parcel of the afflictions of Christ. That can’t be understood of the head, which now in heaven is not suffering any such thing; but of the body, that is, the church; the body, which with its head is the one Christ.

In regard to this is that which in another place the very same apostle says: “I now rejoice in sufferings for you, and I fill up those things which are wanting of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh.” He did not say “of the afflictions of me” but “of Christ,” because he was a member of Christ and in his persecutions, such as it was necessary for Christ to suffer in his whole body, even Paul was filling up Christ’s afflictions in Paul’s own portion. .
