Therefore it is not true that sometimes we ought to lie. What is not true we should never try to persuade anyone to believe.

"I write unto you not because ye know not the truth, but because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth." Behold, we are admonished how we may know antichrist. What is Christ? Truth. Himself hath said "I am the Truth." But "no lie is of the truth." Consequently, all who lie are not yet of Christ. He hath not said that some lie is of the truth, and some lie not of the truth. Mark the sentence. Do not fondle yourselves, do not flatter yourselves, do not deceive yourselves, do not cheat yourselves: "No lie is of the truth."
