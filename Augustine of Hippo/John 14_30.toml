Why be surprised that Christ died, although Christ committed no sin whatever? He wanted to pay back for you what he did not owe himself, in order to deliver you from debt. The devil, having taken in the human race, was in possession of it by right. He possessed what he had taken; he had taken what he had taken in. Christ brought along in his mortal flesh his blood to be shed, with which to cancel the bill of our sins. That other one would still be holding the guilty if he had not put the innocent to death. But now see with what justice he is told, “You have put to death one who had no debt. Now hand over the debtors.” “Behold,” he says, “the prince of this world is coming, and in me he will find nothing.” “How nothing? Haven’t you got a soul, haven’t you got flesh? Aren’t you also the Word? Is all that nothing?”Of course not. Nothing of his own, because [I have] no sin. He is the prince of sinners. The prince of sinners will find nothing in me. I have not sinned, I have contracted nothing from Adam, because I came to you from the Virgin. I did not add anything, because I did not have anything to add it to, and by living a just life I committed no sin. Let him come and find something of his own in me, if he can. But he will find nothing of his own in me. I have no sin. Born innocently, I have led an innocent life. Let him come, he will find nothing. “So why are you dying, if he is coming and will find nothing?” And he gives the reason why he must die: “Behold, the prince of this world is coming, and he will find nothing in me.” And if we might hypothetically ask, “So then, why are you dying?” he would answer, “So that all might know that I am doing the will of my Father. Arise, let us go from here”;55 That is, let us go to [my] passion. He was willing to die because if was the will of his good Father, not because he owed it to the evil prince.
