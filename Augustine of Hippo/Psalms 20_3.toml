"Be mindful of all Your sacrifice" [Psalm 20:3]. Make us mindful of all Your injuries and despiteful treatment, which You have borne for us. "And be Your whole burnt offering made fat." And turn the cross, whereon You were wholly offered up to God, into the joy of the resurrection.

4. "Be mindful of all Thy sacrifice" (ver. 3). Make us mindful of all Thy injuries and despiteful treatment, which Thou hast borne for us. "And be Thy whole burnt offering made fat." And turn the cross, whereon Thou wast wholly offered up to God, into the joy of the resurrection.
