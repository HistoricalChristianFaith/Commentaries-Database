“But why,” they ask, “does a baptized believer, whose sin has already been forgiven, beget a child who is still burdened with the first person’s sin?” Because he begets him from the flesh, not from the spirit. “What is born of the flesh is flesh.” “And if the outer self,” says the apostle, “is decaying, yet the inner self is being renewed from day to day.” It is not from what is being renewed in you that you beget a child. You beget a child from what is decaying in you. You, in order not to die forever, were born and reborn. This child is already born, not yet reborn. If you are alive as a result of being reborn, allow it too to be reborn and live.… Why oppose this? Why try to smash the ancient rule of faith with new objections? After all, what is this that you are saying: “Little children don’t have even original sin in the least degree”? What does this that you say amount to, but that they should not come to Jesus? But Jesus cries out to you, “Let the little children come to me.”
