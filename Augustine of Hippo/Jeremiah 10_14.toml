Because they can be called gods, though they cannot be so, for a time they are even called so. What does the prophet say, or what warning does he give them? The prophet is told to say this to them: “The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from those that are under the heavens.” He is not such a god, for our God is above all gods. Above all what gods? “For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.” - "Expositions of the Psalms 48.14"

He said, “The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven.” He did not say, “The gods that have not made the heaven and from the earth,” because they never were in heaven. What did he say? He said, “Let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven,” as if, while the word earth was repeated, “heaven” did not need to be (because they never were in heaven). He repeats “earth” twice, since it is under heaven. “Let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven,” from their temples. Consider whether this is not now taking place, whether in a great measure it has not already happened. For what, or how much, has remained? The idols remained rather in the hearts of the pagans than in the niches of the temples. - "Expositions of the Psalms 99.2"
