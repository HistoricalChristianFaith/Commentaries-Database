Because they can be called gods, though they cannot be so, for a time they are even called so. What does the prophet say, or what warning does he give them? The prophet is told to say this to them: “The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they shall perish from the earth, and from those that are under the heavens.” He is not such a god, for our God is above all gods. Above all what gods? “For all the gods of the nations are idols, but the Lord made the heavens.” - "Expositions of the Psalms 48.14"

In reading what is said in this psalm of Christ and of the church, one would find that what is there foretold is fulfilled in the present state of the world. He would see the idols of the nations perishing from off the earth, and he would find that this is predicted by the prophets, as in Jeremiah: “Then shall you say to them, ‘The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth shall perish from the earth, and from under heaven,’ ” and again, “O Lord, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to you from the ends of the earth and shall say, ‘Surely our ancestors have inherited lies, vanity and things in which there is no profit. Shall a person make gods for himself, and they are not gods?’ Therefore, behold, I will at that time cause them to know, I will cause them to know my hand and my might, and they shall know that I am the Lord.” Hearing these prophecies and seeing their fulfillment, I need not say that he would be affected. We know from experience how the hearts of believers are confirmed by seeing ancient predictions now being fulfilled. - "Reply to Faustus the Manichaean 13.7"

He said, “The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven.” He did not say, “The gods that have not made the heaven and from the earth,” because they never were in heaven. What did he say? He said, “Let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven,” as if, while the word earth was repeated, “heaven” did not need to be (because they never were in heaven). He repeats “earth” twice, since it is under heaven. “Let them perish from the earth and from under the heaven,” from their temples. Consider whether this is not now taking place, whether in a great measure it has not already happened. For what, or how much, has remained? The idols remained rather in the hearts of the pagans than in the niches of the temples. - "Expositions of the Psalms 99.2"
