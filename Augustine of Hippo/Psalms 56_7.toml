"For nothing You shall save them" [Psalm 56:7]. He has taught us even for these very men to pray. However "they shall sojourn and hide," however deceitful they be, however dissemblers and liers in wait they be; do thou pray for them, and do not say, Shall God amend even such a man, so evil, so perverse? Do not despair: give heed to Him whom you ask, not him for whom you ask. The greatness of the disease do you see, the might of the Physician do you not see? "They shall sojourn and hide: as my soul has undergone." Undergo, pray: and there is done what? "For nothing You shall save them." You shall make them safe so as that nothing to You it may be, that is, so that no labour to You it may be. With men they are despaired of, but Thou with a word dost heal; You will not toil in healing, though we are astounded in looking on. There is another sense in this verse, "For nothing You shall save them:" with not any merits of their going before You shall save them....They shall not bring to You he-goats, rams, bulls, not gifts and spices shall they bring You in Your temple, not anything of the drink-offering of a good conscience do they pour thereon; all in them is rough, all foul, all to be detested: and though they to You bring nothing whereby they may be saved; "For nothing You shall save them," that is, with the free gift of Your Grace....

You see, “he was handed over on account of our sins, and rose again on account of our justification.” Your justification, your circumcision, does not come from you. “It is by grace that you have been saved through faith; and this not from yourselves, but it is God’s gift; not from works.” In case by any chance you should say, “I deserved it, that is why I received it.” Do not think you received it by deserving it, because you would not deserve it unless you had received it. Grace came before your deserving or merit; it is not grace coming from merit but merit from grace. Because if grace comes from merit, it means you have bought it, not received it free, gratis, for nothing. “For nothing,” it says, “you will save them.” What is the meaning of “for nothing you will save them”? You can find no reason in them to save them, and yet you save them. You give for nothing, you save for nothing. You precede all merits, so that my merits follow your gifts. Of course, you give for nothing, save for nothing, since you can find no reason for saving and many reasons for condemning.
