As holy David repented for his deadly crimes and still retained his kingship, so the blessed Peter earnestly repented, having denied the Lord, and shed such bitter tears, yet remained an apostle. Letter , To Boniface.

We must understand by this, that the Lord suffered these things till morning, in the house of the High Priest, whither He had first been brought. Matthew and Mark, on the other hand, first notice the injuries done to Christ, then the temptation of Peter. Concerning which it is said, “And as Peter was beneath in the palace, there cometh one of the maids of the High Priest.”.
: This maid is not the same, but another, as Matthew says. Indeed, we must also understand, that in this second denial he was addressed by two persons, that is, by the maid whom Matthew and Mark mention, and by another person, of whom Luke takes notice. It goes on: “And he denied it again.”
