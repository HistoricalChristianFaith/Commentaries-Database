What order does God impose on you? "Love me. You love gold, you will seek gold, and perhaps you will not find it. Whoever seeks me, I am with him. You will love honor, and perhaps you will not find it. Whoever seeks me, I am with him. Who has loved me and has not attained me?" God says to you, "You wish to make [someone] a patron or a powerful friend of yours; you solicit him through someone else inferior. Love me," God says to you, "there is no soliciting of me through anyone; love itself makes me present to you." What is sweeter than this love, brothers? Not without reason you just heard in the psalm, "The unjust have told me of delights, but not as your law, Lord." What is the law of God? The commandment of God. What is the commandment of God? That new commandment that is called new for the very reason that it renews: "A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another." Hear that this is the law of God. The apostle says, "Bear one another's burdens, and so you will fulfill the law of Christ." This is the consummation of all our works, love. There is the end. Because of this we are running; to this we are running. When we come to it, we shall rest.
