“For, I know where I come from and where I am going.” This has reference to the Father; for the Son, who is himself equal [to the Father], gave glory to him by whom he was sent. How greatly then should one glorify the Creator who made him!… He did not separate from his Father, however, when he came, or desert us when he returned—unlike that sun which in going to the west leaves the east.

A burning lamp is indeed capable at the same time of exposing to view other things that the darkness covered and of showing itself to your eyes. So also the Lord Christ distinguished between his faithful ones and his enemies, as between light and darkness: as between those whom he illuminated with the ray of faith and those on whose closed eyes he shed his light. So, too, the sun shines on the face of the sighted and of the blind. Both alike, while standing and facing the sun, have the sun shine on them, but both are not enlightened in the eyesight. The one sees; the other does not. The sun is present to both, but one of them is absent from the present sun. So likewise the Wisdom of God, the Word of God, the Lord Jesus Christ, is everywhere present because truth is everywhere, wisdom is everywhere … Therefore the light bears witness to itself. It opens the healthy eyes and is its own witness so that it may be known as the light.… It is also present [to unbelievers], but they do not have the eyes of the heart with which to see it.
