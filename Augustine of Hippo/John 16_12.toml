So that is how we must take what the Lord says to the disciples, when he says, “Everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you.” If this had already happened, why does he tell them somewhere else, “I have still many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now”? Certainly, everything I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. But when he says, “You cannot bear them now,” and says, “I still have to say to you,” he is putting things off, not cutting them off altogether. So because of the certainty of his hope, by which he knew without a doubt that he would do this, it was in his reckoning already as good as done. And that is why he could say, “I have made known to you.”
