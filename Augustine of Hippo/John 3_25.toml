John baptized, Christ baptized. John’s disciples were moved; there was a running after Christ, people were coming to John. Those who came to John, he sent to Jesus to be baptized. But those who were baptized by Christ were not sent to John. John’s disciples were alarmed and began to dispute with the Jews, as usually happens. The Jews then asserted Christ to be the greater person and his baptism necessary to be received. But John’s disciples did not yet understand as much and defended John’s baptism. At last they come to John to solve the question.…“And they came to John and said to him, ‘Rabbi, he that was with you beyond the Jordan, behold, the same baptizes.’ ” … In other words, “What do you say? Shouldn’t they be stopped so that the people come to you instead?”
