The Christ, who died for us, descended into the realms of death, not of necessity but by power, and loosed the pains of hell. In this way it must be understood that Wisdom released Adam from his crime. Not without reason does the church believe that he was released from those bonds by the holy flesh of the only Son of God—of whom Adam was the progenitor, being the father of the human race and thus also the father of the Christ, who was made man for the salvation of human beings—not by his own merit but by the grace of God in Jesus Christ our Lord.

It must be understood that, according to the book of Wisdom, Adam was released from his crime. That book does not say this as an accomplished fact, but predicted it as future, though using the past tense. It says, “He freed him from his fall,” just as it was said, “They have pierced my hands,” and all the other events that are said there of the future using the verbal form of the past tense.
