"Then You shall accept the sacrifice of righteousness" [Psalm 51:19]. But now sacrifice for iniquity, to wit, a spirit troubled, and a heart humbled; then the sacrifice of righteousness, praises alone. For, "Blessed they that dwell in Your house, for ever and ever they shall praise You:"  for this is the sacrifice of righteousness. "Oblations and holocausts." What are "holocausts"? A whole victim by fire consumed. When a whole beast was laid upon the altar with fire to be consumed, it was called a holocaust. May divine fire take us up whole, and that fervour catch us whole. What fervour? "Neither is there that hides himself from the heat thereof."  What fervour? That whereof speaks the Apostle: "In spirit fervent." [Romans 12:11] Be not merely our soul taken up by that divine fire of wisdom, but also our body; that  it may earn their immortality; so be it lifted up for a holocaust, that death be swallowed into victory. "Oblations and holocausts." "Then shall they lay upon your altar calves." Whence "calves"? What shall He therein choose? Will it be the innocence of the new age, or necks freed from the yoke of the law?...
