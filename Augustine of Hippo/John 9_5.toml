What is that night in which, when it comes, no one shall be able to work? Hear what the day is, and then you will understand what the night is. But how shall we hear what the day is? Let he himself tell us: “As long as I am in this world, I am the light of the world.” See, he himself is the day.… The natural day is completed by the circuit of the sun and contains only a few hours. The day of Christ’s presence will last to the end of the world, for he himself has said, “Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.”
