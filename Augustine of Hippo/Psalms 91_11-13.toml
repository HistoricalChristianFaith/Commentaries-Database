Well, the Donatists are not false Christians. They are quite simply not Christians at all, since they listen to what the devil suggested and do not listen to the answer Christ gave him. How, after all, did the Lord, our teacher and savior, answer the devil’s suggestion of such things? “Get back, Satan, for it is written: You shall not tempt the Lord your God.” The devil, as a matter of fact, had taken his suggestion from Scripture, and the Lord replied from Scripture. The devil had said to the Lord, you see, “Since it is written, He will instruct his angels about you; they will lift you up in their hands, lest you should hurt your foot on a stone.” “Hurl yourself down,” he said, “and if you are the Son of God, the angels are there to catch you; what are you afraid of?” The Lord could indeed both have cast down his body and not allowed it to die; but what the devil was suggesting to Christ at that time is the sort of thing Christ was not teaching future Christians. This, you see, is exactly what the devil is also suggesting to the Donatists, saying, “Hurl yourselves down, the angels are there to catch you. With such a death you do not go to punishment, but you win through to a crown.” They would be Christians if they give an ear to Christ and did not trust the devil, who first separated them from the peace of the church and later on gave them cliff-jumpers.

But what is said to Christ? “And you shall trample down the lion and the serpent.” The lion because of his open danger, the serpent because of his concealed deception. The serpent drove Adam out of paradise; the very same one, as a lion, persecuted the church, as Peter says: “Your adversary the devil goes about as a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.” Let the devil not appear to you to have lost his rage; when he flatters, he must be feared the more.
