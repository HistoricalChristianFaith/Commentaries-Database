There follows the seventh commandment: “You shall not steal,” and the seventh plague: hail on the crops. What you steal from the commandment, you lose from your account in heaven. No one makes an unjust gain without suffering a just loss. For example, someone steals and acquires a suit, but by the judgment of heaven he forfeits trust. Where there is gain, there is loss; visible gain, invisible loss; gain from his own blindness, loss from the Lord’s cloud. You see, dearly beloved, there is nothing that escapes providence. Or do you really think that what people suffer, they suffer while God is asleep? We see these things happening all the time and all around; clouds gather, rain comes down in buckets, hail is hurled down, the earth shaken by thunder, scared out of its wits by lightning. Everywhere these things are thought to happen as though they had nothing to do with divine providence. Against such ideas that psalm is on its guard: “Praise the Lord from the earth”—his praises had already been told from the heavens—“dragons and all deeps, fire, hail, snow, ice, stormy winds, which all carry out his word.” So those who for their own evil desire steal outwardly are hailed on inwardly by the judgment of God.

For you [God] evil does not exist, and not only for you but for the whole of your creation as well, because there is nothing outside it that could invade it and break down the order that you have imposed on it. Yet in the separate parts of your creation there are some things that we think of as evil because they are at variance with other things. But there are other things again with which they are in accord, and then they are good. In themselves, too, they are good. And all these things that are at variance with one another are in accord with the lower part of creation that we call the earth. The sky, which is cloudy and windy, suits the earth to which it belongs. So it would be wrong for me to wish that these earthly things did not exist, for even if I saw nothing but them, I might wish for something better, but still I ought to praise you for them alone. For all things “give praise to the Lord on earth, monsters of the sea and all its depths; fire and hail, snow and mist, and the storm-wind that executes his decree; all you mountains and hills, all you fruit trees and cedars; all you wild beasts and cattle, creeping things and birds that fly in air; all you kings and peoples of the world, all you that are princes and judges on earth; young men and maids, old men and boys together; let them all give praise to the Lord’s name.” The heavens, too, ring with your praises, O God, for you are the God of us all. “Give praise to the Lord in heaven; praise him, all that dwells on high. Praise him, all you angels of his, praise him, all his armies. Praise him, sun and moon; praise him, every star that shines. Praise him, you highest heavens, you waters beyond the heavens. Let all these praise the Lord.” And since this is so, I no longer wished for a better world, because I was thinking of the whole of creation, and in the light of this clearer discernment I had come to see that though the higher things are better than the lower, the sum of all creation is better than the higher things alone.

I am, therefore, leaving out those things that are done corporeally in a quite ordinary period of time, such as the rising and the setting of the stars, the births and the deaths of animals, the innumerable diversities of seeds and buds, the mists and the clouds, the snows and the rain, the lightnings and the thunders, the thunderbolts and the hails, the winds and the fires, the cold and the heat, and all such things. Nor am I taking into account the things that rarely happen in the same order, such as the eclipses of the heavenly bodies, the appearances of unusual stars, monsters, earthquakes, and similar things. I am considering none of these things, for their first and highest cause is nothing else than the will of God. Hence, when certain things of this kind are also mentioned in the psalm, such as “fire, hail, snow, mists,” it immediately adds “that fulfill his words,” lest anyone might believe that they were done by chance or by corporeal causes only, or even by spiritual causes that exist outside the will of God.
