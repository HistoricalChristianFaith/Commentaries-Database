All truth is justice. In the confessing of what is the case, there is justice. He speaks the truth, that sinners who justify themselves by their faults cannot be justified. And in this way one is called truly just in that confessing one’s own sin, he asks them to be accounted to himself yet begs God for mercy. For he knows that it is stated in the law, “Confess your sins, and you will be justified.” What does it mean “to confess at the start of speaking” unless “to speak freely and not just when forced to”? For who (even one who fears God) is without sin, since faults get mixed into thinking and unconsciously we sin in so many ways?
