And neither will you believe that it was foretold that these nations would come to some place of God, as it has been said, “To you the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth.” Understand, if you can, that it is to the God of the Christians, who is supreme and the true God, that the people of these nations come, not by walking but by believing. For this same announcement has been made in these words by another prophet: “The Lord shall be terrible upon them and shall consume all the gods of the earth, and they shall adore him every man from his place, all the islands of the Gentiles.” One says, “To you the Gentiles shall come from the ends of the earth”; the other, “They shall adore him every man from his own place.” Therefore they will not be required to withdraw from their own place in coming to him, because they will find him in whom they believe in their own hearts.

For a long time … the demons kept silent in their own temples concerning the things that would come to pass, although because of the utterances of the prophets they could not have been unaware of them. When, later, the events began to draw near, they wished, as it were, to foretell them, so that they might not be deemed ignorant and vanquished. Nevertheless, not to mention other instances for the present, long ago there had been foretold and recorded that which the prophet Zephaniah says: “The Lord shall prevail against them and shall cast out all the gods of the Gentiles of the earth. And they shall adore him every man from his own place, all the islands of the Gentiles.” Possibly those gods who were worshiped in the temples of the Gentiles did not believe that those events would occur to them and consequently did not wish them to be noised abroad through their own seers and diviners.
