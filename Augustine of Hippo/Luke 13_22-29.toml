Christ has hidden enemies. All those who live unjust and irreligious lives are Christ’s enemies, even if they are signed with his name and are called Christians. I mean the ones to whom he is going to say, “I do not know you,” and they say to him, “Lord, in your name we ate and drank. In your name, we performed many deeds of power. What did we eat and drink in your name?” You see that they did not value their food very highly, and yet it was with reference to it that they said they belonged to Christ. Christ is the food that is eaten and drunk. Even Christ’s enemies eat and drink him. The faithful know the Lamb without spot on which they feed, if only they fed on it in such a way that they are not liable to punishment! The apostle says, “Whoever eats and drinks unworthily is eating and drinking judgment upon himself.”

The shepherds came from nearby to see, and the magi came from far away to worship. This is the humility for which the wild olive deserved to be grafted into the olive tree and against nature to produce olives. It deserved to change nature through grace. They come from the farthest parts of the earth, saying according to Jeremiah, “Truly our fathers worshiped lies.” They come, not just from one part of the world, but as the Gospel according to Luke says, “from east and west, from north and south, to sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.”
