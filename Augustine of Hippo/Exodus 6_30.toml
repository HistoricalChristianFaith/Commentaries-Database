Moses says, “Behold, I have a weak voice, how will Pharaoh listen to me?” He appears to excuse himself for the weakness of his voice, not only due to the great number of the people but also due to the condition of one man. It would be remarkable if his voice were so weak that he could not be heard even by one man. Or perhaps the royal dignity did not allow them to speak at close range? For God says to Moses, “Behold, I gave you as a god to Pharaoh, and Aaron your brother will be your prophet.”
