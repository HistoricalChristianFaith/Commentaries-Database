"My soul is always in Your hand" [Psalm 119:109]. Some copies read, "in my hand:" but most, "in Your hand;" and this latter is indeed easy. For "the souls of the righteous are in God's hand: [Wisdom 3:1] in whose hand are both we and our words." [Wisdom 7:16] "And I do not forget Your law:" as if his memory were aided to remember God's law by the hands of Him in whose hands is his soul. But how the words, "My soul is in my hands," can be understood, I know not. For these are the words of the righteous, not of the ungodly; of one who is returning to the Father, not departing from the Father.. ..Is it perhaps said, "My soul is in my hands," in this sense, as if he offered it to God to be quickened? Whence in another passage it is said, "Unto You, O Lord, have I lifted up my soul."  Since here too he had said above, "Quicken Thou me."
