For a man swollen with pride in comparison to another might say, “My faith distinguishes me,” or “my justice” or whatever. It is to prevent such ideas that the good teacher asks, “But what do you have that you have not received?” Did you not receive it from him who chose to distinguish you from another? It was he who chose to give you what another did not receive. “But if you have received, why do you glory as if you had not received it?” Now I ask, is the apostle concerned here with anything else than that “He who glories should glory in the Lord”? But nothing is so contrary to this sentiment than for anyone to glory in his own merits as if he and not the grace of God were responsible for them. I refer to that grace that distinguishes the good from the wicked, not one which is common to the good and the wicked. On this premise the grace by which we are living and rational creatures, and thus distinguished from beasts, would be enmeshed in nature. The grace by which the beautiful are distinguished from the ugly, or the intelligent from the stupid, is a grace that perceives nature. But that person whose pride the apostle was trying to restrain was not puffing himself up in comparison to the beasts, nor in comparison to the gifts of nature that might exist even in the worst of men. Rather, he was puffed up because he attributed some good thing which pertained to the morally good life to himself and not to God. Thus, he deserved to hear the rebuke, “For who distinguishes you? Or what do you have that you have not received?” For though the ability to possess faith belongs to our nature, is that also true of the actual possession of faith? “For not all men have faith,” although all men have the possibility of having faith.

Then, therefore, they afterwards marveled at the fact that they saw him ascending and they rejoiced that he went up to heaven, for the precedence of the Head is the hope of the members. Moreover, they heard the angelic message, “men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up to heaven? This Jesus … shall come in the same way as you have seen him going up to heaven.” What is the significance of “he will come in the same way”? He will come in that same form, so that the Scripture may be fulfilled, “They shall look upon him whom they have pierced.” He shall come to men; he shall come as a Man; but he shall come as the God-Man. He shall come as true God and true Man to make men like God. He has ascended as Judge of heaven; he has expressed himself as Herald of heaven. Let us stand justified so that we may not fear the judgment that is to come. As a matter of fact, he did ascend; those who announced it to us witnessed it. The people who did not see it believed; still some incredulous persons mocked, “for not all have faith.”
