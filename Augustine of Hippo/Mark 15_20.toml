But we must understand that the words of Matthew, they “put of Him a scarlet robe, "Mark expresses by “clothed Him in blue”; for that scarlet robe was used by them in derision for the royal blue, and there is a sort of red blue, very like scarlet. It may also be that Mark mentions some blue which the robe had about it, though it was of a scarlet colour.
It appears that Matthew and Mark here relate things which took place previously, not that they happened when Pilate had already delivered Him to be crucified. For John says that these things took place at Pilate’s house; but that which follows, “And when they had mocked Him, they took off the blue from Him, and put on Him His own clothes, "must be understood to have taken place last of all, when He was already being led to be crucified.
