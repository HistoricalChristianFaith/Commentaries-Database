“As the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son also to have life in himself.” Therefore, [the Son] does not live by participation; rather, he lives without change and in every respect is, himself, life. The Father has given the Son to have life. As the Father has, so he has given. What difference is there? The difference is that the one has given, the other has received. Did the Son already exist when he received? Do we understand that Christ was once without light when he is himself the wisdom of the Father about which it was said, “It is the brightness of eternal life?”Therefore, when it says, “He has given to the Son” it is as if he said, “He begat a Son,” since the Father gave by begetting. Just as the Father gave the son to be, he also gave him to be life and he gave him to be life in himself. What does it mean to be life in himself? It means that he would not need life from any other source. It means that he himself would be the fullness of life out of which others, who believe in him, might [truly] have life while they live. Therefore “He has given to him to have life in himself.” He has given to whom? He has given, so to speak, to his Word, to him who “in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God.”
