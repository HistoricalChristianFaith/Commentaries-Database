And the Lord shall reward Me according to My righteousness [Psalm 18:24]. Accordingly not only for the breadth of faith, which works by love; but also for the length of perseverance, will the Lord reward Me according to My righteousness. "And according to the cleanness of My hands in the sight of His eyes." Not as men see, but "in the sight of His eyes." For "the things that are seen are temporal; but the things that are not seen are eternal:" [2 Corinthians 4:18] whereto the height of hope appertains.
