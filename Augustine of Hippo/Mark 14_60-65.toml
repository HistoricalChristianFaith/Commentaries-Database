(de Con. iii. 6) Matthew, however, does not say that Jesus answered I am, but, Thou hast said. But Mark shows, that the words I am were equivalent to Thou hast said. There follows, And ye shall see the Son of Man silting on the right hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven. (Matt. 26:64)

(ubi sup.) We must understand by this, that the Lord suffered these things till morning, in the house of the High Priest, whither He had first been brought.
