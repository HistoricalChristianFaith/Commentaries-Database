Whoever you understand here, be careful that you do not think that the porter is greater than the door; for in our houses the doorman usually ranks above the door, not the door above the doorman.… The doorman is our Lord himself. There is much less difference between a door and a doorman than between a door and a shepherd. And he has called himself both the door and the shepherd. Why then not the door and the doorman?… For what is the door? The way of entrance. Who is the doorkeeper? He who opens it. Who, then, is he that opens himself, but he who reveals himself to sight?… If you seek another person for doorman, take the Holy Spirit … of whom our Lord below said, “He will guide you into all truth.” What is the door? Christ. What is Christ? The truth. Who opens the door but the one who will guide you into all truth?

And who else leads them out but the same one who loosens the chain of their sins so that, unfettered, they may follow him?
