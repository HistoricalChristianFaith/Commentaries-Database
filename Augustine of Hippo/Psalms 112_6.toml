He therefore who does these things, "shall guide his words with discretion." His deeds themselves are the words whereby he shall be defended at the Judgment; which shall not be without mercy unto him, since he has himself shown mercy. "For he shall never be moved" [Psalm 112:6]: he who, called to the right hand, shall hear these words, "Come, you blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." For no works of theirs, save works of mercy, are there mentioned. He therefore shall hear, "Come, you blessed of My Father;" for, "the generation of the right ones shall be blessed." Thus, "the righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance."

Today we are celebrating the memory of a just man. So in this sermon that I owe your graces in carrying out my ministry, I must say something about what we have been singing to the Lord with full and harmonious hearts and voices: "The just person will be held in eternal memory, he will not be afraid of an evil hearing." The psalm, clearly, was read in order to remind us what good purpose is served by this sort of solemn celebration. The reason, you see, that holy church celebrates every year the anniversary of the last days of the just and holy people who have departed from this world is not thereby to increase the honor enjoyed by these just persons but to set before us an example to be imitated.

So "the just person will be remembered forever; and he will not be afraid of an evil hearing." The judge is coming, you see, of the living and the dead, as we read in the Gospel. And it is true; since in fact the things we now see had not yet occurred, when it was foretold they would happen. The fact that you can now see the name of Christ being proclaimed throughout all nations, people converted to the one God, idols being forsaken, temples pulled down, images smashed; none of these things had yet happened, and yet they were spoken of, and now they can be seen. So in the Scriptures in which these things we can now see were written about (they were written, though, at a time when they could not be seen, but they were being promised for the future), in the very same Scriptures we read of what has not yet come about. I mean, the day of judgment has not yet come, the resurrection of the dead has not yet happened, the one who is going to judge has not yet come, who came the first time to be judged.
