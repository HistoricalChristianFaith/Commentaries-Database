"Give ye glory to God, above Israel is the magnificence of Him" [Psalm 68:34]. Of whom says the Apostle, "Upon the Israel of God." [Galatians 6:16] For "not all that are out of Israel, are Israelites:" [Romans 9:6] for there is also an Israel after the flesh. Whence he says, "See ye Israel after the flesh." [1 Corinthians 10:18] "For not they that are sons of the flesh, are sons of God, but sons of promise are counted for a seed." [Romans 9:8] Therefore at that time when without any intermixture of evil men His people shall be, like a heap purged by the fan, [Matthew 3:12] like Israel in whom guile is not, [John 1:47] then most pre-eminent "above Israel" shall be "the magnificence" of "Him: and the virtue of Him in the clouds." For not alone He shall come to judgment, but with the elders of His people: [Isaiah 3:14] to whom He has promised that they shall sit upon thrones to judge, [Matthew 19:28] who even shall judge angels. [1 Corinthians 6:3] These be the clouds.
