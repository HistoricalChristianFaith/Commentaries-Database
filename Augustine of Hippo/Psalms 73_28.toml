But you do what? "But for me to cleave to God is a good thing" [Psalm 73:28]. This is whole good. Will you have more? I grieve at your willing. Brethren, what will you have more? Than to cleave to God nothing is better, when we shall see Him face to face. [1 Corinthians 13:12] But now what? For yet as a stranger I am speaking: "to cleave," he says, "to God is a good thing:" but now in my sojourning (for not yet has come the substance), I have "to put in God my hope." So long therefore as you have not yet cloven, therein put your hope. You are wavering, cast forward an anchor to the land.  Not yet do you cleave by presence, cleave fast by hope. "To put in God my hope." And by doing what here will you put in God your hope? What will be your business, but to praise Him whom you love, and to make others to be fellow-lovers of Him with you? Lo, if you should love a charioteer, would you not carry along other men to love him with you? A lover of a charioteer wherever he goes does speak of him, in order that as well as he others also may love him. For nought are loved abandoned men, and from God is reward required in order that He may be loved? Love thou God for nought, grudge God to no one....For what follows? "In order that I may tell forth all Your praises in the courts of the daughter of Sion." "In the courts:" for the preaching of God beside the Church is vain. A small thing it is to praise God and to tell forth all His praise. In the courts of the daughter of Sion tell thou forth. Make for unity, do not divide the people; but draw them unto one, and make them one. I have forgotten how long I have been speaking. Now the Psalm being ended, even judging by this closeness,  I suppose I have held a long discourse: but it does not suffice for your zeal; you are too impetuous.  O that with this impetuosity ye would seize upon the kingdom of Heaven.
