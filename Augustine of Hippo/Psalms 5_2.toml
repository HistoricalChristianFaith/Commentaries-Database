"Attend to the voice of my supplication;" that is, to that voice, which he makes request that God would understand: of which what the nature is, he has already intimated, when he said, "Understand my cry. Attend      to the voice of my supplication, my King, and my God" [Psalm 5:2]. Although both the Son is God, and the Father God, and the Father and the Son together One God; and if asked of the Holy Ghost, we must give no other answer than that He is God; and when the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost are mentioned together, we must understand nothing else, than One God; nevertheless Scripture is wont to give the appellation of King to the Son. According then to that which is said, "By Me man comes to the Father," [John 14:6] rightly is it first, "my King;" and then, "my God." And yet has not the Psalmist said, Attend You; but, "Attend." For the Catholic faith preaches not two or three Gods, but the Very Trinity, One God. Not that the same Trinity can be together, now the Father, now the Son, now the Holy Ghost, as Sabellius believed: but that the Father must be none but the Father, and the Son none but the Son, and the Holy Ghost none but the Holy Ghost, and this Trinity but One God. Hence when the Apostle had said, "Of whom are all things, by whom are all things, in whom are all things," [Romans 11:36] he is believed to have conveyed an intimation of the Very Trinity; and yet he did not add, to Them be glory; but, "to Him be glory."
