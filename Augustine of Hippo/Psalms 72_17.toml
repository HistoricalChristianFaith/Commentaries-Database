"Be," therefore, "the name of Him blessed for ever: before the sun endures the name of Him" [Psalm 72:17]. By the sun times are signified. Therefore for everlasting endures the name of Him. For eternity does precede times, and is not bounded by time. "And there shall be blessed in Him all the tribes of the earth." For in Him is fulfilled that which has been promised to Abraham. "For He says not, In seeds, as though in many; but as though in one, And to your Seed, which is Christ." [Galatians 3:16] But to Abraham is said, "In your Seed shall be blessed all the tribes of the earth." [Genesis 22:18] And not the sons of the flesh but the sons of promise are counted in the Seed. [Romans 9:8] "All nations shall magnify Him." As if in explanation there is repeated that which above has been said. For because they shall be blessed in Him, they shall magnify Him; not of themselves making Him to be great, that of Himself is great, but by praising and confessing Him to be great. For thus we magnify God: thus also we say, "Hallowed be Your name," [Matthew 6:9] which is indeed always holy.
