Who endowed him with such patience? Who? Let the psalm tell us. There, after all, we can read, there we can sing, “Shall my soul not be subject to God? For it is from him that my patience comes.” Whoever imagines that Saint Vincent was capable of these things by his own powers is making a very big mistake. Those, you see, who are confident they are capable of this by their own powers may seem to overcome by patience but are in fact being overcome by pride.
