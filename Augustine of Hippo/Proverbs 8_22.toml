According to the form of God it was said, “Before all the hills he has begotten me,” that is, before all the most exalted creatures, and, “Before the morning star I have begotten you,” that is, before all the ages and temporal things. But according to the form of a slave it was said, “The Lord created me in the beginning of his ways.” Because according to the form of God he said, “I am the truth,” and according to the form of a slave, “I am the way.” For since he himself, “the firstborn of the dead,” has laid out the road for his church to the kingdom of God, to eternal life, of which he is the head even to the extent of giving immortality to the body. He was, therefore, created in the beginning of the ways of God for his works.

The beginning of his ways is the head of the church, which is Christ incarnate, through whom there was to be given us an example of living, that is, a certain way by which we might reach God.… So the Word by which all things were made was created man in the beginning of his ways.
