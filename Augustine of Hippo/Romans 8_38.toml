Paul says that he is sure, not merely that he is of the opinion … that neither death nor the promise of temporal life nor any of the other things he lists can separate the believer from God’s love. No one can separate the believer from God; not someone who threatens death, because he who believes in Christ shall live even if he dies, nor someone who offers earthly life, because Christ gives us eternal life. An angel cannot separate us, because “if an angel comes down from heaven and tells you something other than what you receive, let him be anathema.” Nor can a principality, i.e., an opposing power, because Christ has … vanquished them in himself.
