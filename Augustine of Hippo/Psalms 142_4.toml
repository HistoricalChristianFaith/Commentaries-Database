"I considered upon the right hand, and saw" [Psalm 142:4]. He considered upon the right hand, and saw: whoso considers upon the left hand, is blinded. What is to consider on the right hand? Where they will be to whom shall be said, "Come, you blessed of My Father," etc., [Matthew 25:34, 41] ...He goes on to say, "and there was none that knew me." For when you fear all things, who knows what you regard, whether you direct your eyes to the right hand or to the left? If, in bearing, you seek the praise of men, you have regarded the left: if, in bearing, you seek the promises of God, you have regarded the right hand. Have you regarded the right hand, you shall see: have you regarded the left hand, you shall be blinded. But even when you see on the right hand, there will be none to know you. For who comforts you save the Lord? "Flight has perished from me." He speaks as though he were hemmed in. Let the persecutors rejoice over him; he is overpowered, he is taken, he is hemmed in, he is conquered. "Flight has perished" from him who flees not. But he who flees not, suffers whatever he can for Christ: that is, he flees not in soul. For in body it is lawful to flee; it is allowed, it is permitted; for the Lord says, "When they persecute you in one city, flee to another." [Matthew 10:23] He then who flees not in soul, from him "flight has perished." But it makes a difference why he flees not; whether because he is hemmed in, because he is caught, or because he is brave. For both from him that is caught flight has perished, and from him that is brave flight has perished. What flight then is to be avoided? What flight shall we allow to perish from us? That whereof the Lord speaks in the Gospel, "The Good Shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, when he sees the wolf coming, flees." When he sees the ravager, why flees he? "Because he cares not for the sheep.". ..In two ways a man's life is sought, either by his persecutors or by his lovers.  So then "there is none to seek my life," he said of them; verily they persecute my life, and they seek not my life. But if they seek my life, they will find it clinging to You: and if they know to seek it, they know also to imitate it.

“And they were seeking Jesus,” but in an evil way. For blessed are they who are seeking Jesus, but in a good way. Those people were seeking Jesus that neither they nor we might have him; but we have received him who withdrew from them. They who are seeking are reproached, they who are seeking are praised; for it is the disposition of the seeker that finds either praise or condemnation. For you have this also in the Psalms: “Let them be confounded and covered with shame who seek my life.” These are the ones who seek in an evil way. In another place, however, it says, “Flight has perished from me; and there is no one who seeks after my life.” They who seek are blamed; they who do not seek are blamed. Therefore let us seek Christ that we may have him; let us seek him that we may hold him but not that we may kill him. For these people, too, were seeking him precisely in order that they might hold him but that soon they might not have him. “They were seeking, therefore, and they were saying to one another, ‘What do you think, that he is not coming to the feast day?’ ”
