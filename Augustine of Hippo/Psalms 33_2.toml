"Praise the Lord with harp:" praise the Lord, presenting unto Him your bodies a living sacrifice. [Romans 12:1] "Sing unto Him with the psaltery for ten strings" [Psalm 33:2]: let your members be servants to the love of God, and of your neighbour, in which are kept both the three and the seven commandments.
