He means here, of course, the Father. But how is it then that he says in another place, “The Father judges no one but has committed all judgment to the Son”? … In the former place judgment is used in the sense of inflicting pain, but here it is used in the sense of discernment … When he says there is “one who seeks and judges,” he is referring to the Father, who discerns and distinguishes between my glory and yours. For you glory in the spirit of this present world. I do not.… The Father distinguishes the glory of the Son from that of mere human beings.… For just because Christ has been made man does not bring us into a comparison with him. We have sin; he was without sin.… So then, brothers, in respect, I say, to his very form of a servant … the difference is great between the glory of Christ and the glory of other people. It is of that glory he spoke when the devilpossessed heard him say, “I seek not my own glory; there is one who seeks and judges.”
