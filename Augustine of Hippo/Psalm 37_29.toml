"The righteous shall inherit the land" [Psalm 37:29]. Here again let not covetousness steal on you, nor promise you some great estate; hope not to find there, what you are commanded to despise in this world. That "land" in the text, is a certain "land of the living," the kingdom of the Saints. Whence it is said: "You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living."  For if your life too is the same life as that there spoken of, think what sort of "land" you are about to inherit. That is "the land of the living;" this the land of those who are about to die: to receive again, when dead, those whom it nourished when living. Such then as is that land, such shall the life itself be also: if the life be for ever, "the land" also is to be yours "for ever." And how is "the land" to be yours "for ever"?
