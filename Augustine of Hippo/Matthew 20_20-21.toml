(Cons. Ev. ii. 64.) What Matthew has here represented as being said by the mother, Mark (Mark 10:35) relates that the two sons of Zebedee spake themselves, when she had presented their wish before the Lord; so that from Mark's brief notice it should rather seem, that they, and not she, had said that which was said.
