"For I was mindful of Your judgments from the beginning of the world, O Lord, and received comfort" [Psalm 119:52]; or, as other copies have it, "and I was exhorted," that is, received exhortation. For either might be rendered for the Greek pareklhqhn. "From the beginning of the world," that is, from the birth of the human race, "I was mindful of Your judgments" upon the vessels of wrath, which are fitted unto perdition: "and I received comfort," since through these also have You shown the riches of Your glory on the vessels of Your mercy. [RomansÂ 9:22-23]
