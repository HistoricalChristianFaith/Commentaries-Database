"O Lord, let me not be confounded, for I have called upon You" [Psalm 31:17]. O Lord, let me not be put to shame by those who insult me, for that I have called upon You. "Let the ungodly be ashamed, and be brought down to hell." Let them rather who call upon stones be ashamed, and made to dwell with darkness.
