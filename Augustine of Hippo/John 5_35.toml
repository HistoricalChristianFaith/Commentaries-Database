All people are lamps because they can both be lighted and extinguished.… Only [Christ] is not a lamp. For he is not lighted and extinguished, because “as the Father has life in himself, so he has given to the Son to have life in himself.” Therefore, the apostles, too, are lamps. And they give thanks because they both have been kindled by the light of truth and burn with the Spirit of love, and the oil of God’s grace is available to them. If they were not lamps, the Lord would not say to them, “You are the light of the world.” For after he said, “You are the light of the world,” he shows that they should not think they were such a light as that of which it is said, “It was the true light that enlightens everyone who comes into this world.”
