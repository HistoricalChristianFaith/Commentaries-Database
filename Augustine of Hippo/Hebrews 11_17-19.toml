The apostle says, “He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all.” This explains why Isaac himself, just like the Lord carrying his cross, carried to the place of sacrifice the wood on which he was to be placed.… Note that when Abraham first saw the ram, it was caught by its thorns in a thicket of briers. This surely is a symbol of Jesus, crowned with thorns by the Jews before he was immolated.
