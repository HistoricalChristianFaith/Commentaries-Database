..."Your hands have made me, and fashioned me" [Psalm 119:73]. The hands of God are the power of God. Or if the plural number moves them, since it is not said, Your hand, but, "Your hands;" let them understand by the hands of God the power and wisdom of God, both of which titles are given to one Christ, [1 Corinthians 1:24] who is also understood under the figure, Arm of the Lord.  Or let them understand by the hands of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit; since the Holy Spirit works conjointly with the Father and the Son: whence says the Apostle, "But all these works that one and the self-same Spirit:" [1 Corinthians 12:11] he said, "one and the self-same;" lest as many spirits as works might be imagined, not that the Spirit works without the Father and the Son. It is easy therefore to see how the hands of God are to be understood: provided, at the same time, that He be not denied to do those things through His Word which He does by His hands: nor be considered not to do those things with His hands, which He does through His word....But is this said in respect of Adam? From whom since all men were propagated, what man, since Adam was made, may not say that he himself also was made by reason of procreation and generation from Adam? Or may it rightly be said, in this sense, "Your hands have made me, and fashioned me," namely, that every man is born even of his parents not without the work of God, God creating, they generating? Since, if the creative  power of God be withdrawn from things, they perish: nor is anything at all, either of the world's elements, or of parents, or of seeds, produced, if God does not create it....

Without doubt, if what I said is true and you not only heard this true thing but also understood it, two things happened there; distinguish them, hearing and understanding. Hearing occurred through me; through whom did understanding occur? I spoke to the ear that you might hear; who spoke to your heart that you might understand? Without a doubt, someone also said something to your heart so that not only did that sound of words strike your ear but something of truth descended into your heart. Someone spoke also to your heart, but you did not see him. If you understand, brothers, your heart has also been spoken to. Understanding is a gift of God. If you understood, who spoke this in your heart? He to whom the psalm says, “Give me understanding that I may learn your commands.”
