But the “heaven of the heavens” belongs to you, Lord. And the earth that you assigned “to the children of mortals,” for them to see and to touch, was not the one that we now see and touch. “It was invisible and confused,” an abyss, on which no light shone. In other words, “darkness ruled over the abyss,” that is, a darkness greater than that in the abyss. The abyss today, of visible waters, even in their depths have a semblance of light, perceivable in any case by fish and by the animals that crawl on the ocean floor. That other, rather, was altogether virtually nothing, because it was still absolutely without form. It was, however, such as could assume a form. You, Lord, brought forth “the world from unformed matter”—what was almost nothing, drawn by you out of nothing, to bring forth the great things that we human beings admire. This is truly the marvel of these corporeal heavens, that is, of the firmament, which you created between the waters on the second day, after the light was created, saying, “Let it be so. And so it was.”

We can ask ourselves if the Scripture calls “heaven and earth” all the things already distinguished and arranged in their order. Or if, by the term “heaven and earth,” it means the matter itself of the universe, originally unformed, which by the ineffable command of God was differentiated and arranged in the formed and magnificent natures that we now admire. Although we in fact read in Scripture, “You who made the world, drawing it from formless matter,” we nevertheless cannot say that the matter itself (of whatever kind it may be) was not made by him from whom we declare and profess by faith that all things come. Consequently, we also call “world” the ordered arrangement of all the formed and distinct things, whatever they may be, while on the contrary, we call “heaven and earth” the matter itself, as if the latter were the primordial germ of the heaven and the earth. So “heaven and earth,” something confused and mixed, is capable of receiving forms from God the creator.
