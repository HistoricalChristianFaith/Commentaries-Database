The Son of God, the only begotten of the Father, God always, man for our sake, having become what he made—I mean, he became man, having made humankind—says to the Father, "I confess to you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth." "You are my Father, Lord of heaven and earth"; Father of the one through whom all things were made. The whole of creation, you see, is briefly unfolded in these two words, heaven and earth. That is why it says in the first book of God's Scriptures, "In the beginning, God made heaven and earth"12; and also, "My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth." But by the word heaven is to be understood whatever is in the heavens, and by the word earth whatever is on the earth; so by naming these two parts of creation, you do not leave out a single creature, because it is either here, or it is there.
