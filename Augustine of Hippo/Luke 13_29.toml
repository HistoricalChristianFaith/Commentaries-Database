The shepherds came from nearby to see, and the magi came from far away to worship. This is the humility for which the wild olive deserved to be grafted into the olive tree and against nature to produce olives. It deserved to change nature through grace. They come from the farthest parts of the earth, saying according to Jeremiah, "Truly our fathers worshiped lies." They come, not just from one part of the world, but as the Gospel according to Luke says, "from east and west, from north and south, to sit down with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven."
