The weakness and the corruptibility of the body are truly fetters that weigh down the soul. The body"s fragility is like the material a persecutor could use for causing pain and suffering, thus forcing many of the saints into impiety. The apostle longed to be unbound from these fetters and to be with Christ, but to remain in the flesh was necessary for the sake of those to whom he was ministering the gospel. Until, then, this corruptible puts on incorruption, and this mortal puts on immortality, the weak flesh will imprison the willing spirit. No one feels these fetters except those who groan inwardly, who are burdened and wanting to be clothed with the tabernacle that is from heaven, because death is terrifying and mortal life brings sorrow. The prophet redoubles his own groaning in behalf of these individuals who are suffering so that their groaning may come before the sight of the Lord.
Those who are bound by the disciplines of wisdom may also be understood to be fettered. But these disciplines, if patiently endured, can be turned into adornments, which is why it is written, "Put your feet into [wisdom"s] fetters." - "Expositions of the Psalms 78.15"
