"See! I do so; I do 'submit to the Lord, and I do entreat.' But what do you think? That neighbour of mine is a wicked man, living a bad life, and prosperous! His thefts, adulteries, robberies, are known to me. Lifted up above every one, proud, and raised on high by wickedness, he deigns not to notice me. In these circumstances, how shall I hold out with patience?" This is a sickness; drink, by way of remedy. "Fret not yourself because of him who prospers in his way." He prospers, but it is "in his way:" you suffer, but it is in God's way! His portion is prosperity on his way, misery on arriving at its end: yours, toil on the road, happiness in its termination. "The Lord knows the way of the righteous; and the way of the ungodly shall perish."  Thou walkest those ways which "the Lord knows," and if you dost suffer toil in them, they do not deceive you. The "way of the ungodly" is but a transitory happiness; at the end of the way the happiness is at an end also. Why? Because that way is "the broad road;" its termination leads to the pit of hell. Now, your way is narrow; and "few there be" that enter in through it: [Matthew 7:13-14] but into how ample a field it comes at the last, you ought to consider. "Fret not yourself at him who prospers in his way; because of the man who brings wicked devices to pass."

"Cease from anger, and forsake wrath" [Psalm 37:8]. Wherefore are you angry? Wherefore is it that, through that passion and indignation, you blaspheme, or almost blaspheme? Against "the man who brings wicked devices to pass, cease from anger, and forsake wrath." Do you not know whither that wrath tempts you on? You are on the point of saying unto God, that He is unjust. It tends to that. "Look! Why is that man prosperous, and this man in adversity?" Consider what thought it begets: stifle the wicked notion. "Cease from anger, and forsake wrath:" so that now returning to your senses, you may say, "My eye is disturbed because of wrath."  What eye is that, but the eye of faith? To the eye of your faith I appeal.  Thou believed in Christ: why did you believe? What did He promise you? If it was the happiness of this world that Christ promised you, then murmur against Christ; yes! Murmur against Him, when you see the wicked flourishing. What of happiness did He promise? What, save in the Resurrection of the Dead? But what in this life? That which was His portion. His portion, I say! Do you, servant and disciple, disdain what your Lord, what your Master bore?...

"For evil-doers shall be cut off" [Psalm 37:9]. "But I see their prosperity." Believe Him who says, "they shall be cut off;" Him who sees better than thou, since His eye anger cannot cloud. "For evil-doers shall be cut off. But those that wait upon the Lord,"— not upon any one that can deceive them; but verily on Him who is the Truth itself—"But those that wait upon the Lord, they shall inherit the land." What "land," but that Jerusalem, with the love of which whosoever is inflamed, shall come to peace at the last.
