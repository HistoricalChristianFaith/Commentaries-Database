And when God was feeding them, the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit was feeding them. Now he is raised up and becomes like a second shepherd. But he is not a second one. Not a second one in the form of God, because in the form of God he and the Father are one God. But in the form of a servant he is raised up to feed them like a second one, because the Father is greater. Listen to one feeding them, and Christ feeding them: “I and the Father are one.”

In his divinity he is equal to the Father; by his incarnation he is subject to the Father.

[We must understand] that the Father is not anything in respect to his own substance. We must also understand that what is said about him—that he is the Father and his very existence as Father—is all said in relation to the Son. How then can the Son be of the same essence as the Father, seeing that the Father—in respect to himself—is neither his own essence, nor does he exist at all in respect to himself? Rather, even his very essence exists in relation to the Son. But this establishes even more the fact that [the Son] is of one and the same essence [with the Father], since the Father and Son must be of one and the same essence, seeing that the Father has being itself—not in respect to himself, but to the Son. This is the essence he begot, and the essence by which he is whatever he is. Therefore neither [person] exists in respect to himself alone. And both exist in relationship to one another.
