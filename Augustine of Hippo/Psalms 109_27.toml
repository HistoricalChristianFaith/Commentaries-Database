"Though they curse, yet bless Thou" [Psalm 109:27]. Vain therefore and false is the cursing of the sons of men, that have pleasure in vanity, and seek a lie;  but when God blesses, He does what He says. "Let them be confounded that rise up against me." For their imagining that they have some power against Me, is the reason that they rise up against Me; but when I shall have been exalted above the heavens, and My glory shall have commenced spreading over the whole earth, they shall be confounded. "But Your servant shall rejoice:" either on the right hand of the Father, or in His members when they rejoice, both in hope among temptations, and after temptations for evermore.
