Considering the signs mentioned by Gospel and prophecy which we see happening, would anyone deny that we ought to hope for the coming of the Lord? Manifestly, it is nearer and nearer every day. But the exact span of the nearness, that, as we said, “is not for you to know.” Notice when the apostle said this, “For our salvation is nearer than when we believed. The night is past and the day is at hand,” and look how many years have passed! Yet, what he said was not untrue. How much more probable is it to say now that the coming of the Lord is near when there has been such an increase of time toward the end! Certainly the apostle said, “The Spirit manifestly says that in the last times some shall depart from the faith.” Obviously, those were not yet the times of heretics such as he describes them in the same sentence, but they have now come. According to this, we seem to be in the last times, and the heretics seem to be a warning of the end of the world.

The fulfillment of these predictions in the Manichaeans is as clear as day to all that know them and has already been proved as fully as time permits.
