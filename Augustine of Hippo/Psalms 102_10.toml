"And that because of your indignation and wrath: because you have taken me up, you have cast me down" [Psalm 102:10]. This is your wrath, O Lord, in Adam: that wrath in which we were all born, which cleaves unto us by our birth; the wrath from the stock of iniquity, the wrath from the mass of sin: according to what the Apostle says, "We also were once the children of wrath, even as others." For He says not, the wrath of God shall come upon him: but, "abides upon him:" because that wrath in which he was born is not taken away....Man set in honour, is made in the image of God: raised up to this honour, lifted up from the dust, from the earth, he has received a reasonable soul; by the vivacity of that very reason, he is placed before all beasts, cattle, birds that fly, and fishes. [Genesis 1:26] For which of these has reason to understand? Because none of them is created in the image of God....Therefore, "Because You have taken me up, You have cast me down:" punishment follows me, because You have given me a free choice. For if You had not given me a free choice, and for this reason did not make me better than cattle, just condemnation would not follow me when I sinned. Thus You have taken me up in giving me freedom of choice, and by Your judgment You have cast me down.
