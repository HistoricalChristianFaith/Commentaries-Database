So let us praise the Lord, brothers and sisters, because we are holding his trustworthy promises, though we have not yet received the things promised. Do you imagine it is not enough to hold him to his promises and that we should be demanding the payment of his debts? By making promises, God has become our debtor. It is out of his goodness, not our rights, that he has become a debtor. What have we ever given him, that we should be able to hold him in our debt? Or perhaps because you heard in the psalm, "What shall I render to the Lord?" First of all, when he says, "What shall I render to the Lord?" they are the words of a debtor, not of someone demanding repayment of a debt. Something had been advanced to him. "What shall I render the Lord?" What is "What shall I render?" What shall I pay back? What for? "For all the things he has rendered to me." What has he rendered to me? To begin with, I was nothing, and he made me; I had gotten lost, and he looked for me; looked for me and found me; I was a captive, and he redeemed me; having bought me, he set me free; from a slave he made me into a brother. "What shall I render to the Lord?" You haven't got anything you can tender.When you look for absolutely everything from him, what have you got that you can render to him? But wait. There is something or other the psalmist wants to say, when he asks, "What shall I render to the Lord for all the things he has rendered to me?" He looks around everywhere for something he can tender, pay back, and he seems to find it. What does he find? "I will take the cup of salvation." Even though you were thinking of paying something back, you are still looking for something to take. Look here, please. If you are still looking for something to take, you will still be a debtor. When are you going to be a someone who pays back? So if you are always going to be a debtor, when will you ever pay back? You won't find anything you can pay back; you won't have anything apart from what he has given.
