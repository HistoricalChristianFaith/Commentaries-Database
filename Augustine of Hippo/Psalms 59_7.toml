Concerning the words of Simeon, where he says to the virgin mother of the Lord, “And a sword shall pierce your soul,” I have set forth in another letter what I think, and I sent you a copy some time ago, which you2 saw among other things. As to his adding, “that out of many hearts thoughts may be revealed,” I think it is to be taken in the sense that by the passion of the Lord both the plots of the Jews and the weakness of the disciples were made manifest. It is possible to believe that tribulation is signified by the word sword, that tribulation through which Mary’s mother’s heart was wounded by the feeling of grief. That sword was in the lips of the persecutors, of which it says in the psalm, “And a sword is in their lips.” They were the “sons of men whose teeth are weapons and arrows and their tongue a sharp sword.” The iron that pierced the soul of Joseph seems to me to be an expression of bitter tribulation; thus, it is plainly said, “The iron pierced his soul until his word came,” that is, he remained that long in bitter tribulation until his prediction was fulfilled. From then on he was held in great esteem and was free from tribulation. But, lest human wisdom should receive the credit because his word came, that is, what he foretold came to pass, in its own way the holy Scripture gives the glory of it to God, and adds at once, “The word of the Lord inflamed him.”
