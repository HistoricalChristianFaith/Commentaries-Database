Let us therefore see whether God fulfils His promises. After these stern penalties which have been recorded as having been inflicted upon this people and kingdom, that God might not be supposed to have fulfilled His promises in it, and so not to grant another kingdom in Christ, of which kingdom there shall be no end; the Prophet addresses Him in these words, "Lord, how long will You hide Yourself unto the end?" [Psalm 89:46]. For possibly it was not from them and to the end; because "blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be saved." [RomansÂ 11:25] But in the mean while "shall Your wrath burn like fire."
