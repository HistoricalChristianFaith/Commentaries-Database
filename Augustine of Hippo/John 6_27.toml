"Labor not for the meat which perisheth, but for that which endureth unto everlasting life." What ye seek of me, ye seek for the sake of something else: seek me for my own sake. For He intimates that that food is Himself, which becomes more evident in what follows. "Which the Son of man shall give unto you, for Him hath God the Father sealed." You think all the while that I am getting up to give you to eat that sort of food, which ye take for the satisfying of hunger, and soon forget. Labor not for that food, but for that which endureth unto life eternal. And when He had said, "shall give," He added, "for Him hath God the Father sealed:" that is, for this the Father sealed, namely, that He might give that food; for what is meant by sealed, but impressed a certain something peculiar to Himself? For to seal, is to put a distinguishing mark upon a thing. Whoever seals a thing, puts a mark on it, lest it be confounded with any other. To seal, then, is to put on a mark. All things God has made are common things: something peculiar He has put upon His Son, namely, has begotten Him equal to Himself, that He might be distinguished, and not be reckoned as one of the whole creation.

(Tr. xxv. 10) Under the figure of food He alludes to Himself. Ye seek Me, He saith, for the sake of something else; seek Me for My own sake.

(Tr. xxv. 10) As He told the woman of Samaria above, If thou knewest Who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldest have asked of Him, and He would have given thee living water. (c. 4) So He says here, Which the Son of man shall give unto you.
