[Wisdom said] to the unwise, “Come, eat my bread, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.” In these words, surely, we recognize that the wisdom of God, the Father’s coeternal Word, has built a house for himself, namely, a body in the virgin’s womb. And to this body, as to the head, he has united the church as his members, has “slain” his martyrs as “victims,” set his “table” with bread and wine in allusion to the priesthood according to Melchizedek, and called the weak and unwise.
