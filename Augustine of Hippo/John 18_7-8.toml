They had heard him the first time when he said, “I am he.” But they did not comprehend what he said. Why then did they go backward and fall unless the one who could do whatever he wanted did not want them to understand at first? But had he never permitted himself to be taken by them, they would not have done indeed what they came to do. However, he also would not have been able to do what he came to do. So now that he had shown his power to them when they wanted to take him and could not, he lets them seize him and thereby makes them unconscious agents of his will.
