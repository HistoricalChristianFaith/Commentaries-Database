This is the only Evangelist who has given us the very name of this servant, as Luke is the only one who tells us that the Lord touched his ear and healed him. The interpretation of Malchus is “one who is destined to reign.” What, then, is signified by the ear that was cut off in the Lord’s behalf and healed by the Lord, but the renewed hearing that has been pruned of its oldness, that it may from that point on be in the newness of the spirit and not in the oldness of the letter? Who can doubt that he, who had such a thing done for him by Christ, was yet destined to reign with Christ? And his being found a servant pertains also to that oldness that generates bondage, which is Hagar. But when healing came, liberty was also signified.
