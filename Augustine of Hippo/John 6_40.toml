He has said two things: “This is the work of God that you should believe in the one whom he has sent,” while here he added, “whoever sees and believes.” The Jews saw but did not believe; they had the one condition, lacked the other. How could they attain to eternal life without the other? The reason those who saw did not attain eternal life was because they did not also believe. If so, what about us who have believed but have not seen? If it is those two things that earn eternal life, seeing and believing—and whoever is lacking one of them cannot attain to the reward of eternal life—what are we to do? The Jews [who saw him] lacked the one; we the other. They had seeing but lacked believing. We have believing but lack seeing. Well, as regards our having believing and lacking seeing, we have prophetically been declared blessed by the Lord himself just as Thomas, one of the Twelve, was blessed when he felt his scars by touching them.

“Whoever sees the Son and believes on him should have everlasting life,” that is, by believing, by passing over to life, as at the first resurrection. But this is only the first resurrection. He alludes to the second when he says, “And I will raise him up at the last day.”
