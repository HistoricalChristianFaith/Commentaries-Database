For who is “drawn,” if he was already willing? And yet no one comes unless he is willing. Therefore he is drawn in wondrous ways to will by the one who knows how to work within the very hearts of individuals. Not that people who are unwilling should believe—which cannot be—but that they should be made willing from being unwilling.That this is true we do not surmise by human conjecture but discern by the most evident authority of the divine Scriptures. It is read in the books of the Chronicles, “Also in Judah, the hand of God was made to give them one heart, to do the commandment of the king and of the princes in the word of the Lord.” … Did the men of God who wrote these things—in fact, did the Spirit of God himself, under whose guidance such things were written by them—assail human free will? Away with the notion! But God has commended both the most righteous judgment and the most merciful aid of the Omnipotent in all cases. For it is enough for human beings to know that there is no unrighteousness with God. But how he dispenses those benefits, making some deservedly vessels of wrath, others graciously vessels of mercy—who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor? If, then, we attain to the honor of grace, let us not be ungrateful by attributing to ourselves what we have received. “For what do we have which we have not received?”?
