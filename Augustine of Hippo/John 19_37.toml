Certainly the words that the Septuagint has translated, “They shall look on me because they insulted me,” stand in the Hebrew, “They shall look on me whom they pierced.” And by this word the crucifixion of Christ is certainly more plainly indicated. But the Septuagint translators preferred to allude to the insult that was involved in his whole passion. For in point of fact they insulted him both when he was arrested and when he was bound, when he was judged, when he was mocked by the robe they put on him and the homage they did on bended knee, when he was crowned with thorns and struck with a rod on the head, when he bore his cross and when at last he hung upon the tree. And therefore we recognize more fully the Lord’s passion when we do not confine ourselves to one interpretation but combine both and read both “insulted” and “pierced.” When, therefore, we read in the prophetical books that God is to come to do judgment at the last, from the mere mention of the judgment, and although there is nothing else to determine the meaning, we must gather that Christ is meant. For though the Father will judge, he will judge by the coming of the Son. For he himself, by his own manifested presence, “judges no one but has committed all judgment to the Son.” For as the Son was judged as a man, he shall also judge in human form.
