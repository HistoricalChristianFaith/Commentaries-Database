“Whoso offendeth one of these little ones,” that is so humble as He would have his disciples to be, by not obeying, or by opposing,(as the Apostle says of Alexander, ) “it were better for him that a mill-stone should be hanged about his neck, and he be drowned in the depths of the sea,” that is, it were better for him that desire of the things of the world, to which the blind and foolish are tied down, should sink him by its load to destruction.
