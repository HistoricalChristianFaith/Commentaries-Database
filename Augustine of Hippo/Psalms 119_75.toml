"I know," she says, "O Lord, that Your judgments are righteous, and that in Your truth You have humbled me" [Psalm 119:75]. Mercy and truth are so spoken of in the Divine Word, that, while they are found in many passages, especially in the Psalms, it is also so read in one place, "All the paths of the Lord are mercy and truth." And here indeed he has placed truth first, whereby we are humbled unto death, by the judgment of Him whose judgments are righteousness.
