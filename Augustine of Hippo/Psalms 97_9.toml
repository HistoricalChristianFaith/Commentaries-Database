See if this be not the reason for the joy of the daughters of Judah. "For Thou, Lord, art most high over all the earth" [Psalm 97:9]. Not in Jud√¶a alone, but over Jerusalem; not over Sion only, but over all the earth. To this whole earth the judgments of God prevailed, so that it assembled its nations from every quarter: judgments with which they who have cut themselves off have no communion: they neither hear the prophecy, nor see its completion; "For Thou, Lord, art most high over all the earth: You are exalted far above all gods." What is "far"?  For it is said of Christ. What then means "far," except that You may be acknowledged coequal with the Father? What means, "above all gods"? Who are they? Idols have not life, have not sense: devils have life and sense; but they are evil. What great thing is it that Christ is exalted above devils? He is exalted above devils: but neither is this very great; the heathen gods indeed are devils,  but "He is far above all gods." Even men are styled gods: "I have said, You are gods: and you are all the children of the Most Highest:" again it is written, "God stands in the congregation of princes: He is a Judge among gods."  Jesus Christ our Lord is exalted above all: not only above idols, not only above devils; but above all righteous men. Even this is not enough; above all Angels also: for whence otherwise is this, "Worship Him, all you gods"? "You are far exalted above all gods."
