"Let all those that seek You, O Lord, rejoice and be glad" [Psalm 40:16]. Those who "seek" not me, but "You;" who say not to me, "Well done! Well done!" but see me "glory in You," if I have anything whereof to glory; for "he who glories, let him glory in the Lord." [1 Corinthians 1:31] "Let all those who seek You, Lord, rejoice and be glad."

"And say continually, the Lord be magnified." For even if the sinner becomes righteous, you should give the glory to "Him who justifies the ungodly." [Romans 4:5] Whether therefore it be a sinner, let Him be praised who calls him to forgiveness; or one already walking in the way of righteousness, let Him be praised who calls him to receive the crown! Let the Name of the Lord be magnified continually by "such as love Your salvation."
