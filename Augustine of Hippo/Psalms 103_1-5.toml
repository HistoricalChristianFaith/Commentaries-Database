If you did not wish to be contentious, I think you would now see how correctly we understand what you are trying to explain differently. When the prophet said, “who forgives all your faults”—something that is done by the remission of all sins—he immediately added “who heals all your diseases.” He wants us to understand the evils with which the saints will never finish their internal warfare until those evils are healed or, as far as possible in this life, progressively diminished. Not even when the virtue of chastity stands unshaken is there no sickness by which the flesh lusts against the spirit. When there is no sickness, the spirit does not lust against it, because it lusts in order at least by not consenting to obtain health, since it is unable to do so by not fighting. We are speaking of that whose resistance to us we perceive within us; if an alien nature, we must get rid of it; if our own, it must be healed. If we say it is an alien nature and must be gotten rid of, we agree with the Manichaeans. Let us, then, confess it is our own nature that must be healed, and thus we shall at the same time be clear of Manichaeans and Pelagians.

He is the Beginning, O God, in which you made heaven and earth. In this wonderful way you spoke and created them in your Word, in your Son, who is your strength, your wisdom and your truth.Who can understand this mystery or explain it to others? What is that light whose gentle beams now and again strike through to my heart, causing me to shudder in awe yet firing me with their warmth? I shudder to feel how different I am for it: yet in so far as I am like it, I am aglow with its fire. It is the light of Wisdom, Wisdom itself, which at times shines on me, parting my clouds. But when I weakly fall away from its light, those clouds envelop me again in the dense mantle of darkness that I bear for my punishment. For “my strength ebbs away for very misery,” so that I cannot sustain my blessings. And so I shall remain until you, O Lord, who “have pardoned all my sins,” also “heal all my mortal ills.” For you will “rescue my life from deadly peril, crown me with the blessings of your mercy, content all my desire for good, restore my youth as the eagle’s plumage is restored.” “Our salvation is founded on the hope of something,” and in endurance we await the fulfillment of your promises. Let those who are able listen to your fulfillment of your promises. Let those who are able listen to your voice speaking to their hearts. Trusting in your inspired words, I shall cry out, “What diversity, Lord, in your creatures! What wisdom has designed them all!” The Beginning is Wisdom, and Wisdom is the Beginning in which you made heaven and earth.

Finally, after redemption from all decay, what remains but the crown of justice? Certainly that remains; but even with that, or rather under that, take care the head is not too swollen to receive the crown. Listen, pay attention to the psalm, and see how the crown refuses to fit a swollen head. After saying, “who redeems your life from decay,” he went on, “who crowns you.” Now here you were on the point of saying, “Crowns you: that means my merits are being acknowledged; my virtue has brought this about; a debt is being paid, not a gift being presented.” Listen rather to the psalm. After all, here is something you also say: “Every person is a liar.” So listen to what God is saying: “Who crowns you with compassion and mercy.” So it is out of mercy that he crowns you, out of compassion that he crowns you. I mean to say, you did not deserve to be called, and being called to be justified, and being justified to be glorified.
