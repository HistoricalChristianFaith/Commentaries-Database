"Draw not My Soul away with sinners, and destroy me not with them that work iniquity, with them that speak peace with their neighbours" [Psalm 28:3]. With them that say unto Me, "We know that You are a Master come from God." [JohnÂ 3:2] "But evil in their hearts." But they speak evil in their hearts.
