He, then, is happy who has everything he wants but does not want what is not proper.… But, when men have attained that welfare for themselves and for those whom they love, shall we be able to say that they are now happy? They have something which it is proper to wish for, but if they have nothing else, either greater or better or more to their advantage and personal distinction, they are still far from happiness.… Certainly it is proper for them to wish for these things, not for the sake of the things themselves but for another reason, namely, that they may do good by providing for the welfare of those who live under them, but it is not proper to covet them out of the empty pride of self-esteem or useless ostentation or hurtful vanity.

I’ve been wagging a finger at the rich. Poor people, you listen too. You should pay out too; you shouldn’t go plundering either. You should give of your means too. You too curb your greed. Listen, you poor, to the same apostle, “There is great gain,” he says, “in godliness with contentment.” You have the world in common with the rich. You don’t have a house in common with the rich, but you do have the sky, you do have the light in common with them. Just look for a sufficiency, look for what is enough, not for more than that. Anything more is a weighing down, not a lifting up of the spirit; a burden, not a reward.
