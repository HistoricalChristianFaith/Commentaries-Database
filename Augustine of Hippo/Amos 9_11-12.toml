But let us hear what Hosea goes on to say: “And after this the children of Israel shall return, and shall seek the Lord their God, and David their king. And they shall fear the Lord and his goodness in the last days.” You will never find a prophecy plainer than this, for the name king David means Christ who, as St. Paul says, “was born according to the flesh of the offspring of David.” Further on still, Hosea foretold the resurrection of Christ on the third day, but in the mysterious way that is proper to prophecy. He says, “He shall heal us after two days, and on the third day we shall rise up again.” This is the idea underlying the words of St. Paul: “Therefore if you have risen with Christ, seek the things that are above.” The prophet Amos too has predictions not unlike those of Hosea. He says, “Be prepared to meet your God, O Israel, for behold, I am the one who forms the thunder, and creates the wind, and declares to men their Christ.” And, in another place: “ ‘In that day I will raise up the tabernacle of David that is fallen. And I will close up the breaches of the walls thereof and repair what is fallen. And I will rebuild it as in the days of old, so that the remnant of men may seek me out, and all nations, because my name is invoked upon them,’ says the Lord that does these things.”
