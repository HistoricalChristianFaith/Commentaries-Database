Lastly, lest of anything else the clouds be understood, he has in continuation added, "Wonderful is God in His saints, the God of Israel" [Psalm 68:35]. For at that time even most truly and most fully there shall be fulfilled the name Israel itself, which is one "seeing God:" for we shall see Him as He is. [1 John 3:2] "He Himself shall give virtue  and strength to His people, blessed be God:" to His people now frail and weak. For "we have this treasure in earthen vessels." [2 Corinthians 4:7] But then by a most glorious changing even of our bodies, "He Himself shall give virtue and strength to His people." For this body is sown in weakness, shall rise in virtue. [1 Corinthians 15:43] He Himself then shall give the virtue which in His own flesh He has sent before, whereof the Apostle says, "the power of His Resurrection." [Philippians 3:10] But strength whereby shall be destroyed the enemy death. [1 Corinthians 15:26] Now then of this long and difficultly understood Psalm we have at length by His own aid made an end. "Blessed be God. Amen."
