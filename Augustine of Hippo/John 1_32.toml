Christ was certainly not then anointed with the Holy Spirit when the Spirit as a dove descended upon him at his baptism. For here he condescends to prefigure his body, that is, his church, in which preeminently the baptized receive the Holy Spirit.… For it would be most absurd to believe that he received the Holy Spirit when he was near thirty years of age. For that was the age at which he was baptized by John. But although he came to baptism without any sin at all, he did not come without the Holy Spirit. For it was written of his servant and forerunner John himself, “He shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.” If [John], though generated by his father, still received the Holy Spirit when formed in the womb, what must be understood and believed of the man Christ whose flesh had not a carnal but spiritual conception?

We do not attribute only to Christ the possession of a real body and say that the Holy Spirit assumed a false appearance to people’s eyes. For the Holy Spirit could no more, in consistency with his nature, deceive people than could the Son of God. The almighty God, who made every creature out of nothing, could as easily form a real body of a dove, without the instrumentality of other doves, as he made a real body in the womb of the Virgin without the seed of the male.

Because we love you in Christ, love us in return in Christ; and let our love for one another [voice its] moaning to God, for moaning is itself a characteristic of the dove. If, then, moaning is characteristic of a dove, as we all know, but doves moan in love, hear what the apostle says, and do not wonder that the Holy Spirit wished to be shown in the form of a dove. He says, “For we know not what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with unspeakable groanings.” Well now, my brothers, are we to say that the Spirit groans when he has perfect and eternal happiness with the Father and the Son? For the Holy Spirit is God, as the Son of God is God and the Father God.… Therefore the Holy Spirit does not moan in himself with himself in that Trinity, in that beatitude, in that eternity of his substance; but he moans in us because he makes us moan.… One who knows that he lives in the midst of affliction in this mortal life and that he is exiled from the Lord, … moans well. It is the Spirit that has taught him to moan. He learned it from the dove.

The Holy Spirit was made to appear visibly in two ways: as a dove, on our Lord at his baptism, and as a flame upon his disciples when they were gathered together.… The former shape denoted simplicity, the latter fervency.… The dove intimates that those who are sanctified by the Spirit should have no guile; the fire indicates that in that simplicity there should not be coldness. Nor let it disturb you that the tongues are divided, for tongues are diverse; therefore the appearance was that of cloven tongues.… Do not fear division; recognize unity in the dove.…It was appropriate then that the Holy Spirit should be manifested in this way descending on our Lord so that every one who had the Spirit might know that he ought to be simple as a dove and be in sincere peace with his brothers and sisters. The kisses of doves represent this peace.… Ravens kiss, but they also tear; but the nature of doves is innocent of tearing.… Ravens feed on the dead, but the dove eats nothing but the fruits of the earth. Its food is innocent.…
That is why on this occasion the most holy Trinity appeared, the Father in the voice that said, “You are my beloved Son” and the Holy Spirit in the likeness of the dove. In that Trinity … the apostles were sent [to baptize], that is, in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.… What then could more appropriately represent the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, than the dove? As he said himself to his reconciled church, “My dove is one.” What could better express humility than the simplicity and moaning of a dove?
