"You have sold Your people for no price" [Psalm 44:12]. For we see whom You have made over; what You have received, we have not seen. "And there was no multitude in their jubilees."  For when the Christians were flying before the pursuit of enemies, who were idolaters, were there then held any congregations and "jubilees" to the honour of God? Were those Hymns chanted in concert from the Churches of God, that are wont to be sung in concert in time of peace, and to be sounded in a sweet accord of the brotherhood in the ears of God?
