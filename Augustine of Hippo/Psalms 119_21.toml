"You have rebuked the proud: and cursed are they that do err from Your commandments" [Psalm 119:21]. For the proud err from the commandments of God. For it is one thing not to fulfil the commandments of God through infirmity or ignorance; another to err from them through pride; as they have done, who have begotten us in our mortal state unto these evils....But consider now, after saying, "You have rebuked the proud," he says not, Cursed are they that have erred from Your commandments; so that only that sin of the first men should come into the mind; but he says, "Cursed are they that do err." For it was needful that all might be terrified by that example, that they might not err from the divine commandments, and by loving righteousness in all time, recover in the toil of this world, what we lost in the pleasure of Paradise.
