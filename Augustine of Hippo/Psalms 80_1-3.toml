For whatever other words we may say, whatever words the fervor of the suppliant utters at the beginning of his petition to define it or follows up afterward to intensify it, we say nothing that is not found in this prayer of the Lord, if we pray properly and fittingly. But whoever says anything in his prayer that does not accord with this Gospel prayer, even if his prayer is not of the forbidden sort, it is carnal, and I am not sure it ought not to be called forbidden, since those who are born again of the Spirit2 ought to pray only in a spiritual manner. For instance, he who says, “Be sanctified among all people, as you have been sanctified among us,” and, “May your prophets be found faithful,” what else does he say but “Hallowed be your name”? And he who says, “O God of hosts, convert us and show your face, and we will be saved,” what else does he say but “Your kingdom come”? He who says, “Direct my steps according to your word, and let no iniquity have dominion over me,” what else does he say but “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven”? He who says, “Give me neither poverty nor riches,” what else does he say but “Give us this day our daily bread”? He who says, “O Lord, remember David and all his meekness,” or “Lord, if I have done this thing, if there be iniquity in my hands, if I have rendered to them that have repaid me evils,” what else does he say but “Forgive us our debts as we also forgive our debtors”? He who says, “Take from me the greediness of the belly and let not the lusts of the flesh take hold of me,” what else does he say but “Lead us not into temptation”? He who says, “Deliver me from my enemies, O God, and defend me from them that rise up against me,” what else does he say but “Deliver us from evil”? And if you were to run over all the words of holy prayers, you would find nothing, according to my way of thinking, that is not contained and included in the Lord’s Prayer. Hence when we pray, it is allowable to say the same things in different words, but it ought not to be allowable to say different things.

“O God of hosts, restore us to our own; smile on us, and we shall find deliverance.” For wherever the soul of a person may turn, unless it turns to you, it clasps sorrow to itself. Even though it clings to things of beauty, if their beauty is outside God and outside the soul, it only clings to sorrow.Yet these things of beauty would not exist at all unless they came from you. Like the sun, they rise and set. At their rise they have their first beginning; they grow until they reach perfection; but, once they have reached it, they grow old and die. Not all reach old age, but all alike must die. When they rise, therefore, they are set on the course of their existence, and the faster they climb toward its zenith, the more they hasten toward the point where they exist no more. This is the law they obey. This is all that you have appointed for them, because they are parts of a whole. Not all the parts exist at once, but some must come as others go, and in this way together they make up the whole of which they are the parts. Our speech follows the same rule, using sounds to signify a meaning. For a sentence is not complete unless each word, once its syllables have been pronounced, gives way to make room for the next. Let my soul praise you for these things, O God, Creator of them all; but the love of them, which we feel, through the senses of the body, must not be like glue to bind my soul to them. For they continue on the course that is set for them and leads to their end, and if the soul loves them and wishes to be with them and finds its rest in them, it is torn by desires that can destroy it. In these things there is no place to rest, because they do not last. They pass away beyond the reach of our senses. Indeed, none of us can lay firm hold of them even when they are with us. For the senses of the body are sluggish, because they are the senses of flesh and blood. They are limited by their own nature. They are sufficient for the purposes for which they were made, but they cannot halt the progress of transient things, which pass from their allotted beginning to their allotted end. All such things are created by your word, which tells them, “Here is your beginning, and here your end.”
