Of what world are we speaking when we say “Woe to the world for temptations to sin”? We speak of that world of which it is said, “And the world knew him not.” We are not speaking of that world of which it is said, “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself.” There is an evil world, and there is a good world. In the evil world are all the evil ones of this world. In the good world are all the good ones of this world. We often hear it said of a field: his field is full. Of what? Of wheat. Yet we say also, and say truly too, his field is full of chaff. So with a tree, one says that it is full of fruit while another says it is full of leaves. Both speak truly. The supply of leaves has not usurped the place of the fruit, nor has the supply of fruit driven out the mass of leaves. The tree is full of both. But one thing is plucked by the wind; the other is picked by the harvester. So therefore when you hear, “Woe unto the world because of offenses,” do not be afraid. Love the law of God, and you will have no temptation to sin.
