The Son is sent, not because he is not equal to the Father but because he is “a pure emanation of the light of God” almighty. Here what is emanated and that from which it emanates are of one, identical being. It is not an emanation like that of water springing from a natural opening in the earth or in a rock but like that of light from light. When it says “splendor of the eternal light,” what else can be meant but that it is the light of the eternal light? Light’s splendor—what is it, except light? It is therefore coeternal with the light of which it is the light. Nevertheless, the Scripture preferred the expression “splendor of the light” to the other, “light of the light,” so that no one would believe that the light that emanates is darker than that from which it emanates. Rather, hearing it called its splendor, it is easier to think that the one owes to the other its brilliance, rather than that one shines less brightly than the other. But because there was no chance that anyone would think the generating light to be inferior (no heretic has dared to assert this, nor does it seem believable that one would dare to do so), the Scripture anticipates the notion that the emanated light would be darker than the generating light. It eliminated this conjecture by saying, “It is the splendor of that light,” that is, of the eternal light, thus showing his equality. Indeed, if it were inferior, it would be the shadow, not the splendor. And if greater, it would not emanate, because it could not surpass that from which it was emanating.

Look at God, contemplate the Word, and unite yourself intimately to the Word who speaks. His word is not comprised of syllables; rather, his word is the resplendent brightness of wisdom. It is said of his wisdom that “it is the splendor of the eternal light.” Observe the splendor of the sun. The sun is in the heavens and pours its splendor on all the earth and over all the seas, yet its light is only corporeal. If you could separate the sun’s splendor from the sun itself, so also could you separate the Word from the Father. I have spoken of the sun. A weak little flame from a lamp, however, which can be blown out with a breath, also sheds its light all around. See the light given off by the flame. See that it originates from the flame—you do not see the light without the flame. Convince yourselves, then, beloved brothers and sisters, that the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit are inseparably united among themselves and that this Trinity is one God—and that all of the works of this one God are works of the Father, of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
