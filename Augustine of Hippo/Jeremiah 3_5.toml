To move away from that one simple and single good toward this multitude of pleasures, and to draw near to the love of the world and earthly corruptions, is what going whoring away from the Lord consists in. It is to such a one that he cries out, “You have acquired the face of a whore and become totally shameless.” - "Sermon 142.2"
