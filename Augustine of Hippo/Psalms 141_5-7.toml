This is the oil of the sinner with which the prophet does not want his head to be anointed, as he says: “The just person shall correct me in mercy and shall reprove me, but let not the oil of the sinner fatten my head.” Thus, he prefers to be corrected by the severe mercy of the just rather than to be praised by the soothing ointment of flattery. Whence, the prophet said, “They that call you blessed, the same deceive you.” Therefore, regarding a person whom false flattery has made arrogant, the popular saying states it correctly: “He has a swelled head”; that is, his head has been fattened by the oil of the sinner, and this is not the effect of the harsh truth of correction but of the soothing deceit of praise.

And again, he quotes as words of David, “Let not the oil of the sinner anoint my head,” when David has been speaking of the flattery of the smooth speaker deceiving with false praise, so as to cause the head of the person praised to become great with pride. And this meaning is made manifest by the words immediately preceding in the same psalm. For he says, “Let the righteous smite me. It shall be a kindness, and let him reprove me; but the oil of the sinner shall not break my head.” What can be clearer than this sentence? What more manifest? For he declares that he would rather be reproved in kindness with the sharp correction of the righteous, so that he may be healed, than anointed with the soft speaking of the flatterer, so as to be puffed up with pride.

This brother will bring you37 some things I have written. If you have the time to read them, please be completely candid and merciless in your criticism. The Bible reminds us, “The righteous shall correct me in compassion and reprove me, but the oil of the sinner shall not anoint my head.” This means that the real friend heals me by his criticism, but the false friend merely flatters me. I cannot be a fair critic of my own work because I am either too strict or not strict enough. For I sometimes see my own faults, but I would rather hear a better judge, just in case I begin to flatter myself after a harsh bit of self-criticism, because I decide I am too hard on myself.
