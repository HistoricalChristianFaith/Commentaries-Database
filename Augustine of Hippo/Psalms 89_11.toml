"The heavens are yours, the earth also is Yours" [Psalm 89:11]. From You, over Your earth they rain. Yours are the heavens, by whom is preached Your truth in circuit of You; "Yours is the earth," which has received Your truth in circuit of You; and what has resulted from that rain? "You have laid the foundation of the round world, and all that therein is."
