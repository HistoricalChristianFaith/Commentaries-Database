In your opinion, even those who are born foolish—whom sacred Scripture says should be pitied more than the dead—receive their foolishness as fate from God their creator. But even with these, God undoubtedly loves their souls in some way, because they exist, live and feel, and in any case they are greater than beasts, even if they are dull-minded souls. But that love is different, of which it is written, “God loves no one so much as the one who lives with wisdom.” You, however, ask why God has more love for the souls of babies, for whom he provides the washing of regeneration, sending them to the kingdom, and why would he not give this benefit to others, since babies have no merits of the will to distinguish them, nor is there preference of persons with God. This is a completely stupid argument, which you are always bringing up to us. That where it was said, “You love souls,” it did not say “all souls,” there is no question. Perhaps it was said this way in the sense that God creates all souls but loves only those whom he distinguishes from the others, not based on their merits but by the generosity of his grace, so that they might live with wisdom, as it is written, “God loves no one so much as the one who lives with wisdom—but the Lord gives the wisdom!”
