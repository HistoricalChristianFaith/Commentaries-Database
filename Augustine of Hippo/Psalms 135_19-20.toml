But daily do men believe through the miracles of Christ our Lord; daily the eyes of the blind, the ears of the deaf are opened, the nostrils of the senseless are breathed into, the tongues of the dumb are loosed, the hands of the palsied are strengthened, the feet of the lame are guided; sons of Abraham are raised up of these stones, [MatthewÂ 3:9] to all of whom be it said, "Bless the Lord, you house of Israel" [Psalm 135:19]. All are sons of Abraham; and if sons of Abraham are raised up from these stones, it is plain that they are rather the house of Israel who belong to the house of Israel, the seed of Abraham, not by the flesh, but by faith. But even granting that it is said of that house, and the people of Israel is meant, from thence did the Apostles and thousands of the circumcised believe? "Bless the Lord, you house of Aaron. Bless the Lord, you house of Levi" [Psalm 135:20]. Bless the Lord, you nations, this is, the "house of Israel" generally; bless Him, you leaders, this is, the "house of Aaron;" bless Him, you servants, this is, the "house of Levi." What of the other nations? "You that fear the Lord, bless the Lord."
