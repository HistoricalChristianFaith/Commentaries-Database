In order to attain that vision by which we see God as he is, he has warned us that our hearts must be cleansed. As objects are called visible in our fashion of speaking, so God is called invisible lest he be thought to be a material body. Yet he will not deprive pure hearts of the contemplation of his essence, since this great and sublime reward is promised, on the Lord’s own word, to those who worship and love God. At the time when he appeared visibly to bodily eyes, he promised that his invisible being also would be seen by the clean of heart, “He that loves me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him and will manifest myself to him.” It is certain that this nature of his, which he shares with the Father, is equally as invisible as it is equally incorruptible.

So this faith is also a rule for salvation, to “believe in God the Father almighty,” creator of all things, “king of the ages, immortal and invisible.” He is indeed the almighty God who at the origin of the world made all things out of nothing. He is before the ages and made and governs the ages. He doesn’t, after all, grow with time, or stretch out in space, nor is he shut in or bounded by any material. He abides with and in himself as full and perfect eternity, which neither human thought can comprehend nor tongue describe.

Let us hold firmly that Father and Son and Holy Spirit in their own proper nature, their proper substance, are together and equally invisible. We believe them to be together and equally immortal, together and equally imperishable. There is one place where the apostle states all these things simultaneously, “Now to the king of ages, immortal, invisible, imperishable, to the only God, be honor and glory for ever and ever. Amen.”
