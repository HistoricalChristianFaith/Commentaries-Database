Touching this title there is no question. "O Lord who shall sojourn in Your tabernacle?" [Psalm 15:1]. Although tabernacle be sometimes used even for an everlasting habitation: yet when tabernacle is taken in its proper meaning, it is a thing of war. Hence soldiers are called tent-fellows,  as having their tents together. This sense is assisted by the words, "Who shall sojourn?" For we war with the devil for a time, and then we need a tabernacle wherein we may refresh ourselves. Which specially points out the faith of the temporal Dispensation, which was wrought for us in time through the Incarnation of the Lord. "And who shall rest in Your holy mountain?" Here perhaps he signifies at once the eternal habitation itself, [2 Corinthians 5:1-2] that we should understand by "mountain" the supereminence of the love of Christ in life eternal.
