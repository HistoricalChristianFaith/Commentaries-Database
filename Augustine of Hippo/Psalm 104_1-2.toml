..."Bless the Lord, O my soul." Let the soul of us all, made one in Christ, say this. "O Lord my God, You are magnified exceedingly!" [Psalm 104:1]. Where are You magnified? "Confession and beauty You have put on." Confess ye, that you may be beautified, that He may put you on. "Clothed with light as a garment" [Psalm 104:2]. Clothed with His Church, because she is made "light" in Him, who before was darkness in herself, as the apostle says: "You were sometime darkness, but now light in the Lord." [EphesiansÂ 5:8] "Stretching out the heaven like a skin:" either as easily as thou dost a skin, if it be "as easily," so that you may take it after the letter; or let us understand the authority of the Scriptures, spread out over the whole world, under the name of a skin; because mortality is signified in a skin,  but all the authority of the Divine Scriptures was dispensed unto us through mortal men, whose fame is still spreading abroad now they are dead.
