"For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the face of Your Anointed" [Psalm 132:10]. These words are addressed unto God the Father. "For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the face of Your Anointed." The Lord was crucified in Judæa; He was crucified by the Jews; harassed by them, He slept. He arose to judge those among whose savage hands He slept: and He says elsewhere, "Raise Thou Me up again, and I shall reward them."  He both has rewarded them, and will reward them. The Jews well know themselves how great were their sufferings after the Lord's death. They were all expelled from the very city, where they slew Him. What then? Have all perished even from the root of David and from the tribe of Judah? No: for some of that stock believed, and in fact many thousands of men of that stock believed, and this after the Lord's resurrection. They raged and crucified Him: and afterwards began to see miracles wrought in the Name of Him Crucified; and they trembled still more that His Name should have so much power, since when in their hands He seemed unable to work any; and pricked at heart, at length believing that there was some hidden divinity in Him whom they had believed like other men, and asking counsel of the Apostles, they were answered, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the Name of our Lord Jesus Christ." [Acts 2:38] Since then Christ arose to judge those by whom He had been crucified, and turned away His Presence from the Jews, turning His Presence towards the Gentiles; God is, as it seems, besought in behalf of the remnant of Israel; and it is said unto Him, "For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the presence of Your Anointed." If the chaff be condemned, let the wheat be gathered together. May the remnant be saved, as Isaiah says, "And the remnant has" clearly "been saved:" [Isaiah 10:21-22] for out of them were the twelve Apostles, out of them more than five hundred brethren, to whom the Lord showed Himself after His Resurrection: [1 Corinthians 15:6] out of their number were so many thousands baptized, [Acts 2:41] who laid the price of their possessions at the Apostles' feet. Thus then was fulfilled the prayer here made to God: "For Your servant David's sake, turn not away the presence of Your Anointed."
