John is speaking here about himself. “As a man, I have only received” he said, “what I have from heaven.” … You also realize the kind of testimony I provided for him. And now I am supposed to say that he was not the one who I said he was? Because I received something from heaven in order to be something, do you want me now to throw out everything I have received by speaking against the truth?
