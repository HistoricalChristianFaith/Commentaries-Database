What are we going to do there? Tell me. Sleep? Yes, here people who have nothing to do just sleep. But there is no sleep there, because there is no weariness. So we aren’t going to perform works of necessity, aren’t going to sleep—what are we going to do? None of us must be afraid of boredom; none of us must imagine it’s going to be so boring there. Do you find it boring now to be well? You can get tired of anything and everything in this age; can you get tired of being well? If you don’t get tired of good health, will you get tired of immortality? So what activity are we going to engage in? “Amen” and “Alleluia.” Here, you see, we do one thing and another, there one thing, I don’t say day and night but day without end; what the powers of heaven, the seraphim, say now without ever getting bored: “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts.”
