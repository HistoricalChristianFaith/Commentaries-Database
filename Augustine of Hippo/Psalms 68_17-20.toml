Then there is the apostle Paul: “To each one of us,” he says, “is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ,” and to show that the gift of Christ is the Holy Spirit he went on to add, “That is why it says, he ascended on high, he took captivity captive, he gave gifts to people.” But it is public knowledge that when the Lord Jesus had ascended to heaven after his resurrection from the dead he gave the Holy Spirit; and being filled with it those who believed began to speak with the tongues of all people. And do not let it worry you that he says “gifts,” not “gift.” He was quoting the text from a psalm, and what we read in the psalm is, “you have ascended on high, you have taken captivity captive, you have received gifts among people.” This is the reading of most codices, especially the Greek ones, and we have it translated like this from the Hebrew. So the apostle said “gifts” just as the prophet did, not “gift”; but while the prophet said “you have received them among people,” the apostle preferred to say “he has given them to people,” in order that we might get the fullest meaning from both statements, the one prophetic, the other apostolic, since each has the authority of the divine utterance behind it.

[David] had expectations from God in line with the old covenant, not realizing that it contains signs of things to come—so he was expecting to receive good fortune in this life from God, and he was looking on this earth for what God is keeping for his people in heaven. He wanted to be happy here, though happiness is not to be found here. Happiness, you see, is of course something great and good, but it has its own proper region. It was from the region of happiness that Christ came, and not even he found it here. He was jeered at, he was reviled, he was arrested, he was scourged, he was bound, he was knocked about, insulted with spittle, he was crowned with thorns, hanged on a tree. And finally—“even for the Lord is the departure of death.” It is written in a psalm (those who caught the allusion applauded): “Even for the Lord is the departure of death.” So why, slave, do you seek happiness here, where even for the Lord is the departure of death?
