"And against Me they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together"  [Psalm 35:15], against Me only: they rejoicing, I sorrowful. But we heard just now in the Gospel, "Blessed are they that mourn." [MatthewÂ 5:5] If they are blessed that mourn, miserable are they that laugh. "Against Me they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: scourges were gathered together against Me, and they knew not."  Because they laid to My charge things that I knew not, they also knew not Whom they charged.
