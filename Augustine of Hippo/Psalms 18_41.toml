"They have cried out, and there was none to save them" [Psalm 18:41]. For who can save them, whom You would not save? "To the Lord, and He did not hear them." Nor did they cry out to any chance one, but to the Lord: and He did not judge them worthy of being heard, who depart not from their wickedness.
