The Lord adds, “Because they do not know the one who sent me.” These words are said concerning that knowledge about which it is written elsewhere, “To know you is perfect wisdom.” Those who have this knowledge of the Father, by whom Christ was sent, absolutely cannot persecute the ones whom Christ gathers, because they themselves, along with the others, have been gathered by Christ.
