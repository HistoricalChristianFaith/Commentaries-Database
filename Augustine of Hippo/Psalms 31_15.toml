"In Your hands" are "my lots" [Psalm 31:15]. In Your power are my lots. For I see no desert for which out of the universal ungodliness of the human race You have elected me particularly to salvation. And though there be with You some just and secret order in my election, yet I, from whom this is hid, have attained by lot unto my Lord's vesture. [JohnÂ 19:24] "Deliver me from the hands of mine enemies, and from them that persecute me."
