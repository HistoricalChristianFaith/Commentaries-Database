"Love the Lord, all you His saints" [Psalm 31:23]. The Prophet again exhorts, having sight of these things, and says, "Love the Lord, all you His saints; for the Lord will require truth." Since "if the righteous shall scarcely be saved, where shall the sinner and the ungodly appear?" [1 Peter 4:18] "And He will repay them that do exceeding proudly." And He will repay them who even when conquered are not converted, because they are very proud.
