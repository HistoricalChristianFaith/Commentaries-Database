As they were “looking on,” so we too gaze on his wounds as he hangs. We see his blood as he dies. We see the price offered by the redeemer, touch the scars of his resurrection. He bows his head, as if to kiss you. His heart is made bare open, as it were, in love to you. His arms are extended that he may embrace you. His whole body is displayed for your redemption. Ponder how great these things are. Let all this be rightly weighed in your mind: as he was once fixed to the cross in every part of his body for you, so he may now be fixed in every part of your soul.

How can we understand the same Mary Magdalene both to have stood afar off along with other women as the accounts of Matthew and Mark bear, and to have been by the cross, as John tells us? It could have been the case that these women were at such a distance as made it quite natural to say at once that they were near because they were at hand there in the sight of him, and yet afar off in comparison with the crowd of people who were standing round about in closer vicinity along with the centurion and the soldiers. It is open for us, then, to suppose that those women who were present at the scene along with the Lord’s mother, after he commended her to the disciple, began then to retire with the view of extricating themselves from the dense mass of people, and from a greater distance looking on at what remained to be done.
