"For the Lord has hearkened to the poor" [Psalm 69:33]. He has hearkened to the poor, and He would not have hearkened to the poor, unless they were poor. Will you be hearkened to? Poor be thou: let sorrow cry out from you, and not fastidiousness. "And His fettered ones He has not despised." Being offended at His servants, He has put them in fetters: but them crying from the fetters He has not despised. What are these fetters? Mortality, the corruptibleness of the flesh are the fetters wherewith we have been bound. And would ye know the weight of these fetters? Of them is said, "The body which is corrupted weighs down the soul." [Wisdom 9:15] Whenever men in the world will to be rich, for these fetters they are seeking rags. But let the rags of the fetters suffice: seek so much as is necessary for keeping off want, but when you seek superfluities, you long to load your fetters. In such a prison then let the fetters abide even alone. "Sufficient for the day be the evil thereof." [Matthew 6:34] "Let there praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping in them" [Psalm 69:34]. The true riches of this poor man are these, to consider the creation, and to praise the Creator. "Let there praise Him heavens and earth, sea and all things creeping therein." And does this creation alone praise God, when by considering of it God is praised?
