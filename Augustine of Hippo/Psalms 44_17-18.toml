"All this has come upon us; yet have we not forgotten You" [Psalm 44:17]. What is meant by, "have not forgotten You"? "Neither have we behaved ourselves frowardly in Your covenant."

"Our heart has not turned back; and You have turned aside our goings out of Your way" [Psalm 44:18]. See here is "understanding," in that "our heart has not gone back;" that we have not "forgotten You, have not behaved frowardly in Your covenant;" placed as we are in great tribulations, and persecutions of the Gentiles. "You have turned aside our goings out of Your way." Our "goings" were in the pleasures of the world; our "goings" were in the midst of temporal prosperities. You have taken "our goings out of Your way;" and hast shown us  how "strait and narrow is the way that leads unto life." [Matthew 7:14] What is meant by, "hast turned aside our goings out of Your way"? It is as if He said, You are placed in the midst of tribulation; you are suffering many things; you have already lost many things that you loved in this life: but I have not abandoned you on the way, the narrow way that I am teaching you. You were seeking "broad ways." What do I tell you? This is the way we go to everlasting life; by the way ye wish to walk, you are going to death. How "broad and wide is the road that leads to destruction: and" how "many there be that find it! How strait and narrow the way that leads unto life, and" how "few there be" that walk therein! [Matthew 7:13-14] Who are the few? They who patiently endure tribulations, patiently endure temptations; who in all these troubles do not "fall away:" who do not rejoice in the word "for a season" only; and in the time of tribulation fade away, as on the sun's arising; but who have the "root" of "love," according to what we have lately heard read in the Gospel.. ..
