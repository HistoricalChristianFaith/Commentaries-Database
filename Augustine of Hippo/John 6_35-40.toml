(Tr. xxv. 14) He that cometh to Me, i. e. that believeth on Me, shall never hunger, has the same meaning as shall never thirst; both signifying that eternal society, where there is no want.

(Tr. xxv. 14) Ye desire bread from heaven: but, though you have it before you, you eat it not. This is what I told you: But I said unto you, that ye also have seen Me, and believe not.

(Tr. xxv. 14) But, because ye have seen Me, and believed not, I have not therefore lost the people of God: All that the Father giveth Me, shall come unto Me; and him that cometh to Me, I will in no wise cast out.

(Tr. xxv. 14) That inner place, whence there is no casting out, is a great sanctuary, a secret chamber, where is neither weariness, or the bitterness of evil thoughts, or the cross of pain and temptation: of which it is said, Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. (Mat. 25)

(Tr. xxv. 15) This is the reason why He does not cast out those who come to Him. For I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. The soul departed from God, because it was proud. Pride casts us out, humility restores us. When a physician in the treatment of a disease, cures certain outward symptoms, but not the cause which produces them, his cure is only temporary. So long as the cause remains, the disease may return. That the cause then of all diseases, i. e. pride, might be eradicated, the Son of God humbled Himself. Why art thou proud, O man? The Son of God humbled Himself for thee. It might shame thee, perhaps, to imitate a humble man; but imitate at least a humble God. And this is the proof of His humility: I came not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. Pride does its own will; humility the will of God.

(Tr. xxv in Joan. 16) For this very reason therefore, I will not cast out Him that cometh to Me; because I came not to do Mine own will. I came to teach humility, by being humble Myself. He that cometh to Me, is made a member of Me, and necessarily humble, because He will not do His own will, but the will of God; and therefore is not cast out. He was cast out, as proud; he returns to Me humble, he is not sent away, except for pride again; he who keeps his humility, falleth not from the truth. And further, that He does not cast out such, because He came not to do His will, He shows when He says, And this is the Father's will which hath sent Me, that of all which He hath given Me, I should lose nothing. (Mat. 18:14) Every one of an humble mind is given to Him: It is not the will of your Father, that one of these little ones should perish. The swelling ones may perish; of the little ones none can; for except ye be as a little child, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven. (Mat. 18:3, 5)

(de Cor. et Gratia, c. ix) They therefore who by God's unerring providence are foreknown, and predestined, called, justified, glorified, even before their new birth, or before they are born at all, are already the sons of God, and cannot possibly perish; these are they who truly come to Christ. By Him there is given also perseverance in good unto the end; which is given only to those who will not perish. Those who do not persevere will perish.

(Tr. xxv. 19) See how the twofold resurrection is expressed here. He who cometh to Me, shall forthwith rise again; by becoming humble, and a member of Me. But then He proceeds; But I will raise him up at the last day. To explain the words, All that the Father hath given Me, and, I should lose nothing, He adds; And this is the will of Him that hath sent Me, that every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up at the last day. Above He said, Whoso heareth My word, and believeth on Him that sent Me: (c. 5:24) now it is, Every one which seeth the Son, and believeth on Him. He does not say, believe on the Father, because it is the same thing to believe on the Father, and on the Son; for as the Father hath life in Himself, even so hath He given to the Son to have life in Himself; and again, That whoso seeth the Son and believeth on Him, should have everlasting life: i. e. by believing, by passing over to life, as at the first resurrection. But this is only the first resurrection, He alludes to the second when He says, And I will raise him up at the last day.

"And Jesus said unto them, I am the bread of life: he that cometh to me, shall never hunger, and he that believeth on me, shall never thirst." "He that cometh to me," is the same as, "he that believeth in me;" and "shall never hunger," the same thing as "shall never thirst:" by both is signified that eternal fulness, where is no want. Ye desire the bread from heaven; ye have it before you, and ye eat not.

"All that the Father giveth me, shall come unto me, and him that cometh to me, I will in nowise cast out." What is this interior, whither or from whence he is not cast out who hath come thither? A great secret this interior is, a sweet mystery: O interior without weariness, without the bitterness of evil thoughts, without the interruption of temptations and sorrows! Is it not that interior, of which it was said to that servant of God who rejoiced, "Enter thou into the joy of thy Lord"? This interior is that into which the Lord Jesus brings him whom He casts not out.

Let us hear also why He doth not cast out him that cometh: "For I came down from heaven, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." Therefore dost Thou not cast out him that cometh, because Thou camest down from heaven, not to do Thine own will, but the will of Him that sent Thee? Explain, tell us: why is this the reason why Thou castest not out him that cometh to Thee? Pride casteth out, humility casteth not out. Wherefore pride casteth out: because it doeth its own will. Wherefore humility casteth not out: "because I came, not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." For that cause did the Lord deign in this place to commend humility to us. Our soul departed from God when proud: we return to God when humble. Even as in a disease, when any humor abounding in the body breaks through the skin, they say that the disease has come out; but there is no healing, unless that which burst forth externally return inward and become sound: so did our soul break out by swelling, and was as it were in wound and ulcer of pride. She was cast out of Paradise; and because wounded in the inner man by pride, she was cast into a mortal body, and thereby drank in dissolution, and learnt to love pride: in pride could she not return. That she might return, the Lord came to her, Himself without any sin, neither with any tumor of pride; and He came to die and pay His death for our sins, that humbled she might return, who proud was cast out.

For He Himself teaches us humility by doing, not His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him. Art thou proud, O man? and God humbled Himself. Perchance thou wouldest be ashamed to imitate a humble man: at least imitate the humble God. God's Son came in man, and was made humble. It is enjoined thee to be humble, not to become a brute: He, God, was made man; thou, O man, acknowledge that thou art man; all thy humility is, to know thyself.

Since therefore God teaches humility, He saith, "I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." For this is pride, to do one's own will: for humility, to do the will of God. Wherefore, "him that cometh to me, I will not cast out." Why? "Because I came not to do mine own will, but the will of Him that sent me." I came humble, I came to teach humility, I came a master of humility: he that cometh to me, is incorporated with me; he that cometh to me becomes humble; he that cleaveth to me will be humble; because he doth, not his own will, but the will of God; and therefore he is not cast out, because when he was proud he was cast out.
