It was that very John whose Gospel is before us, as he afterward expressly declares. For it was a custom of the sacred writer, when he came to anything relating to himself, to speak of himself as if he were speaking of another. He would give himself a place in the flow of the narrative so that he became one who was the recorder of public events rather than making himself the subject of his preaching. Matthew also acted this way. … For what does truth lose by the omission of boasting on the writer’s part, as long as the facts themselves are told?
