But in all these blessings of His, God does commend in Abraham the merit of faith. For the Psalmist goes on to say, "For why? He remembered His holy promise, which He made to Abraham His servant" [Psalm 105:42]. "And He brought forth His people with joy, and His chosen with gladness" [Psalm 105:43]. What he said, "His people," he has repeated in, "His chosen." So also what he said, "with joy," he has repeated in, "with gladness." "And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they took the labours of the people in possession" [Psalm 105:44]. "The lands of the heathen," and "the labours of the people," are the same; and the words, "He gave," are repeated in these, "they took in possession."
