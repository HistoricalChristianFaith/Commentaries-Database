So then, what kind of consideration does the doubting of Moses demand of us?… Moses doubted when the wood came into contact with the rock. …The disciples doubted when they saw the Lord crucified. He came to them after his resurrection, as they were talking to each other about this matter in a sad conversation. He kept their eyes from recognizing him, not in order to remove himself from believers but to put them off while they were still doubters. He joined in their conversation as a third party and asked them what they were talking about. They were astonished that he should be the only person not to know what had happened—to the very man, in fact, who was asking about it. “Are you,” they said, “the only stranger in Jerusalem?” And they went over all that had happened to Jesus. Straightaway they proceeded to open up all the depth of their despair and, although unwittingly, they showed the doctor their wounds: “We had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.” The doubt arose because wood had come into contact with the rock. What Moses figuratively stood for was fulfilled.

Recognition, though, happened only when Jesus opened up the Scriptures for them, because they had given up hope and said, “But we had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.” O my dear disciples, you had hoped, now you don’t hope? Come here, robber, give the disciples a lesson. Why have you given up hope, just because you have seen him crucified, because you’ve looked at him hanging there, because you have thought him weak? He was like that for the robber too, hanging on the cross beside him. The robber was sharing in his punishment but he believed straightaway and acknowledged him, while you on the other hand have forgotten he is the author of life. Cry out, robber, from the cross! You, a criminal, win over the saints! What did they say? “We had hoped that he was the one to redeem Israel.” What did this man say? “Jesus, remember me, when you come in your kingdom.” So you had hoped, had you, that it was he who would redeem Israel? O my dear disciples, if he was the one that was going to redeem Israel, it means you have defected. But he has reinstated you; he didn’t abandon you. By becoming your companion on the way, he himself became for you the way.
