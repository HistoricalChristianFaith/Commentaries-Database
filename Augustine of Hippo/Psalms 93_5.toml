"Your testimonies, O Lord, are very surely believed" [Psalm 93:5]. The Lord, who dwells on high, is mightier than the mighty overhangings of the sea. "Your testimonies are very surely believed." "Your testimonies," because He had said beforehand, "These things I have spoken unto you, that in Me ye might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation."...He added, "but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world." [John 16:33] If then He says, "I have overcome the world," cling unto Him who overcame the world, who overcame the sea. Rejoice in Him, because the Lord, who dwells on high, is mightier, and, "Your testimonies are very surely believed." And what is the end of all these? "Holiness becomes Your house, O Lord!" Your house, the whole of Your house, not here and there: but the whole of Your house, throughout the whole world. Why throughout the whole of the round world? "Because He has set aright the round world, which cannot be moved."  The Lord's house will be strong: it will prevail throughout the whole world: many shall fall: but that house stands; many shall be disturbed, but that house shall not be moved. Holiness becomes Your house, O Lord! For a short time only? No. "Unto length of days."
