What does it mean, then, that the younger was blessed in the guise of the elder, but that under the symbols of the Old Testament and its promise to the people of the Jews a spiritual blessing has lighted on the people of the Christians? Pay attention, brothers! They hear about the promised land, and so do we. Scripture seems to be speaking to the Jews about the promised land, and it is we who are blessed with the true understanding of the promised land, we who can say to God, “You are my hope, my portion in the land of the living.” But it is our mother who taught us to say this that is to say the church teaches us in the holy prophets how to understand spiritually these material promises.
