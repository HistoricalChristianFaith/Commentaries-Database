"Keep innocency" [Psalm 37:37]; keep it even as you used to keep your purse, when thou were covetous; even as you used to hold fast that purse, that it might not be snatched from your grasp by the thief, even so "keep innocency," lest that be snatched from your grasp by the devil. Be that your sure inheritance, of which the rich and the poor may both be sure. "Keep innocency." What does it profit you to gain gold, and to lose innocence?
