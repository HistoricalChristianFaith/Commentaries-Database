"You shall rule them with a rod of iron," with inflexible justice, and "You shall break them like a potter's vessel" [Psalm 2:9]; that is, "You shall break" in them earthly lusts, and the filthy doings of the old man, and whatsoever has been derived and inured from the sinful clay. "And now understand, you kings" [Psalm 2:10]. "And now;" that is, being now renewed, your covering of clay worn out, that is, the carnal vessels of error which belong to your past life, "now understand," you who now are "kings;" that is, able now to govern all that is servile and brutish in you, able now too to fight, not as "they who beat the air, but chastening your bodies, and bringing them into subjection." [1 Corinthians 9:26-27] "Be instructed, all you who judge the earth." This again is a repetition; "Be instructed" is instead of "understand;" and "you who judge the earth" instead of "you kings." For He signifies the spiritual by "those who judge the earth." For whatsoever we judge, is below us; and whatsoever is below the spiritual man, is with good reason called "the earth;" because it is defiled with earthly corruption.
