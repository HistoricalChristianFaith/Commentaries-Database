See what a fight we have with our dead sins, as that active soldier of Christ and faithful teacher of the church shows. For how is sin dead when it works many things in us while we struggle against it? What are these many things except foolish and harmful desires which plunge into death and destruction those who consent to them? And to bear them patiently and not to consent to them is a struggle, a conflict, a battle. .

He did not say: Those who are rich. He said: Those who seek to become rich…. The name of riches is, as it were, sweetsounding to the ear. But, “many vain and harmful desires”—does that sound sweet? To be “involved in many troubles”—does that sound sweet? Do not be so misled by one false good that you will thereby cling to many real evils.
