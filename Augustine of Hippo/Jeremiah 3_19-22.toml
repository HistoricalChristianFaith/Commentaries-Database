Through the prophet the Lord speaks and declares with his own gracious words how much mercy and goodness he wishes to bestow on humankind. He says, “But if the wicked do penance for all his sins, which he has committed, and keeps all my commandments and does justice and mercy, living he shall live, and shall not die. I will not remember all his iniquities that he has done. In his justice, which he has done, he shall live.” And, “Is it my will that a sinner should die,” says the Lord God, “and not that he should be converted from his evil ways, and I shall cause him to live?” In another passage we find, “The wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him on the day that he turns from his wickedness.” And again: “Return, you returning children, and I will heal your sorrow.”
