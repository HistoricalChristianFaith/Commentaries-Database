They were not reborn, those who were baptized by John’s baptism, by which Christ himself was baptized. Rather, they were “prepared” by the ministry of a forerunner, who said, “Prepare a way for the Lord”—for him in whom alone they could be reborn.

John [the Baptist] was filled with the Holy Spirit; and he had a baptism from heaven, not from human beings. But how long did he have it? He said, “Prepare the way for the Lord.” But when the Lord was known, he himself became the way; there was no longer need for the baptism of John, by which the way was to be prepared for the Lord.

There it is written, “a voice of one crying in the wilderness,” the Word is conceived in the virgin’s womb. If the voice is not the Word, it is then a loud clanging of metal. For one then would not be able to say that every word is a sound but not every sound is a word. For it is not unfitting to take “the way” as that which came up to the very heart and filled us inwardly. Indeed, the heart became his place to which he comes and remains.
