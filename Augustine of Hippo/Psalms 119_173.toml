"Let Your hand be stretched forth (fiat, be made) to save me, for I have chosen Your commandments" [Psalm 119:173]. That I might not fear, and that not only might my heart hold fast, but my tongue also utter Your words: "I have chosen Your commandments," and have stifled fear with love. Let Your hand therefore be stretched forth, to save me from another's hand. Thus God saved the Martyrs, when He permitted them not to be slain in their souls: for "vain is the safety of man" in the flesh. The words, "Let Your hand be made," may also be taken to mean Christ the Hand of God.
