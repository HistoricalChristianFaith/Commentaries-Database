"Whose sons are like young vines firmly planted in their youth" [Psalm 144:12]. He wishes to recount their happiness. Observe, you sons of light, sons of peace: observe, you sons of the Church, members of Christ; observe whom he calls "strangers," whom he calls "strange children," whom he calls "waters of contradiction," whom he calls a "sword of ill intent." Observe, I beseech you, for among them you are in peril, among their tongues ye fight against the desires of your flesh, among their tongues, set in the hand of the devil wherewith he fights. [Ephesians 6:12] ...What vanity has their mouth spoken, and how is their right hand a right hand of iniquity? "Their daughters are fitted and adorned after the similitude of a temple."
