So there were sheep from among the Jews, and many sheep. But not the only ones. The Lord had others from among the Gentiles. These two peoples coming as it were from different directions are also represented by two walls. The church of the Jews comes from the circumcision; the church of the Gentiles comes from the uncircumcision. Coming from different directions, they are joined together in the Lord. That is why the Lord is called the cornerstone. Thus the psalm says, “The stone that the builders rejected, this very one has become the head of the corner.” And the apostle says, “Christ Jesus being himself the chief cornerstone.” Where there is a corner, two walls connect; two walls do not meet in a corner unless they come from different directions; if they only come from one direction, they do not make a corner. So then, the two goats are the two peoples, so are the two sheepfolds, so are the two walls, so are the two blind men who sat by the road, so are the two boats into which the fish were hauled. There are many places in Scripture where the two peoples are to be understood—but they are one thing in Jacob.

A symbolic statement: “The stone that the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner.” If we understand “stone” in the proper sense, what stone did the builders reject, and it became the head of the corner? If we take “corner” in the proper sense, of what corner did this stone become the head? If we admit it is said symbolically, and you take it symbolically, the cornerstone is Christ, head of the corner, head of the church. Why is the corner the church? Because he called the Jews from this side, the Gentiles from that; and like two walls coming from different directions and coming together in him, he tied them together by the grace of his peace. “For he is our peace, who made of both one.”
