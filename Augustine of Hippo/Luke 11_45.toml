But the key of knowledge is also the humility of Christ, which they would neither themselves understand, nor let be understood by others.
Now all these things Matthew records to have been said after our Lord had come into Jerusalem. But Luke relates them here, when our Lord was yet on His journey to Jerusalem. From which they appear to me to be similar discourses, of which Matthew has given one, Luke the other.
