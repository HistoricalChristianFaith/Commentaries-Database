"You are terrible, and who shall withstand You at that time by Your anger?" [Psalm 76:7]. Now they sleep, and perceive not You angry; but for cause that they should sleep, He was angry. Now that which sleeping they perceived not, at the end they shall perceive. For there shall appear the Judge of quick and dead. "And who shall withstand You at that time by Your anger?" For now they speak that which they will, and they dispute against God and say, who are the Christians? Or who is Christ? Or what fools are they that believe that which they see not, and relinquish the pleasures which they see, and follow the faith of things which are not displayed to their eyes! You sleep and snore,  ye speak against God, as much as you are able. "How long shall sinners, O Lord, how long shall sinners glory, they answer and will speak iniquity?"  But when does no one answer and no one speak, except when he turns himself  against himself?...
