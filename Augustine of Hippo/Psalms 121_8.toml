"May the Lord protect your coming in and your going out." Now look at the coming out of the furnace and the going into it; "Reckon it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various trials." There you are, you have heard about the entrance; now find the exit. It is easy enough to go in; coming out is the big thing. But do not worry: "God is faithful"—because you have gone in, you are naturally thinking about getting out—"God is faithful and does not allow you to be tempted above what you are able to bear, but with the temptation he will also make a way out." What is the way out? "That you may be able to endure." You have gone in, you have fallen in, you have endured, you have come out.

"The Lord preserve your going out and your coming in, from this time forth for evermore" [Psalm 121:8]. Not your body; for the Martyrs were consumed in the body: but "the Lord preserve your soul;" for the Martyrs yielded not up their souls. The persecutors raged against Crispina, whose birthday we are today celebrating; they were raging against a rich and delicate woman: but she was strong, for the Lord was her defence upon the hand of her right hand. He was her Keeper. Is there any one in Africa, my brethren, who knows her not? For she was most illustrious, noble in birth, abounding in wealth: but all these things were in her left hand, beneath her head. An enemy advanced to strike her head, and the left hand was presented to him, which was under her head. Her head was above, the right hand embraced her from above.
