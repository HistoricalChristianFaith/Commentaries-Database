“May the Lord protect your coming in and your going out.” Now look at the coming out of the furnace and the going into it; “Reckon it all joy, my brothers, when you fall into various trials.” There you are, you have heard about the entrance; now find the exit. It is easy enough to go in; coming out is the big thing. But do not worry: “God is faithful”—because you have gone in, you are naturally thinking about getting out—“God is faithful and does not allow you to be tempted above what you are able to bear, but with the temptation he will also make a way out.” What is the way out? “That you may be able to endure.” You have gone in, you have fallen in, you have endured, you have come out.
