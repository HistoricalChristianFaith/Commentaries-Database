The Evangelist has expressed himself cautiously. He does not say “struck” or “wounded” but “opened his side.” Here was opened the gate of life from which the sacraments of the church flowed without which we cannot enter into that life that is the true life: “And there came out blood and water.” That blood was shed for the remission of sins. That water tempers the cup of salvation. This was prefigured when Noah was commanded to make a door in the side of the ark by which the animals that were not to perish by the deluge entered. These animals prefigured the church. To foreshadow this, the woman was made out of the side of the sleeping man. For this second Adam bowed his head and slept on the cross, so that out of that which came, there might be formed a wife for him.
