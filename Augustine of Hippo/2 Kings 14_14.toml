The Almighty, who cannot possibly will anything unjust, is able to set in motion even the inclinations of their will in people’s hearts in order to accomplish through these people whatever he wishes to achieve through their agency. What meaning can these words have that the man of God addressed to King Amaziah: “Do not allow the army of Israel to go out with you, for the Lord is not with Israel and all the children of Ephraim. And if you think to prevail over them, God will put you to flight before your enemies; for it belongs to God both to help and to put to flight”?
How does the power of God help some in war by giving them confidence and turns others to flight by instilling them with fear, except for this reason, that he who has made all things as he willed in heaven and on earth, also works in the human hearts? We also read of what Joash, king of Israel, said when he dispatched a messenger to King Amaziah, who had a mind to go to war with him. Having mentioned certain things, he went on to say, “Sit at home. Why do you provoke evil that you should fall and Judah with you?” The Scripture then went on to add, “And Amaziah would not listen to him because it was the Lord’s will that he should be delivered into the hands of enemies because he sought after the gods of Edom.”
There you see how God, wishing to punish the sin of idolatry, influenced the heart of this man with whom he was justly angry, that he would not heed salutary advice but, in his contempt for it, would engage in battle, there to perish together with his army. - "On Grace and Free Will 21.42"
