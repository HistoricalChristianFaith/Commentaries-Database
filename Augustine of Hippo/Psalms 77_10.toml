"And I said." Now leaping over himself he has said what? "Now I have begun:" [Psalm 77:10], when I had gone out even from myself. Here henceforth there is no danger: for even to remain in myself, was danger. "And I said, Now I have begun: this is the changing of the right hand of the Lofty One." Now the Lofty One has begun to change me: now I have begun something wherein I am secure: now I have entered a certain palace  of joys, wherein no enemy is to be feared: now I have begun to be in that region, where all mine enemies do not anticipate watches. "Now I have begun: this is the changing of the right hand of the Lofty One."
