If we consider who it was that received the blow, might we not well feel the wish that he who struck it were either consumed by fire from heaven, or swallowed up by the gaping earth, or seized and carried off by devils or visited with some other or still heavier punishment of this kind? For couldn’t the one who made the world have commanded any one of these to happen by his power, unless he wanted rather to teach us the patience that overcomes the world? Someone will say here, Why didn’t he do what he himself commanded? He should not have answered the one who struck him but should have instead turned to him the other cheek. But he actually goes further than this. Didn’t he answer truthfully, meekly and righteously, and at the same time prepare not only his other cheek for him who was going to strike it again, but in fact his whole body to be nailed to the tree? In this way he showed what needed to be shown, namely, that those great precepts of his are to be fulfilled not outwardly or ostentatiously but by the preparation of the heart. For even an angry person may visibly hold out his other cheek. How much better, then, is it for one who is peaceful to make a truthful answer and with tranquil mind hold himself ready for the endurance of heavier sufferings to come? Happy is the one who, in all that he suffers unjustly for righteousness’ sake, can truthfully say, “My heart is ready, O God, my heart is ready.” For this is what makes it possible to say, “I will sing and give praise.”
