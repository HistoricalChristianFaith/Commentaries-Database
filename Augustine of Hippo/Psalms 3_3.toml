"But You, O Lord, art my taker."  It is said to God in the nature of man, for the taking of man is, the Word made Flesh. "My glory." Even He calls God his glory, whom the Word of God so took, that God became one with Him. Let the proud learn, who unwillingly hear, when it is said to them, "For what have you that you did not receive? Now if you received it, why do you glory as if you had not received it?" [1 Corinthians 4:7] "And the lifter up of my head" [Psalm 3:3]. I think that this should be here taken of the human mind, which is not unreasonably called the head of the soul;  which so inhered in, and in a sort coalesced with, the supereminent excellency of the Word taking man, that it was not laid aside by so great humiliation of the Passion.
