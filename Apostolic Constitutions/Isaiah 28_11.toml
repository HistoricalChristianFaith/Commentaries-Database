It is not therefore necessary that every one of the faithful should cast out demons or raise the dead or speak with tongues, but such a one only who is graciously given this gift. For [it may contribute] to the salvation of the unbelievers, who are often put to shame not with the demonstration of the world but by the power of the signs, that is, such as are worthy of salvation. For all the ungodly are not affected by wonders, and hereof God is a witness, as when he says in the law: “With other tongues will I speak to this people, and with other lips, and yet will they by no means believe.” For neither did the Egyptians believe in God, when Moses had done so many signs and wonders; nor did the multitude of the Jews believe in Christ, as they believed Moses, who yet had healed every sickness and every disease among them.
