Now concerning the several sorts of food, the Lord says to you, “You shall eat the good things of the earth,” and “All sorts of flesh shall you eat, as the green herb,” but “You shall pour out the blood.” For “not those things that go into the mouth, but those that come out of it, defile a man.” “I mean blasphemies, evil speaking, and if there be any other thing like that. But “do you eat the fat of the land with righteousness.” For “if anything be pleasant, it is his; and if there be anything good, it is his: wheat for the young men, and wine to cheer the maids.” For “who shall eat or who shall drink without him?” Wise Ezra does also admonish you and says, “Go your way, and eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and do not be sorrowful.”
