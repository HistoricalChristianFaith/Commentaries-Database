Now the way of peace is our Saviour Jesus Christ, who has taught us, saying: "Forgive, and ye shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be given to you; ".
For to yon this is not entrusted; for, on the contrary, it is said to those who are not of the dignity of magistrates or ministers: "Judge not, and ye shall not be judged.".
For the Lord says: "With what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged; and as you condemn, you shall be condemned."
