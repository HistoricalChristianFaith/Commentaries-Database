Let your prayers be made at “the third hour”; for then it was that Pilate gave sentence upon our Lord and savior to have him crucified…. Let your prayers be made also at the sixth hour; for at that time he was crucified…. We observe also “the ninth hour” of prayer; for at that time the sun was darkened and the earth shaken with horror, as being not able to look upon those bitter cruelties.
