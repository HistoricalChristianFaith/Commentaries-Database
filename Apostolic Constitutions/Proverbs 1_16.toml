It is not fair to be too hasty in casting out an offender but slow in receiving him when he returns; to be forward in cutting off but unmerciful when he is sorrowful and ought to be healed. For of such as these speaks the divine Scripture: “Their feet run to mischief; they are hasty to shed blood.” … Now the way of peace is our Savior Jesus Christ, who has taught us, saying, “Forgive, and you shall be forgiven. Give, and it shall be given to you,” that is, give remission of sins, and your offenses shall be forgiven you. .
