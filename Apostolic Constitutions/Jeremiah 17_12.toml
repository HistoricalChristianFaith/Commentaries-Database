He has taken away from the ungodly the Holy Spirit and the prophetic rain and has replenished his church with spiritual grace, as the “river of Egypt in the time of firstfruits,” and has advanced the same as a house on a hill or as a high mountain, as a mountain fruitful for milk and fatness, where God is pleased to dwell. “For the Lord will dwell there to the end.” And he says in Jeremiah: “A glorious throne set on high from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.” And he says in Isaiah: “And it shall come to pass in the last days that the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and the house of the Lord shall be on the top of the mountains and shall be exalted above the hills.”
