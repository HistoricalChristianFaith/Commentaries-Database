We further pray to Thee for me, who am nothing, who offer to Thee, for the whole presbytery, for the deacons and all the clergy, that Thou wilt make them wise, and replenish them with the Holy Spirit. We further pray to Thee, O Lord, "for the king and all in authority".
Let us pray "for kings and those in authority "that they may be peaceable toward us, "that so we may have and lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and honesty."
