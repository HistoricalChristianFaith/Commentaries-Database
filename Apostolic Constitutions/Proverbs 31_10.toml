A religious wife is blessed. Let her praise the fear of the Lord: give her of the fruits of her lips, and let her husband be praised in the gates. And again, “A virtuous wife is a crown to her husband.” And again, “Many wives have built a house.” You have learned what great commendations a prudent and loving wife receives from the Lord God. .
