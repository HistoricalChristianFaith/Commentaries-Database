“The souls of those that bear a settled hatred are to death,” says Solomon. But our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ says in the gospels: “If you bring your gift to the altar, and there remember that your brother has anything against you, leave there your gift before the altar, and go your way; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift to God.” .
