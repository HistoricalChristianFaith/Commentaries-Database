If in a small parish one advanced in years is not to be found, let some younger person who has a good report among his neighbors and is esteemed by them worthy of the office of a bishop—who has carried himself from his youth with meekness and regularity, like a much elder person—after examination and a general good report, be ordained in peace.… Joash governed the people at seven years of age. Wherefore, although the person is young, let him be meek, gentle and quiet.
