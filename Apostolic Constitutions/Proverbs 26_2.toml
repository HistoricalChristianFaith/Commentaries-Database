“As birds and sparrows fly away, so the curse causeless shall not come upon any one.” And again [Solomon] says, “Those that bring reproaches are exceedingly foolish.” But as the bee, a creature as to its strength feeble, if it stings anyone, loses its sting and becomes a drone; in the same manner you also, whatsoever injustice you do to others, will bring it upon yourselves. .
