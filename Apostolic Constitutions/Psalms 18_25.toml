Therefore, O bishop, together with your subordinate clergy, endeavor rightly to divide the Word of truth. For the Lord says, “If you walk cross-grained to me, I will walk cross-grained to you.” … Walk therefore in holiness, that you may rather appear worthy of praise from the Lord than of complaint from the adversary.
