Be careful, therefore, O bishop, to study the Word, that you may be able to explain everything exactly and that you may copiously nourish your people with much doctrine and enlighten them with the light of the law. For God says, “Enlighten yourselves with the light of knowledge, while we have yet opportunity.”
