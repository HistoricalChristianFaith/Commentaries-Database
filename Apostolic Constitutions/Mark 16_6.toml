The resurrection in which we believe is that which has already been demonstrated in the resurrection of our Lord. For it is he that raised Lazarus after he had been in the grave four days, and Jairus’ daughter, and the widow’s son. It is he that raised himself by the command of the Father in the space of three days, who is the pledge of our resurrection. For he says: “I am the resurrection and the life.” Now the very One who brought Jonah alive and unhurt out of the belly of the whale in the space of three days, and who brought the three children out of the furnace of Babylon and Daniel out of the mouth of the lions, does not lack power to raise us up also.
