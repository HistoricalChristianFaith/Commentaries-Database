The one who made the body of Adam out of the earth will raise up the bodies of the rest, and that of the first man, after their decay … He, therefore, who brings about that decay will himself bring about the resurrection. And he who said, “The Lord took dust from the ground, and formed man and breathed into his face the breath of life, and man became a living soul,” added after humanity’s disobedience, “Earth you are, and to earth you shall return.” This same one promised us resurrection afterwards, for he says, “All that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those that hear shall live.”
