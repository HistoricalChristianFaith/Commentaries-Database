Be subject to all governmental power and dominion in things which are pleasing to God, as to the ministers of God and the punishers of the ungodly. Render all the fear that is due to them, all offerings, all customs, all honor, gifts and taxes. For this is God’s command, that you owe nothing to anyone but the pledge of love, which God has commanded by Christ.
