Hear this, you of the laity also, the elect Church of God. For the people were formerly called "the people of God," [Exodus 19:5-6] and "an holy nation." [Hebrews 12:23] You, therefore, are the holy and sacred "Church of God, enrolled in heaven, a royal priesthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people," [1 Peter 2:9] a bride adorned for the Lord God, a great Church, a faithful Church.
