But if any one is in want by gluttony, drunkenness or idleness, he does not deserve any assistance or to be esteemed a member of the church of God. For the Scripture, speaking of such persons, says, “The slothful hides his hand in his bosom and is not able to bring it to his mouth again.” And again, “The sluggard folds up his hands, and eats his own flesh.” “For every drunkard and whoremonger shall come to poverty, and every drowsy person shall be clothed with tatters and rags.” And in another passage [we read], “If you give your eyes to drinking and cups, you shall afterwards walk more naked than a pestle.” For certainly idleness is the mother of famine. .
