If the Lord of heaven and earth underwent all his sufferings for us, how then do you make a difficulty to minister to such as are in want, who ought to imitate him who underwent servitude, and want, and stripes and the cross for us? We ought therefore also to serve the brethren, in imitation of Christ. For says he, “He who will be great among you, let him be your minister; and he who will be first among you, let him be your servant.” For so did he really, and not in word only, fulfill the prediction of “serving many faithfully.”
