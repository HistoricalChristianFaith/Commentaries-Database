For this Church is the daughter of the Highest, which has been in travail of you by the word of grace, and has "formed Christ in you "of whom you are made partakers, and thereby become His holy and chosen members, "not having spot or wrinkle, or any such thing; but as being holy and unspotted in the faith, ye are complete in Him, after the image of God that created you."
