You shall not be a hypocrite, lest your “portion be with them.” You shall not be ill-natured or proud, for “God resists the proud.” “You shall not accept persons in judgment; for the judgment is the Lord’s.” “You shall not hate any man; you shall surely reprove your brother, and not become guilty on his account”; and, “Reprove a wise man, and he will love you.” Eschew all evil, and all that is like it: for he says, “Abstain from injustice, and trembling shall not come close to you.” Do not grow angry quickly, or spiteful, or passionate, or furious or daring, lest you undergo the fate of Cain, and of Saul and of Joab. The first of these killed his brother Abel, because Abel was found to be preferred before him with God, and because Abel’s sacrifice was preferred; the second persecuted holy David, who had slain Goliath the Philistine, being envious of the praises of the women who danced; the third killed two generals of armies—Abner of Israel and Amasa of Judah.
