This most celebrated Virgin was of David’s seed, from which her husband also drew his descent. In fact, according to the great apostle, “Man is the head of the woman,” and, according to Moses law, “The two shall become one flesh.” And if the married woman who has offended her husband pays the punishment for adultery according to the Law—as by now she has become the body of the husband and has chosen the man as her head—how, then, does it not follow that, once the genealogy of the head is traced, the body is also counted together with the head? As a consequence it was also necessary in this case that the Virgin, being united with Joseph, was conveniently included in his genealogy, just as we have demonstrated that she was born of the same tribe as he—yes, from the very clan and family of David. And therefore also Gabriel foretold in the prophecy addressed to her, among other things: “And the Lord God shall give him the throne of his father David.” And what did he teach through this? That David was the forefather of him who was to be born from her. And how would it have been possible that the angel conveniently manifested these things to the Virgin, if not with the clear recognition that she descended from David? Indeed, if she had not been a descendent of David, he would not have said, “God shall give him the throne of his father David.” And had it not been clear that what he said was addressed to a daughter of David’s, the Virgin could have rightly asked, “Of which father?” since she knew that she had not known a man. She then learned that she would conceive through the Holy Spirit. Therefore Luke rightly says, “Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the city of Nazareth, to Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be enrolled with Mary, his betrothed, who was with child.” We, then, having this interpretation ever since it came to light, no longer read this discourse ambiguously, as if Mary had only come to be enrolled together with him. Rather, it was because she also was of the house and the family of David. I believe that it has been clearly demonstrated that the genealogy of Joseph has not been uselessly traced by the divine Evangelists, because as a consequence of this the Virgin has been recognized as a descendant of David’s, and thus Christ Jesus, born of her through a supreme miracle, is the Son of God who precedes all ages. And whoever attempts to contradict these words attempts above all to point the sword of his tongue against himself. And he shall be thrown out of the sacred gates of our hall! And in our turn, to us, to whom the Word of God has been sent along with grace and truth, it shall not be justifiable to probe anything further than that which has been said, since the divine Scripture closes the search for more profound things! In fact, it says, “Take care of what has been commanded to you; do not probe the things that are too high for you!”
