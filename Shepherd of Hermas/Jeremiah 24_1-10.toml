“I, the angel of repentance, am telling you: Do not fear the devil. For I have been sent,” he said, “to be on the side of you, who repent with your whole heart, and to steady you in the faith. Put your faith in God, you who despair of your life because of your sins, you who add to your sins and make your life burdensome. Trust that, if you turn to the Lord with your whole heart and do righteousness3 for the rest of your life, serving him uprightly in accordance with his will, he will provide a remedy for your previous failings, and you will obtain the power of mastering the devil’s snares. Do not be in the least afraid of the devil’s threats, for they are as powerless as a dead person’s sinews.”

He said to me, “Cast off indecision and doubt not in the least, when asking anything from God. Do not say, ‘How can I ask and receive anything from the Lord after having committed so many sins?’ Do not entertain such thoughts, but with your whole heart turn to the Lord and ask him without wavering. You will learn his superabundant mercy. He will not leave you in the lurch. No! He will fulfill the request of your soul. God is not like human beings who bear a grudge. He is without malice and has mercy on what he has made.”

“In the first mandate,” he said, “I bade you keep the faith, fear the Lord, and be self-restrained.” “Yes, sir,” I said. “But now I wish to explain their nature, that you may know their individual power and effect. Well! Their effects are twofold. For they relate both to the just and to the unjust. Trust righteousness, but distrust unrighteousness. For the path of righteousness is straight, but wickedness is a crooked path. So, walk in the straight path, and leave the crooked path. Instead, there is nothing but wastelands and numerous obstacles. It is rough and full of thorns. So it is injurious to those who walk in it. Those who take the straight path walk smoothly without stumbling, because it is neither rough nor thorny. Hence, you see that it is more advantageous for you to walk in this road.” “Sir,” I said, “it is on this road that I like to walk.” “Walk in it, then,” he said, “and anyone who turns to the Lord wholeheartedly will also walk there.”
