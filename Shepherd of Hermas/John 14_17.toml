Again [the Shepherd] said to me, “Love the truth, and let nothing but truth proceed from your mouth, so that the spirit that God has placed in your flesh may be found truthful before all. And the Lord who dwells in you26 will be glorified, because the Lord is truthful in every word, and in him is no falsehood. They therefore who lie deny the Lord and rob him, not giving back to him the deposit that they have received. For they received from him a spirit free from falsehood. If they give him back this spirit untruthful, they pollute the commandment of the Lord and become robbers.”
