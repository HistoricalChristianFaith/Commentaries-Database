Put away doubting and do not hesitate to ask of the Lord. Do not say to yourself: “How can I ask of the Lord and receive from him, seeing that I have sinned so much against him?” Do not reason with yourself like this, but turn to the Lord with all your heart and ask of him without doubting, and you will know the multitude of his tender mercies, that he will never leave you but fulfill the request of your soul.
