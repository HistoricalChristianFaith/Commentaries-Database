Be on your guard against every evil word, and every evil desire, and purify your heart from all the vanities of this world. If you guard against these things, your fasting will be perfect. And you will do also as follows. Having fulfilled what is written, on that day on which you fast you will taste nothing but bread and water; and from your meats, which you would have eaten, you will calculate the amount of that day's expenditure, which you would have incurred, and will give it to a widow, or an orphan, or to one in want, and thus you will exhibit humility of mind, so that he who has received benefit from your humility may fill his own soul, and pray for you to the Lord.
