quote='''
But be meek, for “the meek shall inherit the land.” Be patient, merciful, guileless, and mild and gentle, and in every regard “fearful of the words” that you have heard. Do not exalt yourself or allow impudence in your soul. Your soul shall not cling to the proud but associate with good and humble people. Accept the troubles that come to you as good, knowing that nothing happens without God.
