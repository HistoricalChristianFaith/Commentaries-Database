You shall hate all hypocrisy and everything which is not pleasing to the Lord. Forsake in no way the commandments of the Lord; but you shall keep what you have received, neither adding thereto nor taking away therefrom. [Deuteronomy 12:32] In the church you shall acknowledge your transgressions, and you shall not come near for your prayer with an evil conscience.
