You, almighty Master, created all things for your name’s sake and gave food and drink to people to enjoy, that they might give you thanks; but to us you have graciously given spiritual food and drink and eternal life through your servant. Above all we give thanks because you are mighty; to you be the glory forever. - "Didache 10.3–4"
