There are two ways, one of life and one of death; but there exists a great difference between the two ways. The way of life, then, is this: First, you shall love God, who made you; second, love your neighbor as yourself. Anything that you would not want to happen to you, you also should not do to another. And of these sayings, the teaching is this: Bless those who curse you, and pray for your enemies, and fast for those who persecute you. For what good is it if you love those who love you? Do not also the Gentiles do the same? Rather, love those who hate you, and you shall not have an enemy. Abstain from fleshly and worldly lusts. If someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also, and you shall be perfect. If someone insists on you going one mile, go with him two. If someone takes away your cloak, give him your coat as well. If someone takes something from you, do not ask for it back, for indeed you are not able to do so. Give to everyone who asks you, and do not ask for it back, because the Father wills that the blessings we have received should be given to everyone. Happy is the one who gives according to the commandment; for that person is guiltless. Woe to the one who receives. For if one having need receives, he is guiltless; but one who receives even when he does not need it will pay the penalty because he received and because of what he received. He will be taken into confinement and examined concerning the things that he has done, and he shall not escape from there until he pays back the last farthing. It has also been said concerning this, Let your alms sweat in your hands until you know to whom you should give.â€¦
And the way of death is this: First of all it is evil and full of cursings, murders, adulteries, lusts, fornications, thefts, idolatries, magic arts, witchcrafts, rapines, false witnessings, hypocrisies, double-mindedness, deceit, pride, depravity, self-will, greediness, filthy talking, jealousy, overconfidence, loftiness, boastfulness; persecutors of the good, hating truth, loving a lie, not experiencing any reward for righteousness, not cleaving to good or to righteous judgment, not looking out for what is good but for what is evil; from whom meekness and endurance are far, loving vanities, pursuing vengeance, not pitying a poor person, not working for the afflicted or knowing God who made them, murderers of children, destroyers of the handiwork of God, turning away from the person that is in want, afflicting the one who is distressed, advocates of the rich, lawless judges of the poor, utter sinners. Be delivered, children, from all these.
See that no one causes you to err from this way of teaching, since apart from God it teaches you. For if you are able to bear the whole yoke of the Lord, you will be perfect. But if you are not able, do what you can. And concerning food, bear what you are able, but be vigilant in rejecting what is sacrificed to idols, for it has been used in the service of dead gods.
