Let everyone who “comes to you in the name of the Lord” be received; but, after testing him, you will know him, for you know right and wrong. If the one who comes to you is a traveler, help him as much as you can; but he shall remain with you no more than two or three days, unless there is need. But, if he wishes to settle among you and is a craftsman, let him work and eat. But, if he has no trade, provide according to your conscience, so that no Christian shall live among you idle. But, if he does not agree to do this, he is trading on the name of Christ; beware of such people.
