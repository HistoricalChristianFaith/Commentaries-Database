There are two ways, one of life, and one of death. Between the two ways there is a great difference. Now, this is the way of life: “First, you must love God who made you, and second, your neighbor as yourself.” Whatever you want people to refrain from doing to you, you must not do to them. What these proverbs teach is this: “Bless those who curse you” and “pray for your enemies.” Moreover, “fast for those who persecute you.” For “what credit is it to you if you love those who love you? Is that not the way the heathen act?” But “you must love those who hate you,” and then you will make no enemies. “Abstain from physical passions.” If someone strikes you “on the right cheek, turn to him the other too, and you will be perfect.” If someone “forces you to go one mile with him, go along with him for two.” If someone robs you “of your overcoat, give him your suit as well.” If someone deprives you of “your property, do not ask for it back.” (You could not get it back anyway!) “Give to everybody who begs from you, and ask for no return.” –.
