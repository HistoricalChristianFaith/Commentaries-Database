And reprove one another, not in anger, but in peace, as you have it in the Gospel; [Matthew 18:15-17] but to every one that acts amiss against another, let no one speak, nor let him hear anything from you until he repents. But your prayers and alms and all your deeds so do, as you have it in the Gospel of our Lord.
