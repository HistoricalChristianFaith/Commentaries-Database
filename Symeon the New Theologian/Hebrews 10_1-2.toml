Those who lived before grace, because they were under law, found themselves sitting under its shadow. But those who have come into existence after the coming of grace and day have been delivered from the shadow, truly from the slavery of the law. That is to say, they have risen above it, having been taken up on high as by a ladder, namely, the gospel way of life. They are living with the lawgiver, being themselves lawgivers rather than keepers of law.
