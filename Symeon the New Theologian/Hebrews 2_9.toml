But let us look, if you will, and examine closely the mystery of the resurrection of Christ our God, the very thing that mystically comes to be in us as we wish, and how in us Christ is buried in us as in a tomb, and how being united to our souls, he rises up and raises us with him. This is the goal of this discussion.Christ our God was hanged upon a cross and nailed upon it the sin of the world, tasting death and descending to the lower parts of Hades. Then again, rising from Hades he returned to his own undefiled body, from which in his descent he was in no way separated. And immediately he arose from the dead and went up from there to heaven with great glory and power. So we now come from the world and enter through the sufferings of the Lord43 into a repentance and humiliation of burial like his, who himself came down from heaven and took on our body as a tomb, and united with our souls he raises them from the dead, which most surely they were. Then he permits those who were raised with Christ to see the glory of his mystical resurrection.
