Almost everyone views those who are weak and poor as disgusting. An earthly king does not put up with seeing them, rulers turn away, wealthy people disregard them as not worthy of their notice, and when they encounter them they pass by them as if they did not exist. No one thinks it is a blessing to live among them. But God, who is served by innumerable millions of powers, who “upholds the universe by his word of power,” whose magnificence no one is able to endure, this God did not shun becoming father and friend and brother of these outcasts. Rather, in fact, he wanted to become incarnate, so that he might be identified as like us in every way, apart from sin, and might make us sharers in his glory and kingdom. O the depths of the wealth of his great goodness! O the depths of the unspeakable lowering of himself by our Master and God!
