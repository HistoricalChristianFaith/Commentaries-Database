We ought to evaluate well all the thoughts that come upon us and compare and contrast them to the testimonies from the divinely inspired Scriptures and from the teaching of the spiritual and holy fathers. If we find that our thoughts are in tune with these testimonies and have an equivalent meaning, then we ought to hold fast to them with all our might and confidently carry them out in action. But if they are not in harmony with “the word of truth,” then we ought to put them away from ourselves with great anger, just as it is written, “Be angry and do not sin.” For we must flee the attack which springs up from passionate thoughts, as something defiled and bearing the sting of death. Accordingly, we have need of great sober-mindedness, great zeal, much searching of the divine Scriptures. For the Savior used to say, “Search the Scriptures,” indicating to us their usefulness. Search and hold fast with great precision and faith the things that are said, so that, understanding the will of God accurately from the divine Scriptures, you may be able without stumbling to distinguish the noble from the inferior, and not obey every spirit, nor be carried about by harmful thoughts. Be fully convinced, my brothers, that there is nothing so prone to save us as closely following the divine commands of our Savior. All the same, we need many tears, much fear, much perseverance and continual prayer, that the force of even one of the Master’s sayings might be revealed to us, so that we may know the great mystery hidden in little words and lay down our lives unto death even for a single stroke of a letter of the commandments of God. For the word of God is “like a two-edged sword,” cutting off and separating the soul from every bodily craving and sensation. And not only that, it also becomes like a burning fire, arousing our soul’s eagerness and causing us to despise all of life’s painful experiences, and to consider all joy trial when it comes upon us, and to desire and greet death, which is fearful to other people, as life and that which produces life.
