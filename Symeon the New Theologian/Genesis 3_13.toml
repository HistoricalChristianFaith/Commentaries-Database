When God had left Adam, he came to Eve. He wanted to show her that she too would be cast out, if she was unwilling to repent. So he said, “What is this that you have done?” so that she at least might be able to say, “I have sinned.” Why else did God need to speak these words to her, unless indeed to enable her to say, “In my folly, O Master, I, a lowly wretch, have done this, and have disobeyed you. Have mercy on me!” But she did not say this. What did she say? “The serpent beguiled me.” How senseless! So you have spoken with the serpent, who speaks against your Master? Him you have preferred to God who made you. You have valued his advice more highly and held it to be truer than the commandment of your Master! So, when Eve too was unable to say, “I have sinned,” both were cast out from the place of enjoyment. They were banished from paradise and from God.
