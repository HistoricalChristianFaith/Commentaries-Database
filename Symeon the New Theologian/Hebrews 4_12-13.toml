Do you not shudder when you hear God each day saying to you through the whole of the divine Scripture, “Let no evil speech come out of your mouth”? For truly I say to you for any idle word you will give an account, and for every cup of cold water you will receive a reward. Have you not heard that God is the judge of the “thoughts and intentions of the heart”? What does it say? “He who looks at a woman with desire has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” Do you not see how he who looks with desire upon someone is considered an adulterer? Know then, surely, that those who strongly desire wealth are considered greedy, even if they have acquired nothing at all. Those who strive for many costly foods are gluttons, even if because of poverty they survive on only bread and water. They are sexually immoral who imagine many defiling encounters, even if they never look at another person. So too is it with those who say in their heart, “This has gone badly and become unreasonable” and “Why has this happened?” or “Why has that not happened?” Let them not be deceived, they are slanderers and will be judged as those who condemn, even though not a word comes out of their mouths nor does anyone hear them.
