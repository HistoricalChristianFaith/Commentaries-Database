Regarding fear, our Scripture expresses itself in these terms: “Holy is the fear of the Lord, which lasts forever and ever.” But we should really clarify that this fear is to be distinguished from that other fear about which the apostle says, “In love there is no fear, but perfect love banishes fear.” The apostle is referring here to a fear that prevents one from sinning when one would otherwise be inclined to sin. This fear keeps a person righteous against his will. Then, there is the other kind of fear that the prophet speaks about: “The one who is without fear cannot be justified.” This refers to the person who is constantly increasing in love. So, on the one hand, there are those who fear to do evil when they know they will be punished, and there are those on the other hand who do not want to lose the righteousness that brings them such joy. Therefore, where sin is concerned, one should not nourish both fears but only that one of which it is written: “Fear has to do with punishment.” For the other situations—for instance, where it is said, “The fear of God banishes sin,” and, “The one who is without fear cannot be justified,” and, “Holy is the fear of the Lord, which lasts forever and ever”—fear should not to be counted among the vices but should above all be regarded as the opponent of vices.
