Silence was imposed on Zechariah, symbolizing the silence of the Mosaic law. Having appeared to us in the flesh, Christ, like a great legislator, rendered the law mute, wanting to himself be the model of the law. Zechariah, in fact, put his faith in the angel who purified his silence: “I am Gabriel, who stands before the face of God, and I have been sent to speak with you and to bring you this joyful news. And see, you will be mute and unable to talk until the day on which these things take place, because you have not believed my words, which will be fulfilled at their proper time.” Very fittingly was he punished by the loss of his voice, since the Creator of voices was to be born. Not only did he have to endure being the symbol of those who do not believe in the law, but he also did not believe that the voice that was commanded to announce these things had come by the work of the Creator, and, not believing the angel’s words, rightly was he deprived of his voice. In fact, as the wise Solomon says, “By those very things through which one sins, he is later punished,” so that he might learn to believe in the voice that comes from the wilderness.
