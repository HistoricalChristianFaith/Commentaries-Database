He was called “Christ” from the anointing. Then, that the same one was a human being Jeremiah shows, saying, “And he is man, and who has known him?” And Isaiah, “And the Lord shall send them a man, who shall save them, and judging them he will heal them.”

That he was both God and man was declared before by the prophets. That he was God, Isaiah thus declares, “They shall fall down before you, they shall make supplication to you, since God is in you, and we knew it not, even the God of Israel. They shall be ashamed and confounded, all of them who oppose themselves to you, and shall go unto confusion.” … Likewise that he was man … Isaiah also thus speaks, “and the Lord shall send them a man who shall save them, and with judgment shall he heal them.”
