I believe that he wrote it for the purpose of recommending these books which he was about to write on Offices, in which books he testifies that nothing in the whole range of philosophy is better and more profitable than to give precepts for living. But if this is done by those who do not know the truth, how much more ought we to do it, who are able to give true precepts, being taught and enlightened by God?
