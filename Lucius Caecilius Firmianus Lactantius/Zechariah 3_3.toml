Now who this one would be to whom God promised an eternal priesthood Zechariah has taught, even giving his name most clearly. For thus he spoke: “And the Lord God showed me Jesus the high priest standing before the face of the angel of the Lord, and the devil stood at his right hand to be his adversary. And the Lord said to the devil, ‘May the Lord that chose Jerusalem rule over you, and behold the brand plucked out of the fire!’ And Jesus was clothed with filthy garments, and he stood before the face of the angel. And he answered and said to them that stood around before his face, saying, ‘Take away the filthy garments from him, and put on him a tunic and sandals, and put a clean miter upon his head.’ And they clothed him with garments and put a clean miter upon his head. And the angel of the Lord stood and testified before Jesus, saying, ‘Thus says the Lord almighty: If you will walk in my ways and keep my charges, you shall judge my house. And I will give you some of them that are now present to walk with you.’ Hear, then, O Jesus, the high priest.”
