These things are near to the truth. For the soul, when separated from the body, is, as the same poet says, "No vision of the drowsy night, No airy current half so light," because it is a spirit, and by its very slightness incapable of being perceived, but only by us who are corporeal but capable of being perceived by God, since it belongs to Him to be able to do all things.
