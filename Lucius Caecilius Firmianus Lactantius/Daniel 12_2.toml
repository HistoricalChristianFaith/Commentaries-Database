This sentiment set forth by Cicero … “if the soul will be in a state of vigor without the body, it is a divine life; and if it is without perception, assuredly that is not bad,” is clever … but false. For the sacred writings teach that the soul is not annihilated but that it is either rewarded according to its righteousness or eternally punished according to its crimes.
