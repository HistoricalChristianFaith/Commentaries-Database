After a short time the emperor Vespasian subdued the Jews and laid waste their lands with the sword and fire, besieged and reduced them by famine, overthrew Jerusalem, led the captives in triumph and prohibited the others who were left from ever returning to their native land. And these things were done by God on account of that crucifixion of Christ, as he before declared this to Solomon in their Scriptures, saying, “And Israel shall be for perdition and a reproach to the people, and this house shall be desolate; and every one that shall pass by shall be astonished, and shall say, ‘Why has God done these evils to this land, and to this house?’ And they shall say, ‘Because they forsook the Lord their God and persecuted their King, who was dearly beloved by God, and crucified him with great degradation; therefore has God brought on them these evils.’ ” For what would they not deserve who put to death their Lord, who had come for their salvation?
