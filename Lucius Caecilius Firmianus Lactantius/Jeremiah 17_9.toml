David also said in the forty-fourth psalm, “Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness. You have loved righteousness. You have hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness.” By this word he also shows his name, since (as I have shown above) he has called Christ from his anointing. Then, that he was also man, Jeremiah teaches, saying, “And he is a man, and who shall know him?” Also Isaiah: “And God shall send to them a man who shall save them, shall save them by judging.”
