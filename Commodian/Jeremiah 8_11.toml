The time spoken about has come to our people. There is peace in the world and, at the same time, ruin is weighing us down from the enticement of the world—the destruction of the reckless people whom you have torn into schism. Either obey the law of the city, or leave it. You see the speck sticking in our eyes and do not even notice the beam in your own. A treacherous peace is coming to you. Persecution is rife although the wounds are hidden, and thus, without slaughter, you are destroyed. War is waged in secret because, in the midst of peace, scarcely one of you has exhibited even a hint of caution. O badly fortified and foretold for slaughter, you praise a treacherous peace—a peace that will do you more harm than good. Having become the soldiers of another than Christ, you have perished.
