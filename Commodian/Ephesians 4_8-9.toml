Thus the law of God proclaims: when the Highest became lowly, Hell gave way, so that Adam might be lifted from Death; the Lord, having mercy on his own creation, descended into the tomb, and thus through hidden power, he nullified the power of Death. 
The Lord crept up, concealed from the old robber, and He allowed Himself to suffer, in order to cast him down more completely.  
That one, indeed, bold and always cruel like an enemy, while he hoped to rage against a man, was conquered by the Highest.  
By that thing through which the evil one had previously brought man down to death, he himself was overcome; from there comes forth life for us.
