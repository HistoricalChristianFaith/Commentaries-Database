And  labor:
Now faith raises us to labors, and love causes us to remain in those labors.

And enduring hope: 
 And he says "enduring", because persecution is not a one time thing, but it is continuous. All these things, he says, do from faith and hope, so that those circumstances will not only show their courage, but with assurance they might trust in their future rewards. For this reason God allows persecution to occur, in order that their zeal might be shown, and that their conviction might not be seen as coming from themselves, but from the power of God, which persuades the souls of believers so that they be prepared to face a myriad of dangers. But if the Gospel was not steadfast among them they then would not be able to endure.
