The context shows that there is one person who intercedes and another who receives the plea. Nor is it improper for the Son to ask and for the Father to grant the request, for thus the complementary relationship between the two persons is maintained.â€¦ This text teaches us that there is a distinction between the Father and the Son which must not be confused.
