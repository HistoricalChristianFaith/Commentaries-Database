He calls it the age to come. Then he adds at last, “we do not yet see everything in subjection to him. But we see Jesus made lower than the angels.” Then he applies to Jesus the question, “What is man that you are mindful of him?” For the things common to humanity belong to him. But as the Son himself says, “Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings I will establish praise for the sake of your enemies” and “I will see the heavens, the works of your fingers.” No one would say that the man God remembered had made “the praise established from the mouth of babes and infants for the sake of your enemies” and “I will see the heavens, the works of your fingers.” This one remembered humanity and lowered himself a little lower than the angels. But who is the “man”? Jesus. Because of the suffering of his death, “he was made a little lower than the angels.”
