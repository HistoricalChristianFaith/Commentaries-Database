The beginning of Christ was from within Judaism—for he lived as a Jew according to the law. He says because of this, “Leaving this behind, let us be borne to that maturity,” knowing that the one about to be a high priest apart from the law must be a priest “according to the order of Melchizedek.”“Dead works and faith in God, ritual washing.” For Christians the earthly things are dead. Therefore he says that it is out of place that they neglect the way of life based on faith and the mortification of all things and return to ablutions according to the law. When the Lord came, he preached repentance, saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of God has drawn near,” but it was “a repentance from dead works.” … This, then, is what he says: it is not necessary to run back to the law, leaving behind the repentance from dead works and faith in God and baptism25—which he named in the plural because of the multitude of those deemed worthy. And he spoke of baptisms and the teaching and the laying on of hands through which are the elections, and the hope of the resurrection and the rest. And he has prepared this beforehand, since the priests in the law uphold the law with a vengeance, but Melchizedek was outside the law. Not coming from the levitical priesthood, he followed “the order of Melchizedek.” He says that it was not necessary to leave behind the priest in the order of Melchizedek to pursue those who are priests under the law, so that the things written in the law might stand. But he called those things in the law a “foundation,” since it has become a preamble of godliness for men.
