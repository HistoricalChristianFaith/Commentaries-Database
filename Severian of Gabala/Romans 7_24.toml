[[commentary]]
quote='''
Having considered the struggle which was taking place in the body against the soul and how man was imprisoned by this, Paul now seeks a way to escape and tries to rescue man, so that the body of death may be transformed into a body of life.â€¦ For Paul wants his body to be a body of life and not a body of death or of sin.
