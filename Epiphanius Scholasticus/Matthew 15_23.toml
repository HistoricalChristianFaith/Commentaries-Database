Therefore this woman besought the Lord on behalf of her daughter, the church of the Gentiles. “But he did not answer her a word.” It was not that the Lord was unwilling to heal her but that he might reveal her great faith and humility. Then the disciples were moved to mercy and pleaded with the Lord, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying after us.” But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.” Now he said this to the crowd of Jews that they might have no excuse on the day of judgment, when they might pretend to say, “He wanted to come to the Gentiles rather than to us.”
