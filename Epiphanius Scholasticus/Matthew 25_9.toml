“As the bridegroom was delayed, they all slumbered and slept. But at midnight there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.’ ” Likewise, the blessed apostle, Paul, declared, “For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the archangel’s call and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first; then we who are alive, who are left, shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air; and so we shall always be with the Lord.” So those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. But the foolish said to the wise, “Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.” Their spiritual virginity was running out and failing, because they did not have works of religious devotion and compassion. But the wise replied, “Perhaps there will not be enough for us and for you; go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.” For on the day of the resurrection and judgment, however much anyone might be rich in holy works, he will fear for himself, lest he not have enough.
