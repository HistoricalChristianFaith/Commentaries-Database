Christ is the way. Therefore, the two blind men [the Gentiles] were sitting on the way [yet without seeing the way]. By straying through idols, they had completely wandered from the way of truth. Degenerated in the obscurity of sins, they destroyed the eyes of the heart. Thus those sitting shouted, “Son of David, have mercy on us.” But the crowd rebuked them to become silent. But they shouted all the more: “Son of David, have mercy on us.” For with the Jews neither believing nor willing, the blinded nations were shouting all the more through faith, saying, “Son of David, have mercy on us.” And for us, dearly beloved, whether envy opposes a man or the devil holds him back in darkness, let us therefore shout the more through faith, “Son of David, have mercy on us.”
