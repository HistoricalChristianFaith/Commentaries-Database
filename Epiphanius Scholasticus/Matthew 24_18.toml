The holy reading continues: “Let him in the field not turn back.” This field represents the church, as was demonstrated by the blessing our blessed patriarch Isaac gave to his son Jacob: “Behold, the smell of my son is like the smell of a bountiful field which the Lord has blessed.” The field was replete with a multitude of flowers and was redolent with the sweetest aroma. Clearly this signifies the church where the Lord’s flowers—that is, virginity, chastity, continence, confession, faith, mercy, justice, truth and martyrdom—are perfected. These are the flowers of the field, which is the church; the flowers in which the Son of God rejoices, which have merited God’s blessing. Therefore he said, “Let him in the field not turn back.” Likewise, the same Lord once said, “Remember Lot’s wife.” While fleeing the conflagration of Sodom, she looked back and was turned into a pillar of salt, leaving an example of foolishness behind her. Therefore the Lord admonishes us that clinging more fully to his love and faith, we would not turn back, yet rather would save our souls for eternal life.
