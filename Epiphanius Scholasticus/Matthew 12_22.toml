The entire population of the Gentiles was blind, sitting in darkness and in the shadow of death. They could not see Christ with the eyes of their hearts blinded. This was because they did not know the law and could not praise God. They were possessed by a demon, because after such great idolatry and hunger for the demonic, they were led captive as it were by an unclean spirit. “Then a blind and dumb demoniac was brought to him.” By whom was he offered if not by the apostles, who quickly brought all the Gentiles who were attacked by the devil to bring offering to God? Jesus cured him in their presence, “in such a way that he might speak and might see.” He spoke because he praised God through his faith. He saw Christ because light shined on the eyes of his heart. He was healed because, now by leaving behind his mad idolatry and his various mistakes, he was faithfully serving the Lord.
