We read in Genesis that Noah, a very just man, had three sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, with whom he entered into the ark at the time of the flood and departed. From these three sons diverse nations were scattered throughout the entire world. For from the first son of Noah descended the patriarch, Abraham, from whom proceeded, whether for good or ill, all the Jewish people. And from the two [other] sons diverse nations were disseminated. Thus these two blind men had the form of the two sons of Noah. They heard that Jesus was passing by. Now is it not certain that the people of the Gentiles believed in the Savior not by seeing, as did the Jews, but by hearing? And what is the meaning of the phrase that he passed by? Does it not suggest that the messianic event was passing by from the Jews to the nations? Did not the Lord himself say, “I came into this world for judgment so that those who do not see may see and those who see may become blind.”
