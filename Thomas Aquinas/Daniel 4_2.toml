If certain things are divinely represented to any man by means of imaginary likenesses, as happened to Nabuchodonosor, such a man is not to be considered a prophet, unless his mind be enlightened for the purpose of judgment; and such an apparition is something imperfect in the genus of prophecy. Wherefore some have called this "prophetic ecstasy," and such is divination by dreams.
