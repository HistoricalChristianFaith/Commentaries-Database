Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy
He, in writing to these good people, does not mention his title, but supplies only his humble name which is Paul. He also adds the names of two persons who preached to them with him: Silvanus, who is Silas, and Timothy, whom he circumcised, as is mentioned in Acts 16. Paul greets the church, which is the assembly of believers, 

in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
that is, in the faith of the Trinity and of the divinity and humanity of Christ, because our beatitude will consist in knowing them. He mentions only the person of the Father and the incarnate Son, in which two is understood the Holy Spirit who is the bond between the Father and the Son.
