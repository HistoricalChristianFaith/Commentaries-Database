Here in Verse 16 a taking away of consolation is lamented. So first is the bewailing within grief. As stated: "For these things I weep, my eyes flow with tears." And Jeremiah 9:1: "O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears."

Second is the matter of grief itself. As said: "for a comforter is far from me, one to revive my courage That is, as one, like Egypt, to revive my soul; from the grief itself. Since, I (Jerusalem) suffer away from my pristine prosperity. As Psalm 88(87):8 discloses: "Thou hast caused my companions to shun me."

Third, is the effect upon the city (Jerusalem). As said: "my children are desolate for the enemy has prevailed". For, due to a deficiency of aid, the power of the enemy prevails, and then the captivity of the people. As Jeremiah: 50:6 declares: "My people have beeh last sheep; their shepherdshave led them astray".
