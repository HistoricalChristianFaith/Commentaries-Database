The people here are accused of their sins. First, regarding the affliction in their shame: "Thou hast heard their taunts, O Lord, all their devices against me." Which declares, as if: there is no need for proof. For the prophet Daniel 9:16 asserts: "And for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people have become a byword among all who are round about us.

Second, such is insofar as to threats: "The lips and thoughts of my assailants are against me all the day long." As Psalm 38 (37):l2 says: "those who seek my hurt speak of ruin, and meditate treachery all the day long."

Third, (their shame) is, insofar as to derision, and insult: "Behold their sitting and their rising; I am the burden of their songs." For, they sit in council, in order to destroy me by: "their rising". And: "I am the burden of their songs". Since, they compose derisive songs against me."

All the above notions can be understood in the person of the prophet, or the people themselves, as first mentioned. For, Job 30:9 declares: "And now I have become their song, I am a byword to them." Also, Psalm: 69 (68):l2: "and the drunkards make s ongs about me."
