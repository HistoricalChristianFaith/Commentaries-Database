Here is assigned a reason for the destruction. As a result, wonder would cease. And first, as to fault of prelates: "for the sins of prophets and the iniquities of her priests." Namely, those who ought to govern the people. As the Prophet Daniel 13:5 says: "In that year two elders from the people were appointed as judges.

Concerning them the Lord had said: "Iniquity came forth from Babylon, from elders who were judges, who were supposed to govern the people."
