Here the misery of the siege is principally lamented, which is considered in two ways. In the first way the misery of the people is bewailed, in the second way the joy of those deriding is laid bare. As said in Verse 21: "Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, dweller in the land of Uz; but to you also the cup shall pass; you shall become drunk and strip yourself bare."

As to the misery of the people there are two further notions. First the affliction of the people themselves is bewailed, second their lack of power to resist. As said in Verse 17: "Our eyes failed, ever watching vainly for help; in our watching we watched for a nation which could not save."

The first notion (the people's affliction bewailed) has two more ideas. in the first idea is bewailed the misery of people in general, and this idea is followed out twofold. As said in Verse 3: "Even the jackals give the breast and suckle their young, but 'the daughter of my people has become cruel, like the ostriches in the wilderness."

As to the misery of people in general there are two ideas. First is expressed a metaphor, second, it is explained. As there in Verse 2: "The precious sons of Zion, worth their weight in fine gold, how they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands!" Since, there were eminent Jews in certain tribes with subtle knowledge of the divine. As Psalm (l47):20: "He has not dwelt thus with any other nation; they do not know his ordinances. Praise the Lord!" Thus is said in Verse 1: "How the gold has grown dim, how the pure gold is changed!" And as Proverbs: 20:15 says: "There is gold, and abundance of costly stones; but the lips of knowledge are a precious jewel." Again: "How the gold has grown dim". Namely, by the shame of infidelity. As Isaiah 5:13 states: "Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge."

Secondly, 'some persons were eminent in the beauty of their honesty. As Sirach 44:6 states: "rich men furnished with resources, living peaceably in their habitation". Thus is said in Verse 1: "how the pure gold is changed!" That is, as if it is changed like to a blackness of sin, and sadness. As 2 Maccabees 3:16 says: "for his face and the change in his color disclosed the anguish of his soul."

Thirdly, some persons were eminent in the cult of their religion. As Verse 1 concludes: "The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street." That is, the precious sons of different tribes, or nations. As I Maccabees: 4:43 states: "And they cleansed the sanctuary and removed the defiled stones to an unclean place."
