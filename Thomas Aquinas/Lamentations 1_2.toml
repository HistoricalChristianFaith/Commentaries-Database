Verse 2 laments the violation of friendship. So, first is indicated the need for friends. As expressed: "She weeps bitterly": as if continuously: Jerusalem. And, "in the night": privately, due to fear of enemies, or as one in adversity. Also: "tears on her cheeks": since there are none who would wipe them away. As Psalm 6:6 states: "every night I flood my bed with tears"

Secondly, as to lack of aid: "among all her lovers she has none to comfort her". That is, offering any aid against her enemies.

For: "all her friends have dwelt treacherously with her". Namely, the Egyptians and all joining with them. As Ecclesiastes 4:1 claims: "Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sum. And behold, the tears of the oppressed and they had no one to comfort them."

Thirdly, all affection is changeable. As said: "all her friends have dwelt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies."

To this second Verse is applied the Hebrew alphabet letter "Beth". This letter can symbolize a "House". For the house of Jacob now weeps, as a third situation for lamenting is pointed out.

Allegorically, the Church weeps over her enemies.

As Verse 2 expresses: "tears on her cheek": on Church prelates. And: "among her lovers": as the holy angels. Also: "she has none to comfort her as one person consoling with divine justice.

Morally, the human soul laments. As said: "she weeps bitterly in the night. That is, for sins.

Then: "tears on her cheek", the conscience by which action of one speaks.

And: "among all her lovers": in her private affections. Also: "she has none to comfort her with any pleasures of perverted affection.
