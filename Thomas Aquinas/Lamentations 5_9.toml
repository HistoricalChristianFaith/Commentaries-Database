Here is viewed the affliction of hunger. First is shown the people's want; "at the peril of our lives", That is, at a danger to our soul, to our very life. Also, while fleeing into the desert from the face of the sword of Babylon. Or, because, due to loading themselves with foods, they exposed themselves to dangers. As a result, their enemies pursuing them into the desert, would make them flee. As Isaiah 21:14 records: "to the thirsty bring water, meet the fugitive with bread, O inhabitants of the land of Tema."
