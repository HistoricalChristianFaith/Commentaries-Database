Here is exposed the misery from servitude in particular. First is such servitude under Jehoiachin, King of Judah. (cf Last part, 2 Kings (4 Kings), Chapter 25, "The Exile of Judah").

Second is exposed in particular the captivity of Judah under Sedecias, (Zedekiah, recorded in last chapter, 4 Kings). And in Jeremiah Chapter 52, ("Judah Taken Captive at Babylon"). As expressed in Verse 17 ("Pe"):l: "Zion stretches out her hands but there is none to comfort her.

Regarding the first captivity under King Jehoiachin, two further ideas are exposed. First is lamented the servitude of the people, second, a taking away of consolation. As further on exposed in Verse 16 ("Ain"):l: "For these things I weep; my eyes flow with tears; for a comforter is far from me."

To lamentations over the people's servitude, three notions are advanced. First, servitude of people concerning those eminent in dignity. As expressed: "The Lord flouted all my mighty men in the midst of me". Namely, those leaders who do great deeds. For, to other men remaining, these were indeed captives. Hence, Isaiah 3:1 declares: "For behold, the Lord of host, is taken away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water."

Second, are taken away persons eminent in virtue. As said: "he summoned an assembly against me": those apt for destruction. Also: "to crush my young men". That is, young men eminent in virtue. Thus, Psalm 75(74):2 states: "At the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity." And Exodus 32:34 says: "Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them." Also, Ecclesiastes 3:1. claims: "For everything there is a season ."

Third, are taken into captivity persons eminent for purity and piety. As said: "The Lord has trodden me as in a wine press, the virgin daughter of Judah." Namely, a literal affliction of a virgin-daughter. Or, of a tribe (of Judah) which, up until then, had been like a captured virgin-daughter. So, Jeremiah exclaims: "The clamor will resound to the ends of the earth, for the Lord has an indictment against the nations." (Jer:25:3l).

Thus, this Verse 15 ought to be literally prescribed, as the "Interlinear Gloss" so asserts. Yet, what is prescribed in the following Verse 16 ("Am") seems better, as it is divided into three parts.
