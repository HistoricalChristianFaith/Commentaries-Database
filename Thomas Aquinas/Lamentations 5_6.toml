Now, the people's slavery is personal and voluntary, because impelled by no means, people sell themselves to others in slavery. Or, at least for a time, as Verse 6 states: "We have given the hand to Egypt,and to Assyria, to get bread enough." That is, subjugating themselves to them. As I Samuel 2:5 claims: "Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger."

Again: Verse 6: "We have given the hand to Egypt, and to Assyria, to get bread enough". That is, by demanding aid. As Jeremiah 2:18 says: "And now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria to drin~c the waters of the Euphrates?"
