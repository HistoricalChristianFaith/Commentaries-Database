Here is viewed the knowledge of those consecrated to God, namely, the Nazarites, concerning whose consecration Numbers 6:13, and following, reports.

So, first is spoken of their beauty, second, their knowledge and subsequent shame. As said in Verse 8: "Now their visage is blacker than soot, they are not recognised in the streets; their skin has shriveled upon their bones, it has become as dry as wood." Thirdly, a comparison is considered as to punishment, as next said in Verse 9: "Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who pined away, stricken by want of the fruits of the field."

As to corporal beauty, a decent appearance is required, by which is a countenance of joyulness. As Verse 7 says: "Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire."

Also, an old dual color is required, namely,"red". As Verse 7 says: "their bodies were more ruddy than coral." And also as "white". Again, as Verse 7 states: "Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk". Now, the philosopher (Aristotle) claims, the color "white" is exceedingly receptive to other colors. It is befitting that "white" be minus any stain. As Verse 7 refers to this idea: "whiter than milk".

So, such are extreme statements, howsoever false. For, they are figures of speech in which another idea is referred to, as sigiified. So literally such persons were adorned, due to cleanness, and abstinences of their life. As reported of the prophet Daniel, and his ssociates. Also as reported in Deuteronomy: 33:16: "with the best gifts of the earth and its fulness, and the favor of him that dwelt in the bush. Let these come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brothers."
