Faith being restored, one now turns to divine mercy. Two further ideas are added to this idea. First, a preparation for prayer is considered, second, the prayer itself. As said: "We have transgressed and rebelled, and thou hast not forgiven" (Verse 42).

On preparation for prayer, a place is afforded through change of life. As remarked: "Let us test and examine our ways, and return to the Lord." That is, by searching out our past sins. Again : "Let us test and examine our ways." Namely, as to the Lord God, in a desire of our heart seeking divine aid. Then, accepting such one can return to the Lord God by doing good deeds. Since, Jeremiah claims: "know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the Lord your God" (Jer: 2:19).

Second, a place for prayer is prepared through devotion. As said: "Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven." For, Paul the Apostle beseeches: "I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling" (I Tim: 2:8).

Verse 42 then states: "We have transgressed and rebelled, and hast not forgiven." Here prayer begins, first accenting benevolence, second, the fault. Later Verse 59 thus says: "Thou hast seen the wrong done to me, O Lord; judge thou my cause."

Third, a place for prayer is prepared, by seeking vindication. For Verse 64 later states: "Thou wilt requite them, O Lord, according to the work of their hands."

As to an accent on benevolence three futher ideas are proposed. First, benevolence is accented thru their own person, and conquered people; second, as to enemies. For, Verse 46 says: "All our enemies rail against us."

Third, is the person of the judge. As Verse 55 states: "I called on thy name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit."

Here Verses 40-42 take into account a benevolence of their own person and people, setting forth their harassments. First, afflictions of people are considered, second compassion. Verse 49 thus says: "My eyes will flow without ceasing, without respite."

Regarding afflictions of people are two further ideas. First, is conferred their fault, lest following punishment, a discretion of a judge is directed. For, Verse 42 claims: "we have transgressed and rebelled, and thou has't not forgiven." Namely, by sinning against our neighbor. Also: "and rebelled": by sinning against God.

And then: "and thou hast not forgiven". Since, you, Lord God, are inflexible towards our prayers. Thus, Jeremiah says: "As for you, do not pray for this people, or lift up cry or prayer for them, and do not intercede with me, for I do not hear you" (Jer: 7:16). Also, the apostle John points out: "We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if anyone is a worshiper of God, and does his will, God will listen to him" (Jo 9:31).

Second, regarding the people's afflictions, their sins are exposed.
