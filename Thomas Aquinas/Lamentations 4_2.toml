Here is exposed what was said above in Verse 1. So, "The precious Sons": since, as a kind of saints. And "worth their weight in fine gold." That is, of the best, like to wisdom. As Wisdom 7:9 says: "Because all gold is but a little sand in her sight ('Wisdom) and silver will be accounted as clay before her."

Then in Verse 2: "How they are reckoned as earthen pots, the work of a potter's hands." Namely, the fragile and vile people. As Isaiah 64:8 says: "Yet, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou art our potter; we are all the work of thy hand."
