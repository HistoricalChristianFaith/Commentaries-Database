As this opening verse states: "She that was great among the nations," that is, once subject to her. As Ezekiel 5:5 declares: "This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations."

Then is displayed that the people's glory was once distinguished by their tributes. For: "she that was a princess among the cities has become a vassal" Because, once tributes were made to her. As 2 Samuel 8:2 declares: "and he (David) defeated Moab." And the Moabites became servants to David and brought tribute.

And, King Solomon had divided his kingdom within such glories, as setting forth distinctive projects to single cities. As recorded in I Kings 4:21: "Solomon ruled over all the kingdom from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt; they brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life." Also Proverbs l2:21 states: "The hand of the diligent will rule, while the slothful will be put to forced labor."

Now to this Verse 1 is applied the first letter of the Hebrew, "Aleph", since doctrine is indicated. This Verse 1 points out to the Hebrew people the exact doctrine from God that lacks their observance, within their own knowledge, as people within captivity. This fact the prophet Isaiah 5:13 underscores: "Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge; their honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst."

It must be also known that a fourth place of conquest is applicable in many colors, and in parched places: within this first lamentation.

Now, allegorically, "the city", in Verse 1 is the present church. The phrase: "that was full of people!" is indicative of the various tributes. And: "she was great among the nations" denotes obedi ence to the faith. Finally: "she what was a princess among the cities has become a vassal". This can refer to diversity within the Church, as discerned by a life-style prevailing.

Then again "How lonely sits the city that was full of people." This can indicate a loss of protection and aid from angels. And, "How like a widow has she become ". Namely, as she is taken away from her present spouse. Finally: "has become a vassal". That is, exposed to tyrants.

Morally, the phrase: "sits the city", connotes the human soul. And, the phrase, "that was full of people, indicates people of good affection.

Then, the saying, "great among the nations". Namely, regards corruptions. Also: "princess among the cities". That is, as to the human senses.

Then again: "How lonely": away from suffrages of goods. And, "like a widow". As to embraces of a husband. Finally : "has become a vassal": to corruptions.
