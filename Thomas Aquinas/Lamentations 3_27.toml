Divine mercy is here designated as to expectation of future events. First, the expectation itself, second, to the condition of such expectation. As Verse 28: "Let him sit alone in silence when he has laid it on him."

Regarding this expectation of future events three ideas are proposed. First is the result of such an expectation:

"The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him." That is, as if spreading proper posessions. Since, Psalm 73 (72):l claims: "Truely God is good to the upright, to those who are pure in heart."

Second, the manner of this expectation is noticed. As said: "It is good that one should wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord." Namely, patiently, and without a murmur. For Isaiah 30:15 asserts: " in quietness and c in trust shall be your strength."

Third, the time of this expectation is examined: "It is good for a man that he bear the yoke in his youth." That is, a fear of the Lord, and love for the Lord in his youth. Since, as the ardor of time is lessened, and youth is more easily led towards virtue. Like Proverbs 22:6: "Train up a child in the way he should go, and when he is old he will not depart from it."
