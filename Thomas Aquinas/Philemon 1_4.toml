Again, first he expresses thanks; second he gives the reason for his gratitude: as I hear of your charity... ; third, the reason why he thanks God: For I had great joy and consolation... I give thanks to my God. Colossians 3:15: ‘Show yourself thankful.’ Philippians 4.6: ‘With thanksgiving let your petitions be made to God.’ As if he said: I give thanks for past things in order that I might pray for future things. Therefore he says: always making remembrance of you in my prayers... Philippians 11:7: ‘Because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my chains.’ Isaiah 49-15: ‘Can a woman forget her infant, so as not to have pity on the son of her womb? And if she should forget, yet will not I forget you.’
