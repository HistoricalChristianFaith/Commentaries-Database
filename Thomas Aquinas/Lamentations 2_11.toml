Here, miserable persons, due to defect of age, are mourned. First is indicated the death of such persons, second, the order of their death. As verse 12 says: "They cry to their mothers, 'Where is bread and wine?" And as Jeremiah 9:1 expresses it: "O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears." Namely, from a commotion of vital parts, around the heart.

Then: "my heart is poured out in grief," As if, only I grieve, like the heart's commotion within grief. Or, as if one arrives to the very intimacies of the heart. Jeremiah 31:20 so saying: "Therefore my heart yearns for him; I will surely have mercy on him, says the Lord."

Regarding effusion of the human liver on human passions, Verse 11 refers: "because of the destruction of the daughter of my people," That is, as I grieve, as if the city would be destroyed.

Or, since my love for the plight (of the city) within destruction. That is, as if thrown to the earth, those prostrate, whom I loved. The prophet Hosea 13:8 thus states: "and there I will devour them like a lion, as a wild beast would rend them."

Second, (as to the death of such persons) mercy is from compassion. As Verse 11 concludes: "because infants and babies faint in the streets of the city." Namely, the city of Jerusalem, since it has become vile, or from any other condition. As Jeremiah 51:22 says: "with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth; with you I break in pieces the old man and the youth; with you I break in pieces the young man and the maiden."
