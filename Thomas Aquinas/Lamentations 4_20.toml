Fourthly, is excluded a protection from kings. As said: "The breath of our nostrils, the Lord's anointed That is, by which we were breathed through narrow places; as: "the Lord's anointed". Like Josiah (16th King of Judah, son of Amon and Jedidah: 2 Kings 22:1): "was taken in their pits." That is, was killed by the Egptians (cf. 2 Kings, Chapter 24,"Nebuchhadnezzar Conquers Judah"), Namely, while that king Josiah was a just king.

Such also can be exposed as to King Zedekiah (of Judah), as to the consequence of his reign. Or it even can be referred to Christ. As the prophet Isaiah foretold: "But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities." (Is: 53:5).

Then, as Verse 20 concluded: "he of whom was said, "Under his shadow we shall live among the nations." Namely, under the Lord's protection. As the Song of Solomon 2:3 expresses it: "With great delight I sat in his shadow, and his fruit was sweet to my taste."
