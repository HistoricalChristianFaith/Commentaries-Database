Here is excluded a tendency for excluding four things which could be evaded. First, is the aid of friends. As was said: "Our eyes failed, ever watching": as we would expect,"vainly for help": from the Egyptians. As Isaiah 30:3 says: "Therefore shall the protection of Pharoh turn to your shame, and the shelter in the shadow of Egypt to your humiliation."
