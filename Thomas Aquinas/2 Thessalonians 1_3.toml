'we ought to give thanks,'
Paul mentions things that ought to be present in thanksgiving. First, thanksgiving should be directed to God:

we give thanks always to God. 
“He bestows favor and honor” (Ps. 84:11). “Every good endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights” (Jas. 1: 17). Thanksgiving should be unceasing; so Paul says, always.
