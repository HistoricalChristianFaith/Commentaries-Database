The impossibility of escaping is set forth here. To this idea three more notions are presented. First, is the siege, as Verse 22 begins: "Thou didst invite as to the day of an appointed feast my terrors on every side." Namely, like to the Jewish people accustomed to come to a solemn feast day. So, that, by you, (Lord) inspiring, they come to obey you. For, Isaiah 29:3 declares: "And I will encamp against you round about, and I will besiege you with towers and I will raise siegeworks against you."

Second, the impossibility of escaping is noticed. As stated: "and on the day of the anger of the Lord none escaped or survived." And Isaiah 41:25 declares: "I stirred up one from the north, and he has come, from the rising of the sun, and he shall call on my name."

Third, the destruction of those persons understanding is evaluated. Since Verse 22 concludes (this Chapter II): "those whom I dandled and reared my enemy destroyed." For, Baruch: 4:11 claims: "With joy I nurtured them, but I sent them away with weeping and sorrow."
