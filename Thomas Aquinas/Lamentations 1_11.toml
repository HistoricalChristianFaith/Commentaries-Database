Here is noticed the spoiling of possessions taken away from the people. First is obs~erved the need for withdrawing, as to a deficiency of things needed. As expressed: "All her people groan as they search for bread". Psalm l02(lOl):4 thus remarks: "My heart is smitten like grass, and withered; I forget to eat my bread."

Second is noticed the distraction itself: "they trade their treasures for food". Namely, not to satiate themselves, but, "to revive their strength". That is, from the vile life among the Egyptians. (cf. Genesis Chapter 48: "Israel's Last Days")

Third, is noticed that this vile life moves the Lord God to divine pity. As expressed: "Look, O Lord, and behold, for I am despised." To which the prophet Jeremiah 2:36 refers: "How lightly you (Israel) gad about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria."

This final notice is from the legal personality of the city (Jerusalem).

Or, this tribe which, as if, proposes its own misery. Thus, here one is unable to refrain any further. So, he (the prophet) personally breaks forth in words of lamentation.
