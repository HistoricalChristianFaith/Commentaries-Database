So, as far as the infliction of punishment Verse 16 states: '"The Lord himself", by his fore-knowledge, "has scattered them." That is, he disperses (Jews) among nations. As Psalm 55 (54):22 says: "Cast your burden on the Lord, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved."

Thirdly, an irreverence for their elders was blamed on them (the Jews), and their enemies regarded such irreverence. As said: "No honor was shown to the priests, no favor to the elders." As Isaiah 3:5 says: "the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the base fellow to the honorable." Or these can be words of the prophet against enemies (of the Jews).
