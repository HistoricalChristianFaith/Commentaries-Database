Here is exaggerated a punishment in comparison to the punishment of the Sodomites. As said in Verse 6: "For the chastisement of the daughter of my people has been greater than the punishment of Sodom." And greater their fault was, due to their ingratitude, and the profanation of holy things. So, greater the punishment was, since the city is no longer. As the prophet Ezekiel says: "And your younger sister, who lived to the south of you, is Sodom with her daughters." (Ezek: 16:46). And the Apostle Matthew reports: "But I tell you that it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you." (Matt: 11:24). And also Job 9:23: "When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent."

The "Gloss" has: "Morally this concerns the sin of simulation, because it is a sin far greater than the Sodomites." And the opposite is claimed in Chapter 3, Isaiah; (The Lord's Judgrnent). As said in Isaiah: 3:9: "they proclaim their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it." Also, in the"Gloss" it says: "A second plank to hide a sin, after a shipwreck."

Now, as to this situation, it is claimed there is an alleviating condition to sin secretly. Indeed, a sin of simulation is the greater, since in this way deception and glory regarding others is sought out. So, such a situation is regarded the greater sin, not just simply, but even insofar as the effect of deception. Or, insofar as the matter a persons' sins: sins as to spiritualities. For such a person, who invents a falsehood, is much more blameable than one who counterfeits a coin. The philosopher (Aristotle) claims such.
