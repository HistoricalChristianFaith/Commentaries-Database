Then also: "Cry aloud" like blaspheming the Lord. That is, against the Lord God and against the walls. As if the destruction of the city (Jerusalem) could be an occasion for blasphemy. Also, as if the Lord God was not powerful enough to defend (such walls). As Exodus: 16:8 asserts: "Your murmurings are not against us but against the Lord."

Again: "Cry aloud to the Lord! O daughter of Zion!" Namely, the Jewish people, just like one is taught to set forth their grief of heart in tearful prayer. Like Psalm 119 (118):145 declares: "With my whole heart I cry; answer me, O Lord!"

Second, one is invited to a multitude of tears. As Verse 18 continues: "Let tears stream down like a torrent day and night!" For, Jeremiah 9:1 says: "O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears."

Third, one is invited to a continuance of the struggle. As: "day and night! Give yourself no rest, your eyes no respite!" That is, both within prosperities and adversities. Or, literally, at all times in action, or habit. Since Jeremiah 14:17 states: "You:shall say to them this word: "Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease".
