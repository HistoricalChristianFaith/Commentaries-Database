713. - After describing the condition of both testaments, the Apostle now argues from this description and does two things: first, he argues; secondly, he draws the conclusion (v. 28). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he prefaces his intention; secondly, he argues to his conclusion (v. 25b).

714. - He says, therefore: Thus we have said that the blood of Christ speaks more graciously than the blood of Abel. See to it, therefore, that you do not refuse, i.e., despise, him that is speaking, i.e., fulfill what he says. But the blood of Christ says two things to us: first, it speaks by reminding us of His favor, by which He remitted our sins. Therefore, one who sins again, despises the one speaking. Furthermore, He speaks by exhorting us to imitate Him: ‘Christ suffered for us, leaving you an example to follow in his footsteps’ (1 Pt 2:2). Therefore, one who does not take up His cross to follow, refuses the one speaking: ‘Today, if you hear his voice, harden not your hearts’ (Ps. 94:8); ‘This is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased’ (Mt. 17:5).

715. - Then when he says, For if they escaped not, much more shall not we, he argues by comparing the speaking of the Old Testament to that of the New; and this in regard to two things: first, as to the manner of speaking; secondly, as to the efficacy of the speaking.

716. - The manner of speaking, because He spoke upon earth; but here He speaks from heaven. Hence, he says, If they, namely, the ancient fathers, refused him who warned them on earth, namely, Christ: ‘For I myself that spoke, behold I am here’ (Is. 52:6), namely, by angels or prophets: ‘God who a sundry times and in divers manners spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets’ (Heb. 1:1); or him, i.e., the angel through whom the Law was given to Moses: ‘Ordained by angels’ (Gal. 3:19); ‘For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast’ (Heb. 2:2): ‘This is Moses who was in the church in the wilderness, with the angel who spoke to him on mount Sinai, and with our fathers’ (Ac. 7:38) did not escape the vengeance of the divine law: ‘The way to escape shall fail them’ (Jb. 11:20): ‘Every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense’ (Heb. 2:2).

717. - The conclusion follows by arguing from the lesser case: If those who refused the one speaking upon earth did not escape, much less shall we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven; because we shall not be able to escape. For the one who speaks to us in the New Testament is Christ already in heaven: ‘The Lord Jesus, after he spoke to them, was taken up into heaven’ (Mk 16:19); ‘From heaven he made you to hear his voice that he might teach you’ (Dt. 4:36). Therefore, the doctrine of the Old Testament is the doctrine of Christ speaking on earth for two reasons: because there under the figure of earthly things He spoke of heavenly things; furthermore, He promised earthly things there. But the doctrine of the New Testament is that of Christ speaking from heaven, because we turn earthly things into signs of heavenly things by a mystical interpretation. Likewise, heavenly things are promised in it: ‘For your reward is great in heaven’ (Mt. 5:12); ‘If I speak to you of earthly things and you do not believe; how will you believe, if I speak to you of heavenly things?’ (Jn. 3:12).

718. - Then he compares the two testaments in regard to the efficacy of the speaking. As to the efficacy of the Old Testament’s speaking he says, His voice then shook the earth, i.e., wrought many changes on earth, namely, by the signs in Egypt, by the division of the sea, by the earthquake in the desert: ‘The earth was moved: and the heavens dropped at the presence of the God of Sinai, at the presence of the God of Israel’ (Ps. 67:10). This signified that all that speaking moved their hearts by earthly promises.

719. - Then when he says, but now he has promised, he deals with the efficacy of the New Testament and proves it by the authority of a prophet, and then explains it.

720. - That authority is found in Hag (2:7) but not according to our version; for we have: ‘Yet one little while, and I will move the heaven and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.’ But the Apostle says, Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven. But the sense is the same. And it is clear that those words were uttered near the end of the time of the Old Testament, namely, after the return from captivity; at which time nothing remained of the Old Testament. Therefore, it is clear that what was promised was to be fulfilled in the New Testament, namely, the new heaven and the new earth: ‘Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth’ (Is. 65:17). This creation was shown to John in the spirit: ‘And I saw a new heaven and a new earth’ (Rev. 21:1). For in that new creation the heavens will be moved. But heaven can be taken in two senses: in one way for the ethereal heaven and that will be cleansed by the fire of the final conflagration, as has been stated above. In another way, the starry heaven, which will not be cleansed, but will be changed to a new state: for it will cease its motion and the clarity of its parts will be increased, because ‘The light of the moon will be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun seven times brighter’ (Is. 30:26). He says, therefore, but now, i.e., through the New Testament, he promises, saying, Yet once more and I will shake not only the earth but also the heaven.

721. - Then when he says, This phrase, ‘Yet once more,’ indicates the removal of what is shaken, he explains the words of the prophecy; and he lays great stress on the phrase, Yet once more. For in saying, yet, he shows that they are moveable; but in saying, once more, he indicates that they are to be changed from the state of movability and corruptibility to a state of incorruption and immutability. For if they were to remain in a state of changeableness after that change, he would not have said, once more, but ‘again and again.’ This is against Origen who believed that the world will be renewed an infinitude of time and be recovered. He says, therefore: and in that he says, ‘Yet once more,’ he indicates the removal of what is shaken, to a state of immovableness. And as though someone were asking whether God can do this, he adds, as of what has been made. For all things made are subject to God’s power; hence, just as God made them from nothing, so He can change them as He wills. And this in order that what cannot be shaken may remain, i.e., that are immovable, i.e., that they remain immovable as to their essences, but changed as to certain accidental dispositions: ‘As a vesture you will change them, and they shall be changed’ (Ps. 101:28). This has been explained in chap. 1. From all this it is clear that although the things of the Old Testament were moved, it was not to a state of incorruption and immutability; but this is done only in the New, to signify that the promises of the Old Testament were changeable, but not those of the New.

722. - Then when he says, Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, he reaches the main conclusion. For after commending in many ways the grace and benefits conferred and to be conferred upon us by Christ, his main desire is to induce us to serve Him. he concludes that inasmuch as immovable things are promised in the New Testament, we should serve Christ Who promised them, in fear and reverence. And that is the principal conclusion.

723. - Hence, he first recalls the favor granted, saying, therefore, inasmuch as God promises a heaven and an immovable earth, by which are signified the immovable and eternal good things to come, let us be grateful, i.e., give thanks: ‘Thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift’ (2 Cor. 9:15). And receive, because we receive, if not the reality, yet in the hope of the promise, a kingdom that cannot be shaken: ‘Your kingdom is a kingdom of all ages’ (Ps. 144:13); ‘Of his kingdom there will be no end’ (Lk. 1:33). Or by, receiving, is understood the gift of grace, which we receive in the present as a pledge of future glory. Therefore, he says: Therefore receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, i.e., of future glory, which is promised to us: ‘Fear not, little flock, because it has pleased your Father to give you a kingdom’ (Lk. 12:32). For what we hope for, we have, namely, the grace we have received as a beginning of glory. For if nature is not lacking in what is necessary, much less God. Therefore, He gives us the hope of that kingdom, and consequently, the grace, by which we may arrive at it: ‘We have access by faith into grace’ (Rom. 5:2); ‘The Lord will give grace and glory’ (Ps. 83:12).

724. - He continues thus: and so let us offer to God acceptable worship. Here he comes to the service as something required of us. For natural reason dictates that we are obligated to show reverence and honor to anyone from whom we receive many favors; therefore, much more to God, Who has given us the greatest things and has promised us an infinitude of them. Hence, he says that by that grace, namely, given and to be given to us, let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe. For it is not enough merely to serve God, which can be done by outward action; we must also please Him by a right intention and by love: ‘He pleased God and was beloved’ (Wis. 4:10); ‘I will please the Lord in the land of the living’ (Ps. 114:9). But God is especially served by an inward service: ‘Let us serve him in holiness and justice’ (Lk. 1:74). Now by reason of creation God is called Lord, but by reason of regeneration, Father. But to a Lord fear is owed, and to a Father love and reverence: ‘The son honors the father, and the servant fears his lord. If I am your father, where is my honor; and if I am your Lord, where is my fear’ (Mal. 1:6). Therefore, the Lord should be served in fear and in reverence: ‘Serve the Lord in fear; and rejoice unto him with trembling’ (Ps. 2:11).

725. - That we should serve God in that manner he proves by the authority of Deuteronomy (4:24): For our God is a consuming fire. When God is said to be a fire, it does not mean that He is something corporeal, but it is because intelligible things are designated by sense-perceptible things, among which fire has greater nobility and clarity; and greater activity; and a higher natural place; and is more cleansing and more consuming. Therefore, God is especially called fire on account of His clarity, because He inhabits light inaccessible (1 Tim. 6:16), and because He is supremely active: ‘You have worked all our works in us’ (Is. 26:12), and He is in a loftier place: ‘The Lord is high above all nations; and his glory above the heavens’ (Ps. 112:4). Furthermore, he cleanses and as it were, consumes sins; hence, he says that he is a consuming fire: ‘He is like a refining fire’ (Mal. 3:2); and he continues: ‘And he shall purify the sons of Levi’; ‘making purgation of sins’ (Heb. 1:3). He also consumes sinners by punishing: ‘But a certain dread in expectation of judgement and the rage of a fire that shall consume the adversaries’ (Heb. 10:27). Therefore, because such things are promised to us: ‘And the light of Israel shall be as a fire, and the Holy One thereof as a flame’ (Is. 10:17); ‘A fire shall go before them and shall burn up enemies round about’ (Ps. 96:3), we should strive to serve and please God.
