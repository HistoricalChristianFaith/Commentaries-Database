Here a reviling from enemies is exposed. There: "All your enemies rail against you." That is, the Idumeans, the Moabites, and other enemies rail by accusing.

Then: "they hiss" by detracting. "they gnash their teeth" by threatening. Also: "they cry: 'We have destroyed her!'" by insulting her. As Psalm 22 (21):13 states: "They open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion." Also, Jeremiah 51:34 asserts: "Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon has devoured me, he has crushed me." And Psalm 35 (34): 21 reports: "They open wide their mouths against me; they say, 'Aha, Aha! our eyes have seen it'."
