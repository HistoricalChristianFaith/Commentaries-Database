Those events occurring around destruction are viewed here in particular. First, are lamented those events conjoined to the destruction, second, those events following. Onward in Verse 13 such is expressed: "What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem?" etc.

As to events joined to destruction two ideas are advanced. First is bewailed the destruction of common edifices, second, the eminent edifices. As later Verse 6 comments: "He has broken down his booth like that of a garden, laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts."

Regarding destruction of common edifices two further ideas are proposed. First is bewailed destruction itself, that pertains to the king's might, second, what pertains to the people's use. As further on Verse 4 says: "He has bent his bow like an enemy; with his right hand set like a foe; and he has slain all the pride of our eyes in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire."

To the very destruction itself of edifices two more notions are set forth. First is bewailed destruction itself, second, the unavailing resistence. As Verse 3 states: "He has cut down in fierce anger all the might of Israel; he has withdrawn from them his right hand in the face of the enemy."

Three more ideas are again proposed as to destruction itself. First is lamented events that relate to decorum and dignity. Verse 2 thus says: "The Lord has destroyed without mercy all the habitations of Jacob." And, the prophet Joel 1:19 declares: "Unto thee, O Lord, I cry. For fire has devoured the pastures of the wilderness."

Second is lamented events pertaining to fortitude and courage. As Verse 2 continues: "in his wrath he has broken down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. While the prophet Isaiah 25:12 says: "And the high fortifications of his walls he will bring down, lay low, and cast to the ground, even to the dust." Also, Jeremiah 33:4 records: "For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah which were torn down to make siege mounds and before the sword."

Third, the violent detriment of the kingdom is ended.

As Verse 2 concludes: "he has brought down to the ground in dishonor the kingdom and its rulers." The prophet Ezekiel 28:8 exclaims: "They shall thrust you down into the Pit, and you shall die the death of the slain in the heart of the seas."
