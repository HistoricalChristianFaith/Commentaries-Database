The destruction of the miserable is mouxtned, due to reverence for their status. First, regarding elders who: "sit on the ground in silence." Namely, as signs of great sadness. Like Job: 2:13: "And they set with him on the ground seven days and nights and no one spoke a word for him, for they saw thatt his suffering was very great."

Second, the destruction of virgins is mourned. As Verse 10 finally claims: "the maidens of Jerusalem have bowed their heads to the ground." That is, the maidens around the ark of the covenant, or tabernacle, as daughters of the temple priests. Again: "have bowed their heads to the ground." That is, as a sign of sadness. And as "maidens of Jerusalem": insofar as they dwell in this city. Also: "They have cast dust on their heads and put on sackcloth," That is, in their confusion and fear.

Then: "the maidens of Jerusalem". Namely, and those maidens who dwell elsewhere throughout the kingdom. For Isaiah 3:24 states: "Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness."
