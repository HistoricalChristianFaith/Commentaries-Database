Here the judge and his justice is commended: "Thou hast taken up my cause, O Lord, thou hast redeemed my life." That is, during past times. As concurs Psalm 43 (42):l: "Vindicate me, O God, and defend my cause against an ungodly people."

Then Verse 59 continues: "Thou hast seen the wrong done to me, O Lord; judge thou my cause." The benevolence of the divine judge is here accounted for.
