Vindication from adversaries is here sought. This is due to a security from' prayers heard, and vindication considered. Such is also from their foretelling, than their praying.

Thus, two more notions are given: "Thou wilt requite them, O Lord, according to the work of their hands." Namely, as to their penalties. For, Psalm 28 (27):24 states: "Requite them according, to their work, and according to the evil of their deeds."

Second, a determination of their penalty is evaluated. First, regards its duration: "Thou wilt give them dullness of heart; thy curse will be on them." Namely, the sin by which they made you labor.

Besides, Isaiah 1:14 claims: "I am weary of bearing them." That is, since you (O Lord) restore a shield against their sins from their heart. So that, they are not to be penetrated by arrows of divine grace, and the sword of thy word (O Lord). Hence Job 41:15 can say: "His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal."

Third, the determination of penalty to their 'body is accounted for: "Thou wilt pursue them in anger and destroy them from under thy heavens, O Lord." That is, through different afflictions."

Finally, is considered up to the time you (O Lord) destroy them by death, and eternal damnation. That is" under thy heaven O Lord. Namely, those persons who would desire to reside in these heavens. For, Jeremiah elsewhere declares: "Bring upon them the day of evil; destroy them with double destruction!" (Jer 17:18). And Psalm 83 (82):l5: "So do thou pursue them with thy tempest and terrify them with thy hurricane."
