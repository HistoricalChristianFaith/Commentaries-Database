Here is lamented the captivity itself, and around this idea three propositions are advanced. First is proposed an acknowledgment of the justice from a judge. As expressed: "The Lord is in the right, for I have rebelled against his word." And as the prophet Daniel declares: "for the Lord our God is righteous in all the works which he has done" (Dan 9:14).

Secondly, the benevolence of hearers is viewed, provoking them into compassion. As said: "but hear, all you peoples, and behold my suffering." That is: "But hear: cities of Zion, (Judah)." As Jeremiah exclaims: "they shout against the cities of Judah." (Jer 4:l6).

Thirdly, the misery during captivity is lamented. As Verse 18 concludes: "my maidens and my young men have gone into captivity." That is, due to the strength of their age they evade death through famine, as they have gone into captivity." And as Jeremiah 51:34 states: "he has filled his belly with my delicacies, he has rinsed me out."
