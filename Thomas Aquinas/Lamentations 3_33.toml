The divine mercy regarding relaxation of punishments is displayed. So first is considered an absolution from penalities: "For the Lord will not cast off forever". Since, the Lord does not forever punish. Because Psalm 94 (93):14 claims: "For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage." And Isaiah 28:28 remarks: "Does one crush bread grain? No, he does not threst it forever."

Second, divine mercy, in relation to divine piety as to reason, is considered. For, though the Lord causes grief, he will have compassion according "to the abundance of his steadfast love", because, it from such a portion of divine piety (of God the Father) that one punishes in order to correct, then one comforts. For, the Book of Tobit 4:21 states: "Do not be afraid, my son, because we have become poor. You have great wealth, if you fear God and refrain from every sin and do what is pleasing in his sight." Therefore, out of love for humankind is said: "For he does not willingly afflict or grieve the Sons of men." That is, he apportions from his divine love. Since Psalm 36 (35):7 declares: "The children of men take refuge in the shadow of thy wings."
