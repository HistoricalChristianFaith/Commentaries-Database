A reason for the incurable pain is here assigned. For, doctors, in their practice, neglect to cure, just as do prophets. So, first is shown the falseness of prophets, while they foretell false ideas. As Verse 14 states: "Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions." That is they claim seeing what are proven," false and deceptive visions.

Now, it had been stupid to believe the Lord God would not punish sinners. As the prophet Ezekiel 22:28 declares: "And her prophets have daubed for them with whitewash, seeing false visions and divining lies for them." And, St Peter, the Apostle writes: "But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you" (2 Peter 2:1).

Then, as to the above ideas prophets were silent. So Verse 14 continues: "they have not exposed your iniquities to restore your fortunes". Just like the prophet Isaiah 58:1 exclaims: "Cry aloud, spare not, lift up your voice like a trumpet; declare to my people their transgression, to the house of Jacob their sins."

Second, false visions, prophets see and are exposed. As Verse 14 concludes;"but have seen for you oracles false and misleading". Namely, like pressing burdens, like any burden from on high quite restricts anyone. For, Michah, the prophet states: "Thus says the Lord concerning the prophets who lead my people astray, who cry 'Peace' when they have something to eat." (Mic 3:5).

Regarding."oracles false and misleading" are false freedoms. As Jeremiah 28:11 says: "And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, 'Thus says the Lord: Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations within two years'." Or: "oracles": that the Lord God will bring you to himself, "misleading", that he will cast your enemies aside.
