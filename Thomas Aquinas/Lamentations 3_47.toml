Second, there is a description of prophets whom they ought to be protected against their enemies. Since Verse 47 says: "panic and pitfall have come upon us, devastation and destruction." That is, sheer panic, as cause of fear before captivity. And, "pitfall": within such captivity.

Then: "devastation": after the captivity and "destruction": from false prophets. For Isaiah 24:17 says: "Terror, and the pit, and the snare are upon you, O inhabitants of the earth!"

Third, compassion is considered. As: "My eyes flow with rivers of tears because of the destruction of the daughter of my people." Namely, as one imploring, due to singular miseries. Thus Psalm 119 (118): 136 expresses: "My eyes shed streams of tears, because men do not keep thy law."
