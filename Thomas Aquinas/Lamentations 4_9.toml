Here in Verse 9 is considered a comparison. As said: "Happier were the victims of the sword than the victims of hunger, who pined away, stricken by want of the fruits of the field." That is, they were cast down, as soon as they were afflicted. As the Book of Sirach says: "Death is better than a miserable life, and eternal rest than chronic sickness" (Sir 30:17).
