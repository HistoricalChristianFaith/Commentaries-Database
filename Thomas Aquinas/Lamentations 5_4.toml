Here particular miseries are viewed which the people suffer. As stated: "We must pay for the water we drink," Namely, because of the people's slavery, and due to their affliction. As Verse 9 records: "We get our bread at the peril of our lives, because of the sword in the wilderness."

As to the people's slavery are two further notions. First is the slavery in itself, and then its exaggeration. As said in Verse 7: "Our fathers sinned, and are no more; and we bear their iniquities."

On the people's slavery in itself are two more ideas. One regards the people's slavery as they suffered loss of possessions. As Verse 4 declares: "We must pay for the water we drink, the wood we get must be bought." And as Deuteronomy 2:6 repeats: "and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink."
