Here in Verse 3 the misery throughout the captivity's periods is exposed, as to its magnitude. Such is twofold: first, the servitude itself is lamented regarding suppression of human kind, second as to its possessions. As expressed further on in Verse 7 ("Zain"): "When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was none to help her, the foe gloated over her, mocking at her downfall."

The first part, (servitude itself) is divided twofold. First, misery from oppression is loudly bewailed. Secondly, the reason for this misery is shown. As Verse 8 "Heth", declares: "Jerusalem sinned grievously, therefore she became filthy; all who honored her despise her, for they have seen her nakedness; yea, she herself groans, and turns her face away."

As to misery from oppression there are two more notions: First this misery is bewailed as to a present affliction sustained, second, as to an affliction recalled. As Verse 7 "'Zain" states: "Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and bitterness all the precious things that were hers from days of old" etc..

Regarding present affliction there sustained, three further ideas are also presented. First, is the misery itself as to persons fleeing, second as to those remaining. As expressed in Verse 24' "Daleth": "The roads to Zion mourn, for none come to the appointed feasts; all her gates are desolate, her priests groan; her maidens have been dragged away, and she herself suffers bitterly."

Thirdly are those captives, as pointed out in Verse 5: "He": "Her foes have become the head, her enemies prosper, because, the Lord has made her suffer for the multitude of her transgressions; her children have gone away, captives before the foe."

Regarding the misery of those fleeing three notes are made. First, as to the flight itself, as Verse 3 says: "Judah has gone into exile because of affliction and hard servitude." That is, regarding persons fleeing from the land of Judah to the lands of their neighbors.

And: "because of affliction" (on the people) and hard servitude": through taxes, or tributes. For these persons did suffer on the lands of the Chaldaeans. The prophet Isaiah 16:3 states: "Hide the outcasts, betray not the fugitive; let the outcast of Moab sojourn among you;". Again: Isaiah 2l:l5 declares: "To the thirsty bring water, meet the fugitive with bread, O in habitants of the land of Tema. For, they have fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow, and from the press of battle."

Secondly, the imminent straits of those fleeing is bewailed. As Verse 3 says: "she dwells among the nations". That is, among the Moabites and the Ismahelites. Then, "but finds no resting place". For, even there an obstacle was suffered by them. Also, in Deuteronomy 28:65 is asserted: "And among these nations you shall find no ease, and there shall be no rest for the sole of sour foot.

Thirdly, is predicted obstacles in overcoming the power of enemies. As stated in Verse 3: "her pursuers (the Chaldaeans)have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress".

This distress was experienced even towards whom the people fled to, just like in Egypt. As Jeremiah 12:l6 declares: "Then the sword which you fear shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt; and the famine of which you are afraid shall follow hard after you to Egypt; and there you shall die."

To this Verse 3 the Hebrew letter "Ghimel" is set forth, which is interpreted as "a plentitude". Because, for a plentitude of their sins the people suffer a plentitude of miseries. As Matthew 23:32 expresses this: "Fill up then the measure of your father". And Luke declares: "For the measure you give will be the measure you get back" (Lk 6:38).

Allegorically, the word "Judah" in Verse 3 refers to the Church, as joined to Christ. The words also in Verse 3: " has gone into exile

because of affliction", connote hostages. And there are hostages among hostages among whom one seeks peace. Then: "but finds no resting place": like one oppressed at will by everyone. Moreover, the word "Judah" in Verse 3 may mean a soul that ought to believe in God.

Then, Verse 3 continues: "has gone into exile," Namely , into corruptions and demons. And: "but finds no resting place": by fleeing such corruptions and demons.

Then is said: "her pursuers". That is, such demons "have all overtaken her in the midst of her distress": in death.
