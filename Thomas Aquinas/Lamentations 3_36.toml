A contention from divine justice is here advanced. First is eliminated a tyrannical oppression from divine justice. As stated: "To crush under foot": like a tyrant, who externally opposes any judgment. Then: "all the prisoners of the earth". Namely, all those afflicted. To which Psalm 69 (68):33 can refer: "For the Lord hears the needy, and does not despise his own that are in bonds."

Second, perversity of a judge is excluded: "to turn aside the right of man in the presence of the Most High". That is, from rectitude. Add to Verse 36: "the Lord does not approve." And, Job: 34:12: "Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice."

Third, a perverse 1ntention within divine justice is also excluded. Like to those judges, under a guise of justice, intend to oppress some persons. As said: "To subvert a man in his cause, the Lord does not approve." That is, from judgment: "the Lord does not approve." As Proverbs 4:27 admonishes: "Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil."
