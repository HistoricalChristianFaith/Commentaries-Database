The wonders of seeing are here exposed. First, as to seeing friends, second as to enemies. There: "All your enemies rail against you; they hiss, they gnash their teeth, they cry: 'We have destroyed her'" (Verse 16).

Regarding friends their compassion is expressed by four signs. First, by the clap of hands: "all who pass along the way clap their hands at you." Namely, along the way upon the earth, seeing the earth's vastness.

Then,"they hiss" by a movement of their head. And,"wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem".

Then so, by word: "Is this the city which was called the perfection of beauty, the joy of all the earth?"

Because, in both spiritualities and temporalities (Jerusalem) was: "the joy of all the earth". For peoples assembled there in solemnities. And Psalm 48(47):2 declares: "beautiful in elevation is the joy of all the earth, Mount Zion, in the far north, the city of the great king."
