Here the people's slavery is exaggerated. So, first are viewed the conditions of those enslaved, as they are being punished for the sins of others. As said: "Our fathers sinned, and are no more, and we bear their iniquities." Since our fathers have died: "we bear their iniquities", while sustaining their punishments.

On the contrary, the prophet Ezekiel claims: "The word of the Lord came to me again: 'What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel,"The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge"? (Ezek 18:1-2). Solutions can then be declared. As in Exodus 20:5: "for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation." And Deuteronomy 32:41 asserts: "I will take vengeance on my adversaries, and will requite those who hate me."
