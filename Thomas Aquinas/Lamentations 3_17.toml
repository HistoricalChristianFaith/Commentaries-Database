The afflictions are here pursued. As claimed: "He has made my teeth grind on gravel, and made me cower in ashes." That is, like to the warriors by whom defended, and like to teeth of beasts on gravel. So, nothing remains except"in ashes as if worthless. And since Psalm 102 (lOl):9 declares; "For I eat ashes like bread, and mingle tears with my drink."

Verse 17 then states: "My soul is bereft of peace." Here is assumed a rejection: My soul is bereft": of God's divine mercy. Like Psalm 89(88)':39 declares: "Thou has renounced the covenant with thy servant; thou hast defiled his crown in the dust."

Verse 17 concludes: "I have forgotten what hap piness is". Namely, due to the experience of evils. For, Sirach 11:27 claims: "The misery of an hour makes one forget luxury."
