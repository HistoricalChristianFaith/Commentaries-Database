Jerusalem begins to be captured by the divine king himself. About this notion three further views are proposed. First is expressed the precise distress, second, Judah (Jerusalem) is accused of faults by enemies. As Verse 21 later declares: "Hear how I groan; there is none to comfort me."

Third, Judah (Jerusalem) seeks vindication. As Verse 2? later on says: "Let all their evil-doing come before thee; and deal with them as thou hast dealt with me because of all my transgressions.

About the precise distress during the captivity there is excited attention. For, this Verse 20 says: "Behold, O Lord, for I am in distress, my soul is in tumult. In reference, Psalm 5l(50):l declares: "Have mercy on me, O God, according to thy steadfast love; according to thy abundant mercy blot out my transgressions."

As to the accusation of faults by enemies, there is metaphorically expressed a grief that is interior, and a nearness to one's heart. So, Verse 20 says: "my heart is wrung within me because I have been very rebellious." Such is already exposed above. But elsewhere Jeremiah 4:3l says: "For I heard the cry of a woman in travail, anguish as of one bringing forth her first child."

Also, the Book of Ruth 1:20 declares: "She said to them 'Do not call me Naomi, call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me!". And, Deuteronomy 32:14 says: "If I whet my glittering sword, and my hand takes hold on judgment.
