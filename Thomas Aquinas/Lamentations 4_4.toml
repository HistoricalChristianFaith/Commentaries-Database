Here in Verse 4 is considered an effect, namely, the thirst of children. As said here in Verse 4: "The tongue of the nursling cleaves to the roof of its mouth for thirst; the children be~ for food but no one gives to them." That is, due to dryness. And,"the children beg for food". Namely, those who are growing could use solid food. As the prophet Amos claims: "In that day fair virgins and the young men shall faint for thirst." And also above in Chapter 2:12: "They cry to their mothers, 'Where is bread and wine?'" as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city, as their life is poured out'on their mothers' bosom" (Amos: 8:13)
