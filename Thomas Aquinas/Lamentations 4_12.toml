Here is shown the fact (of the destruction) to be awesome. Since, first it was incredible. As said: "The kings of the earth did not believe or any of the inhabitants of the world," That is, since there had been powerful kings over this city, (Jerusalem). And: "that foe": openly violent, or "enemy": falsely hidden. As Isaiah 23:1 states: "The oracle concerning Tyre. 'Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or haven! From the land of Cyprus it is revealed to them." And also Isaiah 30:13: "whose crash comes suddenly, in an instant."
