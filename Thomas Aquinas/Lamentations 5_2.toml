Verse 2 considers the people's affliction. First, in general, second by going down to particular persons. As expressed in Verse 11: "Women are ravished in Zion, virgins in the towns of Judah."

As to the people's affliction in general are two ideas. First is excluded those things by which ~ople are sustained against miseries. Namely, as to their possessions, passed over to enemies control. As Verse 2 states: "Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to aliens." Also, as Chapter 1:10 says: "The enemy has stretched out his hands over all her precious things." And, Jeremiah 6:12 states: "Their houses shall be turned over to others, their fields and wives together."
