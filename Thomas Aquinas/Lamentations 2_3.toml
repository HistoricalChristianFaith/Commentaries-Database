Herein Verse 3 is expressed the impotency for resisting. First is excluded human strength, or power. As said: "all the might of Israel." For, Psalm 75(74):10 claims: "All the horns of the wicked he will cut off, but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted."

Second is excluded any divine power. As Verse 3 continues: "he has withdrawn from them his right hand in the face of the enemy." That is, like any defense by which (the Lord God) came down upon them. Psalm 74(73):ll so refers: "Why dost thou hold back thy hand, why dost thou keep thy right hand in thy bosom?"

Third, Verse 3 concludes regarding the fire of Jacob on the earth. It says: "he has burned like a flaming fire in Jacob, consuming all around." Also Isaiah 42:25 records: "it set him on fire round about, but he did not understand; it burned him, but he did not take it to heart."
