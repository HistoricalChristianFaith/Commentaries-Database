Then is considered in Verse 10 the effects of famine. As stated: "our skin is hot as an oven." That is, dried up by hunger. And: "with the burning heat of famine." As if being obsessed, and fleeing the famine, the people suffered a long time. Like the prophet Hosea 7:6 says: "For like an oven their hearts burn with intrigue." And Job: 19:20: "My bones cleave to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth.
