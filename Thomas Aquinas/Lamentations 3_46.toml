Benevolence on the enemy's part, excitement against indications of evil inflicted by the enemy, are here viewed. First is noticed the preparation for capturing, second, the captivity itself. Thus, Verse 52 states: "I have been hunted like a bird by those who were my enemies without cause."

To the idea, preparation for capturing, three more references are made. First is the enemies' preparation: "All our enemies rail against us". (Verse 46). That is, as if to devour us. So Psalm 22 (21):l3 says: "They open wide their mouths at me, like a ravening and roaring lion."
