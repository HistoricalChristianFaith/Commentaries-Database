Here is bewailed the destruction of edifices relating to defense. About this idea three further aspects are expressed. First is touched upon the indignation of the Lord God. As asserted: "The Lord has become like an enemy And Isaiah 63:10: "therefore he turned to be their enemy, and himself fought against them." Also, Psalm 44(43): "For our soul is bowed down to the dust; our body cleaves to the ground."

He has broken down his booth like that of a garden, laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts; the Lord has brought to an end in Zion appointed feast and sabboth, and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest."
