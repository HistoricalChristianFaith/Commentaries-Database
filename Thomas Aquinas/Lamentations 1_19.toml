Here is the consumption of health of those ones killed by the famine during the siege. So, first is indicated deception from friends: "I called to my lovers but they deceived me". That is, just like the Egyptians, since they did not help me, as I (Jerusalem) hoped for. As, Isaiah, the prophet declares: "For Egypt's help is worthless and empty, therefore I have called her 'Rahab who sits still'" (Is:30:7).

Secondly, the consumption from the fact of the situation is considered. As expressed: "my priests and elders," Namely, as regarding the consumption they are considered as an indignity. Also: "perished in the city." As the prophet Isaiah 5:13 states: "Their honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst."

Thirdly, a reason for this consumption of health is assigned. As Verse 19 concludes: "while they sought food." That is: " to revive their strength". Namely, to revive themselves, while they cannot find any food.

Again, a reason for their need is assigned. For they (priests and elders) sought food for themselves, and not for their people. As the prophet Ezekiel 3L1':2 declares: "O shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?"
