The people's slavery is also exaggerated by the conditions of those enslaving, or dominating. As Verse 8 says: "Slaves rule over us; there is none to deliver us from their hand." Namely, just as the Moabites and the Idumaeans, and other neighbors, by whom they were first dominated.

As Proverbs reminds us: "Under three things the earth trembles; under four it can not bear up: A slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food; an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maid when she succeeds her mistress." (Prov: 30:21-22-23).
