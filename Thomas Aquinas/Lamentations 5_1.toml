Here in Chapter 5, the prophet, after many lamentations, addressed himself for a remedy by prayer. So, he first exposes the people's misery, second, he seeks mercy. As expressed in Verse 19: "But thou, O Lord, dost reign for ever; thy throne endures to all generations."

The first idea (the people's misery) has two aspects. First, the people's misery, in itself is exposed, second, the people's goods that were lost. As said in Verse 14: "The old men have quit the city gate, the young men their music."

Around the first (misery in itself) are two notations. First, in Verse 1 is aroused attention: "Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us;". That is, be attentive to our misery itself. And, as said in Chapter 3:19: "Remember my affliction and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall!"

So, Verse 1 says: "Remember, O Lord, what has befallen us."Which states, as if, hold in attention. Then: "behold": with such attention fix your consideration,"and see our disgrace!"
