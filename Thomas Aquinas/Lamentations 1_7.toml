Here in Verse 7 is recounted the misery within a memory of past events. First is touched upon the very memory of events in past afflictions. Such, when recalled, excite a weariness. As said: "Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and bitterness". That is, during those sins that excite a remorse of conscience.

Then: "all the precious things that were hers from days of old". Namely, as to prosperities causing an arousal of concupiscences. As the prophet Isaiah states: "But what can I say? For he has spoken to me, and he himself has done it. All my sleep has fled because of the bitterness of my soul" (Is: 38:15).

Secondly is pointed out the sufferings from present evils. As is said: "When her people fell into the hand of the foe, and there was none to help her". And as Psalm 22[2]:l says: "Be not far from me, for trouble is near and there is none to help."

Thirdly is set forth a contempt of the foe. As expressed: "The foe gloated over her, mocking at her downfall." Namely, as to things pertaining to the cult of religion. And as I Maccabees 1:39 says: "her feasts were turned into mourning, her sabboths into a reproach, her honor into contempt."

The expositions of the rhetorical position and the mystical sense (of the remaining fifteen Hebrew alphabet letters: "Zain"to "Tau" are touched upon in the "Glosses".
