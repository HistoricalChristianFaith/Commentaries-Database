627. - Having described the things done through faith by the fathers before and during the very entry into the promised land, the Apostle now begins to give examples of those who were in the promised land. But because there were so many, he recites their deeds in a general way and, after giving the names of the fathers, he tells why he must be brief. In regard to this he does three things: first, he gives the names of the fathers and the reason why he passes over their deeds quickly; secondly, he shows what they did by faith (v. 34); thirdly, what they received by faith (v. 33b).

628. - He says, therefore: And what more shall I say? As if to say: I have come to the time they entered the promised land, regarding which a few things remain to be said. For so many things remain to be said that they cannot be explained: For time would fail me to tell of them, i.e., if I wanted to tell of them, there would be insufficient time to do so in a letter, which should be brief. Hence, Jerome writes to Paulinus: ‘The space of an epistle does not allow me to say more.’ Or it can mean the time of life. This is the way John speaks (19.25): ‘But there are also many other signs which Jesus did; which if they were written every one, the world itself, I think, would not be able to contain the books that should be written.’ Where a Gloss says that he is using hyperbole. This is not false, but a figure of speech. In Ps. 39 (v. 6) where we have: ‘I have declared and I have spoken; they are multiplied above number,’ Jerome’s letter says: If I wanted to describe them, there are more than can be described.’

629. - Yet it should be noted that some of them did some good things, and some evil things. Hence, they are listed here only as to the good things they did or received. Yet it is probable that all of them finally were saints. For this reason the Apostle lists them in the catalogue of saints. First, therefore, he mentions Gideon, whose story appears in Judges (chaps. 6-8). He is mentioned first, both because he did nothing evil and because he did something very important; and probably because he received the greatest sign of the incarnation in the fleece and dew, concerning which it says in Ps. 71 (v. 6): ‘He shall come down like rain upon the fleece.’ Secondly, he mentions Barak in Judges (chaps. 4-5), who was not as famous as Gideon, to whom that victory was not credited, but to the woman. Perhaps this is why he passes him by. Thirdly, he mentions Samson Jg (chaps. 13-16), who particularly deserves not to be mentioned here, because he sinned by killing himself. But Augustine in The City of God excuses this, because it is believed that he did this at God’s command. The sign of this is that he could not have destroyed such a house by his own power, but by God’s power, which does not cooperate with evil. Fourthly, he mentions Jephthah in Judges (chaps. 11-12), whom he lists after Samson, because he did not do the great things the latter did.

630. - But there is a question about Jephthah, whether he sinned by immolating his daughter as he vowed. For it seems not, because Judges (11:29) says: ‘The spirit of the Lord came upon Jephthah’ and then mentions the vow and the victory. But Jerome says the contrary, namely, that he was indiscreet in vowing and guilty in paying. I answer that something from the Holy Spirit was there, namely, an impulse to vow in general that he would immolate whatever he came upon that could be immolated; but there was also something from his own spirit, namely, that he immolated what he should not. In this he sinned, but later he repented. Similarly, Gideon sinned by making an ephod and tempting God, when he asked for a sign on the fleece. But he also repented later, as did David, whom he mentions next, saying, David and Samuel, who are discussed in the Books of Samuel, and the prophets, concerning whom time would fail me, if I wished to discuss them.

631. - But the next question is whether all the ones listed were prophets. I answer that the Holy Spirit can move to three things: namely, to know, to speak and to do; and to each of them in two ways. Sometimes He moves to know by making him understand what is seen, as in the case of Isaiah and the other prophets; hence, they are called seers: ‘He that is now called a prophet, in time past was called a seer’ (1 Sam 9:9); but sometimes without an understanding of what is seen, as in Pharaoh’s dream and in Belshazzar’s vision. He also moves one to speak in two ways: sometimes to know what he says, as David, sometimes without knowing, as Caiaphas and perhaps Balaam. Similarly, He sometimes moves one to do something and to know what he is doing, as Jeremiah, who hid his girdle by the Euphrates (Jer. 13:5); and sometimes without knowing, as Augustine On John says of the soldiers who divided Christ’s garments among themselves without knowing the mystery to which that division was ordained. Therefore, it pertains to the notion of a prophet that he know what he sees or says or does. This is the way John says that Caiaphas prophesied, because he had something characteristic of prophecy. But the movement of the Holy Spirit is called an instinct by Augustine.

632. - Then (v. 33) he shows what the saints mentioned did: first, he shows this in general; secondly, by getting down to details (v. 33c). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions the merits of their deeds; secondly, the reward (v. 33b).

633. - In regard to the first it should be noted that of all the outward acts of the moral virtues, the acts of courage and justice seem the most important, because they pertain most to the common good. For the republic is defended against its enemies by courage, and is preserved by justice. Hence, the Apostle commends the holy fathers on both: on courage, when he says, by faith they conquered kingdoms, i.e., kings, or even their kingdoms, as David and Joshua. Nevertheless, the saints spiritually overcame kingdoms, namely the kingdom of the devil, of whom Job (41:25) says: ‘He is king over all the children of pride,’ and the kingdom of the flesh: ‘Let not sin reign in your mortal body’ (Rom. 6:12); also the kingdom of the world: ‘My kingdom is not of this world’ (Jn. 18:36). But they conquered by faith: ‘This is the victory which overcomes the world, our faith’ (1 Jn. 5:4). For no one can despise present things except for the sake of goods to come, because it is mainly by contempt that the world is overcome, therefore, because faith shows us the invisible things for which the world is despised, our faith overcomes the world.

634. - He comes then to the acts of justice when he says, wrought justice. For justice is sometimes a general virtue, namely, when it obeys the divine law: ‘The Lord is just and has loved justice’ (Ps. 10:8); ‘It is just to be subject to God’ (2 Macc 9:12); ‘He that does justice is just’ (1 Jn. 3:7). But sometimes it is a special virtue and consists in human actions and exchanges, namely, when a person renders to everyone his due. But the saints had both: ‘This is the inheritance of the servants of the Lord, and their justice with me, says the Lord’ (Is. 54:17); ‘If you desire wisdom, keep justice’ (Sir. 1:33), namely, by obeying the commandments, and also by exercising it toward the people: ‘I have done justice and judgment’ (Ps. 118:121).

635. - Then when he says, they received, he shows what they obtained, because they received the promises. For God’s promise is efficacious, because God never fails to keep His promise: ‘Whatever he has promised he is able to perform’ (Rom. 4:21); ‘The Lord is faithful in all his words’ (Ps. 1 44:13). But on the contrary he says above (11:13): ‘These dies according to faith, not having received the promises.’ I answer that what is said here can be understood in three ways: in one way, that God’s promise is the special one by which He promises the saints eternal life, which no one received before the coming of Christ: ‘To confirm the promises made to the fathers’ (Rom. 15:8); secondly, for the promise to inherit the promised land. This the earlier fathers, namely, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, did not receive, but the later ones did, as Joshua and the other saints. Thirdly, for a particular promise made to individuals, as to David a kingdom and to Hezekiah health; and these are the promises they obtained.

636. - Then (v. 33b) he mentions particular benefits conferred on them: first, those which pertain to the removal of evil; secondly, to the performing of good (v. 34b). But the evils harmful to man are of two kinds: one is external and the other internal. He mentions the second when he says, they won strength out of weakness. But external evils are of two kinds, because they are caused either by an irrational creature or a rational. The second of these is mentioned when he says, they escaped the edge of the sword. From irrational sources in two ways: living or non-living. He touches on harm inflicted by inanimate things when he says, quenched raging fire; by animate when he says, they stopped the mouths of lions.

637. - He speaks in the plural, although there was only, namely, Daniel, as it is also said in Matthew (2:20): ‘They are dead that sought the life of the child,’ for Herod was the only one who sought to kill the Child. The reason he does this is that he is speaking of all the saints generally, as of one college of saints; therefore, what one does he imputes to others and even to all, because it was done by the power of the Holy Spirit, which is common to all. Hence, even in that text he speaks as though of all. But it can also be said that this was completed in David who, as he says in 1 Sam (17:34). By the lion is spiritually understood the devil: ‘Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour’ (1 Pt 5:8). Therefore, one who represses his attacks stops the mouths of lions: ‘I broke the jaws of the wicked man; and out of his mouth I took away the prey’ (Jb. 29:17).

638. - He mentions removal of harm from inanimate things when he says, they quenched raging fire, as in the case of the three boys in Dan (chap. 3). Likewise, at the prayer of Moses and Aaron the fire was extinguished which had been sent by the Lord to devour the murmurers, as it says in Numbers (chap. 16). That fire is the internal impulse to concupiscence and anger. Therefore, one who restrains this impulse quenches the violence of fire: ‘Fire has fallen on them and they shall not see the sun’ (Ps. 57:9).

639. - The removal of evil from a rational creature is touched when he says, they escaped the edge of the sword, i.e., the attack of the enemy with sharp swords. But this happened to them very frequently, as is clear in the cases of Joshua, Gideon and David. But by the sword is understood an evil persuasion: ‘Their tongues a sharp sword’ (Ps. 56:7). One escapes those swords, when he puts an evil tongue to silenced: ‘Hedge in your ears with thorns, hear not a wicked tongue’ (Sir. 28:28); ‘The north wind drives away rain, as does a sad countenance a backbiting tongue’ (Pr. 25:23).

640. - Internal harm is infirmity, concerning whose removal he says, they won strength out of weakness, as appears particular in Hezekiah (2 Kg. 20:17). But that infirmity is sin: ‘Have mercy on me, O Lord, for I am weak’ (Ps. 6:3). Therefore, one who rises has recovered.

641. - Then when he says, they became valiant, he mentions the benefits as to the attainment of good; and he mentions three. The first pertains to the fact that acted valiantly; hence, he says, they became valiant in battle, as Joshua: ‘Valiant in war was Jesus, the son of Nun, who was successor of Moses’ (Sir. 46:1). The same is true of many others. The second pertains to the effect of that courage; hence, he says, they put foreign armies to flight, as in the cases of David and of the Maccabees: ‘If armies in camp should stand together against me, my heart shall not fear’ (Ps. 26:3). But the third pertains to the effect of divine courage; hence, he says, Women received their dead raised to life again, i.e., by the resurrection. Some who misunderstood this, explained their dead, i.e., their husbands, and argued that death does not dissolve the bond of marriage. This is false even if they should rise again. It is also against the Apostle in Romans (7:3): ‘If her husband be dead, she is delivered from the law of the husband.’ Hence, it should be noted that even in the effects of the sacraments there is a difference. For some sacraments imprint a character, as baptism, confirmation and Orders. And because a character remains in the soul forever, a baptized or confirmed or ordained person should not repeat any of those sacraments, if he rises again. But the other sacraments do not imprint a character, as penance, extreme unction, and the others. Therefore, because they cure something repeatable, they can be repeated: and among these is matrimony. Therefore, he does not say, ‘husbands,’ but their dead, because through the resurrection mothers received their dead sons, whose resurrection was a presage of the coming resurrection begun by Christ.

642. - An account of their resurrection or rather of their revival is found in 1 Kg. (chap. 17) and 2 Kg. (chap. 4). Yet thus revived, they died again: ‘But Christ rising from the dead dies now no more’ (Rom. 6:0); ‘Christ is risen from the dead the first fruits of them that sleep’ (1 Cor. 15:20). But just as those temporal benefits were given to them as to sick persons for sustenance by the merit of their faith, so they were the figures of coming good things, which will be given to us by the merit of faith: ‘And these signs shall follow them that believe. In my name they shall cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt him: they shall lay their hands upon the sick, and they shall recover’ (Mk 16:17). All of these Gregory explains of spiritual goods.
