Here is indicated arguments to wipe out despair. First, by divine mercy, second, be divine justice. As expressed in Verse 34: "To crush under foot all the prisoners of the earth." Third, by divine power. Which Verse 37 expresses: "Who has commanded and it came to pass, unless the Lord has ordained it?"

To the exclusion of despair by divine mercy, two further ideas are exposed. First, isshown mercy regarding a collection of benefits, second regarding a relaxation of punishments. As Verse 31: "For the Lord will not cast off forever."

Referring to divine mercy towards the collection of benefits three more notions are advanced. First is the memory of past benefits, second, the experience of present benefits. Verse 22 so states: "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases." Third, is the expectation of future benefits. Verse 25 thus states: "The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the soul that seeks him."

For the memory of past benefits three more ideas are referred to. First, the memory induces prophets towards God, as to a due consideration of evils encountered. While saying: O Lord God you seem dissimulating while forgetting us. So, "remember my affliction": freeing us from affliction, as to loss of possessions. And: "my bitterness": as to my fault that is the cause of so much misery. Also: "the wormwood and the gall," an affliction upon humankind.

Second, memory reduces itself to the benefits the people received. For Verse 20 states: "My soul continually thinks of it", the benefits.

And: "is bowed down within me". That is, memory fails from admiration, or desire. As Psalm 42 (41):4 says: "These things I remember, as I pour out my soul."

Third, memory results regards faithfulness. For Verse 21 claims: "But this I call to mind, and therefore I have hope." Hence Sirach 51:8 says."Then I remembered thy mercy, O Lord, and thy work from of old."
