Here is bewailed the captivity, and destruction of the city, (Jerusalem). So, first is considered the destruction itself, second,'the wonder from this fact. As said in Verse 12: "The kings of the earth did not believe, or any of the inhabitants of the world, that foe or enemy could enter the gates of Jerusalem."

Thirdly, is assigned the reason for such destruction. As said in Verse 13: "This was for the sins of her prophets and the iniquities of her priests, who shed in the midst of her the blood of the righteous." That is, leading toward the punishment: "the Lord gave full vent to his wrath." (Verse 11). And: "he poured out his hot anger", due to a determination for a punishment. For, the city, (Jerusalem) was "burnt" in fire which consumed its foundations." That is, evensoever by force, or even up to the very foundations each house was destroyed. As said in Deuteronomy 32:22: "For a fire is kindled by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol."
