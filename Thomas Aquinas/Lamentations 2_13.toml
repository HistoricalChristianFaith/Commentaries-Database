The consequences of destruction is accounted for. Namely the events accustomed to occur after prolonged negotiation. So, first is excluded cure for the plague, second, the wonders of witnessing the plague are considered. Thus, Verse 15 declares: "All who pass along the way clap their hands at you; they hiss and wag their heads at the daughter of Jerusalem."

Third, is the condemnation of the divine judge, who instituted a vindication. As Verse 17 says: "The Lord has done what he purposed, has carried out his threat."

On the cure for this plague, two more ideas are proposed. First is shown the incurable plague itself, second, a cause is assigned. As Verse 14 states: "Your prophets have seen for you false and deceptive visions; they have not exposed your iniquity to restore your fortunes."

On the incurable plague itself two further notions are advanced. First is shown what cannot be lessened by human compassion with mere comparison to other plagues. For instance, human consolation for those afflicted.

Verse 13 thus states: "What can I say for you, to what compare you, O daughter of Jerusalem?" Here a similitude is more than just a comparison. For, whatsoever distances of such reason are comparable, they are not distant "ad infinitum".

Nor, are such distances similiar, if contained within a like quality. Or, that all things have qualities, but only of those things of which one participating does not exceed the quality of another thing.

Now, pains within other situations exceed in the fact regarding what is missing in both temporal and spiritual glory, that other nations, or peoples lack. As Verse 13 continues: "What can I liken to you, that I may confort you, O Virgin daughter of Zion?"

This states, as if: there is nothing worse, or similar to other persons, to what things suffered by you. For Chapter 1:21 says in conclusion: "Bring thou the day thou has announded, and let them be as I am."

Second, is shown what cannot be cured medicinally, due to its magnitude. As verse 13 concludes: "For vast as the sea is your ruin; who can restore you?" Namely, the sea which is most wide and restless. For, Jeremiah 30:15 says: "Why do you cry out over your hurt? Your pain is incurable."
