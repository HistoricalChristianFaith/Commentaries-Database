Verse 4 laments destruction of possessions pertaining to people's use. First are those things that refer to defense. As Verse 5 later states: "The Lord has become like an enemy, he has destroyed Israel; he has destroyed all its palaces, laid in ruins its strongholds."

Regarding those possessions pertaining to their dignity, or decorum, three more notions are exposed. First is indicated the divine indignation. As said at the beginning of Verse 4: "He has bent his bow like an enemy." That is like to a judgment, or the army of the Chaldeans, as if borne from afar.

And: "set like a foe: in order to strike with his right hand, as he presses near." As Psalm 7:12 asserts: "If a man does not repent, God will whet his sword; he has bent and strung his bow."

Second, the infliction of punishment is considered. So, Verse 4 continues: "and he has slain all the pride of our eyes." Namely, people's edifices, and other possessions. As Book of Numbers 24:5 asserts: "How fair are your tents, O Jacob, your encampments, O Israel!"

Third, the magnitude of the punishment is shown, insofar to the extent without limits. As Verse 4 continues: "in the tent of the daughter of Zion; he has poured out his fury like fire," That is, like harassment. Or, as Deuteronomy 32:22 says: "For a fire is kindled

by my anger, and it burns to the depths of Sheol, devours the earth and its increase, and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains." Also, Psalm 69(68):24: "Pour out thy indignation upon them, and let thy burning anger overtake them."
