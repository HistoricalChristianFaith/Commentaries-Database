Here is loudly lamented the captivity of major persons. Around this idea three notations are made. First is set forth an omission of ornamentations. As stated: "From the daughter of Zion has departed all her majesty." For instance, like vases taken away, and treasures from both leaders and priests around Jehoiachin, nephew of Josiah. (cf: II Kings Chapter 24 ("Nebuchadnezzar Conquers Judah"). So, the prophet Ezekiel declares: "They shall also strip you of your clothes and take away your fine jewels." (Ez 23:26).

Secondly, is the necessity for supplies. As said: "Her princes have become like harts that find no pasture". That is, neither for themselves, or for their people. For, even bread is lacking within the city, when besieged at the time of Zedekiah. (cf. Jeremiah, Chapter 31 ("The Lord is Our Righteousness"). And the prophet Isaiah records: "And the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down, her throng and he who exults her." (Is 5:l4).

Thirdly, the captivity of leaders is considered. As stated: "They fled without strength before the pursuers." Namely, they are powerless to resist, as recorded by Jeremiah, Chapter 52. ("The leaders fled into the camp of Jehoiachin, king of Judah". And as said in Psalm 38(37):lO: "My heart throbs, my strength fails me."

Now to this Verse 6 is applied the Hebrew letter "Vau", and interpreted as: "And". That is, as if also these ideas are related to leaders, within a vindication by the Lord God, and within the fifth period of the captivity.

Allegorically, "the daughter of Zion" can refer to the Church, as a celestial Zion. This is exemplified whensoever the phrase is set forth as an ornament of the faith.

And: "Her princes" can refer to prelates who fall into error before a pursuer. For instance, as the devil, or demon, likened to a heretic perverting the faith.

Also: "that find no pasture," as within the Sacred Scriptures. And: "become like harts": in reference to words of God, Our Lord Jesus Christ.
