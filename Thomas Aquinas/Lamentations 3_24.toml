Presently the experience of divine mercy is exposed. First, to the recognition of divine mercy itself; "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases, his mercies never come to an end." That is, not punishing, as if unmerciful. Since the Lord punished worthily, not reducing his creations backwards to extinction, or nothingness. Thus, Jeremiah 10:24 declares: "Correct me, O Lord, but in just measure; not in thy anger, lest thou bring me to nothing."

Second, an approbation from the Lord's divine mercy is indicated. For, Verse 23 says: "They are new every morning; great is thy faithfulness." Namely, as I, the Lord God, openly approve. Again: "great is their faithfulness". That is, regarding Jeremiah, who, among your suppliants, acknowledge you. For, the Apostle Matthew reports: "Then Jesus answered her, 'O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire'." (Mt: 15:28).

Third, there is an intended conclusion: "The Lord is my portion": my soul says: "Therefore I will hope in him". Namely, since I (Jeremiah) choose his divine mercy in portions while others despise it. As said in Psalm 16 (15):5: "The Lord is my chosen portion and my cup; thou holdest my lot."
