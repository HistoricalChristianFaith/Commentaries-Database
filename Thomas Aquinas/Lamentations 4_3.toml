Here is set forth the peoples' misery in parts. First is viewed the affliction of thei~siege, as to their famine, second, as to the capture and destruction of their city. As said in Verse 11: "The Lord cave full vent to his wrath, he poured out his hot anger; and he kindled a fire in Zion, which consumed its foundations." Thirdly is viewed the derision toward the captured citizens as said in Verse 15: "Away! Unclean! men cried at them; 'Away! Away! Touch not!'"

As to the first view (affliction from their famine) there are four notions. First is indicated the famine among the youth, second, among the delicate and weak. As expressed in Verse 5: "Those who feasted on dainties perish in the streets; those who were brought up in purple lie on ash heaps."

Thirdly is viewed the famine of those consecrated to the Lord God. As said in Verse 7: "Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk; their bodies were more ruddy than coral, the beauty of their form was like sapphire."

Fourthly, is viewed the immense famine among mothers, as expressed in Verse 10: "The hands of compassionate women have boiled their own children; they 'became their food in the destruction of the daughter of my people."

As to the first, (famine among the youth) are two further ideas. First is the famine among nursing babies, second among the youth, or adolescents. As there in Verse 4: "the children beg for food, but no one gives to them."

Around the first notion (famine among nursing babies) are two more ideas. First is a deficiency of milk, second the effect of such deficiency. As there: "The tongue of the nursling cleaves to the roof of its mouth for thirst" (Verse 4).

"Even the jackals" (Verse 3) display certain possessions from famine bodies; horselike feet, said to be from laceration, since, they lacerate their own offspring. Concerning which Job 39:16 declares: "She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear." So, to such women are the women of Jerusalem compared, not due to cruelty of the affection, but due to the similarity of their action, which was from a deficiency of nutrition.
