Here thirdly a remedy in flight is excluded. Here is touched upon the account in the last part of Jeremiah: (Chapter 52: "Judah Taken Captive at Babylon"). Then the Chaldeans captured Zedekiah (King of Judah) fleeing on a path to a wilderness, or solitude. As in the hyperbolic langage of Habakkuk 1:8 states: "they fly like an eagle swift to devour."
