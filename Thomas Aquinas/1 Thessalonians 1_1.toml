Paul and Sylvanus and Timothy
and Timothy, whom he circumcised, as is mentioned in Acts 16.

to the church of the Thessalonians 
Paul greets the Church, which is the assembly of believers, 

in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, 
that is, in the faith of the Trinity and of the divinity and humanity of Christ, because our beatitude will consist in knowing them. He mentions only the person of the Father and the incarnate Son, in which two is understood the Holy Spirit who is the bond between the Father and the Son.
