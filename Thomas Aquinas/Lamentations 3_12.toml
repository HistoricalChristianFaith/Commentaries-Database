The manner for afflicting is stated here. First the manner is insidious, second, it is open. Verse 12 then says: "He bent his bow and set me as a markfor his arrow."

Third, the manner for afflicting is widespread. Verse 15 so states: "He has filled me with bitterness, he has sated me with wormwood."

Regarding the insidious manner for afflicting two more ideas are presented. First is the insidious action of enemies. So Verse 10 says: "He is to me like a bear lying in wait, like a lion in hiding." Just like Nabuchodonosor fighting against me ( Jeremiah), from ambush (cf. Old Babylon Empire; around 1140 B.C; or Ruler of New Babylon Empire, around 605-562 B.C.).

Then, Verse 10: "He is to me like a bear": cruel, and "like a lion": in which is designated the above ruler (Nabuchodonosor). As the prophet Hosea relates: "So I will be to them like a lion, like a leopard I will lurk beside the way" (Hos 13:7).

Second, ambushes, or plots of such enemies whom they would repell. As Verse 11: "He led me off my way and tore me to pieces." As expressed in Chapter 1:13 "he has left me stunned, faint all the day long."

Then Verse 12: "He bent his bow and set me as a mark for his arrow." Here is displayed what is publicly and openly added to the very manner.

About this above idea three more notions are added. First is exposed the proposal: "He bent his bow and set me." Namely, like to a judgment, or to an army of enemies. For Psalm 7:12 states: "he has bent and strung his bow". And Job: 16:12: "he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target."
