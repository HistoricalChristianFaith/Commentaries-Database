The order of death is here exposed,as it excites mercy. First is a prayer to mothers as said: "They cry to theri mothers, 'Where is bread and wine?'". As if wine is lacking, so give to us bread. For Lamentations 4:4 claims: "the children beg for food, but no one gives to them."

Second, there is the necessity for praying. As Verse 12 continues: "as they faint like wounded men in the streets of the city." That is, they perish by the famine: "in the streets of the city". As if by avoiding everything, since they are unable to render any aid or remedy. For Jeremiah 21:7 says: "and the people in this city who survive the pestilence, sword, and famine."

Third, is the most bitter death. Verse 12 thus concludes: "as their life is poured out on their mothers' bosom." Thus the Book of Kings: "And when, he had lifted him, and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her lap till noon, and then died." (2 Kings (4 Kings): 4:20).
