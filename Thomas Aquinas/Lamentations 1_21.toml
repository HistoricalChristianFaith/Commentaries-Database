One is here accused of faults towards others. First, one is faulted for each of aid. As said: "Hear how I groan; there is none to comfort me." Namely, like the Egyptians, or others in whom I can trust. Like the utterance of Jeremiah 31:15: "Thus says the Lord; 'A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentat ion and bitter weeping."

Second, Judah (Jerusalem) is pointed out as a delight to her enemies. As Verse 21 continues: "all my enemies have heard of my trouble; they are glad that thou hast done it." And Psalm l3(l2):4 states: "Lest my enemy say, 'I have prevailed over him'; lest my foes rejoice because I am shaken."

Third, Judah (Jerusalem) is, as if, secure within divine justice. As Verse 21 concludes: "Bring thou the day thou hast announced, and let them be as I am." Namely, you (O Lord) lend them to their destruction, as a surety of comfort to me Judah (Jerusalem), now having like griefs and afflictions. As Isaiah 65:13 states: "Behold my servant shall eat, but you shall be hungry."
