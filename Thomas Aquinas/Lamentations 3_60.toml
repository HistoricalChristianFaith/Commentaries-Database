Besides, an accusation regarding the adversary is proposed. So, first is an accusation against the evil within the deed. Thus is said: "Thou hast seen the wrong done to me, O Lord." This states as if: they are unable to deny what is known to thee, (O Lord God). For, Lamentations 1:22 makes known: "Let all their evil doing come before thee; and deal with them as thou hast dealt with me."

Second, an accusation, as to the fury in the enemy's heart is underscored: "Thou hast seen all their vengeance, all their devices against me." For Jeremiah 18:18 reports: "Then they said 'Come, let us make plots against Jeremiah, for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet."

Third, is an accusation regarding sin from their mouth: "Thou hast heard their taunts, O Lord, all their devices against me."
