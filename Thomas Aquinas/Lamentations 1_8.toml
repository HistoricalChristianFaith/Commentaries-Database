Here in Verse 8 is shown the cause of the misery: Jerusalem. First is indicated its very sinning, secondly, its progress. As said: "she became filthy.

There are two further notions. First sin is referred to as "filthy". Namely, as expressed, "anthonomastically", within infidelity and idolatry. As Proverbs l4:34 declares: "Righteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people."

Secondly, the effect of sin is set forth. First, is the misery, plus an instability. As said: "all who honored her despise her". Namely, at the time of Jerusalem's prosperity: "despise her, for they have seen her nakedness". That is, her adversity. As Job 29:11 claims: "When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved."

Thirdly, there results a sadness of heart. As said: "yea, she herself groans, and turns her face away." That is, from the prosperity perfected by the Lord God. As Psalm 40 (39):l1 states: "Let them be turned back and brought to dishonor who desire my hurt!"
