Here special persons are viewed. For instance, women ravished in Zion by men corrupting women. As Deuteronomy 28:30 records: "You shall betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her." And further on: '"Your sons and your daughters shall be given to another people, while your eyes look on and fail with longing for them all the day." (Deuteronomy 28:32).
