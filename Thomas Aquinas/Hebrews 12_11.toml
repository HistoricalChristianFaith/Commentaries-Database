671. - Having exhorted them to endure evil patiently, according to the example of the ancient fathers and Christ, the Apostle now exhorts them to do the same on the authority of Scripture. In regard to this he does three things: first, he gives the authority; secondly, he explains its meaning (v. 7); thirdly, he argues to his conclusion (v. 8).

672. - He cites the authority, which is found in Proverbs (3:11) but in different words from our version; for we have: ‘My son, reject not the correction of the Lord; and do not faint when you are chastised by him. For whom the Lord loves, he chastises; and as a father in the son he pleases himself.’ But because the Apostle quotes that authority for our consolation, he uses other words; hence, he says, And have you forgotten the exhortation. As if to say: It is strange, your comforts have given joy to my soul’ (Ps. 93:19); ‘I will never forget your justifications’ (Ps. 118:94). But he says, exhortation [consolation] i.e., God consoling; and he speaks emphatically: ‘Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our tribulation’ (2 Cor. 1:3). He continues, which addresses, i.e., the God of consolation, you as sons. Therefore, if he chastises, He does not hate; but His chastisement is directed to our good, because He speaks to us as to sons.

673. - But he gives the words of another saying: My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, as some who hate discipline; and he adds the reason, For the Lord disciplines him whom he loves. By this authority he forbids two things, namely hatred of discipline and impatience with it. By reason of the first he says, My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, as some who hate discipline and of whom it says in Proverbs (9:8): ‘Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate you’; ‘They have hated him that rebukes in the gate; and have abhorred him that speaks perfectly’ (Am 5:10). Therefore, the Apostle says, Do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord. As if to say: God chastises you for discipline; do not regard lightly [neglect], i.e., do not despise it by negligence: ‘He that rejects wisdom and discipline is unhappy’ (Wis. 3:11). By reason of the second he says, Do not lose courage [be wearied] when you are punished by him. For some, even though they do not hate a harsh correction, bear it impatiently; therefore, he says, Be not wearied, while you are rebuked [punished] by him. For a man is spiritually wearied, when he is so sad that he faints: ‘That you be not wearied, fainting in your mind’ (Heb. 12:3); ‘Be not grieved with her bonds’ (Sir. 6:26).

674. - Then when he says, For the Lord disciplines [chastises] whom he loves, he gives the reason. But as the Philosopher says, the word ‘chastisement’ is generally used in regard to children: for we call a person chaste, whose concupiscence has been chastised. Similarly, a child is said to be chastised, when he is well disciplined. For something prone to evil needs chastening. But concupiscence is such, and so is a child who follows his own impulses. Therefore, one who chastises does so to keep them from evil. And because our senses and thoughts are prone to evil (Gen. 6:5), the Lord chastises us to draw from evil: ‘The Lord chastising has chastised me; but he has not delivered me over to death’ (Ps. 117:18); ‘You have chastised me, and I was instructed as a young bullock unaccustomed to the yoke’ (Jer. 31:18). But He chastises not to punish but to save. Hence he says, He scourges every son whom he receives. Therefore, those who are not scourged are not numbered among his sons: ‘They are in the labor of men; neither shall they be scourged like other men’ (Ps. 72:5). Hence, it is a sign, as it were, of eternal reprobation: ‘My jealousy shall depart from you’ (Ez. 16:42). Nor is it strange, if He scourges every son He adopts, because He did not spare His own Son: ‘Ought not Christ to have suffered these things?’ (Lk. 24:26).

675. - Then (v. 7) he shows the meaning of the above scriptural quotation: first, he explains the meaning of the admonition; secondly, the meaning of the reason; thirdly, he shows that the reason is fitting (v. 7c).

676. - The Apostle’s advice was not to neglect the Lord’s discipline and not to become weary. But he includes both in these words, for not to neglect and not to grow weary are nothing less than to persevere in discipline; hence Job (6:10): ‘This is my consolation that afflicting me with sorrow, he spare not’; ‘Embrace discipline, lest at any time the Lord be angry’ (Ps. 2:12). He told us why we should not be negligent when he said, Whom the Lord loves he chastises; hence, he says here: God is treating you as sons. As if to say: Persevere, because he deals with you as with His sons: ‘You shall call me Father and shall not cease to walk after me’ (Jer. 3:19). Then he shows that the reason is fitting when he says, What son is there whom his father does not discipline [correct]? For it is the father’s duty to correct his son: ‘He that spares the rod hates his son; but he that loves him corrects him betimes’ (Pr. 13:2); ‘A horse not broken becomes stubborn; and a child left to himself will become headstrong’ (Sir. 30:8). Therefore, correction is necessary, as a sting of the flesh was given to Paul, lest he fall (2 Cor. 12:7).

677. - Then (v. 8) he argues from what he has already said: first, he concludes to something unwelcome; secondly, by giving an example (v. 9); thirdly, he mentions the resulting usefulness (v. 11).

678. - In regard to the first he gives this reason: All the saints who have pleased God passed through many tribulations, by which they were made sons of God. Therefore, one who does not persevere in discipline is not a son but a bastard, i.e., born of adultery. From this reason he draws this conclusion: If you are left without discipline [chastisement], in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. ‘All who would live godly lives in Christ will suffer persecution’ (2 Tim. 3:12); ‘All that have pleased God passed through many tribulations, remaining faithful’ (Jdt. 8:23). Nor is it necessary that the saints always have outward tribulations, when they are afflicted inwardly by the wicked lives of perverse men: ‘Lot dwelling among them that vexed the just soul from day to day with unjust works’ (2 Pt 2:8). But a son, properly speaking, is born of a legitimate father; our mother is the Church, whose spouse is God Himself: ‘I will espouse you to me in faith’ (Hos 2:20). Therefore, those born of the spirit of the world or the devil are bastards: ‘But draw near hither, you sons of the sorceress, the seed of the adulterer and of the harlot’ (Is. 57:3). Therefore, it is clear that they are not truly sons, unless they are born of a legitimate father.

679. - Then (v. 9) he gives the second reason drawn from our own experience, namely, paternal correction. This proceeds according to the twofold difference between God the Father and the father of our flesh. The first difference is that a man begets a man as to the body, but not as to the soul, which is created and not transmitted: ‘I have not given you a spirit and a soul’ (2 Macc 7:22); hence, he says, We have had earthly fathers to discipline us: ‘Have you children? Instruct them’ (Sir. 7:25). And we respected them: ‘Honor your father and your mother’ (Ex. 20:12). But God is our Father in a more excellent way, namely, as to the soul, which He creates: ‘The spirit will return to God who gave it’ (Ec 12:7). Furthermore, He makes the soul just by adopting us as sons: ‘The Spirit gives testimony to our spirit that we are the sons of God’ (Rom. 8:16). Hence, he says, shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits, i.e., our souls, which are called spirits, because they are not evolved from matter, and live? for the end of obedience is everlasting life: ‘If anyone keep my word, he will not taste death forever’ (Jn. 8:52); ‘He became to all that obey him the cause of eternal salvation’ (Heb. 5:9).

680. - Secondly, there is a difference between human and divine correction; first, as to the end, because the end of human correction is transitory, for it is directed to living well in this life, which lasts a few days; secondly, as to the reason, because man corrects according to his will, which can be mistaken, yet we obey it. But not so in divine correction: for He instructs us in something useful for eternity, namely, to receive the holiness which He Himself is: ‘Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself; let him be your fear and let him be your dread. And he shall be a sanctification to you’ (Is. 8:13). Therefore, he says, they disciplined us for short time; and this in regard to the first: at their pleasure, in regard to the second. But he disciplines us for our good: ‘I am the Lord who teaches you profitable things’ (Is. 48:17); and this that we may share his holiness. Therefore, we should all the more accept his chastisement.

681. - He continues: All discipline [chastisement] seems painful rather than pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness [justice] to those who have been trained by it. This is the third reason, which is drawn from the benefit of the correction. But since chastisements are forms of medicine, the same judgement seems to be true of chastisement as of medicine. But just as medicine, when it is taken, is bitter and disgusting, and yet its end is very sweet and desirable, so chastisement, although it is harder to endure, brings forth the best fruit. But it should be noted that chastisement, i.e., discipline, is drawn from the word ‘to learn.’ But children, who are taught, learn from the rod. Therefore, discipline is taken for science, as in the beginning of Posterior Analytics: ‘Every intellectual doctrine and discipline comes into existence from pre-existing knowledge,’ which in Greek is called epistemon. But sometimes it is taken for correction, which in Greek is paideia. He says, therefore: All chastisement, which is instruction by blows and annoyances, for the moment, indeed, seems painful rather than pleasant; because outwardly it brings sadness in enduring it, but inwardly it brings sweetness because of the end intended. Hence he says, seems and not ‘is’: ‘As sad and always rejoicing’ (2 Cor. 6:10); ‘A woman, when in labor, is sorrowful; but when she has brought forth, she no longer remembers the anguish, for her joy’ (Jn. 16:21); ‘That which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation works for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory’ (2 Cor. 4:17).

682. - Therefore, he says, later it yields fruit, for fruit implies sweetness: hence, fruition is delight in the end now achieved. Most peaceful, for fruit is had here with disturbance of external inconveniences and internal trials; therefore, it is not most peaceful, as there. In glory, indeed, there will be no inward gnawing of conscience, no inclination to sin, no outward affliction. For according to Augustine, whatever you desire will be there; therefore, the fruit will be most peaceful: peaceful in the tranquility of conscience; more peaceful in obtaining the first stole; most peaceful in obtaining the second: ‘My people shall sit in the beauty of peace, in the tabernacles of confidence and in wealthy rest’ (Is. 32:18); ‘Her fruit is better the chiefest and purest gold’ (Pr. 3:14). Therefore, it will yield the fruit of righteousness [justice], i.e., which justice earns: ‘To him that sows justice there is a faithful reward’ (Pr. 11:30). Or of justice, i.e., to lay hold on justice: ‘Sow for yourselves in justice and reap in the mouth of mercy’ (Hos 10:12); ‘Going, they went and wept, sheaves’ (Ps. 125:6). But fruit is brought forth only to them that are exercised in it, i.e., by discipline: ‘Strong meat is for the perfect; for those who by custom have their senses exercised’ (Heb. 5:14).
