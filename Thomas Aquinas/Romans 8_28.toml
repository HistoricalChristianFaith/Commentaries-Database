Having shown that the Holy Spirit helps us in the weaknesses of the present life in regard to fulfilling our desires [n. 686], the Apostle now shows how he helps us in relation to external events by directing them to our good. First, he states his proposition; secondly, he proves it [v. 29; n. 701]; thirdly, he draws a conclusion [v. 35; n. 721]. 696. In regard to the first there are two things to consider [cf. n. 699]. First, the greatness of the benefit conferred on us by the Holy Spirit, namely, that all things work together for good. To realize this we should consider that whatever happens in the world, even if it be evil, accrues to the good of the universe; because, as Augustine says in Enchiridion: "God is so good that he would permit no evil, unless he were powerful enough to draw some good out of any evil." However, the evil does not always accrue to the good of that in which it is. Thus, the death of one animal accrues to the good of the universe, inasmuch as by the destruction of one thing something else begins to be, although it does not accrue to the good of that which ceases to be; because the good of the universe is willed by God according to itself and to this good all the parts of the universe are ordained. 697. The same seems to apply to the relationship of the noblest parts to the other parts, because the evil affecting the other parts is ordained to the good of the noblest parts. But whatever happens to the noblest parts is ordained only to their good, because his care for them is for their sake, whereas his care for the others is for the sake of the noblest: as a physician allows a malady in the foot that he might cure the head. 341 But the most excellent parts of the universe are God’s saints to each of whom applies the word of Mt (25:23): "He will set him over all his goods." Therefore, whatever happens to them or to other things, it all accrues to the benefit of the former. This verifies the statement in Pr (11:20): "The fool will be servant to the wise," namely, because even the evil of sinners accrues to the good of the just. Hence, God is said to exercise a special care over the just, as it says in Ps 34 (v.15): "The eyes of the Lord are toward the righteous," inasmuch as he takes care of them in such a way as to permit no evil to affect them without converting it to their good. This is obvious in regard to the penal evils which they suffer, hence it says in the Gloss [of Lombard, col. 1488 D] that "because in their weakness humility is exercised, in affliction patience, in contradictions wisdom and in hatred good will." Hence it says in 1 Pt (3:14): "If you suffer for righteousness’ sake, you will be blessed." It might be asked whether their sins also work together for their good. Some say that sins are not included when he says, all things, because according to Augustine: "Sin is nothing and men become nothing, when they sin." But contrary to this a Gloss says: "God makes all things work together for their good to the extent that if they deviate and stray from the path, he even makes this contribute to their good." Hence it says in Ps 37 (v.24): "Though the righteous man fall, he shall not be cast headlong, for the Lord is the stay of his hand." But according to this it seems that they always arise with greater love, because man’s good consists in love in such a way that without it the Apostle says that he is nothing (1 Cor 13:2). 342 The answer is that man’s good consists not only in the amount of love but especially in his perseverance until death, as it says in Mt (24:13): "He who endures to the end will be saved." Furthermore, because he has fallen, he rises more cautious and more humble; hence, the Gloss adds that this makes them progress, because they return to themselves more humble and wiser; for they fear extolling themselves or trusting in their powers to persevere. 699. Secondly, we consider the recipients of this benefit and see something on God’s part and on man’s part. He indicates what is involved on man’s part when he says: for those who love God. For the love of God is in us through the indwelling Spirit. But it is the Holy Spirit who directs us in the right path; hence it says in 1 Pt (3:13): "Who is there to harm you, if you are zealous for what is right?" and in Ps 119 (v. 165): "Great peace have they who love your law; nothing can make them stumble." And this is reasonably so, because, as it says in Pr (8:17): "I love those who love me." To love is to will good to the beloved; but for God to will is to accomplish, for "whatever the Lord wills he does" (Ps. 135:6). Therefore, God turns all things to the good of those who love him. 700. Then he considers what is involved on God’s part who, first of all, predestined believers from all eternity; secondly, calls them in time; thirdly, sanctifies them. He touches on these three things when he says: Who are called according to his purpose, i.e., the predestined, the called and the sanctified; "purpose" here refers to predestination which, according to Augustine, is the resolve to be merciful: "according to the purpose of him who accomplishes all things according to the counsel of his will" 343 (Eph 1:11). "Called" refers to calling: "He called him to follow him" (Is 41:2). "Saints" refers to sanctification: "I am the Lord who sanctifies you" (Lev 21:8). The Apostle says that he knows this, saying: we know: "He gave him knowledge of holy things" (Wis 10:10). This knowledge arises from experience and from considering the efficacy of love: "Love is as strong as death" (S of S 8:6) and of eternal predestination: "My counsel shall stand, and I will accomplish all my purpose" (Is 46:10). 701. Then (v.29) he proves what he had said with the following proof: No one can harm those whom God advances; but God advances the predestined who love him. Therefore, nothing can harm them, but everything works for their good. First, therefore, he proves the minor, namely, that God advances them; secondly, the major [v. 31; n. 710]. In regard to the first he does two things: first, he mentions things that refer to advancement of the saints from all eternity; secondly, those that occur in time [v. 30; n. 707]. 702. First, therefore, he presents two things, namely, foreknow1ede and predestination when he says: Those whom he foreknew he also predestined. Now some say that predestination is taken here for the preparation which occurs in time, during which God prepares the saints for grace. They say this in order to distinguish foreknowledge from predestination. But closer examination shows that both are eternal and that they differ in notion. For, as was stated above, predestination implies the mental preordaining of things which a person intends to do. But from all eternity God has predestined the benefits which he intends to give his saints. Hence, predestination is eternal. But foreknowledge differs 344 conceptually from predestination; because foreknowledge implies only the knowledge of future things, whereas predestination implies causality in regard to them. Consequently, God has foreknowledge even of sins, but predestination bears on salutary goods. Hence The Apostle says in Eph (1:5): "Predestined according to the purpose of his will, to the praise and glorious grace which he freely bestowed." 703. Regarding the order between foreknowledge and predestination some say that foreknowledge of good and of evil merits is the reason for predestination and reprobation, in the sense that God predestines certain ones, because he foresees that they will act well and believe in Christ. According to this the present text reads: "Those whom he foreknew to be conformed to the image of his Son, he also predestined." This interpretation would be reasonable, if predestination were restricted to eternal life which is bestowed for merits. But under predestination falls every salutary benefit prepared for man from all eternity by God; hence all the benefits he confers on us in time he prepared for us from all eternity. Hence, to claim that some merit on our part is presupposed, the foreknowledge of which is the reason for predestination, is nothing less than to claim that grace is given because of our merits, and that the source of our good works is from us and their consummation from God. Hence, it is more suitable to interpret the present text as stating that those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son. Then this conformity is not the reason for predestination, but its terminus or effect. For the Apostle says: "He destined us to be his adopted sons through Jesus Christ" (Eph 1:5). 704. For the adoption as sons is nothing more than that conformity, because a person adopted into the sonship of God is conformed to his true Son. 345 First, in the right to the inheritance, as was stated above (v. 17): If sons, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ." Secondly, in sharing his splendor. For he is begotten of the Father as the splendor of his glory (Heb 1:3). Hence by enlightening the saints with the light of wisdom and grace, he makes them be conformed to himself. 705. The phrase, to the image of his Son, can be interpreted in two ways: in one way so that it means: conformed to the image of his Son, who is an image: "He is the image of the invisible God" (Col 1:15). In another way so that the sense is this: He predestined us to be conformed to his Son in the fact that we bear his image: "Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven" (1 Cor 15:49). He says, those whom he foreknew he also predestined not because he predestines all the foreknown, but because he could not predestine them, unless he foreknew them: "Before I formed you in the womb I knew you" (Jer 1:5). 706. Then he indicates what follows from this predestination, when he says: in order that he might be the first-born among many brethren. For just as God willed to communicate His natural goodness to others by imparting to them a likeness of his goodness, so that he is not only good but the author of good things, so the Son of God willed to communicate to others conformity to his sonship, so that he would not only be the Son but the first-born among sons. Thus, he who is the only-begotten through an eternal origin, as it says in Jn (1:18): "The only Son who is in the bosom of the Father," is the first-born among many brethren by the bestowal of grace: "He is the first-born of the dead, and ruler of kings on earth" (Rev 1:5). 346 Therefore, Christ has us as brothers, both because he communicated to us a likeness of his sonship and because he assumed the likeness of our nature, as it says in Heb (2:17): "He had to be made like his brethren in every respect." 707. Then (v. 30) he mentions what happens on the part of the saint as a consequence of predestination. First, he mentions the call, when he says: Those whom he predestined he also called. For predestination cannot be voided: "The Lord of hosts has sworn, ‘As I have planned, so shall it be, and as I have purposed, so shall it stand" (Is 14:24). Predestination begins to be carried out with the person’s being called. This call is twofold: one is external and is made by the mouth of a preacher: "She has sent out her maids to call from the highest places" (Pr 9:3). In this way God called Peter and Andrew, as it says in Mt (4:18). The other call is internal and is nothing less than an impulse of the mind whereby a man’s heart is moved by God to assent to the things of faith or of virtue: "Who stirred up one from the east and called him to follow?" (Is 41:2). This call is necessary, because our heart would not turn itself to God, unless God himself drew us to him: "No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him" (Jn 6:44); "Turn us to thyself, O Lord, that we may be turned" (Lam 5:21). Furthermore, this call is efficacious in the predestined, because they assent to the call: "Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me" (Jn 6:45). 708. Hence secondly, he mentions justification when he says: those whom he called he also justified by infusing grace: "They are justified by his grace as a gift" (Rom 3:24). 347 Although this justification is frustrated in certain persons, because they do not persevere to the end, in the predestined it is never frustrated. 709. Thirdly, he mentions glorification, when he adds: and those he also glorified and this in two ways, namely, by growth in virtue and grace and by exaltation to glory: "In all things, O Lord, thou hast exalted and glorified thy people" (Wis 19:22). He uses the past for the future, either because the future is certain, or because what is future in some is already fulfilled in others. 710. Then (v. 31) he clarifies the major premise, namely, that nothing can harm those advanced by God: first, he shows that they cannot suffer any loss through the evil of punishment; secondly, nor through the evil of guilt [v. 33; n. 715]. 711. The evil of punishment is twofold: one consists in the imposition of evils, the other in the removal of good things. First he shows that those who are advanced by God do not suffer harm from the efforts of persecutors, saying: What then shall we say? As if to say: since God bestows so many good things on his elect, what can be said against this, so as to nullify it? As if to say: Nothing. "No wisdom, no understanding, no counsel, can avail against the Lord" (Pr 21:30). Or: What shall we say? For one is struck with amazement, when he considers these things: "I considered thy works and became terrified" (Hab 3:2). Or: What shall we say to this? i.e., what return could we make to God for such great blessings: "What shall I render to the Lord for all his bounty to me" (Ps 116:12). Then he continues, If God is for us by predestining, calling, justifying and glorifying, who is against us, i.e., successfully? "Let us stand up together, who is my 348 adversary?" (Is 50:8); "Place me next to you, and let anyone’s hand fight against me" (Jb 17:3). 712. Secondly, he shows that God’s holy ones cannot suffer loss by the removal of good things, saying: He who did not spare his own Son. But whereas he spoke earlier about adopted sons, he separates this Son from all others, saying: his own Son, i.e., not adopted, as heretics pretend, but natural and co-eternal: "That we may be in his true son, Jesus Christ" (1 Jn 5:20) of whom the Father says in Mt (3:17): "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased." 713. He says, did not spare, to indicate that he did not exempt him from punishment. For there was no guilt in him to forgive: "He who spares the rod hates his son" (Pr l3:24). However, God the Father did not spare his Son, as though to add something to him who is in all things perfect God; rather he subjected him to the passion for our benefit. And this is what he adds: but gave him up for us all, i.e., in expiation for our sins: "He was put to death for our trespasses" (Rom 3:25); "The Lord put on him the iniquity of us all" (Is 53:6). God the Father gave him up to death by appointing him to become incarnate and suffer and by inspiring his human will with such love that he would willingly undergo the passion. Hence he is said to have given himself over: "He gave himself up for us" (Eph 5:2). Judas, too, and the Jews gave him up, as was explained at the end of ch. 4. 714. It should be noted that in saying, He did not spare his own Son, it is as though he were saying: He not only exposed other holy men to tribulation for their 349 salvation: "I have hewn them by the prophets" (Hos 6:5); "If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation" (2 Cor 1:6), but even his own Son. But in the Son of God all things exist as in their primordial and preoperative cause: "He is before all things and in him all things hold together" (Col 1:17). Therefore, when he was given up for us, all things were given to us; hence he adds: how has not had also, with him, given us all things, the highest things, namely, the divine persons to enjoy, rational spirits to live with, all lower things to use, not only prosperity but adversity as well: "All are yours and you are Christ’s and Christ is God’s" (l Cor 3:23). Hence, it is clear that, as it says in Ps 34 (v.9): "Those who fear him have no want."
