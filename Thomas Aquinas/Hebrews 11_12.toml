580. - Having given an example of faith from the fathers who existed before the deluge, i.e., those who were the fathers of both the Gentiles and the Jews; the Apostle now treats specifically of the fathers who existed after the deluge, namely, the fathers of the Jews. First of all, he gives the example of the faith of Abraham, who was the father of believers; hence, he was the first to receive the seal of faith before the Law. First, he shows what Abraham did; secondly, what Isaac did (v. 20); thirdly, what Jacob did (v. 21); fourthly, what Joseph did (v. 22). The first is divided into two parts: in the first he shows what he did in regard to external and human knowledge; secondly, what he did in regard to God (v. 17). In regard to the first he does three things: first, he shows what he did in regard to his dwelling place; secondly, what he did in regard to generation (v. 11); thirdly, what he did in regard to his own conversion (v. 13). In regard to the dwelling place he does two things: first, what he did in regard to his first change of location; secondly, in regard to his other change (v. 9).

581. - In order to show how great is the authority of his example of Abraham, he mentions the renown of his name, saying, he that is called Abraham, by God: ‘You shall be called Abraham’ (Gen. 17:5). He is also called by men: ‘Abraham was the great father of a multitude of nations’ (Sir. 44:20). Therefore, such a one called by God and preached by men is a worthy example. Secondly, he gives the example, saying, by faith Abraham obeyed. For by faith we are enabled to believe God concerning invisible things: ‘For obedience to the faith’ (Rom. 1:5); When he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance: ‘Go forth out of your country and from your kindred, and out of your father’s house, into the land which I shall show you’ (Gen. 12:1). But the Lord was to give him that land for an inheritance: ‘All the land which you see, I will give to you’ (Gen.13:15).

582. - But did he not leave his own land along with his father, Thares? Therefore, he did not leave because of God’s command, but his father’s. I answer that he left with his father with the intention of returning again, but in response to the Lord’s command he went into Mesopotamia to Syria where he intended to remain after his father’s death. But in response to the Lord’s command he went into the land of Canaan. But was this so wonderful that he had to have faith about it and believe God? Yes, because he went out, not knowing where he was to go. But what is unknown is invisible. By Abraham’s obedience we are instructed to go out from all carnal affection, if we would obtain our inheritance: ‘Forget your people and your father’s house’ (Ps. 44:11); ‘The eye has not seen, O God, besides you, what things you have prepared for them that wait for you’ (Is. 64:4). Hence, that inheritance is unknown to us.

583. - Then (v. 9) he shows what he did by faith in regard to his dwelling place: first, what he did; secondly, the reason why (v. 10).

584. - For we sometimes notice a person leaving his native land and going elsewhere to make a lasting home. Not so Abraham, for he lived as a stranger in the land of Canaan and dwelt there as a stranger. This is obvious from the fact that he did not build a house there, but lived in huts and tents, which are transportable dwellings; hence, mention is always made of tents, when he speaks of Abraham. Therefore, he lived there as a stranger because of the Lord’s command: ‘And he gave him no inheritance in it; no, not the pace of a foot’ (Ac. 7:5); ‘He was a sojourner in the land of the Philistines many days’ (Gen. 21:34). This is true as to what the Lord was to give him gratis, but not as to what he bought. Hence, he says, by faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as is clear from Genesis (12 to 21), as in a foreign land; which is obvious from his living in tents. That he had no intention of returning to his native land, even if he had lived longer, is shown by the fact that he lived with Isaac and Jacob not at the same time, but successively. These were the children of the promise, because the promise was made to them (Gen. 17 and 28). He says, heirs with him of the same promise, in which we are given to understand that we should live in the world as foreigners and strangers: ‘And they that use this world, as though they used it not’ (1 Cor. 7:31); ‘For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is above’ (Heb. 13:14).

585. - Then when he says, he looked forward to the city which has foundations, he shows why he lingered there as a stranger, namely, because he did not consider himself as having anything on earth, but was seeking a heavenly city as his inheritance: ‘Our feet were standing on your courts, O Jerusalem. Jerusalem, which is built as a city’ (Ps. 121:2); ‘your eyes which see Jerusalem, a rich habitation, a tabernacle that cannot be removed’ (Is. 33:20). It is called a city, first of all, because of the unity of the citizens, which unity is true peace: ‘Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise your God, O Sion’ (Ps. 147:12) and in v. 14: ‘Who puts peace in your borders.’ Your people shall sit in the beauty of peace, and in the tabernacle of confidence, and in wealthy rest’ (Is. 23:18); That they may be one, as we also are one’ (Jn. 17:22). Secondly, it is ordered, because it exists for justice and not for doing evil. But perpetual justice is there: ‘And the name of the city from that day is, the Lord is here’ (Ez. 48:35). Thirdly, it was sufficient unto itself in all things that are necessary, for whatever is necessary will be there most perfectly, because it is a state made perfect by the assemblage of all good things: ‘Jerusalem, which is built as a city, which is compact together’ (Ps. 121:3).

586. - This city has foundations, in which stability is signified: ‘A tabernacle that cannot be removed’ (Is. 33:20). But the foundations are the first part of a building; hence, the angels are the foundations of a city: ‘The foundations therefore are in the holy mountains’ (Ps. 86:20); for men will be raised to the orders of angels.

587. - The founder of this city is God, not the wisdom of human art: ‘We know, if our earthly house of this habitation be dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, eternal in heaven’ (2 Cor. 5:1). Now two things are required for the erection of a city: the first is the authority of the prince, by means of whom it is made firm and who is called its founder, and from whom it takes its name, as Rome from Romulus. And so God is called the founder of that city: ‘In the city of our God: God has founded it forever’ (Ps. 47:9). The second is the way it is put together, which commends the wisdom of the artisan. And so God is called its artisan, because it was put together according to the disposition and wisdom of God: ‘Great is the Lord and exceedingly to be praised in the city of God, in his holy mountain’ (Ps. 47:2). For the proper arrangement of a work commends the workman. But divine wisdom will never be so resplendent as there; and, therefore, it is exceedingly to be praised.

588. - Then when he says, by faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, he shows what his wife obtained by faith. In regard to this he does two things: first, he shows what she obtained; secondly, what she obtained in her children (v. 12).

589. - But there were two defects in his wife that made it seem almost impossible for her to be able to conceive: one was that she was sterile: ‘And Sarah was barren’ (Gen. 11:30). The other was that due to her age she was not naturally suited to bear children: ‘It had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women’ (Gen. 18:11). But the Apostle touches on these two defects: first, when he says, being barren; secondly, when he says, even when she was past the age. Yet in spite of all this, she received the power to conceive by faith, namely, her own or Abraham’s, because even though it was impossible according to nature that a woman of ninety conceive of a man of ninety, nevertheless, both believed God, for Whom nothing is difficult. Hence, he says, since she considered him faithful who had promised.

590. - But on the contrary, it seems that Abraham did not believe, because in Genesis (17:17) he asked: ‘Shall a son, think you, be born to him that is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bring forth?’ Again, in regard to Sarah it is stated in Genesis (18:12): ‘She laughed secretly, saying: ‘After I am old, and my lord is an old man, shall I give myself to pleasure?’ I answer that in regard to Abraham, his laughing was not due to doubt, but to wonder: ‘He staggered not by distrust; but was strengthened in faith, giving glory to God. Most fully knowing that whatsoever he has promised, he is able also to perform’ (Rom. 4:20). Hence, his laughter is not reproved by God, Who knows the hearts of all. But Sarah at first doubted in the first promise, but when the angel referred to the power of God, when he said: ‘Is there anything hard to God?’ (Gen. 18:14), she then believed; and this was, as it were, a second promise. Therefore, he says that he re-promised, because when He promised the first time, she did not believe, but only when He re-promised.

591. - But it should be noted that all the miraculous conceptions which took place in the Old Testament were as a figure of that greatest of miracles which occurred in the incarnation. For it was necessary that His birth from the Virgin be prefigured by certain things, to prepare souls to believe. But it could not be prefigured by something equal, because a figure necessarily falls short of what is prefigured. Therefore, the Scripture shows the Virgin birth by the birth from sterile women, namely, Sarah, Anna, and Elizabeth. But there is a difference: because Sarah received the power to conceive from God miraculously, but from human seed; but in the Blessed Virgin He even prepared that most pure matter from her blood, and along with that, the power of the Holy Spirit was there in place of seed. For the Word was made flesh not from human seed but by a mystical spiration.

592. - Then when he says, for which cause there sprung even from one man, he shows what she obtained in her children by God’s power, namely, a multiplying of seed in the merit of faith, from one, namely, Abraham, they were sprung: ‘I called him alone, and blessed him, and multiplied him’ (Is. 51:2). Secondly, his condition should be considered, because he was as good as dead; for he was already an old man, as was stated above. But on the other hand, because Sarah was dead, he begot sons by another wife, as it is stated in Genesis (25:2). Therefore, it is incorrect to describe him as good as dead. I answer that an old man can well produce from a young woman, but not from an old. Consequently, his power to produce was dead in regard to Sarah, but not in regard to others. Or, one might say that from one refers to Sarah’s womb already as good as dead: ‘Nor the dead womb of Sarah’ (Rom. 4:19); ‘Look upon Abraham, your father and to Sarah that bore you’ (Is. 51:2). Thirdly, the difference between those who come forth from Abraham should be considered. For, as it is stated in Romans (9:6): ‘Just as some who are of the seed of Abraham are not Israelites, so not all who are of the seed of Abraham are sons; but those who are children of the promise are accounted for the seed.’ Therefore, his offspring are divided into two branches, the good and the wicked. The good are signified by the stars, of whom he says that they have sprung as the stars of heaven in number: ‘The stars have given light in their watches, and rejoiced’ (Bar. 3:34). But the wicked are signified by the sands of the seashore, because the wicked Jews of Abraham’s seed are conformed to the Gentiles. But the sand is everywhere buffeted by the waves of the sea, and the wicked by the winds of the world: ‘The wicked are like the raging sea’ (Is. 57:20). But the Jews were not altogether sand, but as the sand, because they shared their wickedness with the Gentiles: ‘I have set the sand a bound for the sea’ (Jer. 5:22). Again, sand is sterile and fruitless; so, too, the wicked are sterile of all work of good fruit. Hence, he says, they sprung as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore. The figure is hyperbole. Or it is described as innumerable, not because it cannot be counted, but because it cannot be counted easily: ‘I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that is by the sea shore’ (Gen. 22:17).
