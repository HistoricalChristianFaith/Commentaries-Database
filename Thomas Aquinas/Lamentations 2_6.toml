Verse 6 bemoaned the destruction of principal edifices. The first is the temple, second, the royal house or palace. As Verse 8 later says: "The Lord determined to lay in ruins the wall of the daughter of Zion; he marked it off by the line." Regarding the temple two views are set forth. The first views the destruction of the very temple, second, is viewed those possessions within the temple. As Verse 7 states: "The Lord has scorned his altar, disowned his sanctuary."

Three notions are proposed as to the destruction of the temple itself. First is inferred the very destruction of the temple. As Verse 6 begins: "He has broken down his booth": that was made in the desert. In Silah had been placed the tabernacle which Solomom had constructed.

Then, "like that of a garden." That is, what is easily destroyed. As Psalm 78(77):60 states: "He forsook his dwelling at Shiloh, the tent where he dwelt among men." And, Jeremiah 26:6: "Then I will make this house like Shiloh, and I will make this city a curse for all the nations of the earth."

Second, the ending of temple feasts is touched upon. As said: "laid in ruins the place of his appointed feasts; the Lord has brought to an end in Zion appointed feast and sabboth." (Verse 6). As if said: a feast acceptable before. And as Isaiah 1:14 says: "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates."

Third, is indicated reprobation of ministries. As stated in conclusion: "and in his fierce indignation has spurned king and priest." Namely, such indignation aims at the king, to whom pertains the defense of the temple, or sanctuary.

Also, aimed at the priest to whom the administration of temple and sanctuary relates. For, Job 12:19 says: "He leads priests away stripped, and overthrows the mighty."
