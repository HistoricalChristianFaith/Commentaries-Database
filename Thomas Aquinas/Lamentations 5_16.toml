Here is indicated the glory of di~nities. First, the glory of a king. As stated: "The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned!" As Job 19:9 records: "He has stripped from me my glory, and taken the crown from my head."

Second, is the glory of the temple. Here sadness is placed upon it.
