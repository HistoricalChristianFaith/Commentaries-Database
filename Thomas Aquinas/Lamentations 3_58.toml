The benevolence, on the part of the person, the judge, is displayed here. First is shown his mercy towards miserable people, second, the justice of the judge. Verse 58 thus says: "Thou hast taken up my cause, O Lord, thou hast redeemed my life."

Regarding mercy toward miserable people, three more ideas are set forth. First is a prayer for such miserable persons: "I called on thy name, O Lord, from the depths of the pit." Namely, like one existing with difficulties.

And: "from the depths of the pit". Just like the greatest tribulation in Egypt, as recorded in the Book of Judges. Also, as Sirach (Ecclesiasticus) 51:10 declares: "I appealed to the Lord, the Father of my Lord, not to for- sake me in the days of affliction."

Second, the mercy from prayer is then referred to: "Thou didst hear my plea, 'Do not close thine ear to my cry for help'."

Third, the consolation from the prayer heard is remembered: "Thou didst come near when I called on thee; thou didst say, 'Do not fear'." Namely, confirming me (Jeremiah) by thy divine aid (O Lord God), then, as now. For Job 17:3 declares: "Lay down a pledge for me with thyself; who is there that will give surety for me?"
