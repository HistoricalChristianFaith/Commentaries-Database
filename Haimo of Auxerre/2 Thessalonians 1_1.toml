The first letter that was written to the them, where it comes to the place where the Apostle speaks of the role of the elect who are still alive on the Day of Judgment, saying, "Then we who are still alive, who are left, suddenly will be caught up with them to meet Christ in the air" (1 Thess 4:17), they were upset and utterly terrified, since they thought that the Apostle was saying that in his own lifetime, and thus in theirs, too, the Lord would come in judgment. They were afraid that they would be cast into the dungeon of eternal punishment with the Devil, because, as latecomers to the faith, they were imperfect. So the Apostle wrote this second letter to them as soon as he learned of their despair. In it he indicated to them that the Day of Judgment was not yet imminent in their lifetime. He also announces the coming and the death of the Antichrist.
