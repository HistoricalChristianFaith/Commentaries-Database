[The crowds] caused the Pharisees to turn away.
They loathed the high priests.
They lifted up in song their voices befitting to God.
They caused creation to rejoice.
They sanctified the air.
They shook the dead beforehand.
They opened heaven.
They planted paradise.
They stirred up the dead to the same zeal.
For that reason some of the Greeks at that time were urged on toward that zeal for God, because of this utterance befitting to God;
And having reached a turning about, they approached … one of the apostles by the name of Philip, saying to him:
“Sir, we wish to see Jesus.”
Behold the preaching of the crowd,
And how they moved the Greeks to conversion.
