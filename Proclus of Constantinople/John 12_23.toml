[The Greeks say,] “We wish to see Jesus”—not so much in order to look him in his face, as to carry the cross.
And therefore Jesus, having seen their
intention,
Openly said to those present:
“The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.”
Glorified—referring to the conversion of the Greeks;
A glory that the Jews donned
But that the nations put on.
Therefore Jesus said concerning the Gentiles:
“The hour has come For the Son of man to be glorified.”
Glorified—referring to the cross.
For from it the power of the Lord was made known,
Because it changed the shame into glory—
the insult into honor,
the curse into blessing,
the gall into sweetness,
the vinegar into milk,
the slap in his face into freedom,
death into life.
The hour has come, For the Son of man to be glorified.
Glorified—referring to the cross,
For from it the cross is even now glorified.
For the cross itself even now still glorifies kings,
and gives radiance to priesthood,
and preserves virginity,
and establishes asceticism,
and strengthens union,
and guards widowhood,
and protects orphans,
and increases the blessing of children,
and multiples the church,
and enlightens the people,
and preserves a spiritual lifestyle,
and opens paradise,
and guides the robber,
and roots out enmity,
and extinguishes hatred,
and puts demons to flight,
and drives the devil away.
