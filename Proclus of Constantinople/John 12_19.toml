It irritated the high priests and Pharisees to hear from the crowds:
“The King of Israel.”
They were hearing what they did not wish to hear.
They were used to addressing him as one possessed by demons,
But these were proclaiming him “King”:
“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord,
even the King of Israel.”
Who is the one who suggested this utterance to the crowds?
Who is the one who put this praise into their minds?
Who is the one who entrusted them with branches from the palm trees?
Who is the one who suddenly at a fixed signal acted as military commander of them all?
Who is the one who taught them this harmony of voice?
The grace from above, the revelation of the Holy Spirit.
And therefore they called out with boldness:
“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.”
