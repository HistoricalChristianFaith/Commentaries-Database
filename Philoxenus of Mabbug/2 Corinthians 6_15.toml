The Holy Spirit is our true baptism, and for this reason we remain always baptized, for he is in us always, and nothing can deprive us of our baptism apart from the denial of God and consorting with demons. In such cases the Holy Spirit really does depart, because he cannot agree to remain in a place where Satan dwells. “For what fellowship does Christ have with Satan or the believer with the unbeliever, or God’s temple with that of demons?” On the Indwelling of the Holy Spirit.
