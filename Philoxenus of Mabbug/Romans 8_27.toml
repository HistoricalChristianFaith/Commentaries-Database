You see that all the good promptings which bring us to repentance result from the activity of the Spirit, and pure prayer, which brings all these good promptings to completion, is also stirred up in our soul as the result of the Spiritâ€™s activity. He too, in a hidden way, initially arouses us to groans at the memory of our sins.
