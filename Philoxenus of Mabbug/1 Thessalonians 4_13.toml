“Brothers, I want you to know about those who sleep: you must not grieve like the rest of humanity, who have lost all hope.” Our resurrection too will take place by the power of the Holy Spirit who is within us. Because the Holy Spirit is in faithful persons when they die, their death cannot be called death, but only sleep.
