Pure prayer such as is worthy of God, O disciple of God, is not uttered by means of compound words. Prayer that is worthy of God consists in this: that one gather in one’s mind from the entire world and not let it be secretly bound to anything; that one place it entirely at God’s disposal and forget, during the time of prayer, everything that is material, including one’s own self and the place where one is standing. One should be secretly swallowed up in the spirit of God, and one should clothe oneself in God at the time of prayer both outwardly and inwardly, set on fire with ardent love for him and entirely engulfed in his thoughts of God, entirely commingled in all of him, with the movements of one’s thoughts suffused with wondrous recollection of God, while the soul has gone out in love to seek him whom it loves, just as David said, “My soul has gone out after you.”
