“But he ran,” the text says, “to the cattle and took a calf.” What kind of calf? Perhaps the first one he encountered? Not at all, but “a good and tender” calf. And although he would hasten in all things, nevertheless he knows that what is excellent and great should be offered to the Lord or to angels. He took therefore or chose from the herd a “good and tender” calf and delivered it to his servant. “The servant,” the text says, “hastened to slaughter it.” He himself runs, his wife hastens, the servant makes haste. No one is slow in the house of a wise man. He serves therefore a calf and at the same time with it bread and fine wheat flour, but also milk and butter. These were the courtesies of hospitality of Abraham and Sarah.

A calf is served; behold, another mystery. The calf itself is not tough but “good and tender.” And what is so tender, what so good as that One who “humbled himself” for us “to death” and “laid down his life for his friends”? He is the “fatted calf” which the father slaughtered to receive his repentant son. “For he so loved this world, as to give his only Son” for the life of this world. Nevertheless the wise man is not ignorant of whom he has received. He runs to three men and adores one, and he speaks to the one saying, “Turn aside to your servant, and refresh yourself under the tree.”
