Is God a light to enlighten the eyes of the body or the eyes of the intellect? The prophet says of the latter, “Enlighten my eyes lest I sleep in death.” I think it is clear to everyone that we would not say that God performs the work of the sun and assigns to another the task of enlightening the eyes of those who will not sleep in death. God, therefore, enlightens the mind of those whom he judges to be worthy of personal enlightenment. But if God illuminates the mind according to the statement “The Lord is my light,” then we must assume that he is apprehended by the intellect and is invisible and incorporeal, because he is the light of the mind.
