And the divine Scriptures bear witness both to the preaching of the gospel by the apostles and to that by our Savior. David, on the one hand, says of the apostles, and perhaps also of the Evangelists, “The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power; the king of powers is of the beloved.” At the same time he also teaches that it is not the composition of a speech and the utterance of sounds and the practiced beauty of speech that produce persuasion, but the provision of divine power.… Simon and Cleopas testify to this power and say, “Was not our heart burning on the road as he opened the Scripture to us?” And since the quantity of power God supplies to those who speak also differs, the apostles had great power in accordance with David’s statement: “The Lord shall give the word to them that preach good tidings with great power.”

For the word of God declares that the preaching (although in itself true and most worthy of belief) is not enough to touch the human heart, unless God gives to the speaker a certain power and his words have a certain grace. It is only by divine agency that this takes place in those who speak effectively. The prophet says in Psalm 67 [LXX] that “the Lord will give a word with great power to them who preach.” Then, if it should be granted with respect to certain points, that the same doctrines are found among the Greeks as in our own Scriptures, yet they do not possess the same power of attracting and influencing the souls of people to follow them. Therefore the disciples of Jesus, men ignorant so far as Greek philosophy is concerned, traveled through many countries of the world and impressed, agreeably to the desire of the Logos, each one of their hearers according to his desires, so that they received a moral improvement in proportion to their willingness to accept of that which is good.
