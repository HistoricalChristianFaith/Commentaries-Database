Some people think that the Savior spoke on a single level when he said, “Give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar”—that is, “pay the tax that you owe.” Who among us disagrees about paying taxes to Caesar? The passage therefore has a mystical and secret meaning.There are two images in humanity. One he received from God when he was made, in the beginning, as Scripture says in the book of Genesis, “according to the image and likeness of God.” The other image is of the earth. Man received this second image later. He was expelled from Paradise because of disobedience and sin after the “prince of this world” had tempted him with his enticements. Just as the coin, or denarius, has an image of the emperor of this world, so he who does the works of “the ruler of the darkness” bears the image of him whose works he does. Jesus commanded that that image should be handed over and thrown away from our face. He wills us to take on that image, according to which we were made from the beginning, according to God’s likeness. It then happens that we give “to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and to God what is God’s.” Jesus said, “Show me a coin.” For “coin,” Matthew wrote “denarius.” When Jesus had taken it, he said, “Whose inscription does it have?” They answered and said, “Caesar’s.” And he said to them in turn, “Give to Caesar what is Caesar’s, and to God what is God’s.”
