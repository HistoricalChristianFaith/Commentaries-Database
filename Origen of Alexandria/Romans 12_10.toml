It happens that we hate things we ought not to, just as we love things we ought not to. We are ordered to love our brothers, not to hate them. If you think that someone is ungodly, remember that “Christ died for the ungodly.” And if you think that because your brother is a sinner you do not have to love him, remember that “Christ Jesus came into this world to save sinners.” But if he is righteous, then he is much more worthy of love, for “God loves the righteous.”
