As always, when the apostle Paul talks about faith, he adds hope as well, and rightly so, for hope and faith are inseparable.â€¦ Just as Abraham believed against hope, so all believers do the same, for we all believe in the resurrection of the dead and the inheritance of the kingdom of heaven. These appear to go against hope as far as human nature is concerned, but when we take the power of God into consideration, there is no problem.
