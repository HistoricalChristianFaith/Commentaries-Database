He foretels His crucifixion to His disciples, adding, And the Son of Man shall be delivered to be crucified; thus fortifying them against that shock of surprise, which the sight of their Master, led forth to crucifixion, would otherwise have occasioned them. And He expresses it impersonally shall be delivered, because God delivered Him up in mercy to the human race, Judas from covetousness, the Priest for envy, the Devil through fear that through His teaching the human race would be plucked out of His hand, little aware how much more that would be effected by His death, than either by His teaching or miracles.

Not true Priests and elders, but Priests and elders of what seemed the people of God, but was indeed the people of Gomorrah; these, not knowing God's High Priest, laid a plot against Him, not recognising the firstborn of the whole creation, (Col. 1:15.) yea, even against Him that was elder than them all, did they take counsel.

By reason of the parties among the populace, those who favoured and those who hated Christ, those who believed and those who believed not.

The words of the prophet, “And the rulers took counsel together against the Lord and his anointed,” were fulfilled20 when “the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the court of the high priest” and took counsel together “against the Lord and his anointed.” They were not true priests but “of the people” and “elders.” They only seemed to be the people of God but were after all the people of Gomorrah. It was they who would say, “Crucify him! Crucify him!” and “Away from the earth with such a one!” Furthermore, what Isaiah said, “Hear the word of the Lord, O leaders of Sodom; pay heed to God’s law, O people of Gomorrah,” applies to the Jewish leaders who lived at the time of Christ. And what Ezekiel said to Jerusalem, “It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you,” can be said more rightly of Jeru-salem, over which the Lord wept, than of the time of the prophet. The chief priests sinned more greatly than Sodom. They did not recognize God’s high priest but plotted against him. The elders of the people, not knowing the “firstborn of every creature” and the one who is older than all creatures, took counsel against him. Jerusalem was forsaken at that so-called court where “they took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by stealth.” Unfortunately this was the city that first killed the prophets and then the Lord of the prophets. That city took action against the founder of the whole world.

They took counsel “in order to arrest Jesus by stealth.” The prophet had aptly said about them, “May the Lord cut off all deceitful lips.” “By stealth” they wanted to seize him and to kill him. But they said, “Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people,” for they had seen Jesus performing many signs and wonders. Many indeed were those who sided with Jesus. They proclaimed that “a great prophet has arisen in Israel.” But others were against him, and they said, “It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons.” Many had come to see the Lord. The people showed great eagerness for him. They either loved Christ or hated him. They either believed in him or did not believe in him. The priests’ counsel remained steadfast (while they themselves who took counsel would not remain steadfast) that he should be killed not on the feast but on another day. “Christ our Passover” was soon to be sacrificed so that, leaving behind the unleavened bread of the Jews, we might feast on the spiritual and true unleavened bread.
