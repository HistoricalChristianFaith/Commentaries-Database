God who from the beginning felt it just to arrange his creation according to merit gathered the diversities of minds into the harmony of a single world, so as to furnish, as it were, out of these diverse vessels or souls or minds one house. In this house there must be “not only vessels of gold and silver, but also of wood and of earth, and some unto honor and some unto dishonor.”
