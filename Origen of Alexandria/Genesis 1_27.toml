Our inner man consists of spirit and soul. The spirit is said to be male; the soul can be called female. If these have concord and agreement between themselves, they increase and multiply by the very accord among themselves and they produce sons, good inclination and understandings or useful thoughts, by which they fill the earth and have dominion over it.

It seems to be worth inquiring in this passage how, according to the letter, when the woman was not yet made, the Scripture says, “Male and female he made them.” Perhaps, as I think, it is because of the blessing with which he blessed them saying, “Increase and multiply and fill the earth.” Anticipating what was to be, the text says, “Male and female he made them,” since indeed man could not otherwise increase and multiply except with the female. Therefore, that there might be no doubt about his blessing that is to come, the text says, “Male and female he made them.” For in this manner man, seeing the consequence of increasing and multiplying to be from the fact that the female was joined to him, could cherish a more certain hope in the divine blessing. For if the Scripture had said, “Increase and multiply and fill the earth and have dominion over it,” not adding this, “Male and female he made them,” doubtless he would have disbelieved the divine blessing.
