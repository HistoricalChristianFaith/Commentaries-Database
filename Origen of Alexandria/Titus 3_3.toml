Paul, the apostle from Israel, came to us as one “blameless according to the justice in the law.” Yet he says “we ourselves,” those from Israel, “were then deceitful, foolish.” So not only those from the pagan nations were “deceitful,” nor only sinners, but we “also,” who have been taught by the law, were such before the coming of Christ.
