The name “world” is often used in the Scriptures with different meanings. What in Latin we call “world,” the Greeks call kosmos, and kosmos not only means “world” but also “ornament.” In fact, in Isaiah, when a reproach is made against the powerful children of Zion, it is said, “Instead of golden ornaments you will be bald, because of your works,” where “ornament” is indicated with the word that means “world,” that is, kosmos. And it is also said that the explanation of the world was contained in the pontifical vestment, as we find in the Wisdom of Solomon, where it says, “The entire world was in the priestly vestment.” Our earth with its inhabitants is also called world, as when the Scripture says that “the whole world is in the possession of the evil one.” And Clement, disciple of the apostles, refers to those places that the Greeks called antipodes and to the other parts of the earth where no one can reach (just as none of the people there can reach us), and he calls them “world,” saying, “The ocean cannot be crossed by people, nor the worlds that are beyond them, which are governed by the very dispositions of the Lord God.” We also call world this universe that is formed by the heavens and the earth, as Paul says, “The form of this world is passing away.” And our Lord and Savior also speaks of another beyond this visible world, which is difficult to describe and define in its reality. He says, “I do not come from this world.” As though he came from another world, he said, “I do not come from this world.” We said that it is difficult to describe this world, so as to not provide anyone with occasion to claim that we assert the existence of the images that the Greeks call ideas. In fact, it is foreign to our way of thinking to assert the existence of an incorporeal world, consisting solely in the fantasy of the mind and fallacious thoughts.
