You see how here, [as in the previous verses,] Paul indicates the mystery of the Trinity. For when he says from him and through him and to him, this corresponds to the one God and Father, from whom are all things, and our one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things. Likewise he says that all things are revealed by the Spirit of God, thus indicating that the providence of the Trinity is present in everything. When he talks about the height of riches he means the Father, from whom all things come; when he talks about the height of wisdom he means Christ, who is the wisdom of God; and when he talks about the depth of knowledge he is referring to the Holy Spirit, who knows the deep things of God.Paul adds “forever” to indicate that the perfection of all things is not bound by time but will extend to eternity and even be increased. He further adds “Amen” so that we might understand that we are coming to that blessedness through him, of whom it is written in the Apocalypse: “These are the words of the Amen.”

Paul declares that God is the beginning of the substance of all things by the words “of him” and the bond of their subsistence by the expression “through him” and their final end by the term “to him.”
