Therefore when he speaks “to the crowds and his disciples” he talks about “the scribes and Pharisees who sit upon the throne of Moses.” I judge these statements to be referring to the following groups. Those who profess that they interpret the law of Moses and glory in this, or who know the law well and seek to profit by this knowledge—these sit upon the throne of Moses. Those who do not depart from the letter of the law are called scribes. Then there are those who profess to know even more, setting themselves apart because they think they are better than the masses. That is why they are called Pharisees, which interpreted means “to divide or segregate” (for Phares translated means “division”).
