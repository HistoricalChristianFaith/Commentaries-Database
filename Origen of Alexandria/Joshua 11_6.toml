Such is the list, therefore, of the entire army of invisible foes who are assembled by King Jabin in order to fight against us who follow Jesus, our leader and Savior. But what does the Lord declare? "Do not shrink back from their appearance," he says "because by tomorrow at this hour, I shall deliver them into your hands." I observe that today we are not able to overwhelm all those powers or to destroy them all, but they will be entirely taken away tomorrow, that is, after the consummation of this age.For, at that time, every opposing power will be pulled down and the inmost part will be conquered when you see that those who are on the left are told, "Go into the eternal fire that God has prepared for the devil and his angels." Then if, following Jesus the leader, we have conquered and have been able to take possession, even we shall occupy the kingdom that the Father has prepared for his saints and for these who "have fulfilled" his commandments and "righteousnes" through our Lord Jesus Christ himself, "to whom is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen!"
