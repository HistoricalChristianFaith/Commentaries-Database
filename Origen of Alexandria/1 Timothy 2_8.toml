Now concerning the place, let it be known that every place is suitable for prayer if a person prays well. For “in every place you offer incense to me … says the Lord” and “I desire then that in every place men should pray,” But everyone may have, if I may put it this way, a holy place set aside and chosen in his own house, if possible, for accomplishing his prayers in quiet and without distraction.
