The higher and profounder spiritual meaning is the “hidden treasures of wisdom and knowledge,” which the Holy Spirit speaking through Isaiah calls “dark and unseen and concealed treasures.” These treasures require for their discovery the help of God, who alone is able to “break in pieces the gates of brass” by which they are shut in and concealed and to burst the iron bolts and bars that prevent us from entering in and reaching all those truths written in veiled language in Genesis concerning the various races of souls and the seeds and generations named there, whether closely akin to Israel or widely separated from his posterity.
