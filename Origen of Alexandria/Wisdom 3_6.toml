God removes evil from us in two ways, by “wind” and by “fire.” If we are good and obedient to his teachings and allow ourselves to be instructed by his Word, the “wind” sweeps away our evils, according to what is written, “If by the Spirit you mortify the deeds of the flesh, you will live.” But if the Spirit has not taken away our evils, there is need of purification by fire. Observe closely, however, each combination of terms. The first is “wind” and “cloud,” the second “fire” and “light,” the third “electrum” and “splendor.” Each of these, as though it were sad, is paired with something more cheerful. Indeed, if the wind dies down, immediately a cloud appears. If fire appears, there is light. If one speaks of electrum, there is brightness all around. We must, “like gold in the furnace” and electrum, be fused by an extremely hot fire. You will find, in the prophet we are commenting on, the Lord who sits in the middle of Jerusalem, fanning those who are a heap of silver, tin, iron and lead. With laments, he reproaches those who bear within themselves the dross of more base material. He says, “You have become the dross of silver, silver that is no longer pure like the grape.” When we superimpose on God’s creature, which at the beginning is good, the vices and passions that come from our wrongs, then we mix iron, tin and lead with gold and silver. To be purified, fire is necessary. As early as possible, then, we must act in such a way so as, when we arrive at this fire, to pass through it peacefully, like gold and silver and precious stones, which have no blemish of adultery. Not that we would be defeated by the fire, but that we might emerge from it approved.
