We ought to please God first, then our neighbor. But perhaps someone will say that Paul is contradicting himself here, because elsewhere he says: “If I please men, then I am not a servant of Christ.” … In answer to this it must be said that it is one thing to try to please others in order to get their praise and quite another to please them in order that one’s own life might be blameless, so that those who meet us may be edified by what they see and hear. We are not called to please others by doing things which are against faith, honor and piety.… Note that Paul himself says this, when he adds that in pleasing our neighbor the purpose is to edify him.
