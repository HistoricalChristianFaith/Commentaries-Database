It is reasonable to ask the chief priests who approached Pilate the following line of questions. Tell us, for what purpose do you think Jesus said, “Destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up”? Was he speaking about the death and resurrection “of his body” or about the destruction and reconstruction of the temple? If you thought that he was speaking of his resurrection, why did you testify against him because he had said, “I am able to destroy this temple and in three days to rebuild it”? If, however, you thought that he was speaking of the temple, as you have testified, then how do you know that he meant “after three days” he would be raised from the dead? See then how Christ exposes their impiety with their own words. Through their words, the chief priests condemn their own testimony, for understanding truly that Christ was speaking of his resurrection, they deliberately twisted his meaning to make it seem like he was speaking of the destruction and reconstruction of that inanimate temple.

What do you say, chief priest? Do you really think that Christ said to his men “after three days I will rise again” and then secretly commanded them to steal his body during the night and to tell everyone that he had risen from the dead after three days? Yet it is manifestly incredible that after giving such great moral instruction to all peoples and after demonstrating such great power throughout all of Judea, he would then turn and deceive his disciples. Even they would find fault with their commander and therefore refuse to do his bidding, most especially in view of the danger which would have threatened them from the people if they had confessed the man just crucified to be both their teacher and the Messiah. But if it is hardly believable for him to have said such a thing to his disciples, see if it is not more logical to believe that just as he performed great miracles and predicted that his gospel would be preached “to the ends of the earth,” that his disciples “would stand before rulers and kings” and that “Jerusalem would be destroyed by an army,” so also did he predict his resurrection when he said “destroy this temple and in three days I will raise it up.” Indeed, it was for that reason that the chief priests and Pharisees said to Pilate, “That imposter said, while he was still alive, ‘after three days I will rise again.’ ”
