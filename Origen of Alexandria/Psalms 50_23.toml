Who among us is of such measure and kind to offer to God “salutary sacrifices” and a “sacrifice of praise”? I believe that one to be a person who praises God in all his actions and fulfills through him what our Lord and Savior says: “That people may see your good works and praise your Father who is in heaven.” Therefore, this one offered “a sacrifice of praise” for whose deeds, doctrine, word, habits and discipline, God is praised and blessed. Just as, on the contrary, there are those of whom it is said, “Through you my name is blasphemed among the Gentiles.”
