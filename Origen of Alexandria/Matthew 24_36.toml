As long as the church, Christ’s body, does not know that day and hour, the Son himself is said not to know it in order that he may be understood to learn of that day and hour only when all of his members do. But “to know” is given its own special meaning here (as is customary with sacred Scripture), for only he who remains to meet its arrival will know that day and hour.
