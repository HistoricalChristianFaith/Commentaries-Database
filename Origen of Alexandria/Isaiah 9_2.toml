Now the expression darkness will likewise be used to refer to two corresponding concepts. The statement “And God called the light day, and the darkness he called night” is an example of the more common meaning. An example of the spiritual meaning occurs in the statement “The people who sat in darkness … and in the shadow of death, light has dawned on them.”
