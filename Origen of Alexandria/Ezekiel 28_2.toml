The bishops have directed that the case of the prince of Tyre should be examined, to say something about merits and faults, and they have ordered also that I should return to the subject of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, on certain points.

In the prophet Ezekiel the “prince of Tyre” is most plainly pictured as a certain spiritual power. When these, therefore, and other similar princes of this world, each having his own individual wisdom and formulating his own doctrines and peculiar opinions, saw our Lord and Savior promising and proclaiming that he had come into the world for the purpose of destroying all the doctrines (whatever they might be) of the “knowledge falsely so called,” they immediately laid snares for him, not knowing who was concealed within him. For “the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.” But their snares became known, and the plots that they had contrived against the Son of God were understood when they “crucified the Lord of glory.” Therefore the apostle says, “We speak a wisdom among the perfect; yet a wisdom not of this world or of the rulers of this world, which are coming to naught … a wisdom that none of the rulers of this world knew. For had they known it, they would never have crucified the Lord of glory.”
