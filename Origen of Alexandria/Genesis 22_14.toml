A clear way of spiritual understanding is opened for those who know how to hear these words. For everything that has been done reaches to the vision, for it is said that “the Lord saw.” But the vision that “the Lord saw” is in the spirit so that you too might see these things in the spirit which are written. And, just as there is nothing corporeal in God, so also you might perceive nothing corporeal in all these things. Rather, you too might beget a son Isaac in the spirit when you begin to have “the fruit of the Spirit, joy, peace.” … Now you beget joy if “you count it all joy when you fall into various temptations” and you offer that joy in sacrifice to God.For when you have approached God joyfully, he again gives back to you what you have offered and says to you, “You will see me again, and your heart shall rejoice, and no man shall take your joy from you.” So, therefore, what you have offered to God you shall receive back multiplied. Something like this, although in another figure, is related in the Gospels when in a parable someone is said to have received a pound that he might engage in business, and the master of the house demanded the money. But if you have caused five to be multiplied to ten, they themselves are given to you, they are granted to you. For hear what Scripture says: “Take his pound, and give it to him who has ten pounds.”57
So, therefore, we appear at least to engage in business for the Lord, but the profits of the business go to us. And we appear to offer victims to the Lord, but the things we offer are given back to us. For God needs nothing, but he wishes us to be rich; he desires our progress through each individual thing.
