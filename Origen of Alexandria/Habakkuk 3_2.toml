And we think that the expression also which occurs in the hymn of Habakkuk, “In the midst either of the two living things, or of the two lives, you will be known,” ought to be understood of Christ and the Holy Spirit. For all knowledge of the Father is obtained by revelation of the Son through the Holy Spirit, so that both of these beings which, according to the prophet, are called either “living things” or “lives” exist as the grounds of the knowledge of God the Father. For it is said of the Son that “no one knows the Father but the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal him.” The same also is said by the apostle of the Holy Spirit, when he declares, “God has revealed them to us by his Holy Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.” And again in the Gospel, when the Savior speaks of the divine and profounder parts of his teaching, which his disciples were not yet able to receive, he thus addresses them: “I cannot bear them now; but when the Holy Spirit, the Comforter, is come, he will teach you all things, and will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you.” We must understand, therefore, that as the Son, who alone knows the Father, reveals him to whom he will, so the Holy Spirit, who alone searches the deep things of God, reveals God to whom he will: “For the Spirit blows where he lists.” We are not, however, to suppose that the Spirit derives his knowledge through revelation from the Son.
