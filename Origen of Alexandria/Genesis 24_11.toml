“In the evening,” therefore, she came to the waters. We have already spoken above about evening. But behold the prudence of the servant. He does not wish to take a bride for his master, Isaac, unless he finds a virgin becoming and beautiful in appearance, and not only a virgin, but one whom a man has not touched. She must be one whom he should discover drawing water. He does not wish to betroth another to his master.He does not give her jewelry unless she is such a person. He does not give “earrings”; he does not give “bracelets.” She remains simple, unlearned, unadorned. Do we suppose that Rebekah’s father, a rich man, did not have bracelets and earrings that he might place on his daughter? Was he so negligent or greedy that he would not give jewelry to his daughter? But Rebekah does not wish to be adorned with Bethuel’s gold. The jewelry of a barbarous and ignorant man is not worthy of her. She needs jewels of the house of Abraham because patience is adorned from the house of the wise man.
Rebekah’s ears, therefore, could not receive their beauty, unless Abraham’s servant come and himself adorn them; nor could her hands receive jewelry except that which Isaac sent. For she wishes to receive golden words in her ears and to have golden deeds in her hands. But she could not previously receive or deserve these things unless she had come to the wells to draw water. How will you, who do not wish to come to the waters, who do not wish to receive the golden words of the prophets in your ears, be able to be adorned with instruction, adorned with deeds, adorned with character?
