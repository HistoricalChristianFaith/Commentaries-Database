But also we must go up the ascent of the hills of Akrabbim, which means “scorpions.” Thus it is necessary for us to pass over and even tread down scorpions, about which the Savior says, “Behold, I have given you the authority to tread over serpents and scorpions.” Whoever therefore wishes and longs to enter into the inheritance of the tribe of Judah must go up these ascents and tread down and escape from scorpions that stand in the way. For this reason, I think that the Lord said to the prophet Ezekiel making this journey, “Son of man, you dwell in the midst of scorpions.”

“And the borders,” it says, “are all the way to Kadesh.” Kadesh means “holy” or “sanctification.” Therefore, the borders of Judah reach all the way to sanctification.
