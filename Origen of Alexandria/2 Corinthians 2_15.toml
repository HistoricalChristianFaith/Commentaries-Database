For, as the apostle says, “We are a good aroma of Christ,” but he adds, “To some a fragrance of life to life, but to others an odor of death to death.” So also the prophetic word is “a sweet fragrance” to those who believe, but to the doubting and unbelieving and those who confess that they are Pharaoh’s people, it becomes a detestable odor.
