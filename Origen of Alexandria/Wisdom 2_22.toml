Though such a great light had arisen, and though the Logos had been made manifest, declaring, “Here is a man whose name is Orient,” they did not see the light, because “their wickedness blinded them, and they did not know the mysteries of God.” Something paradoxical took place with that people and with the pagan nations. The Jews did see a lamp in each of the prophets, but they did not recognize the Sun of righteousness13 that arose. Therefore, even though it seemed that they had a lamp, this was taken from them. On the other hand, “the people”—the pagans—“who were in darkness saw a great light.” Not a small light, as with Israel (though each of the prophets was actually not a small light), but “the people who were in darkness saw a great light,” our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. His light shines, “extending from one end of the earth to the other with power and governing” the churches “with goodness,” since his Spirit fills the whole earth. Thus the prophecy is fulfilled that says, “In the last days the mountain of God will be visible.” And now, “all the nations stream toward it.” This mountain is Jesus Christ.
