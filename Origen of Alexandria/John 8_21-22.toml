If the Word is not received when present, he threatens to go.…As long as we preserve the seeds and principles of truth that have been sown in our souls, the Word has not yet departed from us. But if we utterly destroy them with a flood of wickedness, he will say to us, “I go.” And then, even if we seek him, we will not find him but will die in our sin, overtaken in our sin and swept away by it.…
And we must not pass over without noticing the expression “you will die in your sins.” If it is taken in the ordinary sense, it is clear that sinners will die in their sin and the righteous in their righteousness. But if “you will die” is taken in relation to death, the enemy of Christ, since the one who dies has committed a sin that leads to death, then it is clear that those to whom this is spoken have not yet died.…
Those to whom the Word had not yet come had not committed sin that leads to death. Still, they were spiritually sick, a sickness tending toward death. The Physician, seeing that they were deadly ill, after he had despaired of healing them, said, “I go, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin.” …
Perhaps the statement “where I go you cannot come,” attached to “you will die in your sin,” will be clearer. For whenever someone dies in his sin, he cannot go where Jesus goes, for no one who is dead can follow Jesus: “For the dead do not praise you, O Lord.”
