Let us see whether or not, by the grace of God, we can explain the meaning of the following verse, which still remains hidden to many: “When Judas his betrayer saw him condemned, he repented and returned the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests” and so on.If this were written after Jesus had been sentenced by Pilate, scourged and delivered to the Jews for crucifixion, we would not need to inquire any further into the meaning of the report that “Judas … saw him condemned” because we know that Judas was a party to those events.
But how is it that Judas saw Jesus condemned before Jesus had either been sentenced or interrogated by Pilate? Some perhaps will answer that Judas was anticipating in his mind the final result of Jesus having been handed over by the chief priests and elders of the people, which he did witness. Others, however, will say that one whom Judas “saw condemned” was not Jesus but Judas himself. According to this account, when the chief priests and elders of the people handed Jesus over to Pilate, Judas then realized the evil he had done and understood that such an audacious act was already under the judgment and condemnation of God. Perhaps also Satan, who had entered Judas after the dipping of the morsel of bread, remained present in him until Jesus was delivered to Pilate but “departed from him” after he finished accomplishing Satan’s will. Judas then sensed the devil’s departure and at once saw and understood that “betraying righteous blood” is condemned by God, which he was able to understand only after the devil had ceased working in him. Only then, free from Satan’s influence, was Judas capable of penitence by returning the thirty pieces of silver to those who had paid him. When the devil had left him, he could then say what he had not been able to say earlier, for when his heart was still full of Satan he was unable to confess, “I have sinned in betraying righteous blood.” We are not saying, however, that the devil ceases to prey upon anyone whom he may have left. Rather, he waits and watches for an opportune moment to apply himself again. Even after his victim has sinned and come to recognize the devil’s influence, he still waits and watches for yet a third opportunity to deceive.
