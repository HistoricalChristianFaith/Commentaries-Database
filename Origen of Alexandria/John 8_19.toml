It is necessary to observe that the heterodox think that this text proves clearly that the God whom the Jews worshiped was not the Father of Christ. For if, they say, the Savior said “you know neither me nor my Father” to the Pharisees who worshiped the Creator, then it is evident that the Pharisees did not know the Father of Jesus because he was different from the Creator.… But they who say these things have not understood the divine Scriptures or observed the usage of language in them.…If anyone knew about the Creator and his priestly service, the sons of Eli did, having been raised at the place of worship. Yet, because they sinned, it is written of them in the First Book of Kings that they … “did not know the Lord.” …
So, again, the Pharisees did not know the Father since they did not live according to the Creator’s will. For knowing God can also refer to knowing God, which is something different from merely believing in him.… But who could not agree that the words written in the Psalms, “Be still and know that I am God,” were written for a people who believe in the Creator?

There is a difference between knowing God and believing in him. To the Pharisees, to whom he says, “You neither know me nor my Father,” he had the right to say, “You do not even believe in my Father,” for he who denies the Son does not have the Father, either by faith or knowledge. But Scripture gives us another sense of knowing a thing, that is, being joined to that thing. Adam knew his wife when he was joined to her.… If one who has joined to a prostitute has known the prostitute and one who has joined to his wife has known his wife, then one who has joined to the Lord has known the Lord in a holy manner. And in this sense the Pharisees neither knew the Father nor the Son.…Maybe it is possible for someone to know God and yet not know the Father. For if there is one aspect of him in accordance with which he is Father and another in which he is God, perhaps it is possible for someone to know God but not to know the Father.… Therefore among an infinite number of prayers offered up in the law, we do not find any one addressed to God as “Father.” Perhaps it is because they did not know the Father. They only pray to him as God and Lord, … not anticipating the grace shed by Jesus over the whole world, calling all to sonship and to praise the Father in the midst of the assembly, as it is written, “I will declare your name to my brothers.”
