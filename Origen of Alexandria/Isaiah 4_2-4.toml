Then the gospel says, “When the days of their purification were fulfilled, according to the law of Moses, they brought him into Jerusalem.” The passage says, on account of “their” purification. Who are “they”? If Scripture had said, “on account of ‘her’ purification”—that is, Mary’s, who had given birth—then no question would arise. We would say confidently that Mary, who was a human being, needed purification after childbirth. But the passage reads, “the days of their purification.” Apparently it does not signify one but two or more. Did Jesus therefore need purification? Was he unclean or polluted with some stain? Perhaps I seem to speak rashly; but the authority of Scripture prompts me to ask. See what is written in the book of Job: “No man is clean of stain, not even if his life had lasted but a single day.” The passage does not say, “No man is clean of sin,” but “No man is clean of stain.” “Stain” and “sins” do not mean the same thing. “Stain” is one thing, “sin” another. Isaiah teaches this clearly when he says, “The Lord will wash away the stains of the sons and daughters of Zion, and he will cleanse the blood from their midst. By the spirit of judgment he will purge the stain, and by the spirit of burning the blood.”Every soul that has been clothed with a human body has its own “stain.” But Jesus was stained through his own will, because he had taken on a human body for our salvation.

When one has recognized the differences in sins, one can see how the Lord says in Isaiah, “The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion and will cleanse the blood from their midst by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of burning.” Filth is washed away by a spirit of judgment. Blood is washed away by a spirit of burning. Even if you have not committed a sin that leads to death, you have still sinned and have thereby become filthy. The Lord will wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Zion, and he will cleanse the blood from among them. A spirit of judgment will be the recompense for filth, and a spirit of burning will be a recompense for the blood. Whenever we commit heinous sins, we do not need lye or washing with soap; rather we need the spirit of burning.
