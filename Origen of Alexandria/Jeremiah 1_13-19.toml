Place that candlestick in the south that it may look to the north. For when the light has been lit, that is, when the heart is watchful, it ought always to look to the north and watch for “him who is from the north,” as also the prophet says he saw “a kettle or pot kindled and its face was from the face of the north,” for “evils are kindled from the north for the whole earth.” Be watchful, therefore, apprehensive and zealous. Always contemplate the slyness of the devil and always watch the place from which temptation may come, from which the foe may invade, from which the enemy may creep up. For the apostle Peter also says, “Your adversary the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour.”
