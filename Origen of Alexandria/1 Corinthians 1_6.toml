The testimony of Christ is confirmed in us if we can say, like the apostle Paul, “I am persuaded that neither life nor death etc. can separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord” [Rom 8:38-39]. But if we are upset by every little thing that happens, then Christ’s testimony has not been confirmed in us at all.
