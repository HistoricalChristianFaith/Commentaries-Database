This sentence contains a rhetorical aside (hyperbaton), and the construction is defective.… It ought to be joined to the next verse by the words “to whom,” so that the phrase reads: “the rest of the Gentiles, Greeks and barbarians, to whom I am under obligation.” … The whole thing would then read as follows: “Just as I have fruit among the other Gentiles, Greeks and barbarians, wise and foolish, to whom I am under obligation, so also, as much as in me lies, am I eager to preach the gospel also to you who are at Rome, for I am not ashamed to preach the gospel among any people, for the power of God is in it for salvation to all who believe, for the Jew first and for the Greek, for in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed, which was previously covered by a veil in the law. Now it is revealed in those who come from the faith of the Old Testament to the faith of the new gospel.”So much for the order of the words; now we must examine the apostle’s meaning. When Paul says: “I have often intended to come to you,” he demonstrates the love which he had for the Romans. But when he adds: “but thus far have been prevented,” though indeed it may be thought that he was prevented by God, it is shown by this that it is God’s business where each of the apostles ought or ought not to go. It is by a particular dispensation that he appoints some to preach the Word of God and others not, as Paul himself says elsewhere: “When we tried to go into Bithynia, the Spirit of Christ prevented us.” … But if this phrase refers to the passage where he says that: “Satan hindered us,” he shows clearly that he is constantly struggling in prayer, so that by overcoming the hindrances of Satan he may be given a successful journey in the will of God, to see those who are at Rome.
For he desires and does not cease to pray that he may obtain some fruit from them as he has from the other Gentiles. Thus like one who is acquisitive for many riches, Paul wants to amass some return from his many spiritual investments. He gathers fruit from the Greeks, fruit from the barbarians, fruit from the wise, fruit even from the foolish. For while to some he speaks wisdom as to those who are perfect, to others he says, as if speaking to foolish people, that he wants to know nothing among them except Jesus Christ and him crucified. Some he teaches from the law and the prophets; others he persuades with signs and wonders.
