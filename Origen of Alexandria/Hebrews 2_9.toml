We understood the Christ to be the creator, but the Father is greater. He, indeed, who is such great things as “the advocate,” “the expiation,” “the propitiatory,” because he showed compassion “on our weaknesses” in experiencing temptation “in all things” human “in our likeness, without sin,” is a “great high priest” who offered himself as the sacrifice offered once for all, not for humans alone, but also for every spiritual being. For “apart from God he tasted death for all.” This appears in some copies of the epistle to the Hebrews as “by the grace of God.”But whether “apart from God he tasted death for all,” he died not only for humans but also for the rest of the spiritual beings, or “by the grace of God he tasted death for all,” he died for all apart from God, for “by the grace of God he tasted death for all.” And, indeed, it would be strange to declare that he tasted death for human sins but not also for any other creature, besides man, that happened to be in sin—for instance, for the stars, since not even the stars are absolutely pure before God. As we have read in Job, “And the stars are not clean in his sight,” unless this was said hyperbolically.
For this reason he is a “great high priest,” since he restores all things to the kingdom of the Father, causing the things that are lacking in each of the creatures to be supplied, that they may be able to receive the Father’s glory.
