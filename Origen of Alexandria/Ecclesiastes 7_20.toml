And it is likely also that in countless other things demons delude us and influence us to act according to their will. And it is possible that, just as no one among us is “clean from defilement,” and there is no “just person on the earth who will do good and will not sin,” so also there is no one who has always been free of demons and has never fallen victim to their influence.

If you wish to recall some other of the saints, the word of Scripture replies to you, saying, “There is no one upon the earth who does good and sins not.” Therefore only Jesus rightly “has perfect hands”; who alone “does not sin,” that is, who has perfect and whole works of his hands.
