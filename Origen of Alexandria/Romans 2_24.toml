What Paul says [in verses 17-23] about the Jews is meant to be taken ironically, since anyone who genuinely relies on the law, glories in God and proves the things which are most useful would be doing the things which are listed here. But [in verse 24] he speaks directly to them, borrowing the words of the prophet Isaiah.
