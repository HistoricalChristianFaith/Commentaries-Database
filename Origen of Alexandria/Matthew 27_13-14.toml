The ministers and elders of western Jewish literature, who are the sons of those chief priests and elders who accused Jesus, still today adopt and repeat these same allegations against him. On this account, since the sins of their forebears go before them and remain in them, their works suffer “[God’s] wrath forever,” and they are forsaken along with their entire people “like a tent in the vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field and like a city besieged.” Just as Jesus “gave no answer” then, neither does he give an answer now to the accusations of the Jewish priests and elders. The Word of God remains silent toward them. Still today they turn a deaf ear to the Word of God, as they previously did to the prophets and to him at the consummation of the ages when he “was made flesh and dwelt among us.”
