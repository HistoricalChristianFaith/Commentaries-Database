So John heard Jesus while he was still in his mother’s womb, and he leaped up and rejoiced when he heard him. Why might you not believe that John could understand his father’s prophecy once he was born, as Zechariah said to him: “And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High, for you will go before the Lord to prepare his ways.” So I suppose that Zechariah hastily spoke to the infant because he knew John would soon be living in the desert, and therefore he would no longer enjoy John’s presence. “For the boy was in the wilderness up to the day of his revelation to Israel.”Moses also lived in the desert. After turning forty years old, he fled from Egypt and pastured Jethro’s herds for another forty years. But John went out to the wilderness as soon as he was born.
