When Paul says that he is praying that somehow and at some point he may have a successful journey, so that in the will of God he might come to Rome, it must be remembered that since the apostle of God is dedicated to a holy work, that is, to the work of the gospel, he is waiting until by his prayers not only may he have a journey which is successful but also that it might be successful according to the will of God. How much more therefore ought we, whose work and worth are so much less important, to ask God for success on our journey when we have some business to attend to!Nevertheless, I think that the apostle also wants us to understand that the success of a journey does not always mean that the journey is according to God’s will. For Balaam had a successful journey when he went to Balak in order to curse the people of Israel, but this success was not due to God’s will. And many people have great success in worldly affairs and rejoice in their prosperity, but such prosperity is not of God’s will unless the purpose of our journey is to do his will, as the apostle says here.
