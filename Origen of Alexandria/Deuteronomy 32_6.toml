But if the Lord himself is Creator of all things, we must consider in what manner he is said “to have acquired” what is without doubt his own. It is said also in another song in Deuteronomy: “Is not he himself your God who made you and created you and acquired you?” For each one appears to acquire that which was not his own. Indeed, on this basis the heretics also say of the Savior that he “acquired” those who were not his; for with the price which was paid he purchased men whom the Creator had made. And it is certain, they say, that everyone buys that which is not his own; indeed, the apostle says, “You have been bought with a price.”
