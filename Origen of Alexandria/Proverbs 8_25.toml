Let us consider [that] our Savior is a “reflection of glory.” The reflection of glory has not been begotten just once and no longer begotten. But just as the light8 is an agent of reflection, in such a way the reflection of the glory of God is begotten. Our Savior is the wisdom of God. But the wisdom is the reflection of everlasting light. If then the Savior is always begotten—because of this he also says, “Before all the hills he begets me” (and not “Before all the hills he has begotten me,” but “Before all of the hills he begets me”)—and the Savior is always begotten by the Father, and likewise also if you have the Spirit of adoption, God always begets you in him according to each work, according to each thought. And may one so begotten always be a begotten son of God in Christ Jesus, “to whom is the glory and the power for the ages of ages. Amen.”
