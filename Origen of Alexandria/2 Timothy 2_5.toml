We who are concerned with the business of our Creator will live according to the laws of God. We have no desire to serve the laws of sin.… If necessary, we will also partake of the joys of this life and endure the appointed evils as trials of the soul.… In them the soul of the man who is being tested, like gold in the fire, is either convicted of failure or is manifested as reliable.… Moreover, no one is crowned unless he strives lawfully even here upon earth with the body of humiliation.
