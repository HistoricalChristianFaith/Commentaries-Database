I think every evil and deceitful spirit is a lie, and whenever anyone of these speaks, it speaks from its own resources and by no means from the resources of God. And the father of these [spirits] is the liar, the devil. We will now present what moved us to say that every inferior spirit is false. It is written in the third book of Kings that at the time Micaiah was called by Ahab to prophesy concerning whether he should go to Ramoth-gilead for war or stay, he said, “I saw the God of Israel sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven stood around him on his right and on his left. And he said, ‘Who will deceive Ahab, king of Israel, and he will go up and fall in Ramoth-gilead?’ ” And he spoke in this manner. And a spirit came forth and stood before the Lord and said, “I will deceive him.” And the Lord said to him, “By what means?” And he said, “I will go forth and will be a false spirit in the mouth of all these prophets of yours.’ ”And in the second book of Paralipomenon, the same Micaiah says to Ahab and Jehoshaphat, “Hear the word of the Lord. I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and every power of heaven stood at his right and at his left. And the Lord said, ‘Who will deceive Ahab, king of Israel, and he will go up and fall in Ramoth-gilead?’ ” And he spoke in this manner. And a spirit came forth and stood before the Lord and said, “I will deceive him.” And the Lord said, “By what means?” And he said, “I will go forth and be a false spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.”
These words show clearly, then, that if any spirit is the lying spirit, all similar spirits would be lying spirits, indebted to their lying father for being lying spirits in accordance with their falsehood and evil, not because this belongs to their essence.
