This Isaac, therefore, our Savior, when he has come into that valley of Gerar, first of all wishes to dig those wells that the servants of his father had dug; he wishes to renew the wells of the law, of course, and the prophets, which Philistines had filled with earth.Who are those who fill the wells with earth? Those, doubtless, who put an earthly and fleshly interpretation on the law and close up the spiritual and mystical interpretation so that neither do they themselves drink nor do they permit others to drink.
Hear our Isaac, the Lord Jesus, saying in the Gospels: “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, since you have taken away the key of knowledge, and you yourselves have not entered, nor have you permitted those who wish to enter.” Those therefore are the ones who have filled with earth the wells “which the servants of Abraham had dug;” those who teach the law carnally and defile the waters of the Holy Spirit; who hold the wells for this purpose, not that they might bring forth water but that they might put earth in them. Isaac therefore undertakes to dig these wells. And let us see how he digs them.
When the servants of Isaac, who are the apostles of our Lord, were passing through grain fields on the sabbath, Scripture says, “they plucked the ears and ate, rubbing them in their hands.” At that time, therefore, those who had filled his father’s wells with earth said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing that which is not lawful on the sabbath day.” In order to dig out their earthly understanding, Jesus says to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him, how he went in to Abiathar the priest and ate the consecrated bread, he and his servants, which it was not lawful to eat but for the priests only?” And he adds these words: “If you knew what this means: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would certainly never have condemned the innocent.” But what do those men reply to these words? They quarrel with his servants and say, “This man is not of God who does not keep the sabbath.” In this way, therefore, Isaac dug the wells “which the servants of his father had dug.”

Isaac therefore digs also new wells; no, rather, Isaac’s servants dig them. Isaac’s servants are Matthew, Mark, Luke, John; his servants are Peter, James, Jude; the apostle Paul is Isaac’s servant. These all dig the wells of the New Testament. But those who “mind earthly things” nor permit new things to be established nor old things to be cleansed also quarrel for these wells. They oppose the gospel wells; they resist the apostolic wells. And since they oppose in all things, since they quarrel in all things, it is said to them, “Since you have made yourselves unworthy of God’s grace, henceforth now we go to the Gentiles.”
