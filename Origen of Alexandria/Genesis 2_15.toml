How would God have placed what was altogether imperfect in paradise to work and guard it? For he who is capable of tending “the tree of life” and everything that God planted and caused to spring up afterwards would not reasonably be called imperfect. Perhaps, then, although he was perfect, he became imperfect in some way because of his transgression and was in need of one to perfect him from his imperfection. And the Savior was sent for these reasons.
