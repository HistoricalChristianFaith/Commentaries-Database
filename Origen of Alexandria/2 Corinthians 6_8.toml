If we have lived a life deserving “good repute” and have been spoken well of, now let us also bear up under “ill repute” from the ungodly. Still more, if we have been admired as “true” by those who love truth, now let us laugh at being called “imposters.” During the many dangers from which we have been delivered many said that we were “well known” by God; now let the one who wishes call us “unknown,” when we are probably better known. Thus, in bearing what has happened to us we are “punished” and yet “not killed,” and though “rejoicing,” we resemble those who are “sorrowful.”
