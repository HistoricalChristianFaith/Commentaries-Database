If a person, because he is too tenacious of life or too weak in the face of suffering, or because of the apparently convincing arguments of such as seek to induce us to accept the evil choice, has denied the one and only God and his Christ and borne testimony to demons or goddesses of fortune, then this person must realize that in doing this he is “setting,” as it were, “a table for the demon and offering libations” to Fortune, “forsaking the Lord” and “forgetting his holy mount.” He will incur the reproaches written in Isaiah.
