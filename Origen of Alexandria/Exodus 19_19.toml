But when she [the bride] has become worthy to have it said of her, as also it was said of Moses, that “Moses spoke, and God answered him,” then there is fulfilled in her that which he says: “Make me to hear your voice.” It is indeed high praise of her that is disclosed in that saying, “Sweet is your voice.” For thus also said the most wise prophet David: “Let my speech be sweet to him.” And the voice of the soul is sweet when it utters the word of God, when it expounds the faith and the doctrines of the truth, when it unfolds God’s dealings and his judgments.
