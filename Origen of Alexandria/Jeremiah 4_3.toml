This, then, “is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: ‘Break up fallow ground and sow not among thorns.’ ” This word is especially directed to those who teach, lest they entrust what is said to the pupils too soon before they have prepared the fallow ground in their souls. For whenever they put the “hand to the plow,” they make the “ground fallow” in their souls, according to the “beautiful” and the “good earth” of those who hear. Then, when they sow, the sowers do not sow “among thorns.” But if prior to the “plow” and prior to the making of “fallow ground” in the heart of those who hear, someone takes the holy seeds, the word concerning the Father, concerning the Son and Holy Spirit, the word concerning the resurrection, the word concerning the punishment, the word concerning the final rest, concerning the Law, the Prophets and in general each of the Scriptures, and sows them, he disobeys the first commandment, which states first, break up their fallow ground; second, and do not sow among thorns.
