One might ask if this is not contradicted by the prophetic saying “In your sight shall no living being be justified.” … One may answer, taking refuge in the double meanings of prophecy, that … no one is in all respects and throughout his whole life justified in God’s sight, since he will of course have sinned at some time. But this would not prevent some from being at times holy and blameless before him if they have become so through correction.
