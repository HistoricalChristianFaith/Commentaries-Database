Here Paul is blessing the Romans in the manner of the patriarchs and prophets.… It is a great blessing that they should all understand and think alike. If you want to know just how great it is, look at what the Savior said in the Gospel: “If two or three of you agree, whatever they ask will be done for them by God.” …This unanimity must be “in accord with Christ Jesus,” for of course it is possible to conspire together for evil.
