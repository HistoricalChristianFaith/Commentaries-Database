By reason of the parties among the populace, those who favoured and those who hated Christ, those who believed and those who believed not.

They took counsel "in order to arrest Jesus by stealth." The prophet had aptly said about them, "May the Lord cut off all deceitful lips." "By stealth" they wanted to seize him and to kill him. But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a riot among the people," for they had seen Jesus performing many signs and wonders. Many indeed were those who sided with Jesus. They proclaimed that "a great prophet has arisen in Israel." But others were against him, and they said, "It is only by Beelzebub, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons." Many had come to see the Lord. The people showed great eagerness for him. They either loved Christ or hated him. They either believed in him or did not believe in him. The priests' counsel remained steadfast (while they themselves who took counsel would not remain steadfast) that he should be killed not on the feast but on another day. "Christ our Passover" was soon to be sacrificed so that, leaving behind the unleavened bread of the Jews, we might feast on the spiritual and true unleavened bread.
