He said these things about the just and wise person and these are said in the blessings, “You will sleep and there will not be anyone who frightens you.” For if I am made just, no one can frighten me; I am afraid of nothing else, if I fear God. For it says, “the just is confident as a lion,” and for this reason, he does not fear the lion, the devil, or “the dragon,” Satan, or “his angels”;16 but, according to David, he says, “I shall not be afraid of the nocturnal fear, nor the dart which flies during the day, nor the terror which walks in the darkness nor the ruin and the midday demon.” And he adds that “the Lord is my light and my Savior, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the defender of my life, at what shall I tremble?” And again, “If an army stands against me, my heart will not fear.” You see the steadfastness and vigor of the soul that keeps the commandments of God and has confidence in the freedom that God gives.
