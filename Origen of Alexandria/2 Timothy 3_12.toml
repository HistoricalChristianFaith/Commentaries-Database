When you flee Egypt, you come to these steep ascents of work and faith. You face a tower, a sea and waves. The way of life is not pursued without the waves of temptation. The apostle says, “All who wish to live piously in Christ will suffer persecution.” Job also, no less, declares, “Our life upon earth is a temptation.”
