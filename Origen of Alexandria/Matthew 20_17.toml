Judas was yet among the twelve; for he was perhaps still worthy to hear in private along with the rest the things which his Master should suffer.

Meditating then of this, we ought to know that often even when there is certain trial to be undergone, we ought to offer ourselves to it. But forasmuch as it was said above, When they persecute you in one city, flee ye to another, (Mat. 10:23.), it belongs to the wise in Christ to judge when the season requires that he shun, and when that he go to meet dangers.
