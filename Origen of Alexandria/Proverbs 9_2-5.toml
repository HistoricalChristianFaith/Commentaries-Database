“Wisdom has prepared her table, she has slain her victims, she has mingled her wine in the bowl and cries with a loud voice, Turn in to me and eat the bread which I have prepared for you, and drink the wine which I have mingled for you.” The mind, when nourished by this food of wisdom to a whole and perfect state, as man was made in the beginning, will be restored to the “image and likeness” of God. [Thus], even though a man may have departed out of this life insufficiently instructed but with a record of acceptable works, he can be instructed in that Jerusalem, the city of the saints. That is, he can be taught and informed and fashioned into a “living stone,” a “stone precious and elect,” because he has borne with courage and endurance the trials of life and the struggles after piety. There, too, he will come to a truer and clearer knowledge of the saying already uttered here, that “man does not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.”
