That scarlet robe was prefigured by the scarlet sign mentioned in Joshua the son of Nun, which Rahab used for her safety, and mentioned in Genesis, which was placed on the hand of one of Tamar’s newborn sons in token of the future Passion of Christ. So now, in taking up the “scarlet robe,” he took upon himself the blood of the world, and in that thorny “crown” plaited on his head he took upon himself the thorns of our sins. As to the robe, it is written that “they stripped him of the scarlet robe.” But as to the crown of thorns, the Evangelists mention nothing further. Apparently they wanted us to determine what happened to that crown of thorns placed on his head and never removed. My belief is that the crown of thorns disappeared from the head of Jesus, so that our former thorns no longer exist now that Jesus has removed them from us once and for all on his own distinguished head.

What can be said about the reed they placed “in his right hand”? Here is my explanation: The reed embodied the hollow and fragile scepter that we all were leaning on before we saw it was a bad scepter, for we were trusting in the reed-shaped rod of Egypt or Babylon or some other kingdom opposed to God’s kingdom. Then he took that reed and rod of the fragile kingdom from our hands, to subdue it and break it to pieces on the cross. In place of that reed we once were leaning on, he gave us the scepter of the heavenly kingdom and the rod mentioned in Scripture: “The rod of justice, the rod of your kingdom.” In other words, the rod that chastens those who need to be chastened, as the apostle notes: “What do you want, that I come to you with a rod?” He also gave us a staff that we might celebrate the paschal feast (as Scripture says, “Let your staff be in your hand”), laying down that reed-shaped rod we once had before we celebrated the Lord’s paschal feast.Then they took this fragile, hollow reed and struck the honorable head of Jesus with it, for that ever-adverse kingdom reviles and scourges God the Father, the head of the Lord and Savior. And amid all this, the only-begotten goodness itself was unharmed, nor did he suffer anything, “being made a curse for us,” since by nature he is a blessing. But since he is a blessing, he destroyed and took away and dispelled all human malediction.
