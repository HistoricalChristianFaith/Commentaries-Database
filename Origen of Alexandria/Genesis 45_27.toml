What Latin expresses by saying: “his spirit was revived,” is written in Greek anezōpyrēsen. This means not so much to revive as to rekindle, so to speak, and reignite. This expression is usually used when, perhaps in some material, the fire fails to the point that it appears to be extinguished; and if perhaps it is renewed when kindling has been added, it is said to have been rekindled. Or if the light of a lamp should reach the point that it is thought to have gone out, if perhaps it be revived when oil has been poured in; although the expression is less refined, the lamp is said to have been rekindled. One will speak similarly also of a torch or other lights of this kind.This expression seems to indicate something like this also in Jacob. As long as he was far from Joseph and received no information about his life, his spirit had failed in him, as it were, and the light which was in him had been darkened, as the kindling already failed. But when those who reported to him about Joseph’s life came, that is, those who said that “the life was the light of all people,” he rekindles his spirit in himself, and the brightness of the true light is renewed in him.

But not even this is to be neglected idly, that the text says not the soul, but the spirit as its better part, was revived or rekindled. For indeed the brightness of the light that was in him, even if it was not completely extinguished then when his sons showed him Joseph’s robe stained with the blood of a kid. He could be deceived by their lie, so that “he tore his garments and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned his son, nor did he wish at all to be consoled,” but said, “I go down to my son into the nether world, mourning.” Even if then, as we said, the light in him had not been completely extinguished, nevertheless it had been darkened in the greatest degree because he could be deceived, because he could tear his garments, because he could mourn by mistake, because he could call on death, because he desired to go down into the nether world, mourning. On account of these things, therefore, he now revives and “rekindles his spirit,” because it followed logically that hearing the truth would rekindle and restore the light that the deceit of a lie had obscured in him.
