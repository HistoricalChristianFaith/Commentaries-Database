Who do you think those whole stones are? The conscience of everyone knows who is whole, who is uncorrupted, unpolluted, unstained in flesh and in spirit. This is the one in whom iron has not been set, that is, who did not receive “the fiery darts of the evil one,” the darts of lust, but by the shield of faith “quenched and repelled them”; or the one who never assumed the iron of battle, the iron of war, the iron of strife, but was always peaceable, always calm and gentle, formed out of the humility of Christ. Those, therefore, are “the living stones” out of which Jesus our Lord “constructed an altar from whole stones, in which iron had not been set,” so that he might offer upon them “whole burnt offerings and the sacrifice of salvation.”

I myself think that perhaps the holy apostles are able to be such whole and undefiled stones, making one altar all together on account of their unanimity and concord. For thus “praying unanimously” and opening their mouths all together, they are reported to have said, “You, Lord, you who know the hearts of all.” Therefore, those of one mind who were able to pray with one voice and one spirit, they are perhaps the worthy ones who all together ought to build one altar, upon which Jesus may offer sacrifices to the Father. Yet may we also try to take care that “we all may speak the same thing” with one accord, “perceiving one thing, doing nothing through contention or through vain glory” but “remaining in one mind and in the same purpose,” if perhaps we ourselves can also be made fit stones for the altar.
