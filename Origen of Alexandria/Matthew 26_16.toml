The opportunity which Judas sought is further explained by Luke, how he might betray him in the absence of the multitude; (Luke 22:6.) when the populace was not with Him, but He was withdrawn with His disciples. And this he did, delivering Him up after supper, when He was withdrawn to the garden of Gethsemane. And from that time forward, such has been the season sought for by those that would betray the word of God in time of persecution when the multitude of believers is not around the word of truth.

"From then on he sought an opportunity to betray him." Luke's Gospel shows most clearly the kind of opportunity for which Judas was looking when it says, "And he sought an opportunity to betray him in the absence of the crowds," that is, when the people were not with him but when he was alone with his disciples. His betrayer did the deed after supper, when Christ was alone in the garden of Gethsemane. For once Judas reached his agreement with the Jews, he determined that his opportunity would come when Jesus was not with the crowds. Notice how even today the betrayers of Jesus Christ, Word of truth and Word of God, see their best opportunity to hand him over at a time when Christians are being persecuted.… They are at their worst when the number of his faithful is at its fewest. And since there is a time for all things, for Solomon said "there is a time to be born and a time to die," the time for betraying the Word of truth was specifically when very few of the faithful were with Christ.
