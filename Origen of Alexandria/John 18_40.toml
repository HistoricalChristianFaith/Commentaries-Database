There is a likeness between the names of Barabbas and Jesus that is nothing short of a true mystery. Barabbas is appointed for making sedition and wars and murders in the souls of people, but Jesus is appointed for all good things as the Son of God and Peace and Word and Wisdom. These two therefore are bound in both human things and bodies. Here the people [of the Jews] asked for Barabbas to be released to them. Therefore, that nation [i.e., Israel] does not cease from having seditions and murders and robberies, as regards some of their own race in outward things but also as regards all the Jews who do not believe in Jesus who have also struggles within their own souls. For where Jesus is not, there are seditions and quarrels and battles. But where Jesus is … all good things, and innumerable spiritual riches, along with peace, rest in their hands. For he is our peace who made both one. And if anyone sees the opposite take place, he will recognize in them all that notable prisoner, Barabbas, whose release is craved not only then by sinful Israel according to the flesh but also by all like them in either doctrine or life. Whoever, therefore, does evil things in his body frees Barabbas and binds Christ. But whoever does good things frees Christ and binds Barabbas.

Celsus’s comparison of Christ to a robber or murderer … is anticipated in the Gospels since God was numbered with the transgressors by wicked people who wanted a murderer (one who had been cast into prison for sedition and murder) to be released to them and wanted Jesus to be crucified. And they crucified him between two robbers. Jesus, indeed, is always being crucified with robbers among his genuine disciples and witnesses to the truth, and he suffers the same condemnation they do among people—if indeed we grant that those people have any resemblance to robbers who because of their godly lives suffer all kinds of injury and death so that they may keep their lives clean and pure.… But neither Jesus … nor they were … put to death according to any form of justice, and so it is his persecutors who are the ones who should incur the charge.
