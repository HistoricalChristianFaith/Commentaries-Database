I ask, therefore, on what day the heavenly manna began to be given. I wish to compare our Lord’s day with the sabbath of the Jews. For the divine Scriptures it appears that manna was first given on earth on the Lord’s day. For if, as Scripture says, it was gathered for six consecutive days, but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, it was stopped, without doubt it began on the first day, which is the Lord’s day. But if it is plain from divine Scriptures that on the Lord’s day God rained manna and on the sabbath he did not, let the Jews understand that already at that time our Lord’s day was preferred to the Jewish sabbath. Even then it was revealed that on their own sabbath no grace of God descended to them from the sky; no bread of heaven, which is the Word of God, came to them. For a prophet also says elsewhere, “The sons of Israel will sit for many days without a king, without a prince, without a prophet, without a victim, without a sacrifice, without a priest.” On our Lord’s day, however, the Lord always rains manna from the sky.

For the prophecy was fulfilled that had declared, “For the children of Israel shall abide many days without king and prince. There shall be no victim, nor altar, nor priesthood, nor answers.” These testimonies, accordingly, we employ against those who presume to assert that what is spoken in Genesis by Jacob refers to Judah. They say that there still remains a prince of the race of Judah—he, namely, who is the prince of their nation, whom they style patriarch—and that there cannot fail [a ruler] of his seed, who will remain until the advent of that Christ whom they picture themselves. But if the prophet’s words are true when he says, “The children of Israel shall abide many days without a king, without prince; and there shall be no victim, nor altar, nor priesthood,” and if, certainly, since the overthrow of the temple, victims are neither offered, nor any altar found, nor any priesthood exists. So it is most certain that, as it is written, princes have departed from Judah and a leader from between his thighs, until the coming of him for whom it has been reserved. It is established, then, that he has indeed come from whom it has been reserved and in whom is the expectation of the Gentiles. And this manifestly seems to be fulfilled in the multitude of those who have believed in God through Christ out of the different nations.
