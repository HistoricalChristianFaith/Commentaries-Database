The fourth song is in the book of Judges. Concerning it there is written, “And Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying, ‘That the princes took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the Lord! Hear, O kings, give ear, O governors!’ ” and the rest. And the person who sings this ought to be a bee, whose product is used by kings and ordinary people for their health. For “Deborah,” who sings this song, means “bee.” Moreover, Barak is with her; and his name means “flashing.” And this song is sung after a victory, because no one can sing of what is perfect unless he has conquered his adversaries. Furthermore, it is said in this song, “Awake, awake, Deborah! Stir up the thousands of the people. Awake, awake, utter a song! Awake, Barak!” But you will find these matters more fully discussed in the homilies we have given on the book of Judges.
