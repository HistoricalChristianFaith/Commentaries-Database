And as for the consummation of the world, Jacob is the first to refer to this when, in giving his testament to his sons he says, “Gather to me, you sons of Jacob, that I may tell you what shall be in the last days,” or, “after the last days.” If then there are “last days,” or a time “after the last days,” it follows of necessity that the days that had a beginning also come to an end.
