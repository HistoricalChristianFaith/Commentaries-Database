Even the apostle Paul himself says that he knows in part and understands in part. So who is there who can make a claim that he understands? For however much he may understand, it will appear that he understands through a glass darkly and that only after he lays aside this earthly body will he see face to face. … Thus it is that “no one understands, no one seeks for God.” For as long as we are preoccupied with the cares of the body and seek the things of the body, we cannot seek God nor can we think his thoughts.
