There are various forms of blasphemy. One of them is uttered by those who do not understand or hear what is being said or acknowledge what is true. Now Jesus had said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up." But those who were passing along, like "false witnesses" against Jesus, related what he had not said, attacking him: "Aha, you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself." The truth is, he will not destroy the temple, but what others destroy he will build, whether it be the "temple of his body," which the Jews delivered up to death, or the temple of his witnesses and all those who had God's word in them and who, because of the snares of the wicked, died out of love for God (for "the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live"). And they lied not only when they said, "You who would destroy the temple," but also when they said, "And I will build it in three days." For he did not say that he would build the temple but raise it up. The verb build does not designate a sudden action, but "raise up" does.
