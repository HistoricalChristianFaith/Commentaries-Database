These are the words of the divine Scripture. Let us see, therefore, now what is fitting to be understood in them. “I have descended,” the text says, “to see.” When responses are delivered to Abraham, God is not said to descend but to stand before him, as we explained above: “Three men,” the text says, “stood before him.” But now, because sinners are involved, God is said to descend. Beware lest you think of ascending and descending spatially. For this is frequently found in the sacred literature, as in the prophet Micah: “Behold,” Scripture says, “the Lord departed from his holy place and came down and will tread upon the high places of the earth.” Therefore God is said to descend when he deigns to have concern for human frailty. This should be discerned especially of our Lord and Savior, who “thought it not robbery to be equal with God but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.” Therefore he descended. For “no other has ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” For the Lord descended not only to care for us but also to bear these things that are ours. “For he took the form of a servant,” and although he himself is invisible in nature, inasmuch as he is equal to the Father, nevertheless he took a visible appearance “and was found in appearance as a man.” But also when he descends he is below with some, but he ascends with others and is above. For he goes up with the chosen apostles “into a high mountain and there is transfigured before them.” Therefore he is above with those whom he teaches about the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. But he is below with the crowds and Pharisees, whose sins he reproaches, and he is there with them.… He could not, however, be transfigured below, but he ascended above with those who could follow him, and there he is transfigured.

So also now, therefore, it is said of these who live in Sodom, that if indeed, on his examination, “their deeds are completed as the cry” that has ascended to God, they would be considered unworthy. But if there is any conversion among them, if even ten just men might be found among them, so, at last, God would know them. And for this reason the text said, “But if not, that I might know.” It did not say that I might know what they are doing but that I might know them and make them worthy of knowledge of me, if I should find some among them just, if I should find some repentant, if some such as I ought to know.
