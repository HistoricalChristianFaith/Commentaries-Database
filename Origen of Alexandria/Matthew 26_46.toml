When He had roused them from sleep, seeing in the Spirit Judas drawing near to betray Him, though the disciples could not yet see him, He says, Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.

And even now Jesus is betrayed into the hands of sinners, when those who seem to believe in Jesus, continue to sin while they have Him in their hands. Also whenever a righteous man, who has Jesus in Him, is put into the power of sinners, Jesus is delivered into the hands of sinners.

He says not, Draws near to thee, for indeed the traitor was not near Him, but had removed himself far off through his sins.

"Look! The hour is approaching, and the Son of man will be delivered up into the hands of sinners." It is also in view of this hour, I believe, that he said to his mother, "My hour has not yet come." And now he declares that with the hour approaching, "the Son of man will be delivered up into the hands of sinners." Would that only into the hands of those sinners had Jesus been delivered up! But now I believe that he is delivered up always "into the hands of sinners" when they who seem to believe in Jesus have him in their hands since they are sinners. Indeed, as often as a righteous person indwelt by Jesus has fallen under the sway of sinners, Jesus is delivered up "into the hands of sinners.""Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is approaching." After he has awakened them from that sleep we spoke about, he says to his disciples, "Rise, let us be going." And seeing Judas in his mind, who was approaching him to deliver him up and who was not yet seen by his disciples, he says, "See, the one who will deliver me up is approaching." I believe, however, that "see, he is approaching" and "see, the one who will deliver me up is approaching" are not equivalent. Furthermore, the traitor, who had separated himself from Jesus by his sins and his betrayal was not simply "approaching" Jesus, but "he is approaching" to deliver up the Son of God, whom he already betrayed. Plainly, all wrongdoers first betray Jesus; then they deliver him up.
