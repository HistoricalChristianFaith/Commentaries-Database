But do you want me to show you from the Scriptures that trees or wood are given the name of individual virtues, which we mentioned above? I turn to the most wise Solomon as a witness when he said about wisdom, “The tree of life is for all who embrace it.” Therefore, if “wisdom is the tree of life,” without a doubt, there is another tree of prudence, another of knowledge and another of justice. For logically it is not said that only wisdom, of all the virtues, was worthy to be called “the tree of life” but that the other virtues did not receive names of similar sort. Therefore, “the trees of the field will give their fruit.” This is what I believe the blessed David also understood about himself when he said, “But I am as a fruitful olive tree in the house of God.” From this he clearly shows that the olive tree designates a just and holy person.
