Consider that when Peter sat outside, separated from Jesus while he was in the court of the high priest, he denied Jesus before everyone. And again a second time he denied him in the same way, not having gone outside the door but wanting to go out, yet still not having gone out. But also the third time, when those who stood by said, “Truly you are one of them” and he began to call a curse on himself and swore, “I do not know the man,” he was still not outside. And notice that all of his denials were made in the night and in the darkness before the coming of the day and the sign of day, that is, the rooster crowing, which wakes up those who are willing from their sleep. And I may say that if Peter had denied after the rooster crowed—when it might be said “the night is far spent, the day is at hand, let us walk honorably as in the day”—Peter would have deserved no excuse. But perhaps when anyone denies Jesus in such a way that the sin of denial may admit of healing, that person too appears to deny him before the rooster crows, since the Sun of righteousness has not yet been born to them, nor have they drawn near to his rising.
