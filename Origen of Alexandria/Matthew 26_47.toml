Someone may question why “a great crowd” gathered “with swords and clubs” against him. According to John, this large crowd consisted of a band of soldiers and officers sent by the chief priests. And someone may say that because of the multitude of believers from the people, so many came against him lest a large crowd of believers snatch him out of their hands. But I think there may be another reason why the crowd had gathered against him. Those who believed that he exorcised devils in the name of Beelzebub thought that out of a kind of black magic he could escape from the midst of those who wanted to take hold of him. And perhaps some of them had heard that once when he was to be thrown down from a mountaintop he escaped from the hands of those who were holding him, not by simple human flight but by some preternatural force.
