Where are they who deny that Christ proclaimed in the Gospel the law to be of God, or can it be supposed that the righteous God made His own Son under a hostile law which He Himself had not given? It is written in the law of Moses as follows, Every male which openeth the womb shall be called holy unto the Lord. (Ex. 13:2, 12.)

For this reason it seems wonderful that the sacrifice of Mary was not the first offering, that is, "a lamb a year old," but the second, since "she could not afford" the first. For as it was written about her, Jesus' parents came "to offer a sacrifice" for him, "according to what is said in the law of the Lord, 'a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.' " But this also shows the truth of what was written, that Jesus Christ "although he was rich, became a poor man." Therefore, for this reason, he chose both a poor mother, from whom he was born, and a poor homeland, about which it is said, "But you, O Bethlehem Ephratha, who are little to be among the clans of Judah," and the rest.
