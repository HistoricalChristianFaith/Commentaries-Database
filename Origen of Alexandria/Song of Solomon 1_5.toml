“I am dark and lovely, O daughters of Jerusalem, like the tents of Kedar, like the coverings of Solomon.” In other manuscripts we read, “I am black and lovely.” Again in this passage the character of the bride is introduced as the one speaking, but she is not speaking to those young women who are accustomed to run with her, but “to the daughters of Jerusalem.” Although they have derided her for her hideousness, she seems to answer them and say “I am indeed dark” or “black” as far as the color is concerned, “O daughters of Jerusalem,” but I am “beautiful, if someone should examine the internal liniments of the limbs.” For he also says “tents of Kedar,” which is a great nation. They are “black” and the very name of the people “Kedar” means blackness or darkness. But also the “coverings of Solomon” are black and nonetheless the blackness of the coverings did not seem unsightly to the king in all his glory. …This covers the historical drama and the quasi-story that has been set forth. But let us return to the mystical interpretation. This bride who speaks represents the church gathered from the Gentiles; but the “daughters of Jerusalem,” with whom she hold this discourse … are the daughters of this earthly Jerusalem, who see the church from the Gentiles, although they see her as lowborn because she cannot ascribe to herself the noble quality of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.…
Responding to these things, she says, “Indeed I am black, O daughters of Jerusalem,” inasmuch as I am not a descendant from the stock of famous men and I did not receive the illumination of the law of Moses, but I have my beauty with me. For also in me there is that first quality, namely that I was created in the image of God; and now that I have drawn near to the Word of God, I have received my beauty.
… I am indeed “black” because of the baseness of my ancestry, but I am “beautiful” because of my repentance and faith. For I received the Son of God in me, I received the Word made flesh. I drew near to him, who is the image of God, the firstborn of all creation and who is the splendor of the glory and the image of the substance of God, and I was made beautiful.…
But this can be said about each and every soul that is converted to repentance after very many sins: it was “black” owing to its sins, but “beautiful” because of its repentance and the fruits of repentance.

Thus some such process also happens to us who are in generation. We are dark at the beginning in believing—hence in the beginning of the Canticle of Canticles it is said, “I am very dark and beautiful,” and we look like the soul of an Ethiopian at the beginning—then we are cleansed so that we may be more bright according to the passage, “Who is she who comes up whitened?”
