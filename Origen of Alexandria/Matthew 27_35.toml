There are those who to this day do not have the Lord with them but do have his "garments"—namely, the words contained in Scripture. They do not have them in full but only in part. Nonetheless the prophet had spoken that prediction which was now fulfilled. Now, as to whether any of his clothes were torn apart when they divided his garments or whether any of them remained intact and just what those items were, nothing is said by the first three Evangelists. But in John we read that "when the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, 'Let us not tear it but cast lots for it.' " Therefore not all but only one of the soldiers who had cast lots received it. Now anyone debating the differences between those who have the Lord's "garments" will doubtless find some people who, although they do not have the Lord in their teachings, do have the "tunic" that was "woven from top to bottom."
