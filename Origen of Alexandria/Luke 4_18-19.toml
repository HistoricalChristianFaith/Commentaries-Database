He says, "He sent me to preach the gospel to the poor." The "poor" stand for the Gentiles, for they are indeed poor. They possess nothing at all: neither God, nor the law, nor the prophets, nor justice and the rest of the virtues. For what reason did God send him to preach to the poor? "To preach release to captives." We were the captives. For many years Satan had bound us and held us captive and subject to himself. Jesus has come "to proclaim release to captives and sight to the blind." By his word and the proclamation of his teaching the blind see. Therefore his "proclamation" should be understood not only of the "captives" but also of the "blind.""To send broken men forth into freedom …" What being was so broken and crushed as man, whom Jesus healed and sent away? "To preach an acceptable year to the Lord." … But all of this has been proclaimed so that we may come to "the acceptable year of the Lord," when we see after blindness, when we are free from our chains, and when we have been healed of our wounds.
