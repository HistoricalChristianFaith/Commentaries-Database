Or, the sleep He now bids His disciples take is of a different sort from that which is related above to have befallen them. Then He found them sleeping, not taking repose, but because their eyes were heavy, but now they are not merely to sleep, but to take their rest, that this order may be rightly observed, namely, that we first watch with prayer that we enter not into temptation, and afterwards sleep and take our rest, when having found a place for the Lord, a tabernacle for the God of Jacob, (Ps. 132:3.) we may go up into our bed, and give sleep to our eyes. It may be also that the soul, unable to sustain a continual energy by reason of its union with the flesh, may blamelessly admit some relaxations, which may be the moral interpretation of slumbers, and then again after due time be quickened to new energy.

Then, undoubtedly after the third prayer, he came to the disciples. But the sleep he now orders them to sleep is not that which, as is written, came upon the disciples twice before. For at first "he found them sleeping" but not at rest, and "again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy." But now he orders them not simply to sleep but to take their rest. Indeed, there is a big difference between the sleep implied in Christ's second command to "sleep now and take your rest" and the sleep that is against his will after he orders them to "remain here and watch one hour with me." There was nothing contradictory between his words "watch with me" and later, "Sleep on and take your rest." He simply kept a certain order, so that first indeed we should watch and pray that we do not enter into temptation, and then we should sleep and take our rest according to Christ's command.
