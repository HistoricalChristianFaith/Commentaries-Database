In the Psalms the prophet gives thanks saying, “He who lifts me up from the gates of death that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” And from this we learn that it is never possible for anyone to be fit to declare the praises of God, unless he has been lifted up from the gates of death and has come to the gates of Zion.
