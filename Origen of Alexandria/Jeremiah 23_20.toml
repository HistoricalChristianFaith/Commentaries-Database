It is the custom in Scripture, after what is bitter, to say kind things for encouragement, and after what is good to say more bitter words. Scripture does this in order that, when they have disdained the wealth of the goodness of God, they may not store up for themselves anger in a day of anger. Hence God said, “If anger comes, it will not withdraw unless God has accomplished what he wants.” And if God wants, anger also occurs, in order that what God wants does occur. For if anyone does not want to be in the will of the Word of God, the anger23 is unleashed on him. Thus let us not show a need for an anger or wrath that disciplines.
