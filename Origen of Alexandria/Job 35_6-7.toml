If you look at the heavens and contemplate the clouds, you will understand that you sinned. And what do you need to do? It is necessary that you approach the high priest and implore him to offer a victim for you. “If any one does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous; and he is the expiation of our sins.” If you will do this, you will dissolve your numerous sins. And for those irremediable sins from which we cannot be cured, Jesus Christ came from heaven to cure what was irremediable, and so that it might happen that “blessed are they whose transgressions are forgiven and whose sins are covered.”
