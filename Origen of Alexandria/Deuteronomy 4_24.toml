“God is spirit, and those who worship him should worship in spirit and in truth.” Our God is also “a consuming fire.” Therefore God is called by two names: “spirit” and “fire.” To the just he is spirit; to sinners he is fire.

Hear what is written: “Our God is a consuming fire.” What does the God of fire consume? Will we be so senseless as to think that God consumes the firewood or straw or hay? But the God of fire consumes human sins. He consumes them, devours them, purges them, as he says in another place, “I will purge you with fire for purity.”
