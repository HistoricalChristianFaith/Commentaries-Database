In the Gospel of Luke, the Holy Spirit writes this of him before he reached the age of twelve: “But the boy grew and was strengthened, and he was filled with wisdom.” Human nature itself does not permit this, that wisdom is perfected before the twelfth year of life. It is one thing to participate in wisdom, another thing to be filled with wisdom.…The Son of God “had emptied himself,” and, for that reason, again he is filled with wisdom. “And the grace of God was upon him.” He possessed the grace of God not when he reached young manhood, not when he taught openly, but already when he was a small child.
