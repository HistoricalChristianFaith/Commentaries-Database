Let the church of God, therefore, in this spiritual way understand the births, in this way receive the procreations, in this way uphold the deeds of the fathers with a fitting and honorable interpretation and in this way not disgrace the words of the Holy Spirit with foolish rabbinic fables4 but reckon them to be full of honor, full of virtue and usefulness.
