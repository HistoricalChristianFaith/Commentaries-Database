Let us ask the Lord lest, in accordance with the apostle’s word, even with us, “when Moses is read the veil be upon” our “heart.” For it has been read that Abraham begot a son, Isaac, when he was a hundred years old. “And Sarah said, ‘Who will announce to Abraham that Sarah nurses a child?’ ” “And then,” the text says, “Abraham circumcised the child on the eighth day.” Abraham does not celebrate his son’s birthday, but he celebrates the day of this weaning “and makes a great feast.”6Why? Do we think that it is the Holy Spirit’s intention to write stories and to narrate how a child was weaned and a feast was made, how he played and did other childish things? Or should we understand by these things that he wishes to teach us something divine and worthy that the human race might learn from the words of God?
