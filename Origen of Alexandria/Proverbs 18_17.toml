David also speaks in the Psalms and says, “I made my iniquity known and did not cover my sin. I said, ‘I will proclaim my injustice against myself,’ and you have forgiven the impiety of my heart.” You see, therefore, that “to proclaim the sin” is to deserve the forgiveness of sin. For the devil, having been anticipated in the accusation, will not be able to accuse us further. If we are our own accusers, this profits us to salvation. But if we delay so that we are accused by the devil, that accusation delivers us to punishment; for he will have as companions in hell those whom he will have convicted of complicity.
