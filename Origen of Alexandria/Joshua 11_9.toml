The horses and the chariots that are removed seem to hold the figure of those who, although placed in the heavens, fell away through wantonness and pride, either when they set themselves aflame to desire the daughters of humankind or when they followed him who said, “I shall place my seat above the clouds and I shall be like the Most High.” Perhaps it is for that reason that the prophet also says, “False is the horse for salvation.” And again, concerning those who trust in demons, he says, “These call on chariots and those on horses, but we shall call upon the name of our God.” Certainly Scripture would not apply chariots and horses to God, at least as far as invoking them. But, by all means, it shows that just as we ourselves call upon the true God, so the nations invoke “chariots and horses,” that is, demons, those whom the nations who waged war against Israel invoked. Moreover, Scripture also mentions the horses of the Egyptians, even those very ones ordered to be destroyed at that time.

If we understand the horses that are commanded by the precept of God to be hamstrung, together with their chariots, as the passions of the body—that is, lust, petulance or pride, and fickleness, by whom the unhappy soul, just as a rider, is borne and carried to great dangers—this understanding will not be contrary to our reasoning. The horse, of course, is hamstrung when the body is humbled by fastings and vigils and by every pain of self-denial. And the chariots are consumed by fire when the word of the Lord is fulfilled in us, as he says, “I came to send fire on the earth, and how I wish that it be set ablaze!” Those persons already revealed themselves to burn in that fire who said, “Was not our heart burning within us when he opened the Scripture for us?” Also, therefore, the horse is called “false for salvation” if we allow the impulses of the body to be endured unbridled and if we do not subdue the wanton and haughty necks of the flesh by the yoke of self-denial.But now, if by chance anyone is stimulated and pricked by the words of God through what we say; if he who yesterday might have been carried into lust, flying headlong and impetuous as a horse, yet today, after hearing these things, repents and is converted; if this person even, according to the prophet, “is subdued by the fear of God,” bridles himself, withdraws from sin and henceforth loves the chaste and continent life, then indeed we shall seem “to have hamstrung horses” by drawing the sword of the word of God. For the precept of God is more fittingly accomplished by this than by someone who hamstrings equine animals captured from the spoils of enemies.
