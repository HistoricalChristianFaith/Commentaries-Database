The tax collector in the Gospel, therefore, acting properly, “did not wish even to lift up his eyes,” but on the other hand, the disciple who is present with Jesus would reasonably lift them up when he is given the command, “Lift up your eyes and see the fields, that they are already white to harvest.”2The prophet, too, says, “Lift up your eyes on high.” But in addition, in Psalm 122 (LXX), which is the fourth song of the gradual psalms, the prophet, when he has lifted up his eyes to God in a fitting manner, says, “To you who dwell in heaven I have lifted up my eyes. Behold as the eyes of servants are on the hands of their masters, as the eyes of a handmaid are on the hands of her mistress, so our eyes are on the Lord our God, until he has mercy on us.”
And if we must also show more clearly for whom it is now proper to imitate Jesus by lifting up his eyes, in that he also lifts up his eyes, and for whom this is not proper, but who, like the tax collector, should not only stand far away from the temple but also not wish to lift up his eyes, we will quote the words of Daniel about the lawless elders who lusted after Susanna. The words are as follows: “And they perverted their own mind and turned their eyes away that they might not look to heaven or remember just judgments.” These words should be taken along with the following remarks made about Susanna, “But she, weeping, looked up to heaven, for her heart trusted in the Lord.” Notice in these words that those who perverted their own mind turned their eyes away that they might not look to heaven, but she who trusted in the Lord looked up to heaven as a result of her trust in the Lord.
