Do you still wish that I prove more clearly to you that all things among that prior people, whom Moses foreshadowed in the two and a half tribes, were neither complete nor perfect? Even the history written in this little book itself, Jesus [Joshua], son of Nun, also declares it when it says that the true altar was in the land that Jesus [Joshua] was distributing. But those who were across the Jordan, that is, Reuben and Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh, made an altar for themselves, but it was not a true altar. It merely contained a type and sign of the true altar that was with Jesus [Joshua]. Thus you have no cause to wonder whether or not those people had received the entire knowledge of the Trinity, since they had built neither an entire nor a true altar.
