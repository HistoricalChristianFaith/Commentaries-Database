One window is one of our senses. The Bridegroom looks out through it. Another window is another sense. Through it he gazes with active concern for our well-being. For what senses are there through which the Word of God does not look out? The following example teaches us what “looking out through the windows” means and in what way the Bridegroom sees through them. Where he does not look out, there is death found coming up, as we read in Jeremiah: “See, death is come up through your windows.” When you look on a woman to lust after her, death comes up through your windows.

We can take the windows as meaning the bodily sense through which life or death gains entrance to the soul. That is what the prophet Jeremiah means when, speaking of sinners, he says, “Death is coming up through your windows.” How does death come up through windows? If the eyes of a sinner should “look on a woman to lust after her.” He who has looked on a woman thus “has committed adultery with her in his heart.” Then death has gained entrance to that soul through the windows of the eyes.
