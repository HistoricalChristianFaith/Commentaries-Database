To be fully alive belongs to God, more fully than to any creature. The apostle considered the superiority of the life of God to be beyond comparison. It is with this in mind that Scripture says “Surely as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the Lord.” This is God, “Who alone has immortality,” because none of the living beings with God has the life whose aliveness is absolutely unchangeable and immutable.

We must understand, therefore, that this charity, which God is, in whoever it exists loves nothing earthly, nothing material, nothing corruptible. It is against its nature to love anything corruptible, seeing that it is itself the fount of incorruption. For, because God, “who only has immortality and inhabits light inaccessible,” is charity, it is charity alone that possesses immortality.
