And we notice that the saying, “The barren has borne seven, and she that has many children is weakened,” is in accord with this;7 as also is that which is said in the blessings: “There shall not be one among you that is childless or barren.” This being so, it follows that just as there is one love, known as carnal and also known as Cupid by the poets, according to which the lover sows in the flesh. So also is there another, a spiritual love, by which the inner man who loves sows in the spirit. And, to speak more plainly, if anyone still bears the image of the earthly according to the outer man, then he is moved by earthly desire and love; but the desire and love of him who bears the image of the heavenly according to the inner man are heavenly.
