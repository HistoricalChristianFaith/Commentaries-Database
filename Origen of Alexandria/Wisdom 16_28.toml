It seems to me that, to complete the argument of the prayer, it would not be out of place after this to discuss briefly the disposition and the attitude that one who prays must have, as well as the place where one should pray and the direction he should face (if circumstances permit) and the choice of the appropriate time for praying, and topics of this kind. Disposition refers to the soul, attitude to the body. Thus Paul says … one must pray “without anger or dissension.” The attitude consists in “raising pure hands,” expressions that seem to me to be derived from the psalms, which say, “May the raising of my hands be like the evening sacrifice.” Regarding the place, “I want therefore that people pray in every place.” Regarding the orientation, the Wisdom of Solomon says, “To make it known that one must rise before the sun to give you thanks and worship you before the dawning of the light.”
