When Christ shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father, then those living beings, because they have before this been made part of Christ’s kingdom, shall also be delivered up along with the whole of that kingdom to the rule of the Father, so that, when “God shall be all in all,” they also, since they are a part of all, may have God even in themselves, as he is in all things.
