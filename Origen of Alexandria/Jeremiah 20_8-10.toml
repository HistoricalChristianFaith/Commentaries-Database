And so far as the literal truth is concerned, it is useful to recount what things Jeremiah suffered among the people, with respect to which he said, “And I said, I will not speak, nor will I call on the name of the Lord.” And again, elsewhere, “I was continually being mocked.” And how great sufferings he endured from the then king of Israel are written in his prophecy. And it is also written that some of the people often came to stone Moses to death. His homeland was not the stones of any place but was instead the people who followed him, among whom also he was dishonored.

That people then were sick. There were all kinds of diseases among those who had the name of the people of God. God sent to them the prophets as healers. One of the healers was Jeremiah. He reproved the sinners, since he wanted those who do evil to return. Yet, though needing to hear what was said, they accused the prophet, and they accused before judges similar to themselves. And always the prophet was judged by those who, with respect to his prophecy, had been cured but were not cured because of their own disobedience. It is due to them that he says, “And I said, ‘I will no longer speak nor name the name of the Lord.’ But it happened as a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am weakened on all sides, and I cannot bear it.” He said, seeing himself as one who always is judged, abused, accused and falsely testified against, “Woe is me, mother. What kind of man did you bear me?” He was not speaking as a man who judges but as one who is judged, and not as one who disputes but one who is disputed over all of the earth. Since those who are sick do not hear him when he advises for their good and well being, he says, “I have not helped.”
