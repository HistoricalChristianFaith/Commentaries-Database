The Spirit, therefore, “asks” and “intercedes,” but we “pray.” And Joshua’s words commanding the sun to stand over [Gibeon] seem to me to be an intercession also.… And in Judges, Samson in my opinion said in intercession: “Let me die with the foreigners—when he bent in his strength and the house fell upon the princes and all the people that were there.” Even though it is not written that Joshua and Samson “interceded” but that they “said,” nevertheless their words seem to be an “intercession,” which we must judge to be different from a “prayer,” if we are to give words their proper meaning.
