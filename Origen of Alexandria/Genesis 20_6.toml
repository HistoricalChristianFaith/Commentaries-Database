But what is the meaning of that which Scripture adds: “And the Lord did not permit him to touch her”? If Sarah represents virtue and Abimelech wished to receive virtue “with a pure heart,” why is it said that “the Lord did not permit him to touch her”?Abimelech means “my father is king.” It seems to me therefore that this Abimelech represents the studious and wise men of the world, who by giving attention to philosophy, although they do not reach the complete and perfect rule of piety, nevertheless perceive that God is the Father and King of all things. Those, therefore, so far as it pertains to ethics (that is, moral philosophy), are acknowledged also to have given attention in some respects to purity of heart and to have sought the inspiration of divine virtue with all their mind and zeal. But “God did not permit” them “to touch” her. For this grace was designed to be delivered to the Gentiles not by Abraham, who, although he was great was nevertheless a servant, but by Christ.… Abraham was eager that what was said to him be fulfilled through and in himself, that “all the nations shall be blessed in you.” Nevertheless the promise to him is established in Isaac, that is, in Christ, as the apostle says: “He did not say, And to his seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to your seed, which is Christ.”26
Nevertheless “the Lord heals Abimelech and his wife and his handmaids.”
