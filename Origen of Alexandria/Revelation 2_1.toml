In many places, and especially in the Psalms, you will find speech addressed to the angels. Power has been given to man—at least to him who has the Holy Spirit—to speak even to the angels. I shall give one example from these instances, so that we might realize that angels too can be taught by human voices. It has been written in the Apocalypse of John, “Write to the angel of the church of the Ephesians, ‘I have something against you.’ ” And again, “Write to the angel of the church of Pergamum, ‘I have something against you.’ ” Clearly it is a man who writes to angels and enjoins something.
