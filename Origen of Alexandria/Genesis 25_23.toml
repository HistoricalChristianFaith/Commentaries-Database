I think that this can be said also of each of us as individuals that “two nations and two peoples are within you.” For there is a people of virtue within us, and there is no less a people of vice within us. “For from our heart proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, thefts, false testimonies” but also “deceits, contentions, heresies, jealousies, revelings and such like.” Do you see how great a people of evil is within us? But if we should deserve to utter that word of the saints, “From fear of you, Lord, we have conceived in the womb and have brought forth. We have wrought the spirit of your salvation on the earth.” Thus another people, begotten in the Spirit, is found within us. For “the fruit of the spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, goodness, gentleness, temperance, purity” and so forth. You see another people that is also itself within us. But this one is less; that one greater. For there are always more evil than good people, and vices are more numerous than virtues. But if we should be such as Rebekah and should deserve to conceive from Isaac, that is, from the Word of God, “one people shall overcome the other, and the elder shall serve the younger,” even in us, for the flesh shall serve the Spirit, and vices shall yield to virtues.
