Our earth, that is, our heart, receives blessings if it receives “the rain” of the doctrine of the law “that often falls upon it” and brings forth the fruit of works. But if it does not have a spiritual work but “thorns and thistles,” that is, cares of the world or the desire of pleasures and riches, “it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.” For that reason, each one of the hearers, when he assembles to hear, receives “the shower” of the Word of God; and, if one indeed brings forth the fruit of a good work, one will obtain “a blessing.” But if a person disdains the received Word of God and frequently neglects to hear it and subjects himself to the care and passion of secular affairs, as one who would suffocate the Word “with thorns,” he will procure “a curse” for a blessing, and, instead of receiving a blessing, his “end is to be burned.” Therefore, he says, “I will give you your rains in their season.”

Let us see then whether by an illustration used by the apostle in the epistle to the Hebrews, we are able to prove that by one operation God has mercy upon one while he hardens another. It is not God’s intent to harden, but while having a good purpose, hardening follows as a result of the inherent principle of wickedness in such persons, so that he is said to harden him who is hardened. … As regards the rain there is one operation, but the ground which is cultivated produces fruit, while that which is neglected and is barren produces thorns.
