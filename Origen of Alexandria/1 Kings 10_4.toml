The Scriptures express astonishment that the queen of Sheba came from “the end of the earth to hear Solomon’s wisdom.” When she saw his dinner, his furnishings and the attendants in his place, she was astounded and wholly in a state of wonder. If we do not embrace the great riches of our Lord, the great furnishings of his Word and the wealth of his teachings; if we do not eat the “bread of life”; if we are not fed with the flesh of Jesus and do not drink his blood; if we disdain the banquet of our Savior, we should realize that God has both “kindness and severity.” Of these, we should pray more for his kindness on us, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
