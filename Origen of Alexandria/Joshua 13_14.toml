Neither Moses nor Jesus [Joshua], however, gave an inheritance to the Levites, because “the Lord God himself is their inheritance.” What else can we understand by this, except that in the church of the Lord there are certain persons who precede all the rest by the strength of their spirit and on account of their merits? The Lord himself is said to be their inheritance. And if it is proper to venture into such things and unveil a profound secret, let us see what the figure of priests or Levites secretly discloses, in case there is something. For among every people—I speak of those who are saved—the great majority are no doubt those who please the Lord through good works, honest ways and acceptable deeds because they simply believe in and fear God. But there are a few persons, exceedingly rare, who give attention to wisdom and to knowledge, keep their mind clean and pure, and cultivate noble virtues for their souls. Through the influence of teaching, they can then illuminate the way for the other more simple ones to walk to and arrive at salvation. These persons are probably designated here under the name of Levites and priests, whose heritage is said to be the Lord himself, who is wisdom, which they dearly loved above all other things.
