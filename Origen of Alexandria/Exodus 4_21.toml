Now many have been troubled by the story of Pharaoh, in dealing with whom God says several times, “I will harden Pharaoh’s heart.” For if he is hardened by God and through being hardened sins, he is not himself responsible for the sin; and if this is so, Pharaoh has no free will. And someone will say that in the same way those who are lost have no free will and will not be lost on their own account. Also the saying in Ezekiel, “I will take away their stony hearts and will put in them hearts of flesh, that they may walk in my statutes and keep my judgments,” might lead one to suppose that it was God who gave the power to walk in the commandments and to keep the judgments, by his removing the hindrance, the stony heart, and implanting something better, the heart of flesh.
