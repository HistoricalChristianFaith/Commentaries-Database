We say therefore with confidence that according to the Scriptures God does not know [in the sense of acknowledge] all people. God does not know sin, and God does not know sinners. He is ignorant, so to speak, of those alienated from himself. Hear the Scripture saying “The Lord knows those who are his” and “Let everyone depart from iniquity who calls on the name of the Lord.” The Lord knows his own, but he does not know the wicked and the impious.…We say these things, however, not thinking anything blasphemous about God or ascribing ignorance to him, but thus we understand that these whose activity is considered unworthy of God are also considered to be unworthy of God’s knowing them. For God does not deign to know one who has turned away from him and does not know that one.
