Let us try to do what Wisdom admonishes us, saying, “Drink the waters from your own springs and pools, and let your spring be your own.” Make sure, O hearer, that you have your own well and spring, so that you, when you take in hand the book of the Scriptures, may also begin to express from your own learning some understanding of the text, and, in agreement with what you have learned in church, you too may also attempt to drink from the source of your own spirit. Within you is the source of living water, perennial veins and abundant currents flowing with rational understanding if they have not been obstructed by earth and detritus. But get busy so that you can dig out your earth and purify it from the filth, that is, in order to remove laziness from your soul and throw out the inactivity of your heart. For listen to what the Scripture says: “Sting the eye, and it will bring forth a tear; sting the heart, and it will bring forth understanding.” Therefore you too should purify your spirit so that you may drink from your own living springs and may draw living water from your wells. For, in fact, if you have received in yourself the Word of God, if you have received living water from Jesus and have received it with faith, it will become in you a “fountain of water that springs up to eternal life.”

Since the blessed apostle orders us to be imitators of this grace, that is, the gift of prophecy, although it is imperfect and in our power, saying, “Be zealous for the greater gifts, above all the gift of prophecy,” let us also try to have a zeal for those good gifts and, so far as we are able, to ask for them and then await the fullness of the gift from the Lord. For this, in fact, is what the Lord says by means of the prophet: “Open your mouth, and I will fill it up.” This is also why another Scripture says, “Sting the eye, and it will bring forth a tear; sting the heart, and it will bring forth understanding.”
