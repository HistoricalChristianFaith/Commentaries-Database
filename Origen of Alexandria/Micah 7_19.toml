We should give a tunic to one who has none at all. Who is the person who does not have a tunic? It is one who utterly lacks God. Therefore we should divest ourselves and give to one who is naked. One has God; another does not have God at all. We give to the one who does not have God. The prophet in Scripture says, “We should cast our sins into the depths of the sea.” John continues, “He who has food should do likewise.” Whoever has food should give some to one who has none. He should generously give him not only clothing but also what he can eat.
