With good reason, therefore, when Luke spoke of the woman who was a sinner, he introduced her as weeping copiously. She thus washed the feet of Jesus with her tears … only “anointing,” and not his head but his feet. This woman, however, who was not described as a sinner, did not anoint but “poured” ointment, and not on his feet but “on his head.” As to what is written about Mary, the sister of Lazarus, she too “anointed” the Lord’s “feet.” Note what the Gospel says: The whole “house was filled with the odor of the ointmen.”Perhaps the differences in these women therefore may signify the differences in the faithful. Some of them pour out precious ointment “over the head” of Jesus, others do not anoint the head but only the feet, and others do not pour out abundantly but anoint only so much. Some of them anoint with ointment, leaving the whole house filled with the odor of his divinity. Then there are others, also acceptable to Christ, for they anoint his feet with ointment, which the Pharisees did not even anoint with “oil.”
