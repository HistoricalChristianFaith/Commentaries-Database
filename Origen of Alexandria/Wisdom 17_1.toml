In the Apocalypse we see “a Lamb, as though sacrificed.” This is the Lamb that, for certain ineffable reasons, became the sacrifice of expiation for the entire world, having accepted even to be sacrificed, according to the measure of the Father’s love for humanity. By his blood he bought us back2 from him who had bought us, in that we were corrupted by sins. Leading this lamb to the sacrifice was the God who was in the man, the great high priest, as he himself attests, saying, “No one takes my life from me, but I myself give it. I have the power to give it and the power to take it up again.” All of the other sacrifices are related to this sacrifice by affinity, the sacrifices prescribed by the Law being a symbol of it. And in my opinion, the shedding of blood on the part of the noble martyrs are sacrifices similar to this one; not without reason does John the disciple contemplate them as surrounding the heavenly altar. “Who is wise enough to understand these things, intelligent enough to know them?” To grasp somewhat more contemplatively the reason for these sacrifices, which purify those for whom they are offered, we must understand the significance of the sacrifice of the daughter of Jephthah. Jephthah had defeated the Ammonites because of a vow, to which she who was to be sacrificed adhered, responding to her father’s words, “I have given my word to the Lord against you,” by saying, “Even if it is against me that you have given your word to the Lord, fulfill your vow.” In considering such events one could be led to attribute an element of great cruelty to God, to whom such sacrifices are offered for the salvation of human beings. One needs a more open and farsighted mind to reconcile this in light of the designs of providence, so as to be able to justify these things as both ineffable and beyond human nature, saying, “The judgments of God are great and difficult to tell. For this reason, ignorant souls fell into error.” Moreover, it is also attested among the pagans that in times of pestilence, many were given over to sacrifice for the common salvation. The faithful Roman Clement also admits that this occurred, basing himself on history;8 Paul testifies of him saying, “Together with Clement and my other coworkers, whose names are in the book of life.” Someone wanting to insult mysteries that escape the comprehension of the many finds the precepts regarding martyrs10 similarly absurd. God, however, considers that it would be better for us to confess his divinity at the price of the most atrocious sufferings than to free ourselves for a brief time from apparent evils, declaring our acquiescence to the will of the enemies of truth.
