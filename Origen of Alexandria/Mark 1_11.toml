This is spoken to him by God, with whom all time is today. For there is no evening with God, as I see it, and there is no morningâ€”nothing but time that stretches out, along with his unbeginning and unseen life. The day is today with him in which the Son was begotten. Thus the beginning of his birth is not to be found, as neither is the day of it.
