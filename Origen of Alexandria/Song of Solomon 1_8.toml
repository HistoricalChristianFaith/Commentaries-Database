Therefore, this is what the present passage teaches the soul under the guise of a woman, so that she may know herself.…And for this reason, where she has neglected knowledge, it is is now necessary that she “be borne about by every wind of doctrine to be deceived by errors,” so that now she pitches her tent now by that shepherd, that is, a teacher of the word, and now by another shepherd. And in this way she is borne about as she shepherds not sheep, which is a simple animal, but goats, namely lascivious and restless feelings that lead to sin, while she has sought out various teachers and cultivated them for this very purpose. And this will be the punishment of the guilt of that soul, which was not eager to know itself and to follow that shepherd alone, who “lay down his life for his sheep.”
