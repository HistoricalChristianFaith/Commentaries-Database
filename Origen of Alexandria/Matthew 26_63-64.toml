We find in the law several cases of swearing. And now, on this occasion, the priest commands Jesus to swear “by the living God.” In this regard, I believe it is improper for one who wants to live by the gospel to command someone to swear.Likewise, the Lord himself says in the Gospel: “But I say to you, ‘Do not swear at all’ ” and do not command someone else to swear at all. So, according to Christ’s Gospel command, if it is not permissible to swear, neither is it permissible to command someone else to swear. Therefore it is clear that the high priest unlawfully ordered Jesus to swear, even though he may have ordered him to swear “by the living God.”

It was not fitting for our Lord to respond to the high priest’s command to swear... For this reason, he neither denied that he was Christ, the Son of God, nor did he openly declare it. Instead, as though accepting to be a swearing witness ... he replied, “You have said so.”
And since “everyone who commits sin is of the devil,” the high priest also committed a sin in plotting against Jesus. Therefore he was of the devil, and, being of the devil as it were, he imitated his very father, who doubtingly asked the Savior twice, “If you are the Son of God,” as is written concerning his temptations. Similar in fact are the words “If you are the Son of God” and “if you are the Christ, the Son of God.” Someone may rightly say in this regard that to doubt whether Christ is the Son of God is the work of the devil and of the high priest who plotted against our Lord.

It seems to me that the Son of man seated “at the right hand of Power” signifies enthronement and empowerment. He was seated therefore next to Power—the only power properly so called—and at the right hand. He received all power from the Father “in heaven and on earth.” His adversaries too will see his enthronement, sometime after the blessed have seen him with joy.Now the passage according to Mark does not say “hereafter.” It reads simply, “You will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power.” This does not imply anything contrary to what we have said. However, in light of Matthew’s words, “hereafter you will see” and Luke’s words, “so will the Son of man be in his day,” one may ask whether since the time the Savior had said these things, they were fulfilled to those who heard his words.… Our reply is that they appear to have been fulfilled, since from that time, that is, from the time of the dispensation, the Son of man has been seated “at the right hand of Power,” and his disciples witnessed his resurrection from the dead. For this reason, as we noted before, they saw him seated “at the right hand of Power.”

The prophets of God and the apostles of Christ are those living clouds which Jesus orders to rain down or not to rain down, as he sees fit, upon the fruitless vineyard. Now if anyone does not wish to become these clouds upon which and with which the Son of man will appear, Christ will know this. For God the Word and wisdom and truth and justice will always come upon these clouds and be with them, manifesting his coming to those worthy of himself. Furthermore, we speak of these clouds as though they bear a “sign from heaven,” heavenly clouds that do not pass away. They have been made worthy of the throne of God and the kingdom of God as “heirs of God and coheirs of Christ.” And they will reign with him.
