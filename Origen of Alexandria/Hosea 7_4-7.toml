But where shall I find an approach to the divine Scripture that teaches me what “an oven” is? I must call upon Jesus my Lord, that he may make me the seeker find and may open to the one knocking, that I may find in Scriptures “the oven” where I can rightly bake my sacrifice that God may accept it. Indeed, I think I have found it in Hosea the prophet, where he says, “All adulterers are as an oven ignited for burning.” And again he says, “Their hearts glowed as an oven.” The human heart therefore is “an oven.” But this heart, if vices ignite it or the devil inflames it, will not bake, but it will burn up. But if that one who said, “I came to send fire into the earth” should ignite it, the loaves of the divine Scriptures and of the words of God which I receive in my heart, I do not burn up for destruction, but I bake for sacrifice.
