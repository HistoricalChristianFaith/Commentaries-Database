Our flesh indeed is considered by the uneducated and by unbelievers to perish so completely after death that nothing whatever of its substance is left. We, however, who believe in its resurrection, know that death only causes a change in it and that its substance certainly persists and is restored to life again at a definite time by the will of its Creator and once more undergoes a transformation. What was at first flesh, “from the earth, a man of dust,” and was then dissolved through death and again made dust and ashes—for “dust you are,” it is written, “and unto dust shall you return”—is raised again from the earth. Afterwards, as the merits of the indwelling soul shall demand, the person advances to the glory of a spiritual body.

Scripture says, “A consecrated linen tunic will be put on.” Think of flax thread that comes from the earth. Imagine that the flax thread becomes a sanctified linen tunic that Christ, the true high priest, puts on when he takes up the nature of an earthly body. Remember that it is said about the body that “it is earth and it will go into the earth.” Therefore, my Lord and Savior, wanting to resurrect that which had gone into the earth, took an earthly body that he might carry it raised up from earth to heaven. And the assertion in the law that the high priest is clothed “with a linen tunic” contains this mystery. But that it added “consecrated” must not be heard as superfluous. For the “tunic” that was the flesh of Christ was “consecrated,” for it was not conceived from the seed of man but begotten of the Holy Spirit.
