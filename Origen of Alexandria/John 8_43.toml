First then, we must acquire the ability to hear the divine word so that subsequently we may also be able to know the whole teaching of Jesus. For it is possible that, though one previously could not hear Jesus’ word, he attains the ability to hear it, because one cannot hear until his hearing is healed by the Word who says to the deaf, “Be opened.”
