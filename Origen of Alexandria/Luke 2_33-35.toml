Both by the angel and the multitude of the heavenly host, by the shepherds also, and Simeon.

But they who look deeper into the matter may say, that since the genealogy is deduced from David to Joseph, therefore lest Joseph should seem to be mentioned for no purpose, as not being the father of the Saviour, he was called His father, that the genealogy might maintain its place.

They who explain this simply, may say that He came for the fall of unbelievers, and the rising again of believers.

The careful interpreter will say, that no one falls who was not before standing. Tell me then, who were they who stood, for whose fall Christ came?

There is also a deeper meaning aimed against those who raise their voices against their Creator, saying, Behold the God of the Law and the Prophets of what sort He is! He says, I kill, and I make alive. (Deut. 32:39.) If God then is a bloody judge and a cruel master, it is most plain that Jesus is His Son, since the same things here are written of Him, namely, that he comes for the fall and rising again of many.

But we must take care lest by chance the Saviour should not come to some equally for the fall and rising again; for when I stood in sin, it was first good for me to fall, and die to sin. Lastly, Prophets and Saints when they were designing some great thing, used to fall on their faces, that by their fall their sins should be the more fully blotted out. This it is that the Saviour first grants to thee. Thou wert a sinner, let that which is sin fall in thee, that thou mayest thence rise again, and say, If we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him. (2 Tim. 2:11.)

But all the things which history relates of Christ are spoken against, not that those who believe on Him speak against Him, (for we know that all the things which are written of Him are true,) but that every thing which has been written of Him is with the unbelievers a sign which is spoken against.

But the evil thoughts of men were revealed, that He Who died for us might slay them; for while they were hidden, it was impossible to utterly destroy them. Hence also when we have sinned we ought to say, Mine iniquity have I not hid. (Ps. 32:5.) For if we make known our sins not only to God, but to whoever can heal our wounds, our sins will be blotted out.

Everything that the plain narrative recounts about the Savior is spoken against. The Virgin is a mother. This is “a sign that is spoken against.” “The Marcionites speak against this sign and insist that he was not born of a woman.” The Ebionites speak against this sign and say that he was born of a man and a woman in the same way as we are born. He had a human body.There is still another “sign that is spoken against.” Some say that he came down from heaven. Others say that he had a body like ours, so that he could also redeem our bodies from sin by the likeness of his body to ours and give us hope of the resurrection. He rose from the dead. This is also “a sign that is spoken against.” How did he rise? Was he just as he was when he died, or did he surely rise into a body of a better substance?…
I myself think that even the fact that the mouths of the prophets foretold him is a sign that is spoken against.… It does not mean that those who believe in him speak against these signs. We know indeed that everything that Scripture records is true. But, for unbelievers, all things that are written about him are “a sign that is spoken against.”
