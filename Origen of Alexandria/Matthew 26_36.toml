Jesus brought his disciples from the upper room to a garden which was called Gethsemane because, after he was betrayed, he did not want to be arrested in the same place where he and his disciples had eaten the Passover. Even before he was betrayed, however, he thought it fitting to choose to pray in places devoted purely to prayer, for he knew that some locations are holier than others, as it is written: “The place where you are standing is holy ground.”
