They exemplify the very words of the servant who answers and says, “I knew you to be a hard man” and one who was able to reap “where you did not sow and gather where you did not winnow.”The master answered him and reproached him as a wicked and lazy servant. Note that he did not call himself a hard man. But he agreed with the servant when he went on to say, “You knew that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not winnow.”
How are we to understand the phrase that our Lord truly reaps where he did not sow and gathers where he did not winnow? In this way, it seems to me: The righteous man “sows in the Spirit,” from which he will also “reap eternal life.” Everything that is sown and reaped for eternal life by the righteous man, God reaps. The righteous man belongs to God, who reaps where not he but the righteous man has sown. So we may say that the righteous man has “scattered and given to the poor.” The Lord, however, gathers to himself whatever the righteous man has “scattered and given to the poor.” Reaping what he has not sown and gathering where he has not winnowed, he counts as having been done to himself whatever the faithful have sown or winnowed for the poor. He says to those who have done good to their neighbors: “Come you, blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom which was prepared for you. I was hungry and you gave me to eat …”30
And since he wishes to reap where he did not sow and to gather where he did not winnow, when he does not find anything, he says to those who failed to reap and gather: “Depart from me, you wicked, into everlasting fire, which my Father has prepared for the devil and his angels. For I was hungry and you did not give me to eat.”

Then there was another servant who showed less ability. Because of it, the master of the household gave him “one talent” as though to the servant less capable. “Receiving” it, the servant went away and “hid the talent in the earth.” Instead he should have entrusted the money to the bankers.
