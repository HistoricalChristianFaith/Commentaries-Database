Nor was there night in Peter when he confessed, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” when the heavenly Father revealed it to him, but there was night in him too at the moment of his denial. And in the present instance, moreover, when Judas received the morsel [and] went out immediately, night was present in him at the same time he went out, for the man whose name is “Sunrise” was not present with him because he left “the Sun of justice” behind when he went out. And Judas, who was filled with darkness, pursued Jesus; but the darkness and the one who had taken it up did not apprehend the light that was pursued. Wherefore also, when he said as word of justification, “I have sinned because I betrayed just blood” and “went and hanged himself,” Satan, who was in him, led him to the noose and hung him, at which time the devil also touched his soul. For Judas was not such that the Lord could say to the devil on his behalf what he said on Job’s behalf, “But touch not his soul.”
