We must consider the food promised in the law as the food of the soul, which is to satisfy not both parts of a person’s nature but the soul only. And the words of the gospel, although probably containing a deeper meaning, may yet be taken in their more simple and obvious sense, as teaching us not to be disturbed with anxieties about our food and clothing, but, while living in plainness, and desiring only what is needful, to put our trust in the providence of God.

If you take [this verse] according to the literal sense that “when the just person eats he will fill his soul but the souls of the impious will be in poverty,” it will appear false. For the souls of the impious take food with eagerness and strive after “satiety,” but the just meanwhile are hungry. Finally, Paul was just, and he said, “Up to this hour we are hungry, and thirsty, and naked, and we are beaten with fists.” And again he says, “In hunger and thirst, in many fastings.” And how does Solomon say, “when the just eats he will satisfy his soul”? But if you consider how “the just person” always and “without interruption” eats from “the living bread” and fills his soul and satisfies it with heavenly food which is the Word of God and his wisdom, you will find how the just person “eats his bread in abundance” from the blessing of God.
