When the prophetic word was sent only to the Jews, the names of Jewish kings were put in the headings of the prophecies. For example, “the vision that Isaiah, the son of Amoz, saw, against Judea and against Jerusalem, during the reign of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah.” In the time of Isaiah, I see no one else named except the kings of Judah. In some prophets we also read the names of the kings of Israel, as in this instance: “And in the days of Jeroboam, the son of Joash, king of Israel.” But then the mystery of the gospel was to be preached, and the gospel spread throughout the whole world. The initiator of that gospel was John, in the desert. The authority of Tiberius ruled the world. Then, “in [his] fifteenth year,” it is recorded that “the word of the Lord came to John.”
