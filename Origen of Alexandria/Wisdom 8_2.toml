I think therefore that Sarah, which means “principal,” or what has primacy, is a figure of the aretē which is the virtue of the soul. This virtue is joined and clings to a wise and faithful husband, like that wise one who said of wisdom, “I sought to take her as my bride.” For this reason God says to Abraham, “In everything that Sarah says to you, listen to her voice.”

In many places the sacred Scripture has avoided the term “desire,” replacing it with “love.” At times, however, even if somewhat rarely, it uses precisely the term “desire” and invites and urges the soul to this, as in Proverbs when it says of wisdom, “Desire her, and she will serve you. Hold her close, and she will make you great. Honor her, that she would embrace you.” And in the book entitled the Wisdom of Solomon, it is further written of wisdom, “I desired her beauty.” Nevertheless, I think that the Scripture used the term “desire” only where there was no possibility of equivocation. Indeed, whatever is passionate or shameful can be found in the desire for wisdom or in the one who claims to desire wisdom. In fact, if the Scriptures had said that Isaac desired Rebecca or that Jacob desired Rachel, one could have thought of passion or of something shameful in the holy men of God because of these words, especially among those who do not know how to raise themselves from the letter to the spirit. And precisely in this book that we have before us, it is clear that the word desire has been replaced by “love,” where it is said, “I implore you, daughters of Jerusalem: if you find my beloved, tell him that I am wounded by love.” It is as if she were to say, I have been pierced by an arrow of love. Therefore there is no difference if the sacred Scriptures speak of love or of desire, except that the term “love” is held in such high esteem that even God is personally called love, as John says, “Beloved, let us love one another, because love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows him. The one who does not love, however, does not know God, because God is love.”
