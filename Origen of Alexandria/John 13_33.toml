The statement “Yet a little while I am with you” is clear in the simple sense, so far as the literal sense is concerned, since he would soon no longer be with the disciples. First, he was arrested by the cohort and the tribune and the servants of the Jews who bound him and led him off to Annas first, and after this he was delivered to Pilate. Next, he was condemned to the cross, and then he spent three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

For in that “little while” in which they would not see him, they would seek Jesus, and for this reason they would weep and lament, although their grief would change to joy when the saying was fulfilled, “And again a little while and you will see me.” But to seek Jesus is to seek the Word, and wisdom, and justice, and truth and the power of God, all of which Christ is.
