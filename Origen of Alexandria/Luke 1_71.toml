Let us not suppose that this refers to our bodily enemies, but our ghostly. For the Lord Jesus came mighty in battle (Ps. 24:8) to destroy all our enemies, that He might deliver us from their snares and temptation.

"Deliverance from our enemies." We should not think that this means corporeal enemies, but rather spiritual ones. For the Lord Jesus came, "mighty in battle," to destroy all our enemies and free us from their snares, namely, from the hand of all our enemies "and from the hand of all who hate us."
