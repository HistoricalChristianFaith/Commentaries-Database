And Othniel the son of Kenaz seized it.” Moreover, Othniel, who received the City of Letters, is interpreted “the reply of God.” But “the reply of God” can be said “he to whom God replies,” that is, he to whom God reveals secrets and discloses hidden things. That one, therefore, is the younger brother of Caleb, the one who is able to take the City of Letters of the old covenant, and to demolish the “killing letter.”
