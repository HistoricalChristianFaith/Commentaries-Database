Give your attention, you who have approached God—who believe yourselves to be faithful. Consider diligently how the faith of the faithful is proved from these words that have been read to us. “And it came to pass,” the text says, “after these words, God tested Abraham and said to him: ‘Abraham, Abraham.’ And he said, ‘Here I am.’ ” Observe each detail that has been written. For, if one knows how to dig into the depth, he will find a treasure in the details, and perhaps also the precious jewels of the mysteries lie hidden where they are not esteemed. This man was previously called Abram. Nowhere do we read that God called him by this name or said to him, “Abram, Abram.” For God could not call him by a name that was to be abolished, but he calls him by this name which he himself gave. And not only does he call him by this name, but also he repeats it.
