We said above, I think, that Isaac represented Christ. But this ram no less also seems to represent Christ. Now it is worthwhile to know how both are appropriate to Christ, both Isaac, who is not slain, and the ram, which is slain.Christ is “the Word of God,” but “the Word was made flesh.” One aspect of Christ therefore is from above; the other is received from human nature and the womb of the Virgin. Christ suffered, therefore, but in the flesh; and he endured death, but it was the flesh, of which this ram is a type, as also John said: “Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sin of the world.” But the Word continued “in incorruption,” which is Christ according to the spirit, of which Isaac is the image. For this reason he is victim and priest. For truly according to the spirit he offers the victim to the Father, but according to the flesh he himself is offered on the altar of the cross. As it is said of him, “Behold the Lamb of God, behold him who takes away the sin of the world,” so it is said of him, “You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.”
