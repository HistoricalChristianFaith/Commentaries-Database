Who hears the words of the covenant that God commanded to the ancestors? Is it those who believe in him, or is it those who have proven that they do not believe Moses from their having not believed in the Lord? For the Savior said to them, “If you believe in Moses, you would have believed in me. For he wrote about me. But if you do not believe in what he wrote, how can you believe in my words?” And so they have not believed in Moses, but we who believe in Christ believe in the covenant through Moses, and it is said to us, lest we become accursed, “Cursed is the one who does not hear the words of the covenant, which I commanded to the ancestors.”
