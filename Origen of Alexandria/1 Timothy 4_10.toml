Our reply to this is that he attributes to us statements which we do not make. For we both read and know that God “loves everything that exists and hates nothing that he has made; for he would never have made anything if he had hated it.” … He is also called “Savior of all men, especially of those who believe,” and his Christ is “a propitiation for our sins, but not for ours only, but also for the whole world.” … But now, according to our preaching, Jesus who is called the Christ of God by a certain traditional usage in the Bible has come on behalf of sinners in all places, that they may forsake their sin and entrust themselves to God.
