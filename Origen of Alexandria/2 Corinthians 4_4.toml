For the Son of God is Word and Righteousness. But every sinner is under the tyranny of the prince of this age, since every sinner is made a friend of the present evil age. For he does not hand himself over to the One who gave “himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age” and to deliver us “according to the will of our God and Father,” according to the verse in the letter to the Galatians. And the one who by voluntary sin is under the tyranny of the prince of this age is also ruled by sin. That is why we are commanded by Paul no longer to be subjected to sin that wishes to rule over us. We are so ordered through the following words, “Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal bodies, to make you obey their passions.”.

But if anyone dares to attribute corruption of substance to what was made according to the image and likeness of God, in my opinion he extends the charge of impiety also to the Son of God himself, since he is also called in Scripture “the image of God.” At least the one who holds the opinion will certainly find fault with the authority of Scripture, which says that humanity was made after the image of God. And the traces of the divine image are clearly recognized not through the likeness of the body, which undergoes corruption, but through the intelligence of the soul, its righteousness, temperance, courage, wisdom, discipline, and through the entire chorus of virtues that are present in God by substance and can be in humankind through effort and the imitation of God. The Lord points this out in the Gospel when He says, “Be merciful, even as your Father is merciful” and “Be perfect, as your Father is perfect.” Consequently, it is quite clear that in God all these virtues can never enter or leave, but they are acquired by us little by little and one by one.
