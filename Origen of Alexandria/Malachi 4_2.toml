But do not take the statement that “he sprinkles to the east” as superfluous. From the east came atonement for you; for from there is the man whose name is “East,” who became “a mediator between God and humanity.” Therefore you are invited by this to always look “to the east” where “the Sun of Righteousness” arises for you, where a light is born for you; that you may never “walk in darkness” and that that last day does not seize you in darkness. [Therefore may] the night and fog of ignorance not come upon you unawares, but [may] you always be found in the light of knowledge, always have the day of faith and always preserve the light of love and peace.
