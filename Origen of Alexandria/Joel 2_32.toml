Martyrdom is customarily called “the cup of salvation,” as we find in the Gospel. For when those who wish to sit on Jesus’ right and left in his kingdom yearn for so great an honor, the Lord says to them, “Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink?” By “cup” he means martyrdom; and the point is clear because of the verse, “Father, if it be possible, remove this cup from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” We learn, moreover, that the person who drinks that cup which Jesus drank will sit with him and rule and judge with the King of kings. Thus this is the “cup of salvation,” and when someone takes it, he will “call upon the name of the Lord.” For whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.
