Who is the word that came from the Lord to Jeremiah or to Isaiah or to Ezekiel or anyone except the one “in the beginning with God”? I do not know any word of the Lord other than the one about which the Evangelist spoke.… And I could say that Christ was with Moses, with Jeremiah, with Isaiah, with each of the righteous.… How can they have spoken the word of God if the Word of God did not dwell in them? But these things must be understood especially with respect to us of the church, who want the God of the law and the gospel to be the same, Christ to be the same both then and now and for all of the ages. For there will be those who will cut in two, in their opinion, the divinity previous to the dwelling of the Savior and the divinity proclaimed by Jesus Christ, but we know one God both then and now, one Christ both then and now.
