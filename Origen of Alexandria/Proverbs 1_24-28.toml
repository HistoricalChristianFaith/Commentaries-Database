If there is someone who meditates in the law of the Lord day and night, and if there is someone who is like the mouth of the just because he meditates on wisdom, he will be able to investigate diligently and find these things. If nonetheless he has rightly sought and by his seeking knocked on the door of wisdom, asking from God to open it for him, he also deserves to receive the Word of wisdom and the Word of knowledge through the Holy Spirit and to become a participant of that wisdom which said, “For I stretched out my words and you did not hear.” And rightly he said that he “stretched out words” in his heart, to whom God had given, as we said above, “the breadth of the heart.” For the heart is made broad of that man who can explain those things that have been said briefly in figurative language, taking assertions from the divine books with a broader teaching.

How then is the heaven stretched forth? Wisdom stretches it forth. For it is clear that wisdom stretches it forth in the text: “Since I stretched forth words and you did not pay attention.” He speaks of words being stretched forth; in this way the heaven is stretched forth.
