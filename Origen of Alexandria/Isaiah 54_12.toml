It seems to me also that that fancy of Plato, that those stones that we call precious stones which derive their luster from a reflection, as it were, of the stones in that better land, is taken from the words of Isaiah in describing the city of God: “I will make your battlements of jasper, your stones shall be crystal and your borders of precious stones.”
