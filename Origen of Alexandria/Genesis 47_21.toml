According to the trustworthiness of Scripture, no Egyptian was free. For “Pharaoh reduced the people to slavery to himself,” nor did he leave anyone free within the borders of the Egyptians, but freedom was taken away in all the land of Egypt. And perhaps for this reason it is written, “I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.” Egypt, therefore, became the house of bondage and, what is more unfortunate, of voluntary bondage.For although it is related of the Hebrews that they were reduced to bondage and that, freedom having been snatched away, they bore the yoke of tyranny, nevertheless they are said to have been brought to this state “violently.” For it is written, “The Egyptians abhorred the children of Israel, and with might the Egyptians violently oppressed the sons of Israel and afflicted their life with hard works in mud and brick, and with all the works which were in the plains, in all of which they reduced them to bondage by force.” Notice carefully, therefore, how the Hebrews are recorded to have been reduced to bondage “violently.” There was a natural freedom in them which was not wrenched away from them easily or by some deception but by force.

If, therefore, we understand these words spiritually concerning the bondage of the Egyptians, we recognize that to serve the Egyptians is nothing other than to become submissive to carnal vices and to be subjected to demons. At any rate, no necessity coming from without forces anyone into this state. Rather, the sluggishness of the soul and the lust and pleasure of the body overcome each one. The soul, by its own carelessness, subjects itself to this. But one who bears a concern for the freedom of the soul and improves the dignity of his mind with thoughts pertaining to heaven belongs to the children of Israel. Although he may be “violently” oppressed for a time, nevertheless he does not lose his freedom forever. For our Savior also, discussing freedom and bondage in the Gospel, speaks thus: “Everyone,” he says, “who sins, is a servant of sin.” And again he says, “If you continue in my word, you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.”
