But lest we linger too long on the forms of individual virtues, we can briefly say that they indicate those things by which the church is adorned. Its faith can be compared with gold; the word of preaching with silver; bronze with patience; incorruptible wood with the knowledge that comes through the wood or to the incorruptibility of purity that never grows old; virginity with linen; the glory of suffering with scarlet; the splendor of love with purple; the hope of the kingdom of heaven with the blue. Let those, however, be the materials from which the whole tabernacle is constructed, the priests are clothed and the high priest is adorned. The prophet speaks in another passage about the nature and quality of their clothing: “Let your priests be clothed with justice.” All those garments, therefore, are garments of justice. And again the apostle Paul says, “Put on heartfelt mercy.” They are also, therefore, garments of mercy. But the same apostle no less also designates other more noble garments when he says, “Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and give no attention to the flesh for lusting.” Those, therefore, are the garments with which the church is adorned.
