God is ignorant of evil deeds, not because he is unable to understand everything or to grasp it with his own intelligence (for it is wrong to think this way about God) but because those deeds are unworthy of his contemplation.… God is ignorant of the way of the wicked, and he knows the way of the righteous. Further, who is the way of the righteous except the one who said, “I am the way” whom the Father knows? “No one has known the Son except the Father.” The distinction between the knowledge and ignorance of God is referred to in the prophets as “the memory and forgetfulness” of God. Often it is said in prayer: “Be mindful of me” and “Why have you forgotten our poverty?” Just as God removes sinners from his own memory, so does he again receive the repentant and become mindful of them.
