The sixth song is in 1 Chronicles, where David first established Asaph and his brothers for praising the Lord. The beginning of the song is as follows, “Praise the Lord, give thanks to him, and call on his name; make known his purposes among the peoples. Sing to him, sing praises to him, tell of all his wonderful works, which the Lord has done,” and so forth. It should, however, be known that the song in 2 Samuel is very much like Psalm 18. Furthermore, the first part of the text in 1 Chronicles, up to the place where it says “and do my prophets no harm,” is like Psalm 105, and the latter part of it, following the verse just mentioned, bears a likeness to the first part of Psalm 96, where it says, “Sing to the Lord, all the earth,” up to the place where it says “for he comes to judge the earth.”

In the first book of Chronicles the psalm praising the Lord attributed to Asaph and his brothers, which begins “O give thanks to the Lord, call on his name,” is, for the most part, the same as Psalm 104, down to the words “Do my prophets no harm!” After that it is almost identical to Psalm 95 from the beginning, “Sing to the Lord, all the earth!”
