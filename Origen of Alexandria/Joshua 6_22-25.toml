But the woman Rahab, how is she said to be joined to the house of Israel up to this very day? Is a succession of posterity on her mother’s side ascribed so that she is considered to be preserved in a renewal of offspring? Or rather must it be understood that she has really been bound and united to Israel up to this very day? If you want to see more plainly how Rahab is bound to Israel, consider how “the branch of the wild olive tree is implanted in the root of a good olive tree.” Then you will understand how those who have been implanted in the faith of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob are rightly called attached and “joined to Israel up to this very day.” For we have been attached up to this very day in the root of those former ones, we, the branches of the wild olive taken up from the nations, who at one time were dealing with harlots and worshiping wood and stone instead of the true God.

Therefore, our Lord Jesus will come, and he will come with the sound of trumpets. But just now let us pray that he may come and destroy “the world that lay in wickedness” and all things that are in the world, because “everything that is in the world is the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes.” May he destroy that, may he dissolve it again and again, and save only this one who received his spies and who placed his apostles, received with faith and obedience, in the high places. And may he join and unite this prostitute with the house of Israel.But now let us neither recall nor impute to her the old fault. Once she was a prostitute, but now “a pure virgin, to one man” she has been united, “to Christ.” Hear the apostle speaking of her: “But I have determined this itself, to present you to Christ, a pure virgin to one husband.” It was also surely of her that someone said, “For once we ourselves were also foolish, unbelieving, wandering, serving desires and various forms of pleasures.” Do you still wish to learn more about how the prostitute is no longer a prostitute? Hear Paul saying in addition, “And this surely you have been; but you have been washed, you have been sanctified in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, and in the Spirit of our God.”
