A slanderer conspired against you. Sometimes he said to me, “Stretch out your hand now.” He said to me, “Touch all that he has,” and he added about you that “you would have cursed me to my face.” But, on the contrary, you were victorious. Therefore I say to you, “Clothe yourself with glory. Abase the slanderer completely. Humiliate his angels. He was arrogant against you, but you destroy the arrogant. He was impious against you, but you strike him by lightning.”
