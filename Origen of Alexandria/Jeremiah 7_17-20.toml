You will find at least in the book of Jeremiah the words of God censuring by the mouth of the prophet the Jewish people for doing obeisance to such objects and for sacrificing to the queen of heaven and to all the host of heaven. The writings of the Christians, moreover, show, in censuring the sins committed among the Jews, that when God abandoned that people on account of certain sins, these sins of idol worship also were committed by them.

“God is jealous” and does not wish the soul that he betrothed to himself in faith to remain defiled by sin, but he wishes it to be purified immediately, wishes it to cast out all its impurities immediately, if it has been, by chance, snatched away by some of them. But if the soul continues in sins and says, “We will not hear the voice of the Lord, but we will do what we wish and will burn incense to the ‘queen of heaven,’ ” a practice condemned by the prophet, it will then be held over for that judgment of Wisdom: “Since I indeed called you and you did not listen but jeered at my words, therefore I will laugh at your ruin, too,” or is that judgment that has been placed on those in the Gospel when the Lord says, “Depart from me into the eternal fire that God has prepared for the devil and his angels.”
