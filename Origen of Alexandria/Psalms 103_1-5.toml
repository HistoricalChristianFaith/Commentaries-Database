In like manner, “these fatty parts of the ram that are around the kidneys and these that cover the interior parts” are commanded to be placed on the altar. So you who hear these things should know you ought to offer on the fire of the altar everything that is more sinful within you and hides your “inner being” so that all your “inner being” may be cleansed and you also may say, as David said, “Bless the Lord, my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.” For unless that sinfulness that touches your “inner being” should be removed, your inner being cannot lay hold of the subtle and spiritual sense and cannot receive the understanding of wisdom; therefore, it cannot praise the Lord.
