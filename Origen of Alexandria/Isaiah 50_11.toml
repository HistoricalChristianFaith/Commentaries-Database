If then this is the character of the body that rises from the dead, let us now see what is the meaning of the threatened “eternal fire.” Now we find in the prophet Isaiah that the fire by which each person is punished is described as belonging to himself. For it says, “Walk in the light of your fire and in the flame which you have kindled for yourselves.” These words seem to indicate that every sinner kindles for himself the flame of his own fire and is not plunged into a fire that has been previously kindled by someone else or that existed before him.

This “fire” is not “from the altar.” The fire that is “from the altar” is the fire of the Lord. But that which is outside the altar is not of the Lord but is properly of each one who sins.… This fire is of those who have ignited it, just as it also was written in other places, “Walk in your fire and in the flame which you kindled for yourselves.” But to Isaiah his own fire was not applied but the fire of the altar that “will cleanse his lips.”
