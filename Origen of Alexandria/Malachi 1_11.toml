And it is astonishing that Moses is called Moses even among us and each of the prophets is addressed by his own name. For Christ did not change the names in them but the understanding. And he changes it there that now later we might not pay attention “to Jewish fables” and “endless genealogies,” because “they turn their hearing away from the truth indeed but are turned to fables.” He opened, therefore, the wells and taught us, that we might not seek God in some one place but might know that “sacrifice is offered to his name in every land.” For it is now that time “when the true worshipers worship the Father neither in Jerusalem nor on Mount Gerizim “but in spirit and truth.” God, therefore, dwells in the heart. And if you are seeking the place of God, a pure heart is his place, for he says through the prophet, “ ‘I will dwell in them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God,’ says the Lord.”
