If there is anyone who, when he reads Moses, murmurs against him, and the law which has been written according to the letter is displeasing to him because it seems incoherent in many things, Moses shows him the rock, which is Christ, and leads him to it that he may drink from it and quench his thirst. But this rock will not give water unless it has been struck; when it has been struck it brings forth streams. For after Christ had been struck and crucified, he brought forth the streams of New Testament. This is why it was said of him, “I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.” He had to be struck, therefore, for unless he had been struck and unless “water and blood had gone out from side,” we all would suffer “thirst for the word of God.” This therefore is what the apostle also understood when he said, “They all ate the same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank of the spiritual rock which followed, but the rock was Christ.” But note that God said to Moses in this place, “Go before the people, and take with you men advanced in years, that is, the elders of the people.” Moses alone does not lead the people to the waters of the rock, but only the elders of the people with him. For the law alone does not announce Christ, but also the prophets and patriarchs and all “those advanced in years.”
