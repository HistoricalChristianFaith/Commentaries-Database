There is therefore no absurdity in the prophets [of the Jews] having uttered predictions even about events of no importance, to soothe those who desire such things, as when Samuel prophesies regarding three donkeys that were lost, or when mention is made in the third book of Kings respecting the sickness of a king’s son. And why should not those who desired to obtain auguries from idols be severely rebuked by the administrators of the law among the Jews, as Elijah is found rebuking Ahaziah and saying, “Is it because there is not a God in Israel that you go to inquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron?”
