The city near the desert, which Jesus entered when he no longer walked boldly among the Jews, is Ephraim.Now Ephraim means “fruitfulness.” He was the brother of Manasseh, the elder of the people “because of forgetfulness.”
For after the people “because of forgetfulness” have been left behind, the fruitfulness of the Gentiles has come about, when God “turned” the rivers in Israel “into a desert and the sources of the waters” there “into dry ground” and “their fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of those who dwell in it.” But he “turned the desert” from the Gentiles “into pools of waters” and “their dry land into sources of waters.”
“And he has placed there the hungry, and they made a city for their habitation,” the church. There he sowed fields, according to the seed that fell on the beautiful and good ground and produced a hundredfold, and he planted vineyards, for the Lord’s disciples are branches, which also “yielded fruit of produce, and he blessed them and they were multiplied exceedingly.”
