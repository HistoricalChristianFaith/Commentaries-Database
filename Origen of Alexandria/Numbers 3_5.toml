Further, the priests are described as being more eminent than the Levites; for this same Scripture tells us that “the Lord spoke to Moses, saying, ‘Bring the tribe of Levi and make them stand in the sight of Aaron the priest, to minister to him.’ ” Do you see how here too he both speaks of the priests as superior to the Levites and once more makes the Levites appear as more eminent than the children of Israel?
