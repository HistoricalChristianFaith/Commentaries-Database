Behold the Savior’s greatness. It extends to all the world.… Go up to the heavens. See how he fills the celestial regions, “He appeared to the angels.” Go down in your mind to the nether world. See that he went down there, too.… Ponder the Lord’s power, how it has filled the world—that is, the heavens, the earth and the nether regions.
