Whoever fights under the leadership of Jesus [Joshua] against opposing authorities ought to merit that which is written about those former warriors: “And the whole people,” it says, “returned safely to Jesus [Joshua] and not one of the sons of Israel muttered with his tongue.” You see, therefore, that the person who serves as a soldier under Jesus must come back safely from battle and ought not even receive a wound “from the fiery darts of the wicked one”; he ought to be neither polluted in heart nor defiled in thought, and [he] ought not allow any place for demonic wounds—not through wrath, lust, or any other occasion.Moreover, what is added, “No one muttered with his tongue,” seems to me to have been expressed because no one boasted about the victory, no one attributed it to his own power that he conquered. Indeed, knowing that it is Jesus who bestowed the victory, they do not mutter with their tongue. Understanding that well, the apostle said, “Not I, but the grace of God that is in me.” I think, in addition, that he has in mind that command of the Lord in which he said, “But when you have done all these things, say, ‘We are unprofitable servants; we have only done what we should have done.’ ” For in this similar manner he also seems to prohibit boasting about things well done.
