The God who “judges little by little” those he punishes “gives space for repentance.” By not punishing all at once for the sin, he delays the consummation of the punishment for the sinner. He thus punishes, “judging little by little.” We have an example of this in Leviticus. In the curses against those who transgress the Law, after the first punishments it is written, “The Lord says, if you do not repent after these things, I will multiply my blows sevenfold.” And again he sets forth another punishment, “And if, despite these punishments, you do not want to correct yourselves and turn to me but oppose yourselves to me, I will also oppose you with fury.” You will note that God metes out punishments stingily, as it were, since he wants to lead the sinner to conversion instead of making him pay for everything all at once. With respect to the text, then, these are the things that befell the people. And threatening them with how much they might have suffered afterward, the Word says, “And yet in those days, I will not wholly destroy you.”
