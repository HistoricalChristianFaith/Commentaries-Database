This he adds since the Pharisees have asked truly “What is the greatest commandment in the law?” The Lord himself responds to them and teaches us. Not only is the greatest commandment to love the Lord, but as well it is the first commandment. It is first, however, not in the order of the Scriptures but in the order of virtue. And as this comes from such a source, it must be adhered to, since as with many established commands, Christ says that it is the first and greatest command that “you love the Lord your God with your whole heart and your whole mind and your whole soul,” and the second, however, “is like unto” the first; and accordingly, this similitude is also great, “that you love your neighbor as you love yourself.” This is how we understand the second one, while another may be third in magnitude and order, or a fourth, and so in order we number the commands of the law, accepting this as wisdom from God, who orders them even to the least. Such is the task of no one else but Christ alone, since he is “the power of God and the wisdom of God.”
