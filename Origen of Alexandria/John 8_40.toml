Those who seek to kill him seek to kill a man, since even if they should kill him, God is not killed. And if they seek to kill him when they have not yet killed him, they plot against him as against a man, not thinking that the one against whom they plot is God. For no one would continue to plot against him if he were convinced that the one against whom he plots is God.

If Abraham has not done what he could not possibly have done, the words “this Abraham did not do” will seem to have been spoken without purpose. For some would say to this that the statement “this Abraham did not do” is made in vain, since he did not do what by no means [could have] occurred during his time, for Jesus did not exist during his time. But since I assume that the statement “this Abraham did not do” has been made in praise of Abraham, as it were, I would say that, in accordance with the word that teaches, “Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day, and he saw it and was glad,” it is possible that there was also a man in Abraham’s time who spoke the truth that he heard from God, and that Abraham, in truth, did not seek to kill this man.
