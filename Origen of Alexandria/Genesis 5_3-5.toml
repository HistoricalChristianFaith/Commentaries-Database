Christ is the invisible image of the invisible God, just as according to the Scripture narrative we say that the image of Adam was his son Seth. It is written thus: “And Adam begot Seth after his own image and after his own kind.” This image preserves the unity of nature and substance common to a father and a son. For “whatever the Father does, the Son does likewise.” In this very fact—that the Son does all things just as the Father does—the Father’s image is reproduced in the Son, whose birth from the Father is as it were an act of his will proceeding from the mind.
