It calls the savior “Othniel,” which means “the time of God for me.” Through this first Othniel, then, the people were delivered from their humiliating servility and were restored to peace rather than having their longstanding pride and various deeds removed. But because we already said that a certain spiritual identity can be found in King Chusarsaton as one of the adversaries and a prince of the “powers of the air,” it seems to me fitting to say that Othniel likewise, who was raised up to deliver the people, is a member of the “host of heaven” and of the throng of archangels who “are sent to support those who receive the inheritance of salvation.” These angels are saviors, moreover, designated under the form of Othniel or Ehud, for, as we have often shown, we do not fight alone against the powers of the enemy, but good forces and powers are also sent to our aid by the Lord.
