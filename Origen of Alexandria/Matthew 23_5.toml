Further, therefore, to the reprehensible Pharisees and scribes who were so concerned about their body and appearance, the Lord said, “They do everything to be seen by other men. For they widen their phylacteries and enlarge the tassels of their clothing.” The disciples of Jesus did everything to be seen by God alone. The only ornaments they had bound to their hands were good works. Meditating on divine teaching, they observed the divine commands, always applying them fittingly before the eyes of their souls. Their only tassel was the virtue of Jesus whom they imitated.
