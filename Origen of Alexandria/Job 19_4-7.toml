“And if I—let us suppose—had done things that should not have been done, even if I had been in such a condition, was it not necessary just the same that you felt ashamed while seeing my afflictions, disease, worms and loss of goods? But you approach me without commiserating with me and without feeling any sympathy for my adversities.” … “I will cry out, and there is nowhere judgment; I still contend.” This is as if Job had said, “I cried out like an athlete in the stadium, but my judgment is nowhere there. Indeed, I still fight. But if I do not bring my fight to a close, I will not get my crown.” We actually say these things lest we accuse God of the fact that Job suffered such misfortunes and there was judgment for him nowhere.
