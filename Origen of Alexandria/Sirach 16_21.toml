“And I will send hunger on them and will cause people and beast to die.” How can I proclaim publicly such profound truths? From where will I receive help that I might make you understand how the earth is touched by hunger and fruitfulness, by abundance and poverty? “O the depths of the riches, the wisdom and the knowledge of God!” Hunger perhaps comes because of people and because of the wickedness of souls. Or perhaps it is the fault of the angels to whom the things of the earth were entrusted that the things we see happen take place, if they commit sin. If some are set up as instruments of heavenly providence, but they themselves become interested in the fruits, then the earth’s sterility is probably also due to them. “The greater part of his works are hidden.” We cannot speak of the greatness of wisdom. “Who has counted the sands of the sea, the raindrops, the days of the ages? The height of the heavens, the wideness of the earth, the depths of the wisdom of God.”
