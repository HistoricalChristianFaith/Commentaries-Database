Observe how holy and how marvelous is the sequence of things. Do not imagine that wisdom will come before its enactment in deeds. The deeds ought to come first, and wisdom sought afterwards.… We ought not teach others before we ourselves are instructed and rational. After these things, however, “truth” is added because “truth” is the highest wisdom. The prophet also preserves this same order when he says, “Sow for yourselves righteousness and reap the fruit of life; illuminate yourselves with the light of knowledge.” See how he does not first say, “Illuminate yourselves with the light of knowledge,” but first, “Sow for yourselves righteousness.” It is not sufficient just to sow, but he says, “reap the fruit of life” so that after these you can fulfill what follows, “illuminate yourselves with the light of knowledge.”
