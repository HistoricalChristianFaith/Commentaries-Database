But how does he continue again as if speaking to men: “Let water be received,” the text says, “and your feet be washed”?Abraham, the father and teacher of nations, is indeed teaching you by these things how you ought to receive guests and that you should wash the feet of guests. Nevertheless even this is said mysteriously. For he knew that the mysteries of the Lord were not to be completed except in the washing of feet. But he was not unaware of the importance of that precept, indeed, in which the Savior says, “If any shall not receive you, shake off even the dust which clings to your feet for a testimony to them. Truly I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for that city.” He wished, therefore, to anticipate that and to wash their feet lest perhaps any dust should remain, which, shaken off, could be reserved “in the day of judgment” for a testimony of unbelief. For that reason, therefore, wise Abraham says, “Let water be received and your feet be washed.”
