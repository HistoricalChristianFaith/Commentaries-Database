Behold the mercy and piety of the good God. When he wishes to be merciful, he says that he is displeased and angry. As he says through Jeremiah, “You will be chastised, Jerusalem, with pain and a scourge, lest my soul depart from you.” If you understand these words, it is the voice of God having compassion when he is angry, when he is jealous, when he brings pains and beatings. “For he scourges every one whom he receives.”
