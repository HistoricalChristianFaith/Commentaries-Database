Paul says this about those who have been united to Christ in all the ways mentioned above. When tribulation comes, we shall say to God: “Thou hast given me room when I was in distress.” If we have distress in the world, arising from the needs of the body, we shall call on the breadth of God’s wisdom and knowledge, in which the world cannot distress us. For I shall return to the wide fields of the holy Scriptures and look for the spiritual meaning of God’s Word, and there no distress will take hold of me.… If I suffer persecution and confess Christ before men, I am certain that he will confess me also before his Father, who is in heaven. Famine cannot disturb me, for I have the bread of life which comes down from heaven and refreshes weary souls; nor can that bread ever be wanting, for it is perfect and eternal. Nakedness does not confound me, because I am clothed with the Lord Jesus Christ. … I shall not fear peril, because “God is my light and my salvation; whom then shall I fear?” The earthly sword cannot frighten me because I have “the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God.”
