What kind of fire? “He stationed the cherubim and the fiery sword, which turns about to protect the way of the tree of life.” Where the tree of life is, where the paradise of God is, where God the gardener is, where the blessed and the elect and the holy ones of God reside, there the blessed await God’s own way of handling affairs.
