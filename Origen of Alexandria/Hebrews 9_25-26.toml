But this world, which is itself called an “age,” is said to be the end of many ages. Now the holy apostle teaches that in the age that was before this, Christ did not suffer, nor even in the age before that; and I do not know that I am able to enumerate the number of previous ages in which he did not suffer. I will show, however, the statements of Paul from which I have arrived at this understanding. He says, “He has appeared once for all at the end of the age to take away sin by the sacrifice of himself.” He says that Christ was made a “sacrifice” once, and “at the end of the ages has appeared to take away sin.” Now after this age, which is said to be made for the consummation of other ages, there will be other ages again to follow; for we have clearly learned this from Paul himself, who says, “that in the ages to come he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in his kindness toward us.” He did not say “in the age to come” or “in the two ages to come” but “in the ages to come.” I think, therefore, that by his language many ages are indicated.

In trying to reconcile two apostolic passages it has often occurred to me to raise the question of how there can be a consummation of ages at which Jesus has been manifested once for all to do away with sin if there are going to be ages following this age. The passages are these: In Hebrews, “But now at a consummation of the ages he has been manifested once for all to do away with sin through his sacrifice,” but in Ephesians, “In order that he may show forth in the years following, the exceeding riches of his grace in kindness toward us.” Well, conjecturing on a matter so great, I believe that, just as the year’s consummation is its last month after which arises another month’s beginning, so probably the present age is a consummation of numerous ages completing as it were a year of ages, and after it certain coming ages will arise whose beginning is the coming age. In those coming ages God shall show forth the riches of his grace in kindness, when the greatest sinner, who for having spoken ill against the Holy Spirit is held fast by his sin throughout the present age and the coming one from beginning to end, shall after that, I know not how, receive a dispensation.
