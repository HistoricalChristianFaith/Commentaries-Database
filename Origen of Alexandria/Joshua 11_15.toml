The verse says, “Just as Moses, the servant of the Lord, ordered him.” Here, the word of the law itself is called Moses, the servant of the Lord, just as it says in the Gospel, “They have Moses and the prophets, let them listen to them.” Therefore, the law commanded us to destroy all of sin’s kings, who incite us to sin. “Jesus [Joshua] accomplished this, and he did not transgress anything from all that Moses established for him.” Indeed, according to the first stage of explanation, we said that whatever the law of God—which here is called Moses—ordered, Jesus fulfills in us and is himself the one who destroys vices in us and overthrows the most vile kingdoms of sin. Nevertheless, it can also be said about our Lord and Savior himself, that everything Moses commanded in the law, Jesus accomplished, and he did not transgress anything, since the apostle indeed says, “When the fullness of time had come, God sent his own Son, made from a woman, made under the law.” If, therefore, he was made under the law, since he was under the law, everything that the law commanded, he fulfilled, so that he might redeem us from the curse of the law. He also says concerning himself, “I came not to abolish but to fulfill the law.”
