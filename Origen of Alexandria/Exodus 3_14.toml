That the activity of the Father and the Son is to be found both in saints and in sinners is clear from the fact that all rational beings are partakers of the word of God, that is, of reason, and so have implanted within them some seeds, as it were, of wisdom and righteousness, which is Christ. And all things that exist derive their share of being from him who truly exists, who said through Moses, “I am that I am”; which participation in God the Father extends to all, both righteous and sinners, rational and irrational creatures and absolutely everything that exists.
