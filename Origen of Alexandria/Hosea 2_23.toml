Next the promise of God is said for those who hear; if they do what is “commanded: And you will be my people and I will be your God.” Not everyone who says they are a people of God are “a people” of God. Hence, that people who were proclaimed to be a people of God heard, “You are not my people,” in the passage, “Therefore you are not my people.” And it has been said to that people you are “not my people.” Elsewhere this people was called a “people,” for “they have provoked me to jealousy with what is not God”—he speaks concerning the former—“they have provoked me with their idols. So I will provoke them to jealousy with those who are not a people, with a senseless nation I will provoke them.”
