For if at last we come to perfection, then the Canaanite is said to have been exterminated by us and handed over to death. But as to how this is accomplished in our flesh, hear the apostle saying, “Mortify your members that are upon the earth: fornication, impurity,” and the other things that follow. And again it says, “For those who belong to Christ have crucified their flesh with its vices and lusts.” Thus, therefore, in the third stage, that is, when we come to perfection and mortify our members and carry around the death of Christ in our body, the Canaanite is said to be exterminated by us.

You see what is being said to us in the spiritual interpretation, to clear the woodland that is in us and, cutting useless and unfruitful trees out of us, to make fallow lands there that we would always renew and from which we would reap fruit “thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold.” Does not the word of the Gospel also proclaim the same things to us, saying, “Behold the axe has already been placed at the root of the trees; therefore, every tree that does not bear fruit will be cut down and cast into the fire”9? These are the things Jesus [Joshua] the son of Nun commanded to our ancestors concerning cutting down unfruitful trees; these are the mandates the Lord Jesus describes in the Gospel. So how is it not true that a shadow has preceded and truth has followed after?
