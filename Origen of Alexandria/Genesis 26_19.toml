For who is able worthily to explain either the mysteries of such great wells or of those things that are related to have been done for the wells, unless we invoke the Father of the living Word and he should deign to put the word in our mouth so that we may be able to draw a little “living water” for you who thirst from those wells which are so copious and numerous?There are, therefore, wells that the servants of Abraham dug, but the Philistines had filled these with earth. Isaac therefore undertakes first to clear these wells. The Philistines hate water; they love earth. Isaac loves water; he is always seeking wells; he cleans old wells, he opens new ones.
Consider our Isaac, who “has been offered as a sacrifice for us,” coming into the valley of Gerar, which means “wall” or “hedge.” [He is] coming, I say, that “he might destroy the middle wall of hedge, the enmities, in his flesh.” [He is] coming to remove the wall that is between us and the heavenly virtues, that he might make “both one” and carry back to the mountains38 “on his shoulder” the lamb which had strayed and restore it to the other “ninety-nine which had not strayed.”
