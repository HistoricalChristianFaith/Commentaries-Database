First, therefore, let us investigate why Caleb received the capital city, the capital of Anak, the one first called a capital among all the rest in the land of promise. Anak means “vain humility” or “vain reply.” Therefore, Caleb received the capital of “vain humility.” It is certain that there are two humilities. One is laudable, about which the Savior said, “Learn from me because I am meek and humble in heart; and you will find rest for your souls.” And about this humility it is said, “Everyone who humbles himself will be exalted,” and elsewhere, “Therefore, be humbled under the almighty hand of God.” But there is also another humility, guilty of sins, just as that which Scripture speaks of concerning illicit sexual union: “He humbled her.” This is written concerning Ammon, that he “humbled” Tamar his sister. For it is vain humility that sinks down on account of sin. Therefore, Caleb seized or destroyed the capital city of vain humility and destroyed the three sons of Anak, who were sons of vain humility, and, after he had destroyed them, he occupied the city and did the things that are written later.

But who are those sons of vain humility whom Caleb drove out? First Sheshai, which is interpreted “outside me,” that is, “outside the holy,” because the son of vain humility is outside the holy, and indeed outside God. And another is Ahiman, which means “my brother outside counsel” just as if we said, “brother without counsel.” For it is certain all brothers who are born from vain humility are outside counsel. Third is Talmai, which means “precipice” or “suspension.” This indicates that there is nothing stable in him, but all things are unsettled and rushing headlong into great danger.
