If a wound is inflicted on the body or a bone is broken or a nerve center ruptured, wounds of this sort usually happen to bodies in the space of one hour and then are barely healed with great pain and suffering over a long period of time. For how much swelling and what great agony arises from the wounded spot? But now, if it happens that someone is repeatedly wounded in the same place or the same bone is broken more than once, by what tremendous pain and agony can this be healed and cured? And by what length of time is this brought to healing, if indeed it is even possible? And scarcely ever will one be cured in such a way that he avoids a physical infirmity or a nasty scar.Pass now from the example of the body to the wounds of the soul. However often the soul sins, just that often it is wounded. And lest you be in doubt that it is wounded by sins, as if by arrows and swords, listen to the apostle when he admonishes us to take up “the shield of faith by which,” he says, “you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one.” So you see that sins are the “arrows of the evil one,” which are aimed at the soul. But not only does the soul suffer the wounds of arrows, but it also experiences fractures of its feet when “snares are prepared for its feet” and when its “steps are made to trip.” So, by what length of time do you think that these wounds and others like them can be cured? O, if we could only see how with each sin our inner person is wounded, how bad words inflict a wound! Have you not read, they say, that “swords inflict wounds, but not as much as the tongue.” The soul is wounded, then, even by the tongue; it is also wounded by evil thoughts and desires; but it is fractured and shattered by the works of sin. If we could see all this and feel the scars of a soul that has been wounded, we would certainly resist sin to death. But now, just as those who are filled with a demon or the mentally insane do not perceive it when they are wounded, because they lack natural senses, so is it with us. Since we have become crazed by the desires of the world7 or intoxicated with vices, we cannot feel the extent of the wounds or the extent of the grief we are bringing on our soul by sinning. And therefore it is perfectly consistent that the reckoning of the punishment, that is, of the medical treatment and cure, is extended over time and that for each wound the length of healing be prolonged as well, according to the nature of the wound.
So then, the justice and kindness of God will also become evident in those very penalties of the soul. Let the one who hears this and has committed sin come to his senses and sin no more. For conversion in the present life and a penance having been carried out fruitfully will bring swift medicine to wounds of this sort, since penance not only heals a past wound, but it does not allow the soul to be wounded further by sin.
