Then when the soul thinks it is ready, it sets out from Succoth and camps at Buthan [Etham]. Buthan means “valley.” Now we have said that the stages refer to progress in the virtues. And a virtue is not acquired without training and hard work, nor is it tested as much in prosperity as in adversity. So the soul comes to a valley. For in valleys and in low places the struggle against the devil and the opposing powers takes place.
