Therefore, he wants those for whom “the Lord is their portion” to be sober, to fast, to be vigilant at all times, but especially when they are present at the altar to pray to the Lord and to offer sacrifices in his presence. These commands preserve their force. They ought to be maintained in strict observance. The apostle confirms these as laws of the new covenant. In the same way, setting up the rules of life for the priests or the chief priests to this, he tells them that they ought not to be enslaved “to much wine” but to be “sober.” Sobriety is the mother of virtues, drunkenness the mother of vices.
