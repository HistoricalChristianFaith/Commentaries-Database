Christ is a builder and architect, about whom it has been said in the prophets: “He will build my city, and he will turn back the captivity of my people.” Thus the Lord said, “And I will build them up, and I will not tear them down.” For the God who is good takes down certain buildings. For it is necessary that the building of unclean spirits be destroyed in us, and a temple to God be built in this way from virtues and right teachings so that his glory can be seen in it.
