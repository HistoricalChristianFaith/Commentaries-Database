The third day was now come from Jesus’ baptism, and there was a marriage taking place in Cana of Galilee. Jesus’ mother was there when, on the failure of the wine, he made wine out of water.… Jesus being Maker of man and woman does not refuse to be called to a marriage; it was he who after forming Eve brought her to Adam. Therefore in the Gospel he says about this union, “What God has joined together let no man put asunder.” Let the heretics therefore be put to shame who reject marriage, since Jesus was called to a marriage and his mother was there.
