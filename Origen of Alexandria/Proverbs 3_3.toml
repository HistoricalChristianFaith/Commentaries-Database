If you wish to fast according to the precept of the gospel, observe the evangelical laws on fasting in which the Savior commands this about fasting: “But if you fast, anoint your head and wash your face.” But if you ask how “to wash your face,” the apostle Paul teaches how “with uncovered face, you will contemplate the glory of the Lord and be transformed to this same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord.” “Anoint even your head,” but take care that it not be with the oil of sin. For “the oil of the sinner will not anoint your head.” But “anoint your head” with the oil of exultation, “the oil of joy,” the oil of mercy, so that, according to the command of wisdom, “mercy and faith may not forsake you.”
