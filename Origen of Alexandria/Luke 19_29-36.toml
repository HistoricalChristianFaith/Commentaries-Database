When the Savior had come “to Bethphage and Bethany near Mount Olivet, he sent two of his disciples” to untie “the foal of a donkey” that had been tied, “on which no man had ever sat.” To me, this seems to apply more to the deeper sense than to the simple narrative. The donkey had been bound. Where was it bound? “Across from Bethphage and Bethany.” “Bethany” means “house of obedience,” and “Bethphage” means “house of jaws.” Bethphage is a priestly place, because jawbones were given to priests, as the law commands. The Savior sends his disciples to the place where “obedience” is and where “the place given over to priests” is, to unbind “the foal of an ass, on which no man had ever sat.”
