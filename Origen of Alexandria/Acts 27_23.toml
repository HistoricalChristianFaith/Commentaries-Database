Both good and bad angels are among people. Not by chance or without reason was that angel, for example, allotted to be the guardian of Peter or that other one for Paul or those of the children of the church, those that always “behold the face of their Father, who is in heaven.” Concerning these things there can be no doubt that, by the judgment of God, who clearly sees their ranking and the quality of our souls, these angels are allotted to the guardianship of each one of us by a certain mystical allotment according to the dispensation of Christ.
