But let us understand these verses spiritually, claiming the parable of the Gospel, which says concerning the weeds, “Let them grow up together, lest perhaps when you wish to pluck up the weeds, you also pluck up the wheat with them.” Therefore, as the weeds are permitted in the Gospel to grow up together with the wheat, in the same manner even here in Jerusalem—that is, in the church—there are certain Jebusites who lead an ignoble and degenerate life, and who are perverse not only in their faith but in their actions and in every manner of living. For while the church is on earth, it is not possible to cleanse it to such purity that neither an ungodly person nor any sinner seems to reside in it, where everyone is holy and blessed and no blot of sin is found in them. But just as it is said concerning the weeds, “lest perhaps plucking up the weeds, at the same time you may also pluck up the wheat with them,” so it can also be said of those in whom there are either doubtful or secret sins. For we are not saying that those who are clearly and plainly sinful should not be expelled from the church.

Concerning Jerusalem, we have frequently said that it means “a vision of peace.” If, therefore, Jerusalem has been built in our heart—that is, if the vision of peace has been established in our heart and we always contemplate and retain in our heart Christ, who is “our peace”—if indeed we are so fixed and firm in this vision of peace that absolutely no evil thought or consideration of some sin ever rises up into our heart, if this could be so done, we would be able to say that we are in Jerusalem and no one else dwells with us except those who are holy. But now, even though we make great progress and improve ourselves with the utmost zeal, nevertheless I do not think anyone turns out to be so pure of heart that he is never defiled by the contamination of a contrary thought. Therefore, it is still certain that Jebusites dwell with the sons of Judah in Jerusalem. Yet we do not say these things so that we may neglect to cast them out as far as it may be done. On the contrary, we must be amply concerned and must attempt daily to cast them from Jerusalem; but, just as it is written, we cannot cast all out at the same time.
