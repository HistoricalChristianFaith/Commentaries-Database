Whoever is in Judea, that is, “in the letter of the old law,” should flee to the mountains of the new things of the Spirit. And whoever is found to have gone up onto the roof, which is the Word, and stands high above his home should not descend to retrieve anything from within his house. For he who remains on the roof and denies himself will never need to come down.Whoever is in the field must not turn back. If he is in the field in which the treasure is hidden, as the Lord taught in his parable, he must not turn back. If he is in the field to which Jacob was compared when his father blessed him, saying, “Behold, the smell of my son is like the smell of a bountiful field which the Lord has blessed,” in which everyone who lives according to the law will be blessed with the spiritual blessings of the law, he still must not turn back. As the Scripture says, “You will be blessed in the city and blessed in the field.” Whoever therefore is in the field of “every plant which the heavenly Father has planted,” he too must not turn back. Just as he who puts his hand to the plow and turns back is unfit for the kingdom of God, so also the one in the field who turns back on account of those things which he ought to have forsaken will undoubtedly incur the abomination of desolation which is deception. This is especially true of those who had previously stripped off their old tunic (that is, “the old nature with its practices”) and return again to retrieve it.
