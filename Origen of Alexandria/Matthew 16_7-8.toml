After Jesus said this, the disciples thought to themselves (not aloud but in their hearts), “We did not bring bread.” Then they said something else, like “If we had bread, then we wouldn’t need the yeast from the Pharisees and Sadducees, but since we don’t have bread, we are at risk of taking their yeast. The Savior does not want us to return to their tutelage, so he told us ‘be careful and be on your guard against the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.’ ” Or they reasoned similar things.But Jesus, seeing into their hearts and hearing their inner arguments, reproves them as the Shepherd of the heart because they did not understand nor remember the bread which they had received from him. Because of what they had received, even when they appeared to lack bread, they did not need the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
