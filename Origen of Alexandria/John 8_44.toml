These words make it very clear that one is not a child of the devil as a result of creation, nor is anyone said to be a son of God because he was so created. It is also clear that one who was previously a child of the devil can become a child of God. Matthew also reveals this when he records that the Savior spoke as follows: “You have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. But I say to you, you shall love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, that you may become children of your Father who is in heaven.” For note that by [obeying] the commands, “Love your enemies” and “Pray for those who persecute you,” he who previously was not a child of the Father in heaven subsequently becomes his child.

For such is the meaning of the words “You will to do your father’s desires.” But we must say in reference to these matters that the devil desires, let us say, that this boy be corrupted, and that this woman commit adultery and that these men visit prostitutes. By the power of these desires, [the devil] makes the desire to do the things that he wishes to effect serve him so that, according to this, one could say that the one [i.e., the devil] who causes the prostitution or adultery practices prostitution and commits adultery even before the human becomes involved. And you will say the same thing also about every sin, that is to say, the devil does not desire money, but he desires to make people lovers of money and passionately desirous of material things. And those who love money, even if all they do is wish for it, will to carry out this desire of his.

If we do the works of God and wish to do his desires, we are children of God. But if we do the works of the devil and wish to do what he desires, we are of our father the devil. Let us pay attention, then, not only to what we do but also to what we desire. For even to wish to do the desires of the devil is sufficient to be his child. Perhaps this is why the words “You wish to do the desires of your father” are added after the statement “You do the works of your father,” so that we may learn that even if we merely wish to do what the devil desires, we will still be called the children of the devil.

But notice also the statement “In Adam all die, and in Christ all shall be made alive.” … By observing these words you will perceive the life of man according to the image. And when you have understood what his life is, you will perceive in what manner the murderer killed the living man, and that he will correctly be called a murderer, not because he killed some particular individual but because he killed the whole race insofar as “in Adam all die.”

And the reason why truth is not in him is that he has been deceived and accepts lies, and he has himself been deceived by himself. On this basis he is considered to be worse than the rest of these who are deceived, since they are deceived by him, but he creates his own deception himself.

If one carefully considers human nature, which is not easily purified of false teachings, one sees that, as “everyone is a liar,” not everyone has stood in the truth. If someone is not a liar and has stood in the truth, he is not an ordinary person but is like those to whom God says, “I have said, ‘You are gods, children of the Most High.’ ” … But when the Holy Spirit or an angelic spirit speaks, it does not speak from its own resources but from the Word of truth itself and from wisdom. This is made clear in the Gospel according to John below where Jesus teaches about the Paraclete, saying, “He will receive from me and will declare it to you.” Whenever the lie speaks, however, it speaks from its own resources.… We then who are human beings should hurry and flee with all our strength to become “gods” since, to the extent that we are human, we are liars, just as the father of the lie is a liar.
