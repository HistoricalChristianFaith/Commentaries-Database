Why too does he blame Pharaoh, saying, “You will not let my people go; behold, I will smite all the firstborn in Egypt, even your firstborn,” and all the rest that is recorded as being said by God through Moses to Pharaoh? It is incumbent on him who believes that the Scriptures are true and that God is just, if he is a thoughtful man, to take pains to show how God, in using such expressions as these, can be clearly conceived to be just.

And is there anything more profound to say of Israel, not of nature but of grace, of whom it was written, “Israel is my firstborn son,” when Israel was in dispersion? You yourself will also understand that these are the scattered children of God for whom Jesus was to die in order to gather them together into one.
