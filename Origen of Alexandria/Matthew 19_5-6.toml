The apostle understands “the two shall become one flesh,” as referring to Christ and the church. So we must say that Christ did not dismiss the former (so to speak) wife, that is, the former synagogue, for any other cause than that the wife committed fornication, being made an adulteress by the evil one. Along with him she plotted against her husband and gave him over to death, saying, “Away with such a fellow from the earth, crucify him, crucify him.”It was she, the synagogue, therefore who left him, rather than that her husband divorced her and sent her away. Therefore it says in Isaiah, rebuking her for this divorce: “Where is your mother’s bill of divorce, with which I put her away?”
