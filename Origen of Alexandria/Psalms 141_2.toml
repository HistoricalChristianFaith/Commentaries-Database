And he prays “constantly” (deeds of virtue or fulfilling the commandments are included as part of prayer) who unites prayer with the deeds required and right deeds with prayer. For the only way we can accept the command to “pray constantly” as referring to a real possibility is by saying that the entire life of the saint taken as a whole is a single great prayer. What is customarily called prayer is, then, a part of this prayer. Now prayer in the ordinary sense ought to be made no less than three times each day. This is evident from the story of Daniel, who prayed three times a day when such great peril had been devised for him. And Peter went up to the housetop about the sixth hour to pray; that is when he saw the sheet descending from heaven let down by four corners. He was offering the middle prayer of the three, the one referred to before him by David, “In the morning may you hear my prayer, in the morning I will offer to you and I will watch.” And the last time of prayer is indicated by “the lifting up of my hands is an evening sacrifice.” Indeed, we do not even complete the nighttime properly without that prayer of which David speaks when he says, “At midnight I rise to praise you because of your righteous ordinances.” And Paul, as it says in the Acts of the Apostles, prayed “about midnight” with Silas in Philippi and sang a hymn to God so that even the prisoners heard them.
