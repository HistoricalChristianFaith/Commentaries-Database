For it is certain that he who serves the Word “is debtor to the wise and the unwise.” Because, therefore, he is producing a feast for the wise, for this reason it is said that “he made” not a small but “a great feast.”And you, if you should not still be “a little child” and in need of “milk” but should bring your “senses exercised” and should come more capable to an understanding of the Word of God after very much instruction has been set before you, there will also be “a great feast” for you. The “vegetables” of the weak13 will not be prepared for you as food, nor will you be nourished with milk with which “little children” are nourished, but the servant of the Word will make a “great feast” for you. He will speak to you the “wisdom” that is offered “among the perfect.” He will offer you the “wisdom of God hidden in a mystery, which none of the princes of this world knew.” He will reveal Christ to you in this respect, that in him “all the treasures of wisdom are hidden.”15
He makes you therefore “a great feast,” and he himself eats with you if he should not find you to be such that he should say to you, “I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to little ones in Christ.”
He says this to the Corinthians, to which he also adds, “For when there are contentions and dissensions among you, are you not carnal and walk in a human way?” Paul did not “make a great feast” for these, insofar that when he was with them and was in need, he was a burden to no one. Nor did he eat bread he did not pay for from anyone, but laboring night and day, his own hands served himself and all who were with him. The Corinthians therefore were so far from having a “great feast” that the preacher of the Word of God could have not even the least or a little feast with them.
But there is a great feast for those who know how to hear more perfectly, who bring their “senses” instructed and “exercised” for hearing the Word of God.
