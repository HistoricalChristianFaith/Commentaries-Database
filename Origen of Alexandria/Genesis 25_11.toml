What more can we say about the death of Abraham than what the Word of the Lord in the Gospels contains, saying, “Concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read how he says in the bush: ‘the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’? Now he is not God of the dead but of the living. For all those are living.” Let us also therefore choose this kind of death, as also the apostle says, that “we may die to sin but live to God.” For indeed the death of Abraham should be understood to be such, which death has amplified his bosom so much that all the saints who come from the four parts of the earth “may be borne by the angels into the bosom of Abraham.”

“The Lord blessed Isaac,” the text says, “and he dwelt at the well of vision.” This is the whole blessing with which the Lord blessed Isaac: that he might dwell “at the well of vision.” That is a great blessing for those who understand it. Would that the Lord might give this blessing to me too, that I might deserve to dwell “at the well of vision.”What kind of person can know and understand what the vision is “which Isaiah the son of Amos saw”? What kind of person can know what Nahum’s vision is? What kind of person can understand what that vision contains which Jacob saw in Bethel when he was departing into Mesopotamia, when he said, “This is the house of the Lord and the gate of heaven”? And if anyone can know and understand each individual vision or the things that are in the law or in the prophets, that one dwells “at the well of vision.”
But also consider this more carefully, that Isaac deserved to receive such a great blessing from the Lord that he might dwell “at the well of vision.” But when shall we sufficiently deserve to pass by, perhaps, “the well of vision”? He deserved to remain and dwell in the vision; we, what little we have been illuminated by the mercy of God, can scarcely perceive or surmise of a single vision.

If, however, I shall have been able to perceive some one meaning of the visions of God, I shall appear to have spent one day “at the well of vision.” But if I shall have been able to touch something not only according to the letter but also according to the spirit, I shall appear to have spent two days “at the well of vision.” But if also I shall have touched the moral point, I shall have spent three days. Or certainly even if I shall not have been able to understand everything, if I am nevertheless busily engaged in the divine Scriptures and “I meditate on the law of God day and night” and at no time at all do I desist inquiring, discussing, investigating and certainly, what is greatest, praying God and asking for understanding from him who “teaches humankind knowledge,” I shall appear to dwell “at the well of vision.”But if I should be negligent and be neither occupied at home in the Word of God nor frequently enter the church to hear the Word, as I see some among you who only come to the church on festive days, those who are of this sort do not dwell “by the well of vision.” But I fear that perhaps those who are negligent, even when they come to the church, may neither drink from the well of water nor be refreshed, but they may devote themselves to the occupations and thoughts of their heart which they bring with them and may depart thirsty no less from the wells of the Scriptures.
You, therefore, hasten and act sufficiently that that blessing of the Lord may come to you, that you may be able to dwell “at the well of vision,” that the Lord may open your eyes and you may see “the well of vision” and may receive from it “living water,” which may become in you “a fountain of water springing up into eternal life.” But if anyone rarely comes to church, rarely draws from the fountains of the Scriptures and dismisses what he hears at once when he departs and is occupied with other affairs, this one does not dwell “at the well of vision.”
