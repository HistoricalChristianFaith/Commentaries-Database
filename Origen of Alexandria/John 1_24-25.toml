After the priests and Levites were sent from Jerusalem to ask John who he was, the Pharisees send to him as well, asking, “Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the prophet?” After they have examined him, they are the next to be baptized.… The difficulty is solved as follows. The Pharisees … who heard the words “generation of vipers …,” although they have not believed him, probably come for baptism because they fear the crowd and, in accordance with their hypocrisy toward them, consider it proper to let themselves be washed that they might not seem to be opposed to such people.
