But let us see what Abimelech said to the Lord. “You know, Lord,” the text says, “that I have done this with a pure heart.” This Abimelech acts very differently from Pharaoh. He is not so ignorant and vile but knows that he ought to prepare a “pure heart” for virtue. And because he wished to receive virtue with a pure heart, therefore God heals him when Abraham prays for him. And God heals not only Abimelech but also his handmaids.
