There is a person full of faith who comes forward in the assembly and accuses himself, making everyone aware of some sin he has committed. And yet, those who themselves have no fear of God’s future judgment, on hearing his words, instead of suffering with him who suffers, instead of burning with him who is offended, instead of falling with him who is fallen, say, Get away from me and don’t come near me because I am pure! Then they begin to curse this person whom they previously admired and withdraw their friendship from this person who did not want to conceal his crime. Conveniently they say of those who make the confession, “My friends and companions stand aloof from my plague, and my kin stand afar off.” It is not the case, however, that he ought to be afraid of the behavior of others when, after having committed a sin, he desires to save himself, nor should he fear the reproaches of those who do not think about their own sins or recall the words of the divine Scriptures: “Do not insult a person converted from sin, remember that we all deserve punishment.” Do not worry about such things. Instead, worry about your soul, and pray to God that he may hear you and raise you after you fall so that you will be able to say also that which follows: “I confess my iniquity; I am sorry for my sin.”
