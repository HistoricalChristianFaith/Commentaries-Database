Who do you think that judge is? I do not know any other judge besides our Lord Jesus Christ. Of him Scripture says elsewhere, “He will put the sheep on the right, but the goats on the left.” “Whoever confesses me before others, him will I also confess before my Father who is in heaven. Whoever denies me before others, I will deny him before my Father who is in heaven.”

Each one of us incurs a penalty for each single sin, and the size of the penalty is according to the quality and nature of the offense. I should show some testimony from the Scriptures about the penalty and monetary fines. One man incurs a debt of five hundred denarii and owes that much. Another is obliged to pay fifty denarii. The creditor cancels these debts for both debtors. “Another one,” as the Scripture says, “is brought forward, who owed ten thousand talents.” He is obliged to pay ten thousand talents.…The debt collector comes to claim his due. I resist him. I know that if I owe nothing, he has no power over me. If I am a debtor, the debt collector will send me to prison, fulfilling the order of which we have spoken. The enemy brings me to the ruler, and the ruler to the judge. The judge will hand me over to the debt collector, and the debt collector will put me in prison. What law governs that prison? I will not come out of it, nor will the debt collector allow me to go out, unless I have paid every debt.

The debt collector does not have the power to cancel for me even a penny of the debt or the smallest portion of it. Only one can cancel a debt when the debtors are unable to pity their debts. Scripture says, “One man came to him who owed five hundred denarii, and another who owed fifty. Since they did not have the money to pay him, he forgave both of them.” He who forgave was the Lord. He who collects debts is not the Lord but one whom the Lord assigns to collect debts.You were not worthy to have a debt of five hundred denarii, or fifty, canceled. You did not deserve to hear, “Your offenses are forgiven you.” You will be sent to prison, and there you will have payment exacted by labor and work or by punishments and torture. You will not get out unless you have paid the penny and the “last farthing,” which in Greek means “meager amount.”
