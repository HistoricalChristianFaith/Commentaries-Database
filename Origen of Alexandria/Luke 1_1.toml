With respect to the New Testament also “many have tried” to write Gospels, but not all found acceptance. You should know that not just four Gospels, but very many, were composed. The Gospels we have were chosen from among these Gospels and passed on to the churches. We know this from Luke’s own prologue, which begins this way: “Because many have tried to compose an account.” The words “have tried” imply an accusation against those who rushed into writing gospels without the grace of the Holy Spirit. Matthew, Mark, John and Luke did not “try” to write. They wrote their Gospels when they were filled with the Holy Spirit. Hence, “many have tried to compose an account of the events that are clearly known among us.” …Our doctrines about the person of our Lord and Savior should be drawn from these approved Gospels. I know one gospel called “According to Thomas,” and another “According to Matthias.” We have read many others, too, so that we do not appear to be ignorant of anything, because of those people who think they know something if they have examined these gospels. But in all of these questions we approve of nothing but that which the church approves, namely, only four canonical Gospels.…
Luke makes his intention known by the word he uses; that is, “that have been clearly shown to us,” a concept that the Latin language cannot express in one word. It means that Luke knew by firm faith and by careful consideration and did not waver on any point, wondering whether it should be this way or that.
