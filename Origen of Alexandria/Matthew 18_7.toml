Jesus pronounced “woe for temptations to sin” on people scattered throughout the whole world who are subject to temptations. But the disciples, who do not contemplate the things that are seen, are not of the world. Neither is their Master of the world. Therefore the “woe for temptations to sin” does not apply to Jesus’ faithful disciples. Rather, “great peace have those who love your law; nothing can make them stumble.” But there are some who appear to be disciples yet are still of the world. They love the world, and they love inordinately what is in it. They love the life that is led in these earthly places or the money which is in them, or the possessions or any resources whatsoever. The words “they are not of the world” do not apply to them. But “woe for temptations to sin” will apply to them since they are indeed of the world.
