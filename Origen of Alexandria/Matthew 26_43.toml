But notice that after the first prayer "he came to the disciples and found them sleeping." Likewise after the second prayer "he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy." On this, I believe they were the eyes not so much of their bodies as of their souls. Besides, he had not yet removed the heaviness from their eyes, "because he was not yet glorified." And just as "the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified," so too the heaviness had not yet been removed from their eyes "because Jesus was not yet glorified." Therefore he does not rebuke them, but "leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words." He also teaches us through those "same words," that we may not grow faint in prayer but persist in the very words of our prayer until we obtain those things we have begun to pray for.

And I suppose that the eyes of their body were not so much affected as the eyes of their mind, because the Spirit was not yet given them.
