Let us take an example from God. In fact, “he loves everything that exists” equally, “and he hates nothing that he has made: in fact, he created nothing that should be hated.” Nonetheless, this did not mean that he loved Jews and Egyptians in the same way, or Pharaoh as Moses and Aaron. At the same time, he did not love the other children of Israel as he loved Moses and Aaron and Miriam, and further, he did not love Aaron and Miriam as he loved Moses. Although what is said is true, “You have mercy on all, because all is yours, Lord and lover of souls. In fact, a spirit of incorruptibility is in all,” nevertheless the one who arranged all “with measure, number and weight” unquestionably also proportions his love to the measure of each one’s merits. Do we perhaps think that Paul, when he persecuted the church of God, was loved in the same way as when he underwent persecutions and torments for it and when he said that he bore within himself concern for all the churches?
