They [the Jews] reflected on the death of Abraham and the prophets, understanding that Samuel, too, when he was under the earth because of death, was brought up by a medium who thought the gods were somewhere below the earth and who said, “I saw gods ascending from the earth.” They had not, however, comprehended the life of Abraham and the prophets, nor that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob was not the God of them as men who were dead, but as men who were alive.

Samuel in hades! Samuel, he who was special among the prophets, who was dedicated to God from his birth, who before his birth is said to be in the temple, who at the same time he was weaned was clothed with the ephod and double cloak and became a priest of the Lord, the child to whom the Lord when he speaks uttered his messages, he was brought up by a medium?… Why is Samuel in hades?…Samuel comes up, and note that she does not say that she saw the soul of Samuel. She does not say she saw a man. She has been scared by this thing which she saw. What did she see? “I saw gods,” she says, “coming up from the earth.” And perhaps Samuel has not only come up in order just to prophesy to Saul, but it is likely, just as here “with the holy he will be holy, and with an innocent man he will be innocent,” and with the one of the chosen he will be as one of the chosen, and here the ways of the holy are with the holy but not with the sinners. And if then at some point the way of life of the holy is with the sinners for the purpose of saving the sinners, so perhaps also you may speculate whether either the holy souls of the other prophets in the coming up of Samuel come up together or perhaps whether they were angels of their spirits10—the prophet says, “the angel who speaks in me”—or whether they were angels who came up together with the spirits. And every [place] is filled with those who need salvation, and “are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?” Why do you fear to say that every place has need of Jesus Christ? Those who have need of Christ have need of the prophets. But if he has no need of Christ, he has no need of those who prepare for the appearance and dwelling of Christ.
