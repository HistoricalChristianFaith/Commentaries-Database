Paul says that the sacrifice is living because it has eternal life in it, which is Christ. Elsewhere he says: “We always carry in the body the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.” He calls it holy because the Holy Spirit dwells in it, as he says elsewhere: “Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?”
