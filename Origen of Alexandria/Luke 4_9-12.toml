Therefore let us see what the devil says to the Lord from the Scriptures. “Scripture says, ‘He gave his angels a command concerning you that they should raise you up in their hands, lest perhaps you strike your foot against a stone.’ ” See how crafty he is, even in the texts he quotes. For he wishes to diminish the Savior’s glory, as if the Savior needed the help of angels. It is as if he would strike his foot unless he were supported by their hands. The devil takes his verse from Scripture and applies it to Christ. Yet it is written not of Christ but about the saints in general. Freely and in total confidence I contradict the devil. This passage cannot be applied to the person of Christ, for Christ does not need the help of angels. He is greater than the angels and obtained a better name than they by inheritance. “God never said to any of the angels, ‘You are my Son; today I have begotten you.’”
