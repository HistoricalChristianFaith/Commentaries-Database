The first servant stepped forward in confidence, because he had gone to work and made a profit. That confidence now made him bold, for he was the first one to approach the master and declare to him, "Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more." The master replied in words favorable to us all, even as our master will reply when he settles with us: "Well done, good and faithful servant." These words run counter to what he said to the third man: "You wicked and slothful servant."
