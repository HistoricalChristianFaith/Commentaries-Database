Listen, shepherds of the churches! Listen, God’s shepherds! His angel always comes down from heaven and proclaims to you, “Today a Savior is born for you, who is Christ the Lord.” For, unless that Shepherd comes, the shepherd of the churches will be unable to guard the flock well. Their custody is weak, unless Christ pastures and guards it along with them. We just read in the apostle, “We are coworkers with God.” A good shepherd, who imitates the good Shepherd, is a coworker with God and Christ. He is a good shepherd precisely because he has the best Shepherd with him, pasturing his sheep along with him. For, “God established in his church apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. He established everything for the perfection of the saints.” Let this suffice for a simpler explanation.But we should ascend to a more hidden understanding. Some shepherds were angels that governed human affairs. Each of these kept his watch. They were vigilant day and night. But, at some point, they were unable to bear the labor of governing the peoples who had been entrusted to them and accomplish it diligently. When the Lord was born, an angel came and announced to the shepherds that the true Shepherd had appeared. Let me give an example. There was a certain shepherd-angel in Macedonia who needed the Lord’s help. Consequently, he appeared to Paul in his dreams as a Macedonian man “and said, ‘Cross over to Macedonia and help us.’ ” Why do I speak of Paul, since the angel said this not to Paul but to Jesus who was in Paul? So shepherds need the presence of Christ.
