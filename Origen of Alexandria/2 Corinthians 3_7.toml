But as the apostle discusses these things with that noble understanding which he employs in other matters, he writes: “But we have the mind of Christ.” He also says: “But if the ministry of death written with letters upon stones was glorious, so that the sons of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance, which is passing away, will not the ministry of the spirit be rather in glory?” And again a little later he says, “And not as Moses placed a veil on his face that the sons of Israel might not steadfastly look at the appearance of his countenance. For their senses were made dull, for up to this present day when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart.” Who would not wonder at the magnitude of the mysteries? Who would not greatly fear the sign of a dulled heart? Moses’ face was glorified, but “the sons of Israel” were not able “to look at the appearance of his countenance”; the people of the synagogue were not able “to look.” But if anyone can be superior in conduct and life to the multitude, he can look at the glory of his countenance. For even now, as the apostle says, “The veil is placed on the reading of the Old Testament”.; even now Moses speaks with glorified countenance, but we are not able to look at the glory which is in his countenance. We are not able, therefore, because we are still the populace, and we have no zeal or merit more than the common crowd. But because the holy apostle says, “but that same veil remains in the reading of the Old Testament,” the expressed opinion of such a great apostle would have cut off all hope of understanding for us if he had not added: “But when anyone shall turn to the Lord, the veil shall be removed.” He says, therefore, that the cause of the removal of the veil is our turning to the Lord. We should draw the conclusion from this that as long as we read the divine Scriptures without understanding, as long as what has been written is obscure to us and closed, we have not yet turned to the Lord. For if we had turned to the Lord, without doubt the veil would have been removed.

The apostle briefly indicates the reason that these words that were read to us can be understood or not understood when he says that “the veil of the Old Testament” can “be removed” from the eyes of the one “who has been converted to the Lord.” From this, he wanted it understood that these things are less clear to us to the same degree as our conversion to the Lord is less complete. And for that reason, this must be worked at with all our strength so that, free from secular occupations and mundane deeds, and if possible leaving behind these unnecessary fables of friends, we may apply ourselves to the Word of God and “meditate on his law day and night.” The result will be the conversion of the entire heart. Then we can see the face of Moses, opened and unveiled.
