God did not make "death, and he does not delight in the destruction of living things; for he created all things that they might exist, and the creatures of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them, and the dominion of hades is not on earth." Passing over, then, a little passage, I will ask, From where, then, did death come? "By the envy of the devil, death came into the world." If, then, there is something excellent in our regard, God has made it, but we have created evil and sins for ourselves. For the same reason, the beginning of the passage just read from the prophet speaks in a rhetorical sense to those who have bitterness in the soul contrary to the sweetness that God fashioned for it: "How have you turned to bitterness, you strange vine?" as if he was saying, God did not make lameness, but he has made all things swift of foot, yet what cause arose that has made the lame lame? And God has made all limbs absolutely sound, but what cause arose that makes things suffer? In the same way, the soul, not only of the first man but of all people, arose according to the image—for the statement "Let us make man according to our image and according to our likeness," applies to all people.

Thus does Paul also boast that the observance of the law and the whole glory of the Jewish system was to him like garbage, so that he might be found in Christ, having not his own justification that was of the law, but the justification from God. In this sense, therefore, Paul did not keep his own vineyard—that is to say, he did not keep the Jews' tradition after he had received the faith of Christ. Perhaps the reason why he did not keep it was that, though it had been planted by God as a true vine, it had turned into the bitterness of a strange vine. "For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom, and from the fields of Gomorrah … their clusters are bitter; their wine is the poison of serpents, and the cruel venom of asps."
