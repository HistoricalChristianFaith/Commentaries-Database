But I think that all betrayers of the truth, pretending to love the truth and using the sign of a kiss as a mark of affection, betray the Word of God. Cloaked in belligerence, brandishing clubs and the swords of battle and proffering insults, his enemies desire to take hold of him. And the traitor says to Jesus, "Master." Indeed, all heretics, like Judas, address Jesus in the same way, "Master." They kiss him even as Judas did. Jesus speaks peacefully to them all, since they are all Judases who betray him: "Judas, is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of man?" As for Judas, he is reproached by Christ for his false friendship. "Friend, why are you here?" We hear of no one who is good called by that name in the Scriptures. Moreover, to the wicked and the one not wearing a wedding garment he says, "Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?" Wicked too is that man in the parable of the denarius who hears the words, "Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last as I give to you."

And Jesus said unto him, Friend, wherefore art thou come? He says, Friend, upbraiding his hypocrisy; for in Scripture we never find this term of address used to any of the good, but as above, Friend, how camest thou in hither? (Matt. 22:12.) and, Friend, I do thee no wrong. (Matt. 20:13.)
