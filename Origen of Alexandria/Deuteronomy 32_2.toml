Therefore let us seek in the Scriptures what is “the rain” which is given only to the saints and concerning which “it is commanded to the clouds that they do not pour their rain” upon the unjust. Therefore Moses and the Lawgiver himself teach us what this rain is. For he himself says in Deuteronomy, “Consider, O heaven, and I will speak, and let the earth hear the words from my mouth; let my speech be awaited like rain.” Are these words my speech? Do we pervert violently the meaning of divine law by arguments of rhetoric? Is it not Moses who says that it is “rain” of which he speaks? He says, “Let my speech be awaited like rain and my words descend as dew, as a storm upon the grass and as snow upon the hay.”
