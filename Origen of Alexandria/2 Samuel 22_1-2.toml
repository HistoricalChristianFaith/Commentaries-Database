The fifth song is in Second Samuel, when “David spoke to the Lord the words of this song on the day when the Lord delivered him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul.” He said, “The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God will be my protector.” If, then, you prove able to examine who are the enemies David defeats and overthrows in First and Second Samuel and how he was made worthy of deserving the Lord’s help and of being delivered from enemies of this kind, then you will be able to sing this fifth song yourself.
