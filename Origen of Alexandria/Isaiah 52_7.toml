“How are beautiful are the feet of those who announce good things!” Since Isaiah perceived the beautiful and opportune preaching of the apostles who follow the One who said, “I am the way,” he praises the feet that proceed over the intelligible way, which is Christ Jesus, and go in to God through the door. Those whose feet are beautiful announce Jesus as “good tidings.”
