It was necessary for him to teach these things by example, “giving his back to whips and his cheeks to fists” and not turning his face away “from insults and spitting.” Thus would he, by suffering these things in our place, deliver us (as I believe) who were worthy to suffer all that disgrace. Truly he did not “die for us” that we might not die but that we might not die for ourselves. And he was spat upon and beaten for us, so that we who were worthy of all these things because of our sins might not just suffer them but, suffering them for the sake of justice, we might gratefully accept them. Paul makes it clear that the Savior “humbled himself becoming obedient all the way to death, even to the death of the cross.” … “On account of all this, God exalted him.” God not only exalted him because of the death he underwent for our sake but also because of the buffeting and the spitting and all the rest.Christ did not turn his face away “from insult and spitting,” so his face might be glorified more than the face of Moses42—with so much glory that comparatively the glorification of Moses’ face was outshone, even as the light of a lamp is outshone by that of the sun and even as knowledge, which knows in part, is outshone “when that which is perfect has come.” But they also buffeted the holy head of the church. Because of this, they will be beaten by Satan, not that they may not be extolled or may have their power brought to an end but that, once in the hands of the enemy and punisher, they may receive just punishment for the sin they committed in buffeting Jesus.
Not content with spitting in his face and buffeting him, they even struck his face with the palms of their hands, and, mocking him, they said, “Prophesy to us, O Christ! who is it that struck you?” On account of this … they have been struck and punished. Yet they were unwilling to accept any discipline, as Jeremiah had prophesied about them: “You chastened them and they did not grieve; they were unwilling to receive correction.” And now whoever harms anyone in the church and does these things to him spits on the very face of Christ, and, buffeting Christ, they slap him with the palms of their hands.
