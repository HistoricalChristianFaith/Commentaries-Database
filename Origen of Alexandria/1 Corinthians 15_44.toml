In regard to our bodily nature we must understand that there is not one body which we now use in lowliness and corruption and weakness and a different one which we are to use hereafter in incorruption and power and glory. Rather this same body, having cast off the weaknesses of its present existence, will be transformed into a thing of glory and made spiritual, with the result that what was a vessel of dishonor shall itself be purified and become a vessel of honor and a habitation of blessedness.

The quality of a spiritual body is something such as will make a fitting habitation not only for all saints and perfected souls but also for that “whole creation” which is to be “delivered from the bondage of corruption.”

It is from the natural body that the power and grace of the resurrection calls forth the spiritual body, when it changes it from dishonor to glory.
