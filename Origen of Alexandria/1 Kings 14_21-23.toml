Our Lord and Savior had come for this end, to take on himself humanity’s sins. God “made him who had committed no sin to be sin for our sake.” For this reason, he came down into the world and took on the person of sinners and depraved people. He willed to be born from the stock of Solomon, whose sins have been recorded, and from Rehoboam, whose transgressions are reported, and from the rest of them, many of whom “did evil in the sight of the Lord.”
