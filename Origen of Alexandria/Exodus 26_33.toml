If the ancient custom of sacrifices is clear to you, let us see what these things also contain according to the mystical understanding. You heard that there were two sanctuaries, one, as it were, visible and open to the priests; the other, as it were, invisible and inaccessible. With the exception of the high priest alone, the others were outside. I think this first sanctuary can be understood as this church in which we are now placed in the flesh, in which the priests minister “at the altar of the whole burnt offerings,” with that fire kindled about which Jesus said, “I came to send fire unto the earth, and how I wish it to be ignited.” And I do not want you to marvel that this sanctuary is open only to the priests. For all who have been anointed with the chrism of the sacred anointing have become priests, just as Peter also says to all the church, “But you are an elect race, a royal priesthood, a holy people.” Therefore you are “a priestly race,” and because of this you approach the sanctuary.
