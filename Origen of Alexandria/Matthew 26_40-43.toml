But notice that after the first prayer “he came to the disciples and found them sleeping.” Likewise after the second prayer “he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.” On this, I believe they were the eyes not so much of their bodies as of their souls. Besides, he had not yet removed the heaviness from their eyes, “because he was not yet glorified.” And just as “the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified,” so too the heaviness had not yet been removed from their eyes “because Jesus was not yet glorified.” Therefore he does not rebuke them, but “leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.” He also teaches us through those “same words,” that we may not grow faint in prayer but persist in the very words of our prayer until we obtain those things we have begun to pray for.

As long as Jesus was present, his disciples did not sleep. After he had walked away a short distance, they were unable to watch for even one hour in his absence. For this reason we should pray that Jesus will not leave us for even a short while but will fulfill what he promised when he said to us, “And I am with you all days, even to the end of the world.” In this way will we keep watch as he banishes sleep from our souls, to make it possible for us to fulfill his command: “Do not give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids, that you may escape as a doe from the nets and a bird from the snare of the fowlers.” But coming to the disciples and finding them asleep, he arouses them with a word and tells them to listen, so he may as it were say to those who are listening: “How is it that you were not able to watch with me for even one hour?”He orders us then to be wakeful so we may keep watch and pray. Now that person watches who does good works, that person watches who diligently attends to the truth of the faith lest he be ensnared by any shady teaching. He who watches and prays in this way will have his prayer heard. This is what the Lord means when he says, “Watch and pray.” We should first watch and, while watching, we should pray.
