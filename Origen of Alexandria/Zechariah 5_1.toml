“They sank in the depth like a stone.” Why “did they sink in the depth like a stone”? Because they were not the kind of “stones which sons of Abraham could be raised up” but the kind which love the depth and desire the liquid element, that is, who seize the bitter and fluid desire of present things. Whence it is said of these: “They sank like lead in very deep water.” They are serious sinners. For iniquity is also shown “to sit upon a talent of lead,” as Zechariah the prophet says: “I saw a woman sitting upon a talent of lead, and I said, ‘Who is this?’ And he answered, ‘Iniquity.’ ” Hence it is, therefore, that the unjust “sank in the depth, like lead in very deep water.”
