“I stretched out my words, and you did not listen.” It is reasonable that he said he stretched out words in his heart because … God granted him a large heart. For one who can explain what is briefly said in mysteries in conjunction with the larger teachings asserted in Scripture has an enlarged heart. Therefore, it is necessary, in agreement with the teaching of the wise Solomon, for the person who desires to know wisdom to begin with moral training and to understand what is written: “You have desired wisdom; keep the commandments, and it will be given to you by God.”
