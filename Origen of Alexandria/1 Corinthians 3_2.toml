In spiritual matters, “solid food” means the teaching about the Father and the Son. In the Old Testament, solid food appears under the guise of typology, as, for example, when we read about the serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness. This serpent was a picture, or type, of Christ, which explains why it was that the people were saved when they looked at it.
