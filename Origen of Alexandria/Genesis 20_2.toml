I think, therefore, that Sarah, which means “princess” or “one who governs empires,” represents aretē, which is the virtue of the soul. This virtue then is joined to and clings to a wise and faithful man, even as that wise man who said of wisdom, “I have desired to take her for my spouse.” For this reason therefore God says to Abraham, “In all that Sarah has said to you, listen to her voice.” This saying, at any rate, is not appropriate to physical marriage, since that well known statement was revealed from heaven which says to the woman concerning the man, “In him shall be your refuge, and he shall have dominion over you.” If therefore the husband is said to be lord of his wife, how is it said again to the man, “In all that Sarah has said to you, pay attention to her voice”? If anyone therefore has married virtue, let him listen to her voice in all which she shall counsel him.Abraham therefore does not now wish that virtue be called his wife. For as long as virtue is called his wife, she belongs to him and can be shared with no one. And it is proper that until we reach perfection, virtue of the soul be within us and personal. But when we reach perfection so that we are capable also of teaching others, let us then no longer enclose virtue within our bosom as a wife but as a sister; let us unite her also with others who desire her. For to those who are perfect the divine Word says, “Say that wisdom is your sister.” In this way therefore Abraham too said Sarah was his sister.…
Nevertheless Pharaoh too once wished to receive Sarah, but he did not wish with a pure heart; and virtue cannot unite except with purity of heart. For this reason, therefore, Scripture relates that “the Lord afflicted Pharaoh with afflictions which were grievous and most severe.” For virtue could not dwell with a destroyer—for this is what Pharaoh means in our language.
