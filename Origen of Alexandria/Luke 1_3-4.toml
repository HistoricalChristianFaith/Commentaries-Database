“It seemed right for me, too, following the same course from the beginning.” He makes his point and repeats it. He did not learn from rumors what he is going to write. He himself has grasped it from the beginning. Hence, the apostle Paul praises him deservedly when he says, “He is praised for his Gospel throughout all the churches.” Scripture says this about no one else. It uses the expression only for Luke. “It seemed right for me, too, following the same course from the beginning, carefully to write down all those events for you in order, most excellent Theophilus.” Someone might think that Luke addressed the Gospel to a specific man named Theophilus. But, if you are the sort of people God can love, then all of you who hear us speaking are Theophiluses, and the Gospel is addressed to you. Anyone who is a Theophilus is both “excellent” and “very strong.” This is what the Greek word υεοφιλος [Theophilos] actually means. No Theophilus is weak. Scripture says of the people of Israel, when they were going out from Egypt, “There was no weakling in their tribes.” I could say boldly that everyone who is a Theophilus is robust. He has vigor and strength from both God and his Word. He can recognize the “truth” of those “words, by which he has been instructed” and understand the Word of the gospel in Christ—to whom is glory and power for ages of ages. Amen.
