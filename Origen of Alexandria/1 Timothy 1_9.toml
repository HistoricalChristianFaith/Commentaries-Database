If they who are weak and incapable of the deeper mystery are edified by the letter, let them understand that if “anyone neglects the teachings of the Lord and lies to his neighbor over a deposit, or by a partnership, or by robbery, he is declared guilty of a great sin. But let this be absent from the church of God.… For I say boldly concerning you that “you did not so learn Christ” nor “were you so taught.” Besides, the law itself does not teach these things to the saints and the faithful. Do you want to know that these are not said about the saints and the faithful? Hear the apostle when he distinguishes between them, “The law was not laid down for the just but for the unjust and for those not subject, for the wicked and the impure, for the father-killers and for the mother-killers,” and for those similar to these. Because, therefore, for such men as this the apostle says, “the law was imposed,” the church of God, having left behind the letter, is built up to greater holiness by the spirit, since heaven forbid that it would ever be polluted with such misdeeds.
