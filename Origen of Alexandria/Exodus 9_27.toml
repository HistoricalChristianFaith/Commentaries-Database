See whether it is for this reason that God hardens the heart of Pharaoh, so that at a moment when he was not hardened he could say, “The Lord is just: I and my people are wicked.” His heart has to be hardened further, and he has to suffer more, that he may not, because he has been freed of his hardheartedness too quickly, think too lightly of that hardheartedness and so may have to have his heart hardened over and over again.
