But let us see what this tree represents, under which Abraham stood and provided a meal for the Lord and the angels. “Under the tree of Mamre” the text says. Mamre in our language is translated “vision” or “sharpness of sight.” Do you see what kind of place it is where the Lord can have a meal? Abraham’s vision and sharpness of sight pleased the Lord. For he was pure in heart so that he could see God. In such a place, therefore, and in such a heart the Lord can have a meal with his angels. In fact, earlier prophets were called seers.
