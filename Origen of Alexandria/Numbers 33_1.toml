The one hand of Moses was not enough for going forth from Egypt, and the hand of Aaron was also needed. Moses stands for knowledge of the law; Aaron, for skill in making sacrifices and immolations to God. It is therefore necessary for us when we come forth from Egypt to have not only the knowledge of the law and of faith but also the fruits of works well pleasing to God.
