John’s preaching of repentance was not precisely the same as the preaching of Jesus, yet the Savior preaches in ways commensurable with John, for there is one God who sent them both. John first says “repent” in order to make ready a “people prepared” for God. Jesus, when he has received a people who have been made ready and who have already repented, does not merely say to them, “Repent.” For he does not preach in competition with the law and the prophets. When John had fulfilled the old covenant, Jesus “began to preach” the new, being himself the beginning of it. For this reason the words “he began” are not written of John, for he was an end. Moreover, the one preaches in the wilderness, the other in the midst of the people.

“The kingdom of heaven” is not in a place but in disposition. For it is “within” us. John preaches the coming of that kingdom of heaven, which Christ the King will deliver up “to God, even the Father.”
