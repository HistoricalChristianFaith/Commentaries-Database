But because occasionally the divine fire can be extinguished even in the saints and faithful, hear the apostle Paul warning these who were worthy to receive gifts of the Spirit and grace, and saying, “Do not extinguish the Spirit.” The Scripture says of Jacob, therefore, “And Jacob rekindled his spirit, and Israel said, ‘It is a great thing for me if my son Joseph is still living,’ ” as if he has experienced something like that which Paul warned against and has renewed himself through those words that had been spoken to him about Joseph’s life.But this also should be noticed, that he who “rekindled his spirit,” meaning, of course, that spirit which seemed almost extinguished, is said to be Jacob. But he who says, “It is a great thing for me if my son Joseph is living,” as if he understands and sees that the life which is in the spiritual Joseph is great, is no longer called Jacob but Israel, as it were, he who sees in his mind the true life which is Christ, the true God.
