And if “a wise man shall understand the words from his own mouth and shall hear knowledge on his lips,” we must either declare rashly that the prophets were not wise, if they have not understood “the words from their own mouth,” or admit that the prophets were wise, because they have received what is correct and true and have understood “the words from their own mouth” and borne knowledge on their lips. It is clear that Moses saw in his mind the truth of the law and the allegorical meanings related to the anagogical sense of the stories he recorded, and that Joshua understood the true distribution of land which took place after the overthrow of the twenty-nine kings, since he could see better than us that the things accomplished through himself were shadows of certain realities.
