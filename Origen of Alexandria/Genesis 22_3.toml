Abraham arose in the morning (because the text adds “in the morning,” perhaps it wished to show that the beginning of light shone in his heart), saddled his ass, prepared wood, took along his son. He does not deliberate, he does not reconsider, he does not take counsel with any man, but immediately he sets out on the journey.“And he came,” the text says, “to the place which the Lord had said to him, on the third day.” I omit now what mystery the “third day” contains. I consider the wisdom and intention of the one who tests him. Since everything was done in the mountains, was there thus no mountain nearby. But a journey is prolonged for three days, and during the whole three days the parent’s heart is tormented with recurring anxieties, so that the father might consider the son in this whole lengthy period, that he might partake of food with him, that the child might weigh in his father’s embraces for so many nights, might cling to his breast, might lie in his bosom? Behold to what an extent the test is heaped up.
