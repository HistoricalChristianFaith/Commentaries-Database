All in the church who are sinners, who “have tasted the word of God” and transgress it, justly merit punishment, but each will be tormented according to his position. A leader of the church who sins will undergo greater punishment. Does not the faithful catechumen deserve more indulgence than a leader? Is not the lay person more worthy of pardon than a deacon, and the latter, in turn, more worthy of understanding than a priest? And even if I do not describe them, you know the other scenarios. Fearing God’s judgment, then, and with my gaze always fixed on that series of judgments contained in the Scriptures, the phrase comes to mind, “Do not take on yourself a burden beyond your strength.” And the other, “Do not seek to be a judge if you are not capable of rooting out injustice.” What good would it be for me to sit on the cathedra, my head lifted high, receiving the homage of the great, but being unable to perform actions that are fully worthy of my charge? Would I not be afflicted by an even greater suffering because the honor due the just is given to me by all, though I am a sinner?
