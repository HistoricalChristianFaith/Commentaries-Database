We must also consider the words “as I live, says the Lord.” Perhaps living in the proper sense, especially on the basis of what has been said about living, occurs with God alone. And see if the apostle … considered the superiority of the life of God to be beyond comparison and understood the words “as I live says the Lord” in a manner worthy of God. Can [he] for this reason have said of God, “Who alone has immortality,” because none of the living beings with God has the life which is absolutely unchangeable and immutable? And why are we uncertain about the remaining beings, when not even the Christ had the Father’s immortality? For he tasted death for all.
