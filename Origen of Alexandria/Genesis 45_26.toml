I do not understand these words to have been said in the usual sense. For if, for example, we should assume that he could have been overcome with lust and sinned with his master’s wife, I do not think that this would have been announced about him by the patriarchs to his father Jacob: “Your son Joseph is living.” For if he had done this, without doubt he would not be living. For “the soul that sins, the same shall die.”23But Susanna also teaches the same things when she says, “I am straitened on every side. For if I do this thing—that is, if I sin—it is death to me; and if I do not do it, I shall not escape your hands.” Notice, therefore, that she too understood that there is death in sin.
But also the judgment revealed by God to the first man contains the same things when he says, “But on the day that you shall eat of it you shall die the death.” For as soon as he has transgressed the commandment, he is dead. For the soul that has sinned is dead, and the serpent, which said, “You shall not die the death,” is shown to have deceived him.
And these words have been about that which was said by the sons of Israel to Jacob: “Your son Joseph is living.”

But Jacob is excited not only about the fact that he has heard that “Joseph his son is living,” but also especially about that which has been announced to him that it is Joseph who holds “dominion over all Egypt.”For the fact that he has reduced Egypt to his rule is truly great to him. For to tread on lust, to flee luxury and to suppress and curb all the pleasures of the body, this is what it means to have “dominion over all Egypt.” And this is what is considered great and held in admiration by Israel.
But if there is someone who should subject at least some vices of the body but yield to others and be subject to them, it is not said correctly of him that he holds “dominion over the whole land of Egypt,” but, for example, he will appear to hold dominion over one, perhaps, or two or three cities. But Joseph, whom no bodily lust ruled, was prince and lord “of all Egypt.”
