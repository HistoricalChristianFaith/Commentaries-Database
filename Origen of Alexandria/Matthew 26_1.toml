Yet it is not all barely, but all these; for there were other sayings which He must speak before He should be delivered up.

He said not, After two days will be, or will come, the feast of the Passover, but not meaning the ordinary annual Passover, but that Passover such as had never before been, the Passover will be offered.

We know that the Father had set the hour of his Passion. For he said to his mother at one point, "My hour has not yet come." In another place, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! No, this is why I came to this hour." And elsewhere, "Father, the hour has come! Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you." Since the Father set the hour of his Son's Passion, he could not suffer anything from the time the devil had departed from him until his Passion.
