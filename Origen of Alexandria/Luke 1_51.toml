"To those who fear him he has shown strength in his arm." You may approach the Lord as a weak man. If you fear him, you will be able to hear the promise the Lord makes to you on account of your fear of him.…So, if you fear the Lord, he gives you courage or authority. He gives you the kingdom, so that you might be placed under the "king of kings" and possess the kingdom of heaven in Christ Jesus, to whom is glory and power for ages of ages. Amen.
