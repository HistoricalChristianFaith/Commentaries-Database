In sacred language God is called a fire. For instance, Scripture says, “Our God is a consuming fire.” It also speaks as follows concerning the substance of the angels when it says, “He makes his angels spirits and his ministers a burning fire.” In another place, “The angel of the Lord appeared in a flame of fire in the bush.” We have, moreover, received a commandment to be “fervent in spirit,” which undoubtedly means that the Word of God is hot and fiery. The prophet Jeremiah also hears from him who gave him his answer, “Behold, I have put my words into your mouth like a fire.” Since God, then, is a fire, and the angels a flame of fire and all the saints are fervent in spirit, so, on the contrary, those who have fallen away from the love of God are undoubtedly said to have cooled in their affection for him and to have become cold. For the Lord also says that “because iniquity has grown, the love of many will grow cold.”

We pray that words may be given us, as it is written in the book of Jeremiah that the Lord said to the prophet: “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth as fire. See, I have set you this day over the nations, and over the kingdoms, to root out and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, and to build and to plant.”
