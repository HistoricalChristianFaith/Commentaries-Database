“Written on their hearts” should not be taken too literally. What Paul calls the heart is the rational faculty of the soul.It is also necessary to discuss what Paul means by the word conscience. Is it something distinguishable from the heart or from the soul?… Conscience is the spirit which the apostle says is with the soul, according to which we have been instructed in the higher things. This spirit or conscience is linked to the soul as a teacher and guide to point out what things are best and to reprove and condemn faults. The apostle was speaking of it when he said: “What person knows a man’s thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him?”
