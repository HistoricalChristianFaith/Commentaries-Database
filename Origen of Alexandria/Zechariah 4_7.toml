On account of the height of the kingdom he calls Babylon a “mountain” which was “ruined” from idolatry and unjust works, through which it “destroyed” the others. And it also was the city on high because of the river nearby from which some stairs went up to the city, the city being in two parts and lying close to the river on each bank, with the walls also of the city being very high. And it mentioned a “hand,” the avenging power, the same power of his which destroyed something made from “rocks” for security and for watch. And due to the fire having “obliterated” its “stones,” they were useless, as there was not a stone to be put together for a firm building. And for the analogical meaning, the devil is named a “mountain,” as in the book of Zechariah: “Who are you, a great mountain before the face of Zerubbabel?” And concerning the one who has the “deaf and dumb” demon, the Savior said, “If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain: ‘Move away,’ and it will move away.” Thus the devil is a “mountain” which is “ruined” from his own evil and which “destroys” everyone to the extent they have their mind on what is earthly.
