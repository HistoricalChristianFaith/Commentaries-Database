Over the course of three months Zechariah kept receiving spiritual nourishment from the Holy Spirit. Although he did not realize it, he was being instructed. Then he prophesied about Christ and said, “He redeemed his people and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David,” because Christ was “descended from David according to the flesh.” He was truly “a horn of salvation in the house of David,” since the following passage reinforces it: “For a vineyard was planted on the horn-shaped ridge.” Which horn was it planted on? On Christ Jesus, of whom Scripture now says, “He raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David, as he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from of old.”
