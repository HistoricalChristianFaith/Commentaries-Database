Indeed, do you wish to know what the difference is between the priests of God and the priests of Pharaoh? Pharaoh grants lands to his priests. The Lord, on the other hand, does not grant his priests a portion in the land but says to them: “I am your portion.” You, therefore, who read these words, observe all the priests of the Lord and notice what difference there is between the priests, lest perhaps they who have a portion in the land and have time for earthly cares and pursuits may appear not so much to be priests of the Lord as priests of Pharaoh. For it is Pharaoh who wishes his priests to have possessions of lands and to work at the cultivation of the soil, not of the soul; to give attention to the fields and not to the law. But let us hear what Christ our Lord admonishes his priests: “He who has not renounced all he possesses,” he says, “cannot be my disciple.”33I tremble when I speak these words. For I myself am my own, I say, my own accuser first of all. I utter my own condemnations. For Christ denies that that person whom he has seen possessing anything and that one who does not “renounce all that he possesses” is his disciple. And what do we do? How do we, who not only do not renounce these things which we possess but also wish to acquire those things which we never had before we came to Christ, either read these words ourselves or explain them to people? For since conscience rebukes us, are we able to hide and not bring forth the words that are written? I do not wish to be guilty of a double crime. I admit, and I admit openly to the people who are listening, that these things are written, although I know that I have not yet fulfilled them. But warned from this, let us, at least, hasten to fulfill them, let us hasten to pass over from the priests of Pharaoh, who have an earthly possession, to the priests of the Lord, who have no portion in the earth, whose “portion” is “the Lord.”
