Now “every scribe who has been made a disciple to the kingdom of heaven is like a man that is a householder who brings forth out of his treasury things new and old.” Therefore, it clearly follows by “conversion of the proposition,” as it is called, that every one who does not bring forth out of his treasury things new and old is not a scribe who has been made a disciple for the kingdom of heaven. We must endeavor, therefore, in every way to gather in our heart, “by giving heed to reading, to exhortation, to teaching” and by “meditating in the law of the Lord day and night.” We must observe not only the new oracles of the Gospels and of the apostles and their revelation but also the old things in the law “which has the shadow of the good things to come” and in the prophets who prophesied in accordance with them.
