We also know that what was said of Abel, when he was slain by the wicked murderer Cain, is suitable for all whose blood has been shed wickedly. Let us suppose that the verse “The voice of your brother’s blood is crying to me from the ground” is said as well for each of the martyrs, the voice of whose blood cries to God from the ground.
