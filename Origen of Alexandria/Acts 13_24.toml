It must be said, on the one hand, that the Old [Testament] is not a Gospel since it did not show “the one coming” but announced him beforehand, and on the other that the entire New [Testament] is the gospel, speaking not just in a way similar to the beginning of the Gospel, “Behold, the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world,” but encompassing manifold praises and teachings of the one on whose account the Gospel is the gospel.
