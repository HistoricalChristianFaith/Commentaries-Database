One can use the spiritual sense of this text profitably against those who write malicious things against Christ. Concerning them Isaiah says, “Woe to those who write wickedness.” (I say that they who publish such things are speaking “iniquity in the highest.”) Some will use this text with a view toward those who, constructing a narrative gathered from pagan tongues, fill the sponge not with the word that is drinkable or with the wine which “gladdens the heart” or with the water of restoration but, on the contrary, with poisonous, undrinkable, unwise vinegar. They place this sponge on the reed of their writing and (as far as they are able) seem to offer a swallow of these diatribes for Jesus to drink. Others give Jesus “to drink of wine mixed with gall,” which Jesus the Son of God does not want. Others offer him vinegar instead of wine. Others offer him “wine mixed with gall” when they, having understood the doctrine of the church, live unworthily of it. Those who attribute to the lips of Christ doctrines that are alien to the truth turn the metaphor around. They fill the sponge with vinegar, place it on a reed and drink it themselves.
