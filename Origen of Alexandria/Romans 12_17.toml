If as some people think it is wrong to do evil but not wrong to repay it, it may be just but it is still a similar sin, or in my opinion, even a worse one. For the one who does evil to begin with may perhaps not realize that what he has done is wrong. But the one who repays evil and who is moved by thoughts of revenge has already admitted that he knew it was wrong to do it.â€¦ Note that the apostle does not tell us to do what is pleasing to everyone. But we should do what is right whether other people like it or not.
