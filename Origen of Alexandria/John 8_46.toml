Now, so far as the literal meaning is concerned, the text also involves the Savior’s boldness, since no man could say with the confidence that he had not sinned, “Which of you convicts me of sin?” It is only our Lord “who did not sin,” “who has been tempted in all things like as we are, without sin.” He is the only one able to address these words to all who have ever known him. Now, I understand the words “which of you” to be said not only to those present but also to the whole human race, as if we were to understand it to mean: Who of your race? Or, what sort of person will be able to convict me of sin? But be assured: there is no one.
