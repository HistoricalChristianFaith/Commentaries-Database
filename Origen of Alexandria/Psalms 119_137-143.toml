Do you want me to show you how the fire goes out from the words of the Holy Spirit and ignites the hearts of believers? Hear David speaking in the psalm: “The declaration of the Lord has set him on fire.” And again in the Gospel it was written, after the Lord spoke to Cleopas, “Was not our heart burning within us when he opened the Scriptures to us?” Whence will you burn? Whence will “the coals of fire” be bound in you who are never set on fire by the declaration of the Lord, never kindled by the words of the Holy Spirit?
