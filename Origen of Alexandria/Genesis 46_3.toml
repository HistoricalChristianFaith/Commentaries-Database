It appears fitting indeed after these things, to contemplate and look into what God says to Israel himself through the vision and how he sends him to Egypt strengthening and encouraging him as if he were setting out to some struggles. For he says, “Fear not to descend into Egypt.” This is to say, you shall contend “against principalities and powers and against the rulers of this world of this darkness”—which is figuratively called Egypt—fear not, be not afraid. But if also you wish to know the reason that you ought not fear, hear my promise: “For I will make a great nation of you there, and I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will recall you from there in the end.” He therefore with whom God shall go down into the struggles is not afraid “to go down into Egypt.” He is not afraid to approach the struggles of this world and the battles with resisting demons. For hear the apostle Paul saying, “I have labored more,” he says, “than all those, yet not I, but the grace of God with me.” But also when dissension had been stirred up against him in Jerusalem, and he performed a most brilliant struggle for the word and preaching of the Lord, the Lord stood by him and said the same things that now are said to Israel. “Fear not, Paul,” Scripture says, “for as you have testified of me in Jerusalem, so must you bear witness also at Rome.”
