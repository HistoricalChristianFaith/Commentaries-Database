Unquestionably, at the time when the early Israelites fell into sin, religion languished. Judah made for themselves “statues in Jerusalem,” as well as in that part that came to be called Israel, “in Samaria.” But even now, if one considers the mass of sinners taken together, it would not be hard to say that everyone who, serving sin, makes a god out of what seems good to him—making a statue, casting the work of an artisan, setting it up in secret—is under the curse. It is precisely in the secret of the heart that we fabricate many idols when we sin. Therefore the Word admonishes us to do penance and to “cry out in lamentation over the statues” and the idols that are “in Jerusalem and in Samaria.” Truly, if we who desire to be of the church commit sin, we fabricate “statues in Jerusalem.” If those who are outside of the church sin, as heretics, they make “idols in Samaria.” Nevertheless God, in conformity with his goodness, calls all to repentance, saying, “Cry out in lamentation, statues, in Jerusalem and in Samaria, since as I have acted toward Samaria and the works of their hands, so also will I act toward Jerusalem and its idols.” The threat will be carried out toward those who are in the church just as it was with the Samaritans.
