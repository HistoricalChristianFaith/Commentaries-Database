“God did not make death, and he does not delight in the death of the living. For he created all things that they might exist, and the generative forces of the world are wholesome, and there is no destructive poison in them. And the dominion of Hades is not on earth.” Then, a little further on in the text, it says, “But by the envy of the devil death entered the world.” If therefore God made everything for us in the best possible way, it is we who have caused evil and sins.
