They reflected on the death of Abraham and the prophets.… They had not, however, comprehended the life of Abraham and the prophets or that the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob was not their God as men who were dead but as men who were alive. … Therefore, although Abraham died, nevertheless he was alive32 and no longer saw death since he had seen the day of Jesus and rejoiced and was glad.…This is why our Savior said that “Abraham your father rejoiced that he might see my day, and he saw it and was glad”—to teach that Abraham was alive. But if someone prefers that the words about Abraham do not have this meaning, let him tell us whether he who once saw the day of our Savior … can see death after such a sight … or that one who was worthy of such a sight was later deprived of what he had seen.
Each of these assertions is absurd. For when Abraham saw the day of Jesus, at the same time he saw it he also heard his word and kept it; therefore he no longer sees death. And so, the Jews were also incorrect when they said, “Abraham died,” as if he were still among the dead.… The same is also true of the prophets.… They too kept the word of the Son of God when the word of the Lord came to Hosea, or Jeremiah or Isaiah; for no other Word of God came to any of these than he who was in the beginning with God, his Son, God the Word. Now if anyone has kept this word, the prophets certainly have.… Therefore, just as the Jews’ statement “Now we know that you have a demon” is false, so also is their statement “Abraham is dead, and the prophets.”
