“And I said, Perhaps they are poor since they have lost the capability, since they have not known the way of the Lord and the judgment of God. I will go to the strong, and I will speak to them.” Those who are strong in soul are objects of praise. This comes close to what the Greeks call the strength and the greatness of the rational soul. Thus, when anyone does something great and has worthwhile plans and always considers what is right and what must happen in order for him to live according to reason, without wanting to know anything abject and small, such a person has in the soul strength and greatness. But those others that the word disparaged at first since they were poor did not listen, the prophet says, they did not hear because they are poor, “I will go to the strong and I will speak to them,” and if it is true that the blessed are meant when it says “the ears of those who listen,” one is also blessed if he ever meets a strong and great listener. Therefore, after such things had been said in this way, knowing that with those who speak the damage is minor in comparison with those who although they listen do not receive admonition, seeing also that Jeremiah accused them of poverty of spirit and thoughts, let us ask to receive from God power and greatness as the word grows in us so that we are able to hear the sacred and holy words.
