Rebekah followed the servant and comes to Isaac. The church followed the prophetic word, to be sure, and comes to Christ. Where does she find him? “Walking,” the text says, “at the well of the oath.” On no occasion is one withdrawn from wells; on no occasion does one stand apart from waters. Rebekah is found “at a well.” Rebekah in turn finds Isaac “at a well.” There she gazed upon his countenance for the first time. There “she dismounted from the camels.” There she sees Isaac, who was pointed out to her by the servant.Do you think these are the only words related about wells? Jacob also goes to a well and finds Rachel there.… But also Moses finds Zipporah, the daughter of Reuel, at a well. …
She also “dismounts from the camels,” that is, she departs from vices; she casts off the irrational senses and is united with Isaac. For it is worthy that Isaac pass “from virtue to virtue.” He who is the son of virtue, that is, of Sarah, is now united and joined with patience, which is Rebekah. And this is to pass “from virtue to virtue” and “from faith to faith.” But let us come also to the Gospels. Let us see where the Lord seeks rest when he was “wearied from the journey.” “He came,” Scripture says, “to the well and sat upon it.”17
You see that everywhere the mysteries are in agreement. You see the patterns of the New and Old Testament to be harmonious. There one comes to the wells and the waters that brides may be found; and the church is united to Christ in the bath of water.
You see how great a heap of mysteries presses upon us. We cannot treat all the things that present themselves. These things at least ought to stimulate you to listen, to assemble. Even if we hurry over some things for the sake of brevity, you yourself even, when you read the text again and inquire into it, may dispel the mystery and discover … that the Word of God, finding you also at the waters, may take you up and unite you with himself, that you may be made “one spirit” with him in Christ Jesus our Lord. “To him belongs glory and sovereignty forever and ever. Amen.”
