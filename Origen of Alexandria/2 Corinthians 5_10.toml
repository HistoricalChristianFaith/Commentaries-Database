Why do we ourselves not believe that we all will stand “before the judgment seat of Christ so that each one may obtain the things proper to the body according to what he has done, whether good or evil”? If we would believe these things entirely, there would be applied to us what was written, “Redemption of a man’s soul is his wealth.” But how can we either know or believe or understand these things when we indeed do not come together to hear them? For who of you, when the Scriptures are read, really pays attention? God through the prophet threatens indeed in great anger, “I will send famine upon the earth; not a famine of bread or the thirst of water but a famine of hearing the word of God.” But now God has not sent “a famine” upon his church nor “a thirst to hear the word of God.” For we have “living bread which came down from heaven.” We have “living water springing up into eternal life.” Why in this time of fruitfulness do we destroy ourselves by famine and thirst? It is the mark of a lazy and lingering soul to suffer want in all this abundance.
