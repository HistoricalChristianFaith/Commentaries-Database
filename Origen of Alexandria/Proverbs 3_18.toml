I turn to the most wise Solomon as a witness when he said about wisdom, “The tree of life is for all who embrace it.” Therefore, if “wisdom is the tree of life,” without a doubt, there is another tree of prudence, another of knowledge and another of justice. For logically it is not said that only wisdom, of all the virtues, was worthy to be called “the tree of life” but that the other virtues by no means received names of a similar sort. Therefore, “the trees of the field will give their fruit.”

These things must be understood to be said figuratively; for Christ himself is called “the tree of life.” Just as by other things Christ is disclosed to be priest and victim and altar, and one understanding is not prevented by the other, and in their own passages each thing is perceived figuratively concerning him, so also now in the figures of mysteries a diversity of roles taken from one and the same thing will not get in our way.

It is just this needful bread that seems to me to be otherwise termed in Scripture a “tree of life.” If a person stretches his hand to it and takes of it, he will live forever. And under a third name this tree is termed “wisdom of God.” In Solomon’s words: “She is a tree of life to all that take hold of her, and to those that lean on her as on the Lord she is safe.
