If it is possible to prove that the sacred works are one book, but the non-sacred many, we must observe in addition that there is one book in the case of the living, from which those who deserve it are blotted out, as it is written, “Let them be blotted out of the book of the living.” [By contrast], a plurality of books is brought in the case of those who are reserved for judgment, for Daniel says, “The court convened, and the books were opened.” Moses also testifies to the singleness of the divine book, saying, “If you forgive the people’s sin, forgive; otherwise strike me out of the book that you have written.”
