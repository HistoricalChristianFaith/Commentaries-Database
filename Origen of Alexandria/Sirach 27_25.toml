Those who handed Jesus over were forsaken. The high priests ceased to exist, with no others coming after them. The scribes who condemned Jesus to death, their intelligence darkened and their minds blinded, were no longer able to see the meaning of the sacred text. All those who condemned Jesus to death were handed over to Christ’s enemy, death. Those who mocked him in turn became the object of mockery when “Jerusalem was surrounded by armies” and its desolation drew near. Those who scourged Jesus were themselves scourged and continue to be so, until “the fullness of the nations has come in.” In fact, “one who throws a rock in the air hits himself on the head.” And all of this happened so that God’s vigilance over them would cease and would be transferred to those who have been saved from among the nations, along with the “chosen remnant.” Indeed, “if the Lord of hosts had not left a remnant,” they would already be “like Sodom,” and they would have become like Gomorrah.
