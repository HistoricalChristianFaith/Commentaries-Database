Let us pay attention, just as Joshua says, so that we can prevail over the Canaanites, because if they prevail over us and hold us captive, they may turn us from Israelites to Canaanites, just as it happened to him who was won over by the enticements of the flesh, to which the prophet said, “Race of Canaan and not of Judah, beauty has seduced you.” Let it not happen to us, therefore, that we hear, “race of Canaan,” because “cursed is the son of Canaan; he will be a servant to his brothers.” May the Lord instead grant that we may be children of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, heirs according to the promise and brought forth from stones76 so that we may be children of Abraham, in Christ Jesus our Lord.
