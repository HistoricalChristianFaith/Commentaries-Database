After these things, then, Isaac dug a third well and “called the name of that place ‘Room-Enough,’ saying, ‘Now the Lord has given us room and has increased us on the earth.’ ” For truly now Isaac is given room and his name is increased on all the earth since he has fulfilled for us the knowledge of the Trinity. For then “God was known” only “in Judea” and his name was named in Israel, but now “their sound has gone forth into all the earth and their words into the ends of the world.” For the servants of Isaac going throughout the whole world have dug wells and have shown “the living water” to all, “baptizing all the nations in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” For “the earth is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof.”

But also each of us who serves the Word of God digs wells and seeks “living water,” from which he may renew his hearers. If, therefore, I too shall begin to discuss the words of the ancients and to seek in them a spiritual meaning, if I shall have attempted to remove the veil of the law and to show that the things which have been written are “allegorical,” I am indeed digging wells. But immediately the friends of the letter will stir up malicious charges against me and will lie in ambush for me. They will contrive immediately hostilities and persecutions, denying that the truth can stand except upon earth.But if we are servants of Isaac, let us love “wells of living water” and springs. Let us withdraw from those who are contentious and contrive malicious charges and leave them in the earth, which they love. But let us never cease digging “wells of living water.” And by discussing now indeed things that are old and again things that are new, let us become like that scribe in the Gospel, of whom the Lord said, “He brings forth from his treasures new things and old.”

So therefore the wells that Abraham dug, that is, the Scriptures of the Old Testament, have been filled with earth by the Philistines, or evil teachers, scribes and Pharisees, or even hostile powers; and their veins have been stopped up lest they provide a drink for these who are of Abraham. For that people cannot drink from the Scriptures but suffer a “thirst for the word of God” until Isaac should come and open them that his servants may drink. Thanks therefore to Christ, the son of Abraham—of whom it is written, “The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham”57—who has come and opened the wells for us. For he opened them for those men who said, “Was not our heart burning in us when he opened to us the Scriptures?” He opened therefore these wells and “called them,” the text says, “as his father Abraham had called them.” For he did not change the names of the wells.And it is astonishing that Moses is called Moses even among us, and each of the prophets is addressed by his own name. For Christ did not change the names in the Scriptures but the understanding. And he changes it there that now later we might not pay attention “to Jewish fables” and “endless genealogies,” because “they turn their hearing away from the truth indeed but are turned to fables.”
Christ opened therefore the wells and taught us, that we might not seek God in some one place but might know that “sacrifice is offered to his name in every land.” For it is now that time “when the true worshipers worship the Father” neither in Jerusalem nor on Mt. Gerazim “but in spirit and truth.” God therefore dwells neither in a place nor in a land, but he dwells in the heart. And if you are seeking the place of God, a pure heart is his place. For he says that he will dwell in this place when he says through the prophet, “I will dwell in them and walk in them; and they shall be my people, and I will be their God,” says the Lord.

Consider therefore that perhaps even in the soul of each of us there is “a well of living water,” there is a kind of heavenly perception and latent image of God, and the Philistines, that is, hostile powers, have filled this well with earth. With what kind of earth? With carnal perceptions and earthly thoughts, and for that reason “we have borne the image of the earthly.” At that time, therefore, when we were bearing “the image of the earthly,” the Philistines filled our wells. But now, since our Isaac has come, let us receive his advent and dig our wells. Let us cast the earth from them. Let us purge them from all filth and from all muddy and earthly thoughts, and let us discover in them that “living water” that the Lord mentions: “He who believes in me, from within him shall flow rivers of living water.” Behold how great the Lord’s liberality is: the Philistines filled our wells and hindered our small and trifling veins of water, and in place of these, springs and rivers are restored to us.If therefore you also hearing these words today should faithfully perceive what is said, Isaac would work also in you; he would cleanse your hearts from earthly perceptions. And seeing these mysteries that are so great to be lying hidden in the divine Scriptures, you progress in understanding, you progress in spiritual perceptions. You yourselves will also begin to be teachers, and “rivers of living water” will proceed from you. For the Word of God is present, and this now is his work, that he might remove the earth from the soul of each of you and open your spring. For he is within you and does not come from without, just as “also the kingdom of God is within you.”
