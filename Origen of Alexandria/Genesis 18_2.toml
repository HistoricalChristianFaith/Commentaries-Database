Let us compare, first of all, if you please, this appearance with that one which Lot experienced. “Three men” come to Abraham and stand “before him”; “two” come to Lot and sit “in the street.” See if, in the dispensation of the Holy Spirit, these events did not occur as each man deserved. For Lot was far inferior to Abraham. For if he had not been inferior, he would not have been separate from Abraham, nor would Abraham have said to him, “If you go to the right, I will go to the left; if you go to the left, I will go to the right.” And if he had not been inferior, the land and habitation of Sodom would not have pleased him.Three men, therefore, come to Abraham at midday; two come to Lot and in the evening. For Lot could not receive the magnitude of midday light, but Abraham was capable of receiving the full brightness of the light.
Let us see now how Abraham received those who came and how Lot did, and let us compare each man’s preparation of hospitality. First, however, observe that the Lord also was present with Abraham with two angels, but two angels alone proceed to Lot. And what do they say? “The Lord has sent us to consume the city and destroy it.” He therefore received those who would give destruction. He did not receive him who would save. But Abraham received him who saves and those who destroy.

But let us now, meanwhile, pursue what Abraham does with the three men who “stood before him.” Behold what sort of expression this is itself, that they come “before him,” not against him. He had, to be sure, subjected himself to the will of God; therefore God is said to stand “before him.”

Now let us see how each man receives his guests. “Abraham saw,” the text says, “and ran to meet them.” Notice that Abraham immediately is energetic and eager in his duties. He runs to meet them, and when he had met them, “he hastens back to the tent,” the text says, “and says to his wife: ‘Hasten to the tent.’ ” Behold in the individual matters how great is his eagerness to receive them. He makes haste in all things; all things are done urgently; nothing is done leisurely.
