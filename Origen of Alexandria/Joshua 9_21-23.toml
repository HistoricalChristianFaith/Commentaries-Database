Thus, therefore, you also, if you have brought a word in praise of God, not new and fresh from the learning of the spirit, from the doctrine of God’s grace, your mouth indeed offers “a sacrifice of praise,” but your mind is accused on account of the sterility of yesterday’s flesh. For the Lord did not delay and order the bread which he gave to the disciples to be reserved for the next day when he said to them, “Take and eat.” Perhaps there is something of this mystery in the fact that “he commands them not to carry bread on the way,” that you always bring fresh loaves of the word of God which you carry within you. For this reason, the Gibeonites are condemned, and they become “cutters of wood and carriers of water” because they had brought old bread to the Israelites whom the spiritual law ordered always to use fresh and new.

Of course, it must be observed that the heretics reading this passage, those who do not accept the Old Testament, are accustomed to make a malicious charge and say, “See how Jesus [Joshua] the son of Nun showed no human kindness, so that, although permitting salvation, he inflicted a mark of infamy and a yoke of servitude upon those men who had come to him in supplication.” If the soul less instructed in the divine Scriptures hears these things, it can in consequence be enfeebled and endangered, so that it may shun the catholic faith; for they do not understand their deceptions. For Jesus [Joshua] passed a fitting judgment upon them according to the measure of their own faith.Formerly Rahab the harlot, who believed with a sound faith with all her house and received the Israelite spies with fullest devotion, was received fully into the community and society of the people; and it is written of her that “she was attached to the sons of Israel until today.” But those who did not so much love the community of the Israelite clan as they were terrified by fear of their destruction approached Jesus [Joshua] with cunning and fraud. How could they deserve the liberty of life and the community of the kingdom in their slavish deceits?
Finally, do you wish to know that the condition was dispensed toward them by Jesus [Joshua] because the inferiority of their disposition was fitting for them? They themselves say, “We have heard how many things the Lord did for you.” through the midst of the Red Sea and in the desert. And although they said these things and confessed that they had both heard and known of the divine miracles, yet they produced nothing worthy in faith, nothing in admiration of such great powers. And therefore Jesus, when he sees the narrowness and smallness displayed in their faith, preserves a very just moderation towards them, so that they might merit salvation. Although they had brought a little faith, nevertheless they did not receive the highest rank of the kingdom or of freedom because their faith was not ennobled by the increase of works, since the apostle James declares, “faith without works is dead.”
