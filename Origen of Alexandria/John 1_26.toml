We must note that John’s baptism was inferior to Jesus’ baptism, which was given through his disciples. Those, therefore, in Acts who have been baptized into John’s baptism, who have not even heard that there was a Holy Spirit, are baptized a second time by the apostle. For the washing of regeneration did not come about at the hands of John but at the hands of Jesus through his disciples. And the so-called bath of rebirth takes place with the renewal of the Spirit, which even now is borne above the water, since it is from God. But it does not appear in everyone after the water.
