When Moses had seen the bush burning and not being consumed he was astonished at the sight and said, “I will cross over and see this sight.” He certainly also did not mean that he was about to cross over some earthly space, or to ascend mountains or to descend the steep sides of valleys. The vision was near him, in his countenance and in his eyes. But he says, “I will cross over,” that he might show that he, reminded forcefully by the heavenly vision, ought to ascend to a higher life and cross over to better things than those in which he was.
