“I will punish with the rod” your saints; “I will visit with a whip their sins.” Why? So that “I may not take my mercy from them.” For when he leaves someone, he no longer punishes or whips them, since he does not whip everyone, but “every son the Lord receives.”

Therefore, if this “jealous God” asks for you and wishes your soul to cleave to him, if he keeps you from sin, if he corrects and chastises you, if he is indignant, if he is angry and uses a kind of jealousy against you, know that this is your hope of salvation.… See the compassion and loyalty of the good God. When he wishes to have mercy, he says he is indignant and angry.
