But now, between the words “Take away the stone” and “therefore, they took away the stone,” the words of the dead man’s sister hindered the removal of the stone. And it would not have been taken away at all even later had not Jesus answered and said to her unbelief, “Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of God?” It is good, then, that nothing intervenes between Jesus’ command and the action enjoined by his bidding.
