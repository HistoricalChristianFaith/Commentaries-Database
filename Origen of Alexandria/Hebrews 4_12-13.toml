The mouth of the Son of God is a sharp sword because “the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword.” … The metaphor is especially appropriate, since he did not come to bring peace on earth—that is, on the things which are corporeal and perceived by the senses—but a sword. And since he cuts, so to speak, the harmful association of soul and body that the soul may give itself to the Spirit, which wars against the flesh, and become a friend of God. This is why, according to the prophetic word, he has a mouth which is a “sword” or “like a sharp sword.”

Jesus endured the cross, disregarding the shame, and therefore is seated at the right hand of God. And those who imitate him by disregarding the shame shall sit with him and rule in the heavens39 with him, who came not to bring peace upon the earth but upon the souls of his followers and to bring a sword upon the earth. Since “the Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart,” this word above all now bestows on our souls the prize of that peace which surpasses all understanding, which he left to his apostles. And it brings a sword between the earthly image and the heavenly in order that when he receives our heavenly image we may be made fully heavenly, if we are worthy not to be cut in two.
