Jesus at once speaks to him who had used the sword and cut off the servant’s right ear. He does not, however, say “withdraw your sword” but “return the sword into its place.” There is therefore some place for the sword from which it may be taken by one who does not want to perish, especially by the sword. For Jesus wants his disciples to be peaceful so that, laying aside this warlike sword, they may take another peaceful sword that Scripture calls “the sword of the Spirit.”
