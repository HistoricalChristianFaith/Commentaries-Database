If the soul, joined to the spirit and, so to speak, conjugally united with it, now turns to the pleasures of the body, bending its senses to carnal enjoyments, then seems to obey the salutary admonitions of the spirit, only to again yield to the vices of the flesh—such a soul, contaminated by the body’s adultery, cannot say that it would increase and multiply legitimately, because Scripture calls the children of adulterers imperfect. Such a soul, which sets aside its union with the Holy Spirit and entirely prostrates itself to the senses of the flesh and the desires of the body, shamelessly withdrawing from God, will hear the words, “Your face has become that of a prostitute, entirely without shame.” It will be punished like a prostitute, with the command that its children be readied for slaughter.
