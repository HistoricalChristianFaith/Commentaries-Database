No one standing still or directly approaching him blasphemes Jesus. "Those who passed by blasphemed him," and those who stayed behind plucked food from the vineyard wall demolished by God. Concerning this it is written, "Why then have you broken down its walls, so that those who pass along the way pluck its fruit?" Therefore, as long as one does not pass along the way or avoid it and can say to God while standing, "You have set 'my feet upon a rock,' " one does not blaspheme Jesus. But if one should fall or pass by or cross over or turn away, one blasphemes God. Likewise, those who have fallen into evil works and those who have abandoned the "everlasting statutes" and the way of the heavenly church "are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles."Now, if anyone should say that all heresies are "passing along" and turning away, that one will not be wrong. For this reason also those are held to be "passing along" and blaspheming Jesus who do not keep their head steady but are "wagging" it up and down. For they are not wise, nor do they have their eyes in their head where they belong, as we read in Ecclesiastes: "The wise man has his eyes in his head." Therefore those who pass by and turn away have need to blaspheme Jesus the Son of God, for "no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says 'Jesus be cursed.' "59
