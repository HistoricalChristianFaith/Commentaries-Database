I certainly think that whenever “Moses is read” to us and through the grace of the Lord “the veil of the letter is removed.” and we begin to understand that “the law is spiritual,” then the Lord Jesus reads that law to us.… The law, which Paul names “spiritual,” is thus understood and Jesus himself is the one who recites these things in the ears of all the people, admonishing us that we not follow “the letter that kills” but that we hold fast “the life-giving spirit.”24Therefore, Jesus reads the law to us when he reveals the secret things of the law. For we who are of the catholic church do not reject the law of Moses, but we accept it if Jesus reads it to us. For thus we shall be able to understand the law correctly, if Jesus reads it to us, so that when he reads we may grasp his mind and understanding. Therefore, should we not think that he had understood this mind who said, “And we have the mind of Christ, so that we may know those things that have been given to us by God, those things that also we speak”? Also, those who were saying, “Was not our heart burning within us, when he laid bare the Scriptures to us along the way?” when “beginning from the law of Moses up to the prophets he read all things to us and revealed those things that were written concerning him”?
