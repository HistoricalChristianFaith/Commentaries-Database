They appear to have replied as if they had understood the statement about who their father was in a much lowlier manner than the Lord meant it. For Jesus was referring to God when he declared, “And you, therefore, do the things that you have heard from the Father.” They, however, make a humbler assertion about the father of their own nation when they say, “Abraham is our father.”

It is clear, however, that the Savior refutes this too as a false statement by his reply, “If you are the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham.”

Those who fasten on to one of Abraham’s works, such as the statement “Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him for justice,” think that this is what is referred to in the command, “Do the works of Abraham.” Even if it is conceded to them that faith is a work (which would not be conceded by those who accept the saying, “Faith without works is dead,” as authoritative, nor by those who understand that to be justified by faith differs from being justified by works of law), then let them explain why it was not said in the singular, “If you are children of Abraham, do the work of Abraham.” Rather, it is said in the plural, “Do the works of Abraham.” This is equivalent, I think, to saying, “Do all the works of Abraham.”
