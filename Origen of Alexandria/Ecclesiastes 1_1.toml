But we can also investigate these things before we even come to the very body of the book, such as why Solomon, who seems to have served the will of the Holy Spirit in those three books is called in Proverbs “Solomon, the Son of David, who ruled in Israel,” but in the second book “Solomon” is not written, but it reads, “the words of Ecclesiastes, the son of David, king of Israel in Jerusalem.” To be sure he writes that he is “Son of David” just as in the first book and also “king of Israel.” But there he wrote “Proverbs” but here “words” and called himself “Ecclesiastes,” when he had called himself “Solomon” there. And although there he mentioned only the country over which he reigned, here he both mentioned the nation and designated the place of his kingdom as “Jerusalem.” …I do not think that anyone can doubt that Solomon in rather many respects bears the type of Christ, either because he is named “Man of Peace” or because “the Queen of the South came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon.” This is also the case because he is called “the son of David” and reigns in Israel and because he rules over those kings, on whose behalf he himself is called “king of kings.” And again the true “Ecclesiastes” is that very one “who although he was in the form of God, humbled himself, taking on the form of a servant” in order to gather an ecclesial body, for Ecclesiastes is called from his gathering a congregation.…
Therefore in the first book of Proverbs, when he sets us in moral disciplines, he is said to be “king in Israel” but not yet in Jerusalem because, although we are said to be Israel because of our faith, we nonetheless have not yet arrived to this point so that we seem to have come to the heavenly Jerusalem. But when we will have made progress and will have arrived there so that we will share in the church of the firstborn, which is in heaven, and we know from the ancient and natural reasons we have discussed that the heavenly Jerusalem is our heavenly mother, then already Christ himself will be made our “Ecclesiastes” and will be said to reign not only “in Israel” but also “in Jerusalem.”
