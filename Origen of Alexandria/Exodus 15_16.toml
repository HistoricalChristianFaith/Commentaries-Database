God is asked that for a short while the Gentiles might be changed into stones—that is what the Greek word apolithōthētōsan really means—”until the Jewish people passes through.” There is no doubt but that after they have passed through, the Gentiles will cease to be stone and will receive in place of their hard hearts a human and rational nature in Christ, to whom is glory and power for ages of ages. Amen.
