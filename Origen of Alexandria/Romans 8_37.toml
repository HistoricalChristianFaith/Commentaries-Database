As long as we rely on God’s love, we suffer no feeling of pain. For his love, by which he loved us and drew us to him, makes us not feel the pain and crucifixion of the body. In all these things we are more than conquerors. The bride in the Song of Songs says something similar: “I am wounded with love.” In the same way our soul, once it has received Christ’s wound of love, will not feel the wounds of the flesh, even if it gives the body over to the sword.
