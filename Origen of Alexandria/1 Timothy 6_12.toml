For the angels, as it were, have charge over our souls, to whom “while we are still children we are committed,” as it were, “to tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.” And they, therefore, now say about the progress of each of us, “Now I know that you fear God.” Suppose, for example, I intend to be a martyr. An angel could not say to me on this basis, “Now I know that you fear God,” for an intention of the mind is known to God alone. But if I shall undertake the struggles, if I shall utter a “good confession,” if I shall bear calmly all things which are inflicted. Then an angel can say, as if confirming and strengthening me, “Now I know that you fear God.”
