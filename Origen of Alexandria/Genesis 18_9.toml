What then does the Lord say to Abraham? “Where,” the text reads, “is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “Lo, she is in the tent.” But the Lord said, “I will certainly come to you at this time in due season, and Sarah your wife will have a son.” But Sarah, standing behind the door of the tent behind Abraham, heard.Let the wives learn from the examples of the patriarchs; let the wives learn, I say, to follow their husbands. For not without cause is it written that “Sarah was standing behind Abraham,” but that it might be shown that if the husband leads the way to the Lord, the wife ought to follow. I mean that the wife ought to follow if she sees her husband standing by God.…
But we can also perceive something mystical in this passage if we see how in Exodus “God went before them by night in a pillar of fire and by day in a pillar of a cloud” and the congregation of the Lord followed behind him.
So therefore I understand also Sarah to have followed or stood “behind Abraham.”
What is said next? “And they were both,” the text says, “presbyters”—that is, old—“and far advanced in their days.”
So far as pertains to bodily age, many before them lived for more numerous years, but no one was called presbyter. It appears that this title is ascribed to the saints not by reason of longevity but of maturity.
