What, therefore, does the web of all this mystical history show us? The woman Jael, that foreigner about whom Deborah’s prophecy said that victory would be had “through the hand of a woman,” symbolizes the church, which was assembled from foreign nations. But Jael’s name means “ascent,” for truly there is no route whereby one may ascend into heaven except “through the church of the manifold wisdom of God.” She, therefore, while ascending from the corporeal to the spiritual and from the earthly to the heavenly, killed Sisera, who, as we have already said above, symbolizes the man of carnal or animal vices, for Sisera’s name means “vision of a horse,” concerning which Scripture teaches: “Do not become like horses and mules, in which there is no understanding.” She killed him with a stake, then, which is to say that she overthrew him by the power and cunning of the wood of the cross. Nor is it without reason that the stake is described as having pierced his jaws, for that mouth which spoke of carnal things and that doctrine which preferred the glory of the flesh, deceiving and persuading the human race, by secular wisdom and by the idolatry of comfort, to live for selfish delights and pleasure, that very mouth, I say, is pierced and penetrated by the wood of the cross, in as much as the “broad and easy way” of pleasure which is preached by philosophy has been exposed by Christ, who showed that the “way of our salvation is narrow and difficult.” [Thus], Jael the church sent Sisera the king of vices to his everlasting sleep covered with skins, that is, lulled to sleep by the mortification of his members.
