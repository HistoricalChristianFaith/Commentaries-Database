But just as the doctrine of providence is not at all weakened because of those things which are not understood by those who have once honestly accepted it, so neither is the divine character of Scripture, which extends to the whole of it, lost because our weakness cannot discover in every expression the hidden splendor of the doctrines concealed in common and unattractive style. For “we have the treasure in earthen vessels, that the exceeding greatness of the power of God may shine forth” and may not be reckoned as coming from us who are but human beings.… Therefore, since a celestial or even a supercelestial power compels us to worship the only Creator, let us leave the doctrine of the beginning of Christ, i.e., the elements, and “endeavor to go on to perfection,” in order that the wisdom spoken to the perfect may be spoken also to us.
