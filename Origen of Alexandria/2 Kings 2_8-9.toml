We must note in addition that when Elijah was about to be taken up in a whirlwind as into heaven, he took his sheepskin and rolled it up and struck the water, and it was divided on this side and that, and both crossed, that is to say, himself and Elisha. He was better prepared to be taken up after he was baptized in the Jordan, since Paul, as we explained previously, called the more incredible passage through water a baptism. It is because of this same Jordan that Elisha is capable of receiving the gift that he has desired through Elijah, for he said, “Let a double portion come on me in your spirit.” Perhaps he received the gift in the spirit of Elijah in a double measure on himself because he crossed the Jordan twice, once with Elijah, and a second time when he took the sheepskin of Elijah and struck the water and said, “Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah? And he struck the waters, and they divided on this side and that.”
