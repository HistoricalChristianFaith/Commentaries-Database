It seems to me the words “the people hastened to cross” were not added idly by the Holy Spirit. For this reason, I also think that when we come to baptism for salvation and receive the sacraments of the Word of God, we should not do it idly or negligently, but we should hurriedly press on all the way until we cross over everything.For to cross over everything is to accomplish all the things that are commanded. Therefore let us hasten to cross, that is, to fulfill at the beginning, what is written: “Blessed are the poor in spirit.” Then, when we have set aside all arrogance and taken up the humility of Christ, we may deserve to attain the blessed promise.
Yet even when we have accomplished this, we must not stand still or loiter but cross over the other things that follow, so that “we may hunger and thirst after righteousness.” We must also cross over that which follows so that in this world “we may mourn.” Then we must quickly cross the remaining things so that we may be made “meek” and remain “peaceable” and thus be able to hear as “sons of God.” Also we must hasten so that we may pass through the burden of persecution with the virtue of patience. Whenever we seek earnestly and swiftly—not slowly and languidly—those individual things that pertain to the glory of virtue, this, it seems to me, is “to cross over the Jordan with haste.”
