By the disposition of the universe you find an angel appointed for the earth and another appointed for the waters, another appointed for the air and a fourth appointed for fire. Arise, then—I beg of you—with your reason, and consider the disposition of the animals, the plants and the stars of heaven. There is an angel appointed for the sun, another of the moon and others of the stars. These angels, who accompany us during our time on earth, either rejoice or mourn over us when we sin. “Grieve,” it says, “over the earth because of its inhabitants.” It calls the angel for the earth using the same name as the earth itself, “earth,” as when it says, “The work of human hands and the one who has done it are accursed.” It is not that the inanimate thing itself is accursed, but what resides in the inanimate statue is indicated by the expression “human hands,” and from this it receives its name. In this way I would say that the angel appointed for the earth is designated also by the name “earth,” and the angel appointed for the water is designated by the name “water,” as when it is said, “The waters saw you, O God, the waters saw you and feared. The abyss trembled, a great crash of waters, and the clouds sent out their voice. Behold, your arrows pass.”
