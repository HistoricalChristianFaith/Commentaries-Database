Mark took two prophecies spoken in different places by two prophets and conflated them into one, so as to declare: “As it is written in Isaiah the Prophet …” “The voice of one crying in the wilderness,” which is indeed recorded immediately after the narrative about Hezekiah’s recovery from his sickness. This is then conflated with “Behold I send my messenger to prepare the way before me,” from Malachi. Both John and Mark compress in various ways the quotation from Isaiah, Mark by reading “His paths” for “the paths of our God” and by omitting “before me.”
