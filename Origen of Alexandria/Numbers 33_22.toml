From it they come to Macelath [Kehelathah], which is “sovereignty” or “staff.” Power seems to be meant by both and that the soul has progressed so far as to rule over the body and to obtain by that the staff of power. Indeed, it is power not only over the body but also over the whole world that Paul means when he says, “By the cross the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.”
