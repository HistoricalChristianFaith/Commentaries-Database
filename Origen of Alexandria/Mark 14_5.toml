The traitor Judas, who in appearance championed the cause of the poor, said with indignation, “This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and the money given to the poor.” But in reality he “was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it.” If, then, any one in our time who has the money box of the church speaks like Judas as if speaking for the poor, but steals what is placed there, let there be assigned to him the same portion along with Judas.
