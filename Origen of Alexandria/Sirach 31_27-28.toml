“Bring me into the wine cellar.” The Bridegroom had stopped outside and was welcomed by the bride. Truly he had rested on her bosom. Many young maidens are not such as to be worthy of having the Bridegroom as their guest: “to the crowds” outside, he “speaks in parables.” How I fear that many of us are maidens! “Bring me into the wine cellar.” Why do I wait outside for so long? “See, I stand at the door and knock. If someone opens to me, I will come in to him, and sup with him, and he with me.” “Bring me in.” Even now the divine Word says the same words: see that the Christ says, “Let me in.” He speaks also to you, catechumens, “Let me in,” not simply into the house but “into the wine cellar,” that your soul might be filled with the “wine of delight,” the wine of the Holy Spirit. Thus, “bring into” your “house” the Bridegroom, the Word, Wisdom, the Truth. Thus it can also be said of those who are not yet perfect, “Bring me into the wine cellar.”
