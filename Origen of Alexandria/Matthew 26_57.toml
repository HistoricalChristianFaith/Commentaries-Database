I believe the word for Jewish slavery whereby poor and abandoned persons now profess to be slaves is "Caiaphas." He is known as the high priest who, at odds with the truth, rails against Jesus. But Jesus according to the truth is a priest, the Word of God; under him are established all who worthily and zealously serve God the Father. Where the high priest Caiaphas is found, however, there the scribes come together, that is, learned men who preside over the perishing written word. While being scribes, they are also elders who preside not over the truth but over the classic usage of a mere word. They are unwilling to consider anything beyond that.

Where Caiaphas the High Priest is, there are assembled the Scribes, that is, the men of the letter, who preside over the letter that killeth; and Elders, not in truth, but in the obsolete ancientness of the letter.
