From what ancient Scripture is Paul drawing when he speaks of “the spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places?” My conjecture is that it comes out of the narratives written in Israel about wars and particular combats, like those of David and Goliath, and about the battles of the children of Israel against their enemies.… In each of these narratives there is some implication of the vanquishing and overcoming of demonic spiritual powers.

Some spiritual creatures have sinned in heaven. It is against these that we now struggle, “against the spirits of iniquity in high places.” They first sinned in heaven. Now they are doing it again on earth.
