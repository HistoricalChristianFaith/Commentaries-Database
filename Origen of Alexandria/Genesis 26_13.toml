Isaac was insignificant in the law, but with the passing of time he becomes great. He becomes great, with the passing of time, in the prophets. For while he is in the law alone he is not yet great, since indeed it too is covered with a veil. He grows, therefore, now in the prophets; but when he has arrived at this point that also he may cast aside the veil, then he will be “very great.” When the letter of the law has begun to be separated like the chaff of its barley and it has appeared that “the law is spiritual,” then Isaac will be magnified and will become “very great.”For notice that also the Lord in the Gospels breaks a few loaves, and notice how many thousand people he refreshes “and how many baskets” of leftovers remain. While the loaves are whole, no one is filled, no one is refreshed, nor do the loaves themselves appear to be increased. Now consider, therefore, how we break a few loaves: we take up a few words from the divine Scriptures and how many thousand men are filled. But unless those loaves have been broken, unless they have been crumbled into pieces by the disciples, that is, unless the letter has been discussed and broken in little pieces, its meaning cannot reach everyone. But when we have begun to investigate and discuss each single matter, then the crowds indeed will assimilate as much as they shall be able. But what they haven’t been able to digest should be gathered and preserved, “lest anything be lost.”9
We also, therefore, preserve whatever the “crowds” cannot receive and gather it into baskets and hampers.… Let us see what fragments we have diligently collected lest they be lost, and what we are preserving in baskets until the Lord command what also should become of them.

But now, as much as possible, let us either eat of the bread or draw water from the wells. Let us attempt to do also that which wisdom admonishes, saying, “Drink the waters of your own springs and wells, and let your spring be your own.”Therefore you also attempt, O hearer, to have your own well and your own spring, so that you too, when you take up a book of the Scriptures, may begin even from your own understanding to bring forth some meaning, and in accordance with those things which you have learned in the church, you too attempt to drink from the fountain of your own abilities. You have the nature of “living water” within you. There are within you perennial veins and streams flowing with rational understanding, if only they have not been filled with earth and rubbish. But get busy to dig out your earth and to clean out the filth, that is, to remove the idleness of your natural ability and to cast out the inactivity of your heart. For hear what the Scripture says: “Prick the eye, and it will bring forth a tear; prick the heart, and it brings forth understanding.”

Do you want to know how “grow” should be understood? Listen to what Isaac did. Scripture says of him, “Isaac progressed and became greater, until he became great, and very much so.” His will always tended toward the better and kept making progress. His mind kept contemplating something more divine, and he kept exercising his memory, to store up more in his treasure house and retain it more securely. So this is the way it came about. Isaac cultivated all his virtues in the field of his soul, and thus he fulfilled the command that ordered him to “grow.”
