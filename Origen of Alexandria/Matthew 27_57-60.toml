“He wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and put it in a new tomb” where no one was buried, thus preserving the body of Jesus for its glorious resurrection. But I think that this shroud was much cleaner from the time it was used to cover Christ’s body than it ever had been before. For the body of Jesus retained its own integrity, even in death, so that it cleansed everything it touched and renewed even the new tomb which had been cut from rock.

We say, therefore (lest this passage be understood crudely), that he who said “we were buried with Christ through baptism” and we have risen with him is himself buried after Christ and with Christ in the new, spiritual tomb cut from rock. Furthermore, all who are buried with Christ in baptism, so that they may also rise with him from the new tomb, belong to the “firstborn from the dead who holds primacy in all things.” Joseph did not roll many stones over the entrance to the tomb but only one “great” stone. [This stone] was greater than the power of those who lay in wait but not greater than the power of the angels who descended from heaven and removed the stone and sat on it. For all things which surround the body of Jesus are thereby clean and new and not simply “great” but surpassingly great.
