The power of God the Father and God the Son is at work in the whole of creation. The saints are those who are fully receiving life in the Holy Spirit. Accordingly it is said, “No man can say that Jesus is the Lord except in the Holy Spirit.” However unworthy the apostles might have been, they were told: “You shall receive power when the Holy Spirit is come upon you.” This is what is referred to by the phrase, “he who has sinned against the Son of Man is worthy of forgiveness.” Even if one at times ceases to live according to this divine word, even if one falls into ignorance or folly, the way is not blocked to true penitence and forgiveness. But one who has once been counted worthy to share in life in the Holy Spirit and then finally turns back again in apostasy is by this very act and deed said to have blasphemed against the Holy Spirit.
