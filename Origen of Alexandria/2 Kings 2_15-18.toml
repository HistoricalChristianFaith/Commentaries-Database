I have thought it necessary to dwell some time on the examination of the doctrine of transmigration, because of the suspicion of some who suppose that the soul under consideration was the same in Elijah and in John, being called in the former case Elijah and in the second case John; and that, not apart from God, had he been called John, as is plain from the saying of the angel who appeared to Zacharias, “Fear not, Zacharias, for your supplication is heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear you a son, and you shall call his name John”; and from the fact that Zacharias regained his speech after he had written in the tablet, that he who had been born should be called John.” But if it were the soul of Elijah, then, when he was begotten a second time, he should have been called Elijah; or for the change of name some reason should have been assigned, as in the case of Abram and Abraham, Sarah and Sarai, Jacob and Israel, Simon and Peter. And yet not even thus would their argument in the case be tenable; for … the changes of name took place in one and the same life. But someone might ask, if the soul of Elijah was not first in the Tishbite and second in John, what might that be in both which the Savior called Elijah? And I say that Gabriel in his words to Zacharias suggested what the substance was in Elijah and John that was the same; for he says, “Many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God; and he shall go before his face in the spirit and power of Elijah.” For, observe, he did not say in the soul of Elijah, in which case the doctrine might have some ground, but “in the spirit and power of Elijah.” For the Scripture well knows the distinction spirit and soul, as, “May God sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ”;4 and the passage, “Bless the Lord, you spirits and souls of the righteous” as it stands in the book of Daniel, according to the Septuagint, represents the difference between spirit and soul. Elijah, therefore, was not called John because of the soul but because of the spirit and the power, which in no way conflicts with the teaching of the church, though they were formerly in Elijah and afterwards in John; and “the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,” but the souls of the prophets are not subject to the prophets, and “the spirit of Elijah rested on Elisha.”
