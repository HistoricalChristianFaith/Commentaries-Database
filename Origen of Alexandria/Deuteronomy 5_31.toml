[Celsus] continues by making further remarks as if they were what we should agree to, although none of those Christians who have any intelligence would agree to them. Not one of us says that “God participates in shape or color.” Nor does he “partake of movement”; because it is his nature to be established and firm, he calls the righteous man to imitate him in this respect when he says, “But as for you, stand with me.” If, however, some texts suggest that there is movement of some sort on his part, as for example that which says “They heard the Lord God walking in the garden in the evening,” we should understand such sayings in the sense that God is regarded as being moved by those who have sinned. Or we should interpret such texts in the same way as we do when there is a figurative reference to God’s sleep or his anger or anything of this sort.
