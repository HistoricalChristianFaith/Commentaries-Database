But meanwhile Jesus [Joshua] destroyed the enemies, not teaching cruelty through this, as the heretics think, but representing the future sacraments in these affairs, so that when Jesus destroys those kings who maintain a reign of sin in us, we can fulfill that which the apostle said, “Just as we presented our members to serve iniquity for iniquity, so now let us present our members to serve righteousness for sanctification.”What is it then that is condemned by them in this place as cruelty? It is this, it says, that is written, “Set your feet upon their necks and slay them.” But this is discovered to be humaneness and kindness, not cruelty, is it not?
Would that you might be the sort of person who can “set your feet upon serpents and scorpions and upon every hostile power” and “tread underfoot the dragon and the lizard,” the petty king who once reigned in you and maintained in you a kingdom of sin. Thus, with all those destroyed who used to rule in you by the work of sin, Christ Jesus our Lord alone will reign in you, “to whom is the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen!”
