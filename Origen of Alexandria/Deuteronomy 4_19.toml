It is clear then that since those who live according to the law reverence the One who made the heaven, they do not reverence the heaven as if God. Furthermore, none of those who serve the Mosaic law worship the angels in heaven. And in the same way that they do not worship the sun, moon, and stars and “the world of heaven.” They avoid worshiping heaven as such or the angels in it.

It is quite likely that the enemy will want to induce us by every possible trick down to “the sun and the moon and all the host of heaven.” But we shall reply that the Word of God did not command us to do so. For in no way may we bow down to the creature in the presence of the Creator8 who sustains all and anticipates their prayer. Not even the sun would wish that any friend of God or anyone else, it would seem, should bow down to it. It imitates him who says, “Why do you call me good? None is good but one, that is God” the Father.
