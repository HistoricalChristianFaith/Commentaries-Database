Behold the Lord’s greatness. “The sound of his teaching has gone out into every land.” Our Lord Jesus has been spread out to the whole world, because he is God’s power.… The power of the Lord and Savior is with those who are in Britain, separated from our world, and with those who are in Mauretania and with everyone under the sun who has believed in his name. Behold the Savior’s greatness. It extends to all the world.
