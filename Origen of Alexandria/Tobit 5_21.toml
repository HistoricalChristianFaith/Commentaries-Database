There is no other second goodness existing in the Son, except that which is in the Father. And therefore the Savior also rightly says in the Gospel, “There is none good except one only, God the Father.” With such an expression it may be understood that the Son is not of a different goodness but of that only that exists in the Father. He is rightly termed the image of the Father19 because he proceeds from no other source but from that primal goodness. Otherwise there might appear to be in the Son a different goodness from that which is in the Father. Nor is there any dissimilarity or difference of goodness in the Son. Therefore, no one should imagine that there is a kind of blasphemy, as it were, in the words, “There is none good except one only, God the Father,” as if someone thinks this denies that either the Son or the Holy Spirit is good. However, as we have already said, the primal goodness is to be understood as residing in God the Father, from whom both the Son is born and the Holy Spirit proceeds, retaining within them, without any doubt, the nature of that goodness that is in the source from which they are derived. And if there is anything else in Scripture that is called good (angels, human beings, servants, treasure, or a good heart or a good tree27), the word good is not used with its proper meaning, since these uses refer to outward goodness, not an essential goodness.
