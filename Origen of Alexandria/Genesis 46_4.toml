But I think a still greater mystery lies hidden in this passage. For this statement disturbs me: “I will make a great nation of you, and I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will recall you from there in the end.” Who is it who is made “into a great nation” in Egypt and is recalled “in the end”? To the extent that it pertains to that Jacob of whom one supposes it to be said, it will not appear true. For he was not recalled from Egypt “in the end,” since he died in Egypt. But it will be absurd if someone says Jacob was recalled by God in that his body was carried back. But if it is accepted, it will not be true that “God is not the God of the dead but of the living.” It is not proper, therefore, that these words be understood of a dead body but that they apply to the living and vigorous.Let us consider therefore whether there may be depicted in this statement a figure of the Lord who descends into this world and is made “into a great nation,” that is, the church of the Gentiles, and after all things were completed, returned to the Father. Or, whether it is a figure of “the first-formed man” who descends to the struggles of this world after he was cast out of the delights of paradise. The struggle with the serpent was set before him when it is said, “You shall watch for his head, and he shall watch for your heel,” and again, when it is said to the woman, “I will put enmity between you and him, and between your seed and his seed.”
Nevertheless God does not desert those placed in this struggle but is always with them. He is pleased with Abel; he reproaches Cain; he is present with Enoch, when he is invoked. He commands Noah to construct an ark of salvation in the flood; he leads Abraham “from the house of his father” and “from his kinsmen”;17 he blesses Isaac and Jacob; he leads the sons of Israel out of Egypt. He writes the law of the letter through Moses. He completes what was lacking through the prophets. This is what it means to be with them in Egypt.
But regarding the statement “I will recall you from there in the end,” I think this means, as we said above, that at the end of the ages his only-begotten Son descended even into the nether regions21 for the salvation of the world and recalled “the first-formed man” from there. For what he said to the thief, “This day you shall be with me in paradise,” understand not to have been said to him alone but also to all the saints for whom he had descended into the nether regions. In this man, therefore, more truly than in Jacob the words “I will recall you from there in the end” will be fulfilled.

But each of us also, in the same manner and in the same way, enters Egypt and struggles and, if he is worthy that God should always remain with him, he will make him “into a great nation.” For the number of virtues and the multitude of righteousness in which all the saints are said to be multiplied and to increase is a great nation.That which is said is also fulfilled in the saint: “I will recall you from there in the end.” For the end is considered to be the perfection of things and the consummation of virtues. Indeed, for this reason also another saint said, “Recall me not in the midst of my days.” And again the Scripture bestows testimony on the great patriarch Abraham since “Abraham died full of days.” This statement, therefore, “I will recall you from there in the end,” is as if he had said, Since “you have fought a good fight, you have kept the faith, you have finished the course,” I will now recall you from this world to the future blessing, to the perfection of eternal life, to “the crown of justice which the Lord will give in the end of the ages to all who love him.”

But let us see how also the statement after that should be understood: “And Joseph shall put his hands upon your eyes.” I think many mysteries indeed of secret understanding are hidden within the veil of this statement. It belongs to another time to approach and touch upon these mysteries. Now, meanwhile, it will not appear to be said without reason, since it has appeared also to some of our predecessors that a certain prophecy seemed to be designated in this statement. Since indeed that Jeroboam who made two golden calves that he might seduce the people to worship them was from the tribe of Joseph, by this he blinded and closed the eyes of Israel, as if his hands were placed on them, lest they see their impiety, of which it is said, “Because of the impiety of Jacob are all these things, and because of the sin of the house of Israel. But what is the impiety of Jacob? Is it not Samaria?”32But if someone perhaps asserts that those things that are said by God about a future form of piety ought not be turned to a censurable function, we will say that just as the true Joseph, our Lord and Savior, put his physical hand on the eyes of the blind man and restored his sight that he had lost, so also he put his spiritual hands on the eyes of the law, which had been blinded by the corporeal understanding of the scribes and Pharisees. He restored sight to them, that to these to whom the Lord has opened the Scriptures spiritual vision and understanding might appear in the law.
And would that the Lord Jesus might put “his hands on” our “eyes” too, that we too might begin to look not at those things “which are seen but at the things which are not seen.” And would that he might open for us those eyes which contemplate not present things but future, and might reveal to us the aspect of the heart by which God is seen in spirit, through the Lord Jesus Christ himself, to whom belongs “glory and power forever and ever. Amen.”
