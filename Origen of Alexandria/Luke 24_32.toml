By which is implied, that the words uttered by the Saviour inflamed the hearts of the hearers to the love of God.

Do you want me to show you how the fire goes out from the words of the Holy Spirit and ignites the fire the hearts of believers?… And again in the Gospel it was written, after the Lord spoke to Cleopas, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he talked to us on the road, while he opened to us the Scriptures?" Where will your burning come from? What "coals of fire" will be found in you who are never set on fire by the declaration of the Lord, never inflamed by the words of the Holy Spirit? Hear also in another place David himself saying, "My heart became hot within me. As I mused, the fire burned."

This shows that we must not only employ zeal to learn the sacred literature but also pray to the Lord and entreat "day and night" that the lamb "of the tribe of Judah" may come and, himself taking "the sealed book," may deign to open it. For it is he who "opening the Scriptures" kindles the hearts of the disciples so that they say, "Did not our hearts burn within us while he opened to us the scriptures?"
