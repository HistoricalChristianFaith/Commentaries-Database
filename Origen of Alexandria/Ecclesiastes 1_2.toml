Let us see what is the “vanity” to which the creation was subjected. My own opinion is, that this is nothing else than the possession of bodies, for even though the stars are composed of ether they are nevertheless material. This, it seems to me, is the reason why Solomon arraigns the whole bodily universe as being in a way burdensome and as impeding the activity of spirits, thus: “Vanity of vanities, all is vanity, said the Preacher; all is vanity.” “For,” he adds, “I looked and I saw all things that are under the sun, and behold, all is vanity.”
