A name is a designation that sums up and describes the particular character of the one named.… For when the character of “Abram” was changed, he was called “Abraham.” So when “Simon” was changed, he was called “Peter.” And when “Saul” stopped persecuting Christ, he was named “Paul.” In the case of God, however, whose character is eternally unchangeable and always remains unaltered, there is always a single name. It is that spoken of him in Exodus: “I am.”
