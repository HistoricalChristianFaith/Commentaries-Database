Anyone who doubts this needs only read what Peter said when he went to visit the Gentile Cornelius: “Truly I perceive that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.” We might go even farther and quote what our Lord says in the Gospel: “he who believes in me is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.”
