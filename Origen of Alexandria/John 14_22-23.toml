God does indeed consume and utterly destroy: he consumes evil thoughts, wicked actions and sinful desires when they find their way into the minds of believers. God, with his Son, inhabits those souls that have been rendered capable of receiving his word and wisdom, in line with his saying, “I and the Father shall come and make our abode with him.” After their vices and passions have been consumed, he makes them a holy temple, worthy of himself.
