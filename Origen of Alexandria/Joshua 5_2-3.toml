I may wish in this place to inquire of the Jews how anyone is able to be circumcised a second time with the circumcision of the flesh. For once anyone is circumcised, he does not have anything more to be removed a second time. But see how fittingly and consistently those things may be resolved by us, to whom it is said, “The law is spiritual.” For we say that that person who was skilled in the law and taught by Moses cast off the errors of idolatry and put aside the superstition and worship of images. This is the first circumcision through the law. But if he comes from the law and the prophets to the gospel faith, then he also receives the second circumcision through “the rock, who is Christ,” and what the Lord said to Jesus [Joshua] is accomplished: “Today I have taken away the reproach of Egypt from the sons of Israel.”Just as the apostle said, “They drank from the spiritual rock following them, but that rock was Christ,” so also we are able to say aptly in this place that they were circumcised “from the spiritual rock following them, but the rock was Christ.” For if anyone has not been cleansed through the gospel by a second circumcision, he is not able to put aside the reproach of Egypt, that is, the allurement of fleshly vices.
