But follow me, O hearer, through delicate threads of expression, and I shall disclose to you how for a second time he takes possession of this earth, very much of which is now said to Jesus to be left behind. Listen to what Paul says concerning this: “For he must reign until he makes all his enemies his footstool.” This, therefore, is the “land,” much of which is now said to be left behind, until all are placed entirely under his feet and until he takes possession of all persons for his inheritance. “This,” it says, “is the land that was left behind: all the regions of the Philistines,” and, indeed, very many other lands that follow. Much still “remains,” as far as this pertains to our times, which we see has not yet been “placed beneath the feet of Jesus,” who is certainly to possess all.…From this it is evident that in the second coming Jesus will obtain this extensive land that still remains. But blessed are those who were taken over at his first coming; for those will be truly dear who receive the inheritance of the land of promise in spite of the resistance of many adversaries and the attacks of many enemies by war and by weapons.
