“The boundaries of Judah,” it says, “were made according to their people from the borders of Edom and from the wilderness of Zin to the west.” Therefore, the borders of Judah are next to the borders of Edom. But Edom, as we have already often said, means “earthly things.” Therefore, the regions of Judah come just after earthly things. But it also says, “from the wilderness of Zin.” Zin means “temptations.” Therefore, the regions of the inheritance of Judah come after temptations.

Moreover, “from the boundaries of Edom” is the wilderness of Zin. We said a little before that the wilderness of Zin signified “temptations,” and therefore it was necessary for us to pass through the desert of temptations to attain to the inheritance of the sons of Judah.
