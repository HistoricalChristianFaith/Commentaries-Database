Are you not yet moved to understand that these words are spoken spiritually? Or do you think that it always happens by chance that the patriarchs go to wells and obtain their marriages at waters? He who thinks in this way is “a sensual man” and “does not perceive these things which are of the Spirit of God.” But let him who wishes remain in these understandings, let him remain “a sensual man.” I, following Paul the apostle, say that these things are “allegories,” and I say that the marriages of the saints are the union of the soul with the Word of God: “For he who joins himself to the Lord is one spirit.”But it is certain that this union of the soul with the Word cannot come about otherwise than through instruction in the divine books, which are figuratively called wells. If anyone should come to these and draw from these waters, that is, by meditating on these words should perceive the deeper sense and meaning, that one will find a marriage worthy of God; for [that person’s] soul is united with God.
