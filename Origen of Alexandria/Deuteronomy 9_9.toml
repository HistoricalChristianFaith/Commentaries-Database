Every form of nourishment is called “bread” in the Scriptures. This is clear from what is written concerning Moses: for forty days he neither ate “bread” nor drank water. The word that nourishes is multidimensional and varied. Not everyone can receive the solid and strong nourishment of God’s teachings. Therefore, wishing to give an athlete’s nourishment suitable to the more perfect, [Christ] says, “The bread that I will give is my flesh, which I will give for the life of the world.”
