To you who are coming to baptism, Scripture says, "Bear fruits that befit repentance." Do you want to know what fruits befit repentance? Love is a fruit of the Spirit. Joy is a fruit of the Spirit. So are peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control, and the others of this sort. If we have all of these virtues, we have produced "fruits that befit repentance." … John, the last of the prophets, prophesies the expulsion of the first nation and the call of the Gentiles. To those who were boasting about Abraham he says, "Do not begin to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham for a father.' " And again he speaks about the Gentiles, "For I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham."From what stones? Surely he was not pointing to irrational, material stones but to people who were uncomprehending and sometimes hard.
