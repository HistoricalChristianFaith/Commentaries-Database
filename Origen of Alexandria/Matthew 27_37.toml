The High Priest also in obedience to the letter of the Law wore on his head the writing, 'Holiness to the Lord,' but the true High Priest and King, Jesus, bears on His cross the title, This is the King of the Jews; when ascending to His Father, instead of His own name with its proper letters, He has the Father Himself.

"Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed," and all literature—whether Greek, Roman or Hebrew—gives evidence of his kingdom. And in place of a crown, "over his head" is written "This is Jesus king of the Jews." There is no other reason for his death (nor was there) than that he was the "king of the Jews." He spoke about this when he said, "I have been made king by him on Zion, his holy mountain." And while the chief priest, in keeping with the letter of the law, wore on his head a type of sign with a petal bearing the inscription "the holiness of the Lord," the true chief priest and king—Jesus on the cross—has a sign that reads "This is the king of the Jews." Rising up to the Father and receiving him in himself, he has for his inscription and title the Father of renown and has the Father as his crown. He has been made worthy of him as a house worthy of God the Father, and he alone can fully possess the Father.
