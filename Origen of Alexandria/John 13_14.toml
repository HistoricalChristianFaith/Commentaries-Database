But consider if it is not also difficult for anyone who is a disciple of Christ who wishes to fulfill the command that says, “You also ought to wash one another’s feet,” since he is obliged to desire to perform the work of washing his brothers’ feet, which are physical and perceptible to the senses. Consequently, the faithful [are obliged] to do this in whatever station of life they happen to be, whether bishops and presbyters who seem to be in ecclesiastical prominence, or even those in other positions of honor in the world. This means that the master comes to wash the feet of the believing servant, and parents wash the feet of their son. This custom either does not occur, or it occurs exceedingly rarely and among those who are very simple and rustic.
