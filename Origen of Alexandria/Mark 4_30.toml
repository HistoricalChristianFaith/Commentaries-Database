Now a simile differs from a parable; for it is written in Mark, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?” From this it is plain that there is some logical distinction between a comparison and a parable. The simile seems to be generic, and the parable specific. The simile, which is the highest genus of the parable, contains the parable as one of its species.
