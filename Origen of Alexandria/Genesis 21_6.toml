Isaac means “laughter” or “joy.” Who is it, then, who begets such a son? It is doubtless he who said of these whom he begot through the gospel: “For you are my joy and crown of glory.” For sons of this kind, there is a feast and great joy when they are weaned, for these who “no longer need milk, but strong meat, who by taking up their power have their senses exercised to the discerning of good or evil.” There is a great feast for such as these, when they are weaned. But a feast cannot be offered nor joy possessed for those of whom the apostle says, “I gave you milk to drink, not meat; for you were not able as yet, but neither indeed are you able still. And I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to little ones in Christ.” Let those who wish the divine Scripture to be understood straightforwardly tell us what it means: “I could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to little ones in Christ; I gave you milk to drink, not meat.” Can these words be taken straightforwardly?
