quote='''
For He gives the name of the eye especially to our understanding, but the whole soul, although not corporeal, He metaphorically calls the body. For the whole soul is enlightened by the understanding.

For the understanding from its very beginning desires only singleness, containing no dissimulation, or guile, or division in itself.
