The other disciples only fell away from Jesus, but Peter, who thought that he could begin with deceit and end up with the truth, both fell away from Jesus and also denied him because of the audacious promise he made that he would never fall away.It was not only out of carelessness but almost also out of wickedness that he said, “Even if all fall away because of you, I will not fall away.” He made a rash promise because he did not know the deceitfulness of human nature. This is why Peter didn’t simply fall away from Jesus or even deny him once but abandoned him so completely that he denied him three times.

It seems to me that Jesus’ other disciples had the foresight and wisdom (when it was first said “you will fall away because of me tonight”) not to profess that they would never fall away, for they saw the truth of Jesus’ prediction. But because only to Peter alone was it said, “Truly I tell you, before the cock crows you will deny me three times,” they eventually promised along with Peter, “Even if we have to die with you, we will not deny you.” The difference between Peter and the other disciples is this: Peter did not acquiesce even after Jesus prophesied that he would deny him three times before the cock crowed. The others, however, who were not included in this prophecy or in things said only to Peter, responded with a promise which did not seek to make a liar out of the Lord, as Peter’s promise did.
