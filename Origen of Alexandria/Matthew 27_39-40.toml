No one standing still or directly approaching him blasphemes Jesus. “Those who passed by blasphemed him,” and those who stayed behind plucked food from the vineyard wall demolished by God. Concerning this it is written, “Why then have you broken down its walls, so that those who pass along the way pluck its fruit?” Therefore, as long as one does not pass along the way or avoid it and can say to God while standing, “You have set ‘my feet upon a rock,’ ” one does not blaspheme Jesus. But if one should fall or pass by or cross over or turn away, one blasphemes God. Likewise, those who have fallen into evil works and those who have abandoned the “everlasting statutes” and the way of the heavenly church “are tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the cunning of men, by their craftiness in deceitful wiles.”Now, if anyone should say that all heresies are “passing along” and turning away, that one will not be wrong. For this reason also those are held to be “passing along” and blaspheming Jesus who do not keep their head steady but are “wagging” it up and down. For they are not wise, nor do they have their eyes in their head where they belong, as we read in Ecclesiastes: “The wise man has his eyes in his head.” Therefore those who pass by and turn away have need to blaspheme Jesus the Son of God, for “no one speaking by the Spirit of God ever says ‘Jesus be cursed.’ ”59
There are various forms of blasphemy. One of them is uttered by those who do not understand or hear what is being said or acknowledge what is true. Now Jesus had said, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.” But those who were passing along, like “false witnesses” against Jesus, related what he had not said, attacking him: “Aha, you who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself.” The truth is, he will not destroy the temple, but what others destroy he will build, whether it be the “temple of his body,” which the Jews delivered up to death, or the temple of his witnesses and all those who had God’s word in them and who, because of the snares of the wicked, died out of love for God (for “the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live”). And they lied not only when they said, “You who would destroy the temple,” but also when they said, “And I will build it in three days.” For he did not say that he would build the temple but raise it up. The verb build does not designate a sudden action, but “raise up” does.
