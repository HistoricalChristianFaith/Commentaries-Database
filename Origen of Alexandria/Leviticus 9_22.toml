Something of this sort has also been written about Aaron in the book of Leviticus, namely, that “he raised up his hands over the people and blessed them.” I gather from this that the saying expresses a mystery, namely, that the one who blesses someone must be adorned with works that distinguish him from the many and raise him above them. For when he is going to bless the people, the hands of Aaron are raised on high. So if someone has his hands down toward earthly things, he does not intend to bless anyone.
