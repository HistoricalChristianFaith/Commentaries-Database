“The deceitfulness of riches chokes,” and so does the speech of heretics. The rich are liars, contrasted with “the poor, righteous person,” who is poor in speech and knowledge but righteous in life. The “care of all the churches” of which the apostle speaks is distinguished from the “care of this world.” One suffers from these worldly cares when one does not rejuvenate one’s own soil but receives the word without paying attention and sprouts up thorns, with which the earth was cursed because of the disobedience of Adam. He heard of the “thorns and thistles it shall produce for you,” “whose end is to be burned.” For these are not sown but spring forth of themselves. They “choke the word” of God through troubles and whims. One who knows truly both understands and bears fruit. But if anyone seems to understand without bearing fruit, one does not understand. If one seems to bear fruit without understanding, one does not bear fruit. This displays the variety of levels of virtue spoken of in the text: “sixtyfold and thirtyfold and a hundredfold.” Virtue’s strictness is not exhibited by everyone to the same degree. Some care less about it, some more.
