The ultimate justice itself is Christ, “who was made wisdom for us from God, and justice, and sanctification and redemption.” The justice in each person, however, is formed from that justice, so that many justices come into existence in those who are saved; wherefore it has also been written, “The Lord is just and has loved justice.”
