Let us, however, touch briefly on the Acts of the Apostles, where Stephen and the apostles direct their prayers to that God “who made heaven and earth” and who “spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets,” calling him “the God of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob,” the God who led his people out of the land of Egypt. These expressions undoubtedly direct our minds to faith in the Creator and implant an affection for him in those who have piously and faithfully accepted this truth in him.
