He said to Peter, “Put your sword back into its place” (which is one of patience). After restoring the amputated ear, as the other Evangelist says (which was a sign of both supreme kindness and divine power), he spoke these words that they might ring true to what he had said and done before. Although they might not remember the good things done in the past, they might acknowledge the good things done in the present.
