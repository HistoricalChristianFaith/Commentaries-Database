In Jeremiah, too, he likens himself to a lamb, as thus: “I was as a gentle lamb that is led to the slaughter.” These and other similar sayings he applies to himself.

If we examine the declaration about Jesus who is pointed out by John in the words, “This is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world,” from the standpoint of the dispensation itself of the bodily sojourn of the Son of God in the life of people, we will assume that the lamb is none other than his humanity. For he was “led as a sheep to the slaughter and was dumb as a lamb before its shearer,” saying, “I was as an innocent lamb being led to be sacrificed.”
