For though they seem even now to hear the Law, yet is it only with the left ear that they hear the shadow of a tradition concerning the Law, and not the truth. The people of the Gentiles is signified by Peter; for by believing in Christ, they become the cause of cutting off the Jews' right ear.

Perhaps what Peter did was a mystery, for the right ear of the Jewish people had to be cut off because of their malice toward Jesus. Though they seem to hear the law, they now hear with their left ear the shadowy tradition of the law but not the truth, since they are enslaved by words that profess the service of God but do not serve him in truth. The mystery of these words against Christ is found in the person of Christ's adversary, the high priest Caiaphas. Now it seems to me, since all the Gentile believers were made one people in Christ, the very fact that they believed in Christ was the reason why the right ear of the Jews was cut off, according to what had been prophesied about them: "Make the ears of this people heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears ... and turn and be healed."
