Who are these elders who either came with Joshua/Jesus or after him, if not the very apostles who illumined our hearts by their writings and precepts, even bringing a certain kind of “day” among us from that “true light” in which they were partakers? Whoever, therefore, is enlightened and instructed from the precepts of the apostles and is ordained according to the apostolic rules for the service of the Lord is the very person who is said to serve the Lord in the days of the elders who came after Jesus. Do you wish to see that the apostles also were the “light of the world,” just as the Savior “was the true light which illumines every person coming into the world”2? The Lord himself said to them, as it is written in the Gospel, “You are the light of the world.” But if the apostles are also the light of the world, then the “days” in which “we serve the Lord” undoubtedly illuminate us through their precepts and commandments.

It mentions “the days of the elders who knew all the works of the Lord.” Who is the person who “knows all the works of the Lord,” except the one who does them himself? For just as it was said that the sons of Eli were “sons of pestilence, having no knowledge of the Lord,” yet not meaning that these men who taught others were ignorant of the Lord, but rather that they behaved like those who did not know the Lord, so also in like manner is this statement to be understood that the elders “knew all the works of the Lord.” Moreover, it does not merely say that “they knew the works of the Lord” but specifies that “they knew every work of the Lord,” that is, that they knew the Lord’s work of justice and work of sanctification and patience and kindness and piety, for everything that comes from the commandments of God is called a “work of the Lord.” … Therefore, they are said to “know” the work of God who do his work. But that its customary use of “to know” and “not to know” may shine still more clearly from the authority of the Scriptures, observe how it is written elsewhere that “he who keeps the commandment,” it says, “will not know an evil word.” Can, therefore, one who keeps the commandments become one who does not know evil? He knows, of course, but “not know” is said of him because he is careful to avoid the evil. It is even said of the Lord and Savior himself that “he did not know sin,” certainly indicating in this case that to be ignorant of sin is equivalent to refraining from every sinful act. In this way, therefore, he is said to “know the works of the Lord” who performs “the works of the Lord,” whereas he who does not do the work of God is ignorant of the work of God.
