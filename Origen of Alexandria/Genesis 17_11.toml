We, therefore, instructed by the apostle Paul, say that just as many other things were made in the figure and image of future truth, so also that circumcision of flesh was bearing the form of spiritual circumcision about which it was both worthy and fitting that “the God of majesty” give commands to mortals. Hear, therefore, how Paul, “a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth,” teaches the church of Christ about the mystery of circumcision. “Behold,” he says, “the mutilation”—speaking about the Jews who are mutilated in the flesh—“for we,” he says, “are the circumcision, who serve God in spirit and have no confidence in the flesh.” This is one opinion of Paul about circumcision. Hear also another: “For he is not a Jew who is so outwardly; nor is that circumcision which is outwardly in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly with circumcision of the heart in the spirit, not in the letter.” Does it not seem more appropriate to you to speak of such a circumcision among the saints and friends of God than to speak of a pruning of the flesh?But the novelty of the expression may perhaps deter not only the Jews but even some of our brothers. For Paul, who introduces “circumcision of the heart,” seems to assume things that are impossible. For how shall it be possible that a member be circumcised that, covered by the internal viscera, lies hidden even from the view of men?
