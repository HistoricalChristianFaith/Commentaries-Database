The eyes of sense were then opened, which they had done well to keep shut, that they might not be distracted and hindered from seeing with the eyes of the mind. It was those eyes of the mind which in consequence of sin, as I imagine, were then closed. To that time they had enjoyed the delight of beholding God and his paradise. This twofold kind of vision in us was familiar to our Savior, who said, “For judgment I have come into this world, that those who see not might see and that those who see might be made blind”—meaning by “the eyes that see not” the eyes of the mind, which are enlightened by his teaching; and “the eyes that see,” meaning the eyes of sense, which his words render blind.
