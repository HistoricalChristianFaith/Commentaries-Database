Someone might ask, “If the soul of Elijah was not first in the Tishbite and then in John, what might that be in both which the Savior in both cases called Elijah?” I answer that Gabriel in his reply to Zachariah had already suggested that it was the same being that was in Elijah and John. He says, in fact, “He will lead back many sons of Israel to the Lord God, and he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah.” For, note well: he did not say “in the soul of Elijah,” in which case, the doctrine of the transmigration of souls might have some ground, but “in the spirit and the power of Elijah.” The Scriptures clearly know the difference between “spirit” and “soul,” since the text, “May the God of peace sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved entire, without blame at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,” and the other passage, “Blessed the Lord, you spirits and souls of the righteous,” as it is recorded in the book of Daniel (according to the version of the Seventy), which indicates the difference between soul and spirit. John therefore is called Elijah not because of the soul but because of the spirit and the power, and if these things existed before in Elijah and then in John, this is not at all in conflict with the teaching of the church. But “the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets,” not the souls of the prophets, which are not subject to the prophets.
