And those who attended to the net that was cast into the sea are Jesus Christ, the master of the net, and “the angels who came and ministered to him.” It is not until the net is filled full that they will draw it up from the sea and carry it to the shore beyond the sea—namely, to things beyond this life—but not until the “fullness of the Gentiles” has been drawn into it. But when that fullness has come, then they draw it up from things here below and carry it to what is figuratively called the shore. There it will be the work of those who have drawn it up to sit by the shore, there to settle themselves in order that they may put each of the good fish in its own proper place, into the right vessel. But they will cast outside those that are of an opposite character and are called bad. By “outside” is meant the furnace of fire, as the Savior interpreted it, saying, “So shall it be at the consummation of the age. The angels shall come forth and separate the wicked from among the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.” Only it must be observed that we are already taught by the parable of the tares and the other similitudes set forth that the angels are to be entrusted with the power to distinguish and separate the evil from the righteous. For it is said above, “The Son of Man shall send his angels, and they shall gather out of his kingdom all things that cause stumbling, and those who do iniquity, and shall cast them into the furnace of fire. There shall be the weeping and gnashing of teeth.” But here it is said, “The angels shall come forth and sever the wicked from among the righteous and shall cast them into the furnace of fire.”
