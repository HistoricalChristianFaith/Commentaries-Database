Consequently let us compare the divine Scripture with itself and follow the path of the solution that it would open to us. For we find in the sacrifice of the Passover that it is ordered to be offered “in the evening.” In like manner, the command is given that “nothing will remain of the flesh until morning.” It is not insignificant that the divine word wants us to eat not yesterday’s meat, but always fresh and new, particularly those who offer to God the Passover sacrifice or “the sacrifice of praise.” It commands them to eat this new and fresh meat of the same day. It prohibits yesterday’s meat. I remembered the prophet Ezekiel said something similar when the Lord had commanded him to bake cakes for them in “human dung.” For he answered the Lord and said, “O Lord, never was my soul contaminated, and dead or unclean things did not enter my mouth. Even yesterday’s meat never entered my mouth.” In this case I was often asking myself what this exultation of the prophet was that as something great he brought mean before the Lord and said, “I never ate yesterday’s meat.” But as I see from this place, taught and instructed by these mysteries, this prophet spoke to the Lord saying, I am not a priest so cast down and ignoble that “I eat yesterday’s meat,” that is, old meat.
