In the words of Song of Songs may be found that food of which the apostle says, “But solid food is for the mature” and requires such people as listeners who “have their faculties trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.” Thus, if those we have called “little ones” come to these places in Scripture, it can happen that they receive no profit at all from this book or even that they are badly injured either by reading what has been written or by examining what has been said to interpret it. But for one who is mature according to the flesh, no little risk and danger arises from this book of Scripture [Song of Songs]. For if he does not know how to listen to the names of love purely and with chaste ears, he may twist everything he has heard from the inner man to the outer, fleshly man and be turned away from the Spirit to the flesh. Then he will nourish in himself fleshly desires, and it will seem because of the divine Scriptures that he is impelled and moved to the lusts of the flesh. For this reason I give warning and advice to everyone who is not yet free of the vexations of flesh and blood and who has not withdrawn from the desire for corporeal nature that he completely abstain from reading this book and what is said about it. Indeed, they say that the Hebrews observe the rule that, unless someone has attained a perfect and mature age, he is not even permitted to hold this book in his hands. Moreover, we also accept the observance of the following rule from them—it is their custom that all the Scriptures should be given to children by the teachers and the wise, and that at the same time those passages which they call deuterōseis should be held back to the last. There are four of them: the beginning of Genesis, in which the creation of the world is described; the first chapters of Ezekiel the prophet, in which mention is made of the cherubim; the end of Ezekiel, which includes the building of the temple; and this book, Song of Songs.
