In appearance Judas championed the cause of the poor and said with indignation, “This ointment might have been sold for three hundred pence and given to the poor.” But in reality he “was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put in it.” If, then, anyone in our time who has the bag of the church speaks like Judas on behalf of the poor but takes away what is put in it, let there be assigned to him the portion along with Judas who did these same things.
