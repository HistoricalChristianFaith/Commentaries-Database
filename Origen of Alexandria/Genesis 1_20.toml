According to the letter“swimming creatures” and “birds” are brought forth by the waters at the command of God, and we recognize by whom these things that we see have been made. But let us see how also6 these same things come to be in our firmament of heaven, that is, in the firmness of our mind or heart. I think that if our mind has been enlightened by Christ, our sun, it is ordered afterward to bring forth from these waters that are in it “swimming creatures” and “birds that fly,” that is, to bring out into the open good or evil thoughts that there might be a distinction of the good thoughts from the evil, which certainly both proceed from our heart as from the waters. But by the word and precept of God let us offer up both to God’s view and judgment so that, with his enlightenment, we may be able to distinguish what is evil from the good.
