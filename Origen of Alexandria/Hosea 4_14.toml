Hear what he says through the prophet. When he had enumerated abominable things that the people had committed, he adds these words also: “And for this reason I will not visit your daughters when they fornicate, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery.” This is terrible! This is the outcome when we are no longer reproached for sins, when we offend and are no longer corrected. For then, when we have exceeded the measure of sinning “the jealous God” turns his jealousy away from us, as he said above, “For my jealousy will be removed from you, and I will no longer be angry over you.” I have said these things about the statement “God is jealous.”
