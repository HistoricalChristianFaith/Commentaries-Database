“And they remain as eternal sheep.” What is the meaning of these words? They are those words that Christ spoke, “My sheep hear my voice, and I give them eternal life.” The faithful are the eternal sheep; the heretics are imitators. They want to imitate the flock of Christ. They ordain their own bishops, presbyters, deacons, doctors, congregation and catechumens, and by imitating the eternal sheep they fulfill the prediction, “And they appear as eternal sheep.” They clearly are not eternal sheep but “appear as eternal sheep.”

“And their children play before them, taking up the psaltery and harp.” Our children take up the psaltery and the harp, praising and glorifying God. But “their [the heretics’] children,” who are foolish in themselves, also “play taking up the psaltery and the harp.” Every time they usurp the words of the Old Testament, they play and mock the oracles of the Law and the Prophets. By taking up the harmonies that were once the psaltery of the law and the prophetic harp, they play with them.
