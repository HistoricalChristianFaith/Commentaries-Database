We are not unaware that “Bethany” occurs in nearly all the manuscripts.… But since we have been in these places, so far as historical account is concerned, of the footprints of Jesus and his disciples and the prophets, we have been convinced that we ought not to read “Bethany” but “Bethabara.” …Bethabara means house of preparation, which agrees with the baptism of him who was making ready a people prepared for the Lord.… Jordan, again, means, “their descent.” … Now what is this river but our Savior, through whom coming into this earth all must be cleansed, in that he came down not for his own sake but for theirs?… This is the river that separates the lots given by Moses from those given by Jesus. “The streams” of this “river” that has descended “make glad the city of God.” …
As the dragon is in the Egyptian river, so God is in the river that makes glad the city of God, for the Father is in the Son. For this reason those who come to wash themselves in him put away the reproach of Egypt59 and become more worthy to be taken up. They are cleansed from the most abominable leprosy and receive a double portion of gifts and are prepared to receive the Holy Spirit since the dove of the Spirit has not flown to another river. Since, therefore, we have considered the Jordan in a manner more worthy of God, and the baptism in it, and Jesus who was baptized in it, … let us draw from the river as much of this help as we need.
