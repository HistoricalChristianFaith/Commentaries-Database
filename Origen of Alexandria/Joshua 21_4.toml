"First," it says, "the lot fell out for Kohath, and it came to pass for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were among the Levites." Whose lot was it suitable to be the first to fall out? To whom was it fitting to be given first place, if not to Aaron, the first high priest, first in life, in merits, first in honors and power? Is it resolved among you now at least that this casting of lots is not accidental but that a heavenly power is present, governing it according to the judgment of divine providence? Where, therefore, does this just lot determine the first dwelling places for the sons of Aaron? "Thirteen cities by lot," it says, "in the tribe of Judah, in the tribe of Simeon, and in the tribe of Benjamin." You see how the dwelling places are dispensed to select persons in select tribes.
