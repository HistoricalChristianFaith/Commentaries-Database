Precisely how all this can be fulfilled so that they may be filled with all joy and peace is hard to say, especially since the apostle himself, when talking about the gifts of the Spirit, says that he knows in part and prophesies in part. But I think that believers can have the fullness of peace when they are reconciled to God the Father by faith.… For if someone who believes is armed with the power of the Holy Spirit, it is certain that he will always have the fullness of joy and peace.
