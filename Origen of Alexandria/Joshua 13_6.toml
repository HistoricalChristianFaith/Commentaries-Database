After these things, when he had enumerated very many nations, of the Sidonites alone he said, “And I shall exterminate all the Sidonites from the face of the sons of Israel.” The Canaanites were also named, and those who were opposite Egypt were mentioned, and those who were from the region of Ekron and from the left portions of the river, and very many other nations; but concerning the Sidonites alone, the Lord says that he will destroy them. Just as we have said previously, however, the Sidonites are called “hunters.” Who, therefore, do we understand as those evil hunters that the Lord exterminates if not those opposing powers of whom the prophet says, “They have prepared snares for my feet,” [snares] by which they pursue and ensnare souls for sin? So then, the Lord exterminates them. For when such hunters as these have perished, when at last there will be no one who “stretches out snares” and nets in order to entrap souls in sin, then “each person will rest under his own vine and under his own fig tree.”
