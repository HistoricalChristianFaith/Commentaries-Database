Exhortation is a kind of teaching or word by which afflicted souls are enlightened by the words of holy Scripture which are carefully adapted and collected together for that purpose. For despair often comes when the tribulations of the soul are too many, and it is not an easy matter to put this right with mere words, however polished and plausible they may be. But if the word has the power of God in it, then it penetrates the heart and offers comfort, giving hope to the despairing soul.
