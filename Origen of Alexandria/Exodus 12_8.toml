Christians eat the flesh of the lamb every day, that is, they consume daily the flesh of the Word. “For Christ our pasch is sacrificed.” And because the law of the pasch is such that it is eaten in the evening, for this reason the Lord suffered in the evening of the world, that you may always eat of the flesh of the Word, because you are always in the evening until the morning comes. And if in this evening you shall be anxious and “in weeping and fasting” and shall lead your life in every labor of justice, you shall be able to say, “In the evening weeping shall have place and in the morning gladness.” For you shall rejoice in the morning, that is, in the world to come, if in this world you have gathered “the fruit of justice” in weeping and labor.

And we must eat the meat roasted with fire with unleavened bread. For the Word of God is not only flesh. He says, indeed, “I am the bread of life,” and “This is the bread which comes down from heaven that one may eat of it and not die. I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eat of this bread he shall live forever.”36We must not, however, fail to remark that all food is loosely said to be bread, as it is written in the case of Moses in Deuteronomy: “He did not eat bread for forty days, and he did not drink water,” instead of saying he partook of neither dry nor wet nourishment.
Now I have noted this because it is also said in the Gospel according to John, “And also the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.”

Then too the unleavened bread is commanded to be eaten with bitter herbs; nor is it possible to attain the promised land unless we pass through bitterness. For just as physicians put bitter substances in medicines with a view to the health and healing of the infirm, so also the Physician of our souls with a view to our salvation has wished us to suffer the bitterness of this life in various temptations. [He knows] that the end of this bitterness gains the sweetness of salvation for our soul, just as, on the contrary, the end of the sweetness found in corporeal pleasure, as the example of that rich man teaches, brings a bitter end: torments in hell.

But we eat the flesh of the lamb and the unleavened bread with bitter herbs either by being grieved with a godly grief because of repentance for our sins, a grief which produces in us a repentance unto salvation which brings no regret, or by seeking and being nurtured from the visions of the truth which we discover because of our trials.
