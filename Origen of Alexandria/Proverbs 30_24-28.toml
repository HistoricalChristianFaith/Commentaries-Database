I do not quote these words, however, as taking them in their literal signification, but, agreeably to the title of the book (for it is entitled “Proverbs”), I investigate them as containing a secret meaning. For it is the custom of these writers [of Scripture] to distribute into many classes those writings which express one sense when taken literally but which convey a different signification as their hidden meaning; and one of these kinds of writing is “Proverbs.” … It is not, then, the visible ants which are “wiser even than the wise,” but they who are indicated as such under the “proverbial” style of expression. And such must be our conclusion regarding the rest of the animal creation.

Although the locusts do not have a king, as Scripture says, “He marches the well-ordered army in one line,” but people, although they have been made rational by God, have been able neither to rule themselves orderly nor to endure patiently the control of God as king.
