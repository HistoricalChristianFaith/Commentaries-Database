But when we wish to examine the very letter of the words as given by Matthew, “He that speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death,” consider whether it was taken from the place where it was written, “Whoso strikes his father or mother, let him die the death; and he that speaks evil of father or mother, let him die the death.” For such are the exact words taken from the law with regard to the two commandments; but Matthew has quoted them in part and in an abridged form, and not in the very words.
