We must carefully observe and examine what has been written concerning the position of Jesus’ eyes.… He had changed his thought from his conversation with those below and lifted it up and exalted it, bringing it in prayer to the Father who is over all.… The one who imitates Christ’s prayer, lifting up the eyes of his soul and bringing them up in this way from everyday concerns, memories, thoughts and intention must in this way address to God the great and heavenly words of prayer concerning great and heavenly matters.… If indeed God makes such a promise for those who pray in a worthy manner … that “while you are still speaking, I will say, ‘Here I am,’ ” what answer do we think our Savior and Lord would receive?
