It was fitting that there be a drawing of lots even regarding the suburbs and cities so that perhaps the renowned division among the Levites might not seem perhaps indiscriminate and accidental. Therefore, the distribution by lot that took place among the sons of Israel was characterized by reason, by which someone was considered worthy of the first lot, and someone else the second, as we have already previously examined to the extent we were able. This was true in regard to both those who receive through Moses beyond the Jordan and those who receive from Jesus [Joshua] in the land of promise, where the first lot fell to Benjamin and afterwards to the rest, among whom Dan was the last. Even so it is necessary that there be some reason also in the order of priestly and levitical lots. Thus the first is drawn for someone, the second for someone else, and the third for another, through which these or those places are determined for each one.

Who will explain the diverse sites of the encampments, how this distribution must be retained in the resurrection for each priestly or levitical order of the saints, so that, just as the apostle says, nothing is done haphazardly in the resurrection, but everyone comes “in his own order, Christ first, then those who belong to Christ who have believed in his coming, when he will hand the kingdom over to our God and Father, when he will subject to him every principality and power”?On that occasion, without doubt, there will be some such observances of encampments and priestly distributions and ranks and signals of trumpets.

“First,” it says, “the lot fell out for Kohath, and it came to pass for the sons of Aaron, the priests, who were among the Levites.” Whose lot was it suitable to be the first to fall out? To whom was it fitting to be given first place, if not to Aaron, the first high priest, first in life, in merits, first in honors and power? Is it resolved among you now at least that this casting of lots is not accidental but that a heavenly power is present, governing it according to the judgment of divine providence? Where, therefore, does this just lot determine the first dwelling places for the sons of Aaron? “Thirteen cities by lot,” it says, “in the tribe of Judah, in the tribe of Simeon, and in the tribe of Benjamin.” You see how the dwelling places are dispensed to select persons in select tribes.
