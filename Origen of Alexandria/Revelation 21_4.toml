It must be understood concerning the devil that he has certainly been conquered and crucified, but for those who have been crucified with Christ, moreover for all believers and likewise for all people, the devil will also be crucified at the time when what the apostle says will be fulfilled: “As in Adam all die, so also in Christ will all be made alive.” Thus there is also in this a mystery of future resurrection. For then, too, the people will again be divided into two parts; then, too, there will also be certain ones in front and others behind, who when they unite into one for Jesus, then, at that time, the devil will certainly be no more “because death will be no more.” … Concerning the devil, the apostle says, “Death, the last enemy, is destroyed” because death is truly conquered when “this mortal is swallowed up by life.”
