This then is the “vanity” to which the creation was subjected, and above all that creation which is certainly the greatest thing in this world and which holds a distinguished preeminence by reason of its function. That is, the sun, moon and stars are said to have been subjected to vanity, because they were clothed with bodies and set to perform the task of giving light to the human race. And this creation, Scripture says, was subjected to vanity “not of its own will.” For it did not undertake a service to vanity by the exercise of free will but in obedience to the wish of him who was subjecting it, because he who subjected it promised those who were being given over unwillingly to vanity that on the fulfillment of their splendid work of service they should be delivered from this bondage of corruption and vanity, when the time of redemption “of the glory of the sons of God” should have come. Having received this hope, and looking for the fulfillment of this promise, the entire creation now in the meantime “groans together” with us (for it even has sympathy with those whom it serves) and “is in pain together,” while in patience it hopes for what has been promised.
