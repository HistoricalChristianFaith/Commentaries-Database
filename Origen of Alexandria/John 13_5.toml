Why do you suppose it was not written, “He washed the disciples’ feet” instead of “And he began to wash the disciples’ feet”? For is it the custom of the Scriptures to prefix “he began” without a reason, as in the usage of the majority? Or did Jesus then “begin to wash the disciples’ feet” and not stop when he had washed their feet at that time? For later he washed them and completed the washing, since they were defiled, according to the saying, “You will all be made to stumble because of me this night,” and what was said to Peter, “The rooster will not crow until you deny me three times.” For when these sins occurred, the defiled feet of the disciples were again in need of washing, which he had begun to wash when he rose from supper, [but] he completed the washing when he cleansed them that they might no longer be defiled.
