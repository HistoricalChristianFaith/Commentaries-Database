But as it is in the mockery that Celsus says we speak of “God coming down like a torturer bearing fire” and thus compels us unseasonably to investigate words of deeper meaning, we shall make a few remarks, sufficient to enable our hearers to form an idea of the defense that disposes of the ridicule of Celsus against us, and then we shall turn to what follows. The divine word says that our God is “a consuming fire” and that “he draws rivers of fire before him”; no, that he even enters in as “a refiner’s fire and as a fuller’s herb,” to purify his own people. But when he is said to be a “consuming fire,” we inquire what are the things that are appropriate to be consumed by God. And we assert that they are wickedness and the works that result from it and that, being figuratively called “wood, hay, stubble,” God consumes as a fire. The wicked person, accordingly, is said to build up on the previously laid foundation of reason, “wood and hay and stubble.” … And, in like manner, “rivers of fire” are said to be before God, who will thoroughly cleanse away the evil that is intermingled throughout the whole soul.

And to him to whom we offer firstfruits we also send up our prayers, “having a great high priest who has passed into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,” and “we hold fast this profession” as long as we live; for we find God and his only-begotten Son, manifested to us in Jesus, to be gracious and kind to us. And if we would wish to have besides a great number of beings who shall ever prove friendly to us, we are taught that “thousand thousands stood before him, and ten thousand times ten thousand ministered to him.” And these, regarding all as their relations and friends who imitate their piety toward God and in prayer call on him with sincerity, work along with them for their salvation, appear to them, deem it their office and duty to attend to them, and as if by common agreement they visit with all manner of kindness and deliverance those who pray to God, to whom they themselves also pray. “For they are all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister for those who shall be heirs of salvation.”
