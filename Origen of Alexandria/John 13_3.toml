The things, therefore, that were not formerly in Jesus’ hands are given into his hands by the Father. And it is not some things and not others that are given into his hands, but all things. David, too, seeing in the Spirit, says in relation to this, “The Lord said to my Lord, ‘Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool.’ ” For Jesus’ enemies were also a part of the “all things” that Jesus knew, so far as it was in the power of foreknowledge, to be given to him by the Father.… The Father has given all things into his hands, that is, into his power. For his hands hold all things. Or, the Father [has given all things] “to him,” for his work. “My Father works still, and I work also.”
