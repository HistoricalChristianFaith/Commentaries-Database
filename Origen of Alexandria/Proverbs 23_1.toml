What therefore is “the table of the powerful one,” except the mind of that one who says, “I can do all things in Christ who strengthens me”; and “when I am weak, then I am strong”? On this “clean table of the powerful one,” that is, in his heart, in his mind is offered “a loaf” to the Lord. At the table of this powerful apostle, if you sit to eat, “understand intelligently what is set before you,” that is, perceive spiritually what is said by him.
