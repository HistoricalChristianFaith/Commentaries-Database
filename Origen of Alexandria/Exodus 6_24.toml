For though there were three sons of Korah whose names we find in the book of Exodus—Aser, which is, by interpretation, “instruction,” and the second Elkana, which is translated “possession of God,” and the third Abiasaph, which in the Greek tongue might be rendered “congregation of the father”—yet the prophecies were not divided but were both spoken and written by one spirit and one voice and one soul, which worked in true harmony. And the three speak as one, “As the hart pants after the springs of the water, so pants my soul after you, O God.”
