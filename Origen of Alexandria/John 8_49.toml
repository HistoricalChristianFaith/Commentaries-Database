The statement “And you dishonor me” follows these words and is addressed to those who have dishonored him and said to him, “Are we not correct in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?” They thought that their incorrect statement was correct. For they denounced the Savior because they thought incorrectly that he was a Samaritan and had a demon. But we must think that the statement “And you dishonor me” was made not only to those at that time but also to those who always dishonor him by what they do contrary to the upright word of God. It was made by those who dishonor Christ, who is justice, by the unjust things they do.… “You dishonor me” would also be said to anyone who despises wisdom, since Christ also is wisdom.
