The design of Judas concerning the betrayal of our Lord and Savior did not originate in the wickedness of his mind alone. For Scripture testifies that the “devil had already put it into his heart to betray him.” On this account Solomon rightly commanded, saying, “Keep your heart with all diligence.” And the apostle Paul warns us: “Therefore we ought to pay closer attention to the things which we have heard, lest by chance we drift away.”
