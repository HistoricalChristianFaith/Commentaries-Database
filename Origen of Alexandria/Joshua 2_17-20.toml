Also this commandment is given to the person who was once a prostitute: “All,” it says, “who will be found in your house will be saved. But concerning those who go out from the house, we ourselves are free of them by your oath.” Therefore, if anyone wants to be saved, let him come into the house of this one who was once a prostitute. Even if anyone from that people wants to be saved, let him come in order to be able to attain salvation. Let him come to this house in which the blood of Christ is the sign of redemption. For among those who said, “His blood be upon us and upon our children,” the blood of Christ is for condemnation. For Jesus had been appointed “for the ruin and the resurrection of many.” Therefore, for those refuting his sign, his blood effects punishment; for those who believe, salvation.Let no one persuade himself, let no one deceive himself. Outside this house, that is, outside the church, no one is saved. If anyone goes outside, he is responsible for his own death. This is the significance of the blood, for this is also the purification that is manifest through the blood.
