Because he was a small child, he is found “in the midst of teachers,” sanctifying and instructing them. Because he was a small child, he is found “in their midst,” not teaching them but “asking questions.” He did this because it is appropriate to his age, to teach us what befits boys, even if they are wise and learned. They should rather hear their teachers than want to teach them and not show off with a display of knowledge. He interrogated the teachers not to learn anything but to teach them by his questions. From one fountain of doctrine, there flow both wise questions and answers. It is part of the same wisdom to know what you should ask and what you should answer. It was right for the Savior first to become a master of learned interrogation. Later he would answer questions according to God’s reason and Word.

Surely Jesus was in the temple that Solomon had built. He confesses that it is the temple of his Father, whom he revealed to us, and whose Son he said he was.
