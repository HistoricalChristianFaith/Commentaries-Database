“How long will the earth mourn and the grass of the field be dried up from the evil of the inhabitants in it?” The prophet here again talks as if the earth is alive when he says that the earth mourns on account of the evil of those who walk on it. For each of us, then, the earth either mourns or rejoices. For either it mourns from the evil of those who inhabit it or it rejoices from the virtue of those who inhabit it. For each of us, then, the element itself either rejoices or mourns. If earth does so, perhaps also the rest of the elements do also … including water.
