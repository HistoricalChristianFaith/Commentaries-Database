Consider why many holy women in the Scriptures are said to have been barren, as Sarah herself, and now Rebecca. Also Rachel, Israelâ€™s beloved, was barren. Hannah also, the mother of Samuel, is recorded to have been barren. Also in the Gospels, Elizabeth is said to have been barren. In all these instances this term is used, for after sterility they all gave birth to a holy person.
