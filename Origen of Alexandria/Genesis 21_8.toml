Isaac, Scripture says, “grew” and became strong; that is, Abraham’s joy grew as he looked not at those things “which are seen but at the things which are not seen.” For Abraham did not rejoice about present things or about the riches of the world and the activities of the age. But do you wish to hear why Abraham rejoiced? Hear the Lord saying to the Jews: “Abraham your father desired to see my day, and he saw it and was glad.” In this way, therefore, “Isaac grew.” That vision of Abraham, in which he saw the day of Christ and the hope which is in Christ, were increasing his joys. And would that you too might be made Isaac and be a joy to your mother the church!
