Certain attentive persons even before us have observed in the Scriptures that presbyters or elders are not so called because they have lived to a great age, but they are honored by this title for their maturity of thought and venerable dignity of life, especially when there is added to presbyter this phrase that follows: “full of days.” For if any “presbyter” or “elder” seemed so named because of his great age, who would have been even more fitting to designate by this name than Adam, or surely Methuselah or Noah, who clearly are declared to have lived far more years in this world than the rest? Yet, we see that indeed not one of these is called “presbyter” or “elder” by Scripture. But Abraham, who lived a much shorter life, is the first to be called “presbyter” or “elder” in holy Scriptures. Also it is said by the Lord to Moses, “Choose presbyters for yourself from all the people, those whom you yourself know to be presbyters.” But see, O hearer, whether anywhere in all Scripture you are able to find the title “an elder, full of days” attributed to any sinner.

But since we have determined that the things that are said about Jesus [Joshua] also refer to our Lord and Savior, whom do we understand to be as much “the presbyter and elder, advanced of days” as the one who is “the beginning, the firstborn of every creature”? And for that reason, perhaps, he alone, before whom there is no one, is truly and properly called presbyter. Therefore, although there are those in the Scriptures who are called presbyters or elders or high priests, nevertheless, among the presbyters or elders the Lord Jesus must be reckoned chief of presbyters, and among bishops, chief of bishops, just as among high priests he is “chief of high priests.” and as among shepherds he is “chief of shepherds.” The Savior must be held first and chief in this and in every honorable title, because he is the “head” of all.
