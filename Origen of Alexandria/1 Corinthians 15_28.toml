As long as I am not subjected to the Father, neither is he said to be “subjected” to the Father. Not that he himself is in need of subjection before the Father, but for me, in whom he has not yet completed his work, he is said not to be subjected, for “we are the body of Christ and members in part.”.

But the heretics, not understanding (I cannot tell why) the apostle’s meaning contained in these words, deprecate using the term subjection in regard to the Son.… Such men do not understand that the subjection of Christ to the Father reveals the blessedness of our perfection and announces the crowning glory of the work undertaken by him.

God will be all things in each person in such a way that everything which the reasoning mind can feel or understand or think will be all God. When purified from all the dregs of its vices and utterly cleared from every cloud of wickedness, the mind will no longer be conscious of anything besides or other than God. That mind will think of God and see God and hold God. God will be the mode and measure of its every movement. In this way God will be all in all.

When “he shall have completed” his “work” and brought his whole creation to the height of perfection, then he is said to be “subjected” in these whom he subjected to the Father. In these “he finished the work that God had given him that God may be all in all.”
