Some may find it difficult or think it is a fable when we say there are many demons to take care of each particular sinner. Let them return to the authority of the Gospel and find that man who lived in the tombs, possessed by the demons. When the Savior asks it, “What is your name?” it answers, “Legion, for we are many.” Why therefore does it seem strange to attribute a demon to a particular kind of sin, since it is written that in a single man an entire legion of demons was found? But I remember saying similar things when we were expounding that verse in the psalms where it says, “In the mornings I wiped out all the sinners on the earth in order to disperse from the city of the Lord all those who do iniquity.” Thus it is also said that “in the hand of the just there are swords that cut in two,” undoubtedly in order for them to destroy opposing powers. But I believe that, in order to bring even more force to these affirmations, we can cite the word of the apostle Paul: “May the God of peace swiftly grind Satan under your feet.” If, in fact, Satan is alone, can he be subjected under the feet of the servants of God and then take action again? If he has been subjected, and subjected by God, he surely can act no longer. Perhaps it will be necessary then to think that there are as many satans as there are those who complete his works. It seems to me that this is also what is indicated in the book of Wisdom26 where it is said, “The impious who curse Satan are cursing their own soul.” But we also find this kind of thinking in a booklet not even contained in the canon, entitled The Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs, that individual satans ought to be recognized in individual sinners. The same idea seems to be expressed in a still more illuminating way when looking at the meaning of its name, according to the instruction of erudite Hebrews: Satan means “adversary.” All those, therefore, who oppose the will of God can be called satans.
