Something in the passage has perhaps escaped our notice. You will find it out by noting how the cup is mentioned in the three Gospels. Matthew writes that the Lord said, “Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me.” Luke writes, “Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me.” Mark writes, “Abba, Father, all things are possible to you, remove this cup from me.” Every martyrdom completed by death for whatever motive is called a cup. See whether you cannot say with him, “Let this cup pass from me.” … “The cup of salvation” in Psalms is the death of the martyrs. That is why the verse “I will take the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord” is followed by “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his saints.”
