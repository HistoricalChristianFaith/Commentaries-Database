Nevertheless, since Jesus recites the law to you and reveals to your hearts its spiritual meaning, do not remain “proselytes,” that is, catechumens, any longer, but hurry to receive fully the grace of God.… And you “children,” “do not be children in your thinking; be babes in evil, but in thinking be mature.” As the apostle says to the Hebrews, “Let us leave the elementary doctrines of Christ and go on to maturity.” But you, too, who under the title women are weak, cast down and tired, you are exhorted to “lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees.”
