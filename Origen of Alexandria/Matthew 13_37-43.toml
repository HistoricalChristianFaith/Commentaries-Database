But when, as we have indicated, he gathers from the whole kingdom of Christ all things that make people stumble, and the reasonings that produce lawless acts are cast into the furnace of fire, and the worse elements utterly consumed … then shall the righteous, having become one light of the sun, shine in the kingdom of their Father. For whom will they shine? For those below them who will enjoy their light, after the analogy of the sun which now shines for those upon the earth? Of course, they will not shine for themselves. But perhaps the saying “Let your light shine before men” can be written “upon the table of the heart,” according to what is said by Solomon, in a threefold way. So even now the light of the disciples of Jesus shines before the rest of humanity, and after death before the resurrection, and after the resurrection “until all shall attain to full maturity” and all become one sun. Then shall they “shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.”
