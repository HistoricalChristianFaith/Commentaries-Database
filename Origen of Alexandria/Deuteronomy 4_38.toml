If we rightly understand the matter, this is the statement of Moses at the beginning of his book: “In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.” For this is the beginning of all creation; to this beginning the end and consummation of all things must be recalled, in order that this heaven and this earth may be the habitation and resting place of the pious. So all the holy ones and the meek obtain an inheritance in that land, since this is the teaching of the Law and the Prophets and the Gospels.
