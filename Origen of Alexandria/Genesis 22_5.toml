He leaves the servants. For the servants were not able to ascend with Abraham to the place of the burnt offering that God had shown him. “You,” therefore, the text says, “stay here, but I and the child will go and when we have worshiped, we will return to you.” Tell me, Abraham, are you saying to the servants in truth that you will worship and return with the child, or are you deceiving them? If you are telling the truth, then you will not make him a burnt offering. If you are deceiving, it is not fitting for so great a patriarch to deceive. What disposition therefore does this statement indicate in you? I am speaking the truth, he says, and I offer the child as a burnt offering. For this reason I carry wood with me, and I return to you with him. For I believe, and this is my faith, that “God is able to raise him up even from the dead.”
