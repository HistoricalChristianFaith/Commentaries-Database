So then in the book of Numbers we find Moses taking an Ethiopian wife—that is to say, one who is dark or black. Because of her Mary and Aaron speak ill of him and say with indignation, “Has the Lord spoken to Moses only? Has he not also spoken to us?” Now on careful consideration the narrative here seems to lack coherence. What has their saying “Has the Lord spoken to Moses only? Has he not also spoken to us?” to do with their indignation about the Ethiopian woman? If that was the trouble, they ought to have said, “Moses, you should not have taken an Ethiopian wife and one of the seed of Ham. You should have married one of your own race and of the house of Levi.” They say not a word about this. They say instead, “Has the Lord spoken to Moses only? Has he not also spoken to us?” Rather, it seems to me that in so saying they understood the thing Moses had done more in terms of the mystery. They saw Moses—that is, the spiritual law—entering now into wedlock and union with the church that is gathered together from among the Gentiles. This is the reason, apparently, why Mary [Miriam], who typified the forsaken synagogue, and Aaron, who stood for the priesthood according to the flesh, seeing their kingdom taken away from them and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof, say, “Has the Lord spoken to Moses only? Has he not also spoken to us?”
