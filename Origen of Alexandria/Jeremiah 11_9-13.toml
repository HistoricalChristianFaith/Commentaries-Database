Do we intend to repent for the sin mentioned concerning the people of Judah, since we know that we are the people of Judah because of Christ, who was prophesied and called Judah? For perhaps it is because there are some sinners among us who act contrary to right reason that the prophet says, “A conspiracy was found among the people of Judah and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.” For whenever a conspiracy of unrighteousness and a conspiracy to commit sin was found in any who in name come from the church—with the result that one can apply to the sinner the statement that “each is caught in the snares of his sins”—God could say, “A conspiracy was found in the people of Judah.” But may no conspiracy be found in us.

Though God justly does not hear those who do not hear him, the demons will be unable to save the just in those who burn incense to them, whenever the time of troubles arrives. Thus, whenever God does not listen, it is dangerous to seek help from demons. But one must depend on God, who has turned away from us due to sins, yet who does not disregard the great and lasting refuge in himself.
