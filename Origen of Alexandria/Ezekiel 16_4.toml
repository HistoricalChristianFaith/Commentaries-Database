Not everyone is washed for salvation. We who have received the grace of baptism in the name of Christ are washed, but I do not know who is washed for salvation.

It is quite difficult that he who is washed should be washed in order to be saved. Listen, catechumens, listen, and from what is said, prepare yourselves, while you are catechumens, while you are not yet baptized, and come to the bath and be baptized for salvation. Do not be so baptized that you are washed but not for salvation.

It is a great work to be rubbed with salt. If we are seasoned with salt, we are full of grace.

The soul that is reborn is barely out of the bath before being enveloped with towels.

To take an example from human relationships, if the Holy Spirit gives, then I travel on to Jesus Christ and God the Father.
