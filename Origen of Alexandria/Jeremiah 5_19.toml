The Word literally said to them, “As you have forsaken me and served other gods in your land, you shall serve in a land not your own.” But every person who makes something a god serves alien gods. Do you deify food and drink? “Your god is the belly.” Do you honor silver and the wealth here below as a great good? Your god and lord is Mammon. For Jesus spoke of the love of money when he said, “You cannot serve God and Mammon. No one can serve two masters.” Thus one who honors money and esteems wealth and supposes that it is good and accepts the rich as gods and despises the poor as not possessing god in their character, deifies silver. If anyone in the land of God, in the church, should worship alien gods by making things worthy to be god that are not to be made god, he will be rejected to an alien land and worship gods that he worshiped when he was inside. Outside let him be rejected by the church as a lover of money; let the one who is a glutton be outside the church.
