The fig tree may be understood to represent the people of the circumcision. The Lord came to them when he was hungry and, “finding no fruit there” but the appearance of life only, said, “May no one ever eat fruit from you again.” At his coming therefore this fig tree, the people of the circumcision, “withered immediately.” But the other fig tree, the one which until that time had been barren and was about to be cut down because no one had ever applied himself diligently to its cultivation, began to bear fruit when fertilizer was spread around it. What was formerly a blight upon the earth will now produce fruit in such abundance sufficient even for the entire time in which it was barren.
