But turn yourself quickly toward the life-giving Spirit and, while avoiding physical terms, look keenly at what is the “left hand” of the Word of God and what is the “right hand” and also what is the “head” of his bride, namely of the perfect soul or of the church, and let not the carnal and changeable sense of the word take hold of you.For this here is the “right hand” and “left hand” of the groom, that is said concerning Wisdom in Proverbs, where she says, “Long life is in her right hand, but in her left hand are riches and glory.”
