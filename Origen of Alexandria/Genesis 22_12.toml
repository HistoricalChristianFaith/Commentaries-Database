In this statement it is usually thrown out against us that God says that “now” he had learned that Abraham fears God, as though he were such as not to have known previously. God knew, and it was not hidden from him, since it is he “who has known all things before they come to pass.” But these things are written on account of you, because you too indeed have believed in God. But unless you fulfill “the works of faith,” unless you are obedient to all the commands, even the more difficult ones, unless you offer sacrifice and show that you place neither father nor mother nor sons before God, you will not know that you fear God. Nor will it be said of you, “Now I know that you fear God.”And yet it must be considered that an angel is related to have spoken these words to Abraham, and subsequently this angel is clearly shown to be the Lord. Whence I think that, just as among us “he was found in appearance as a man,” so also among angels he was found in appearance as an angel. And following his example the angels in heaven rejoice “over one sinner repenting” and glory in the progress people make in their relationship with God. For they, as it were, have charge over our souls, to whom, “while we are still children we are committed,” as it were, “to tutors and governors until the time appointed by the father.” And they therefore now say about the progress of each of us, “Now I know that you fear God.” For example, I intend to be a martyr. An angel could not say to me on this basis, “Now I know that you fear God,” for an intention of the mind is known to God alone. But if I shall undertake the struggles, if I shall utter a “good confession,” if I shall bear calmly all things which are inflicted, then an angel can say, as if confirming and strengthening me, “Now I know that you fear God.”

But grant that these words are spoken to Abraham, and he is said to fear God. Why? Because he did not spare his son. But let us compare these words with those of the apostle, where he says of God: “who spared not his own Son but delivered him up for us all.” Behold God contending with people in magnificent generosity: Abraham offered God a mortal son who was not put to death; God delivered to death an immortal Son for humanity.What shall we say to these things? “What shall we render to the Lord for all the things that he has rendered to us?” God the Father, on account of us, “spared not his own son.” Who of you, do you suppose, will sometime hear the voice of an angel saying, “Now I know that you fear God, because you spared not your son,” or your daughter or wife? Or, you spared not your money or the honors of the world or the ambitions of the world, but you have despised all things and “have counted all things dung that you may gain Christ”? Or, “you have sold all things and have given to the poor and have followed the Word of God?” Who of you, do you think, will hear a word of this kind from the angels? Meanwhile Abraham hears this voice, and it is said to him, “You spared not your beloved son because of me.”
