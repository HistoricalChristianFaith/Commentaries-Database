Sin means “bramble bush” or “temptation.” Thus the hope of good things now begins to smile upon you. What is the hope of good things? The Lord appeared from the bush and answered Moses; and this became the beginning of the Lord’s coming to the children of Israel. But it is not insignificant that Sin also means “temptation.” For visions usually involve temptation. Sometimes an angel of wickedness disguises himself as an angel of light.
