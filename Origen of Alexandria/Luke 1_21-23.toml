When the priest Zechariah offers incense in the temple, he is condemned to silence and cannot speak. Or better, he speaks only with gestures. He remains unable to speak until the birth of his son, John. What does this mean? Zechariah’s silence is the silence of prophets in the people of Israel. God no longer speaks to them. His “Word, which was with the Father from the beginning, and was God,” has passed over to us. For us Christ is not silent.…Christ ceased to be in them. The Word deserted them. What Isaiah wrote was fulfilled: “The daughter of Zion will be deserted like a tent in the vineyard or like a hut in the cucumber patch. She is as desolate as a plundered city.” The Jews were left behind, and salvation passed to the Gentiles.
