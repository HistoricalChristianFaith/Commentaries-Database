Jesus our Lord does not accept witness from demons, as he said, “Be silent and come out of him.” So, in imitation of him, his apostle Paul “grieving” it says, “turned and addressed the spirit of Python, ‘I command you in the name of Jesus Christ, depart from her.’ ” Perhaps you may ask why Paul is grieving when he rebukes the spirit of Python. It had spoken no blasphemy, had it, for it says, “A woman with the spirit of Python was following Paul and his companions and kept shouting, ‘These men are servants of God the most high, and they proclaim to you the way of salvation.’ And she kept doing this for many days.” It is clear that Paul was not grieving because of blasphemy but because he considered testimony given by the spirit of Python unworthy of his message.
