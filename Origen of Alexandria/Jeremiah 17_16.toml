“Behold, they say to me, ‘Where is the word of the Lord? Let it come.’ But I have not been weary of following you.” Jesus says to you, “Take up your cross, and follow me,” and, “Leave everything, and follow me,” and, “He who does not leave behind father and mother and follow me is not worthy to be my disciple.” If, then, you become such a person so as to follow Jesus in every way, and you will follow, and to the extent you do follow, you will not be weary. “For there is no hardship in Jacob, nor will distress be seen in Israel.” There is no toil in following Jesus. The following itself takes away the toil. In order that we may no longer be weary, since we are weary before beginning to follow him, that is why he says, “Come to me, all who are weary and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.”
