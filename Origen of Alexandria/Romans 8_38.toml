Here we pass from human temptations to superhuman trials. Of the former Paul says that we can overcome them, but although he does not say this of the latter—for only Christ can conquer them—nevertheless even here there is reason to speak of victory, since even with all the forces of the enemy ranged against us, nothing can separate us from the love of God.“Death” here refers primarily to the death which separates the soul from the love of God, rather than what we usually think of as death, which merely separates the soul from the body. “Life” here presumably refers to the life of sin, which is constantly trying to separate us from the love of God.
“Angels” and “principalities” must refer to the devil and his hosts, against whom we have to struggle. “Things present” are the desires of this world, and “things to come” are the trials and temptations which may yet afflict us in this life. The “powers” are spiritual beings rather like angels, who must, however, be distinguished from them. They also fight to separate us from the love of God, but they cannot prevail if that love is rooted and grounded in us.
