We have read from the book of Genesis the story where it is related that after the appearance of the three men, after the destruction of Sodom and the salvation of Lot, either due to his hospitality or because of his kinship to Abraham, “Abraham departed thence,” the text says, “to the south” and came to the king of the Philistines. It is related also that he made an agreement with Sarah his wife that she should not say that she was Abraham’s wife but his sister. It is also said that King Abimelech took her, but God went in to Abim-elech at night and said to him, “You have not touched this woman, and I have not permitted you to touch her, etc.” But after this Abimelech gave Sarah back to her husband and at the same time rebuked Abraham for not having told him the truth. It is also related that, as a prophet, Abraham prayed for Abimelech, “and the Lord healed Abimelech and his wife and his handmaids.” And the omnipotent God was concerned to heal even the handmaids of Abimelech, “since he had closed up their wombs that they might not bear.” But they began to bear because of Abraham’s prayer.If anyone wishes to hear and understand these words literally, he ought to gather with the Jews rather than with the Christians. But if he wishes to be a Christian and a disciple of Paul, let him hear Paul saying that “the law is spiritual,” declaring that these words are “allegorical” when the law speaks of Abraham and his wife and sons. And although no one of us can by any means easily discover what kind of allegories these words should contain, nevertheless one ought to pray that “the veil might be removed” from the heart. “If there is anyone who tries to turn to the Lord”—“for the Lord is Spirit”9—the Lord might remove the veil of the letter and uncover the light of the Spirit. [Then] we might be able to say that “beholding the glory of the Lord with open face we are transformed into the same image from glory to glory, as by the Spirit of the Lord.”
