Not true Priests and elders, but Priests and elders of what seemed the people of God, but was indeed the people of Gomorrah; these, not knowing God's High Priest, laid a plot against Him, not recognising the firstborn of the whole creation, (Col. 1:15.) yea, even against Him that was elder than them all, did they take counsel.

The words of the prophet, "And the rulers took counsel together against the Lord and his anointed," were fulfilled when "the chief priests and elders of the people gathered in the court of the high priest" and took counsel together "against the Lord and his anointed." They were not true priests but "of the people" and "elders." They only seemed to be the people of God but were after all the people of Gomorrah. It was they who would say, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" and "Away from the earth with such a one!" Furthermore, what Isaiah said, "Hear the word of the Lord, O leaders of Sodom; pay heed to God's law, O people of Gomorrah," applies to the Jewish leaders who lived at the time of Christ. And what Ezekiel said to Jerusalem, "It will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom than for you," can be said more rightly of Jeru-salem, over which the Lord wept, than of the time of the prophet. The chief priests sinned more greatly than Sodom. They did not recognize God's high priest but plotted against him. The elders of the people, not knowing the "firstborn of every creature" and the one who is older than all creatures, took counsel against him. Jerusalem was forsaken at that so-called court where "they took counsel together how they might seize Jesus by stealth." Unfortunately this was the city that first killed the prophets and then the Lord of the prophets. That city took action against the founder of the whole world.
