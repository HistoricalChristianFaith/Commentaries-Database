Whence Bethphage is interpreted, The house of the Shoulder; for the shoulder was the priest's portion in the Law. It follows, Then Jesus sent two of his disciples.,

Or when they say, Hosanna to the Son of David; Blessed is He that cometh in the name of the Lord, it is the dispensation of Christ's humanity that they set forth; but His restoration to the holy places when then say, Hosanna in the highest.

Whence also, when He ascended into heaven, He gave command to His disciples that they should loose sinners, for which also He gave them the Holy Spirit. But being loosed, and making progress, and being nourished by the Divinity of the Word, they are held worthy to be sent back to the place whence they were taken, but no more to their former labours, but to preach to them the Son of God, and this is what He signifies when He says, And straightway He will send them.
