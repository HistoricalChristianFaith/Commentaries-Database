This is similar to what Paul says later on [in verse 14]: “We know that the law is spiritual.” It was not only Paul who knew that the law was spiritual but these people too, who had been taught by it and who were spiritual themselves.… Before the coming of Christ there were many Jews who grew in spiritual knowledge and saw God’s glory, e.g., Isaiah, of whom John testifies when he says: “Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.”
