It is said that God made those miserable garments with which the first man was clothed after he had sinned. “For God made skin tunics and clothed Adam and his wife.” Therefore, those were tunics of skin taken from animals. For with such as these, it was necessary for the sinner to be dressed. It says, “with skin tunics,” which are a symbol of the mortality that he received because of his skin and of his frailty that came from the corruption of the flesh. But if you have been already washed from these and purified through the law of God, then Moses will dress you with a garment of incorruptibility so that “your shame may never appear”and “that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.”
