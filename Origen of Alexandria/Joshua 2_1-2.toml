Meanwhile, the spies are sent by Jesus [Joshua] to Jericho and are received by the prostitute Rahab. Those spies, who are sent before the face of Jesus [Joshua], can also be considered the messengers of God, just as it is written, “Behold, I send my messenger before your face who will prepare your paths.” This passage, fulfilled invisibly through others, was fulfilled visibly through John, about whom this was also written. Because the scribes and Pharisees did not believe him, the Lord spoke concerning the baptism of John and said that the “prostitutes and publicans who believed” were baptized. The same thing is fulfilled in the fact that the prostitute received the spies of Jesus [Joshua] and is snatched away and brought back from the destruction of every hostile nation.

Nevertheless, our Jesus [Joshua] sends spies to the king of Jericho, and they are received hospitably by a prostitute. But the prostitute who received the spies sent by Jesus [Joshua] was no longer a prostitute since she received them. Indeed, everyone of us was a prostitute in his heart as long as he lived according to the desires and lusts of the flesh.
