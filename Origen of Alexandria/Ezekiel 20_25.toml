Having forgotten the benefits and marvels performed by God, they set up the head of a calf. For this reason, therefore, precepts are given to them by which they are tested. Hence it is that through the prophet Ezekiel the Lord says to them, “I gave you precepts and ordinances that were not good, by which you will not live.” For when they were tested in the precepts of the Lord, they were not found faithful.

We hold, then, that the law has a twofold sense—the one literal, the other spiritual—as has been shown by some before us. Of the first or literal sense it is said, not by us but by God, speaking in one of the prophets, that “the statutes are not good, and the judgments not good”; whereas, taken in a spiritual sense, the same prophet makes God say that “his statutes are good, and his judgments are good.”
