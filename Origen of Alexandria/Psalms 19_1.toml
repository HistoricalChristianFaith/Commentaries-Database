If someone, hypothetically, should seem to believe in Jesus but should not believe that the God of the law and of the gospel is one, whose glory the heavens declare, since they were made by him, and the work of whose hands the firmament proclaims, since it is their work, this person would be deficient in the greatest article of faith.

Any who are perfect, who have been made heavenly or have become [part] of heaven, “declare the glory of God,” as it says in the psalm. For this reason in brief also the apostles who were of heaven were sent to declare the glory of God and received the name of Boanerges, “which is the sons of thunder,” that by the power of thunder we might believe them truly to be heavens.
