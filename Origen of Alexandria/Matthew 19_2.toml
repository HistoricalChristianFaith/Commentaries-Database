Note that there is a distinction here between the crowds who simply followed and Peter and the others who “left everything and followed” and Matthew, who arose and followed him—he did not simply follow but “having arisen”; for “having arisen” is an important addition. There are always those, then, who follow at a distance like the great multitudes yet who have not arisen that they may follow, nor have they given up all that was theirs formerly. But they are few who have arisen and followed, who also, in the regeneration, shall sit on twelve thrones. Only, if one wishes to be healed, let him follow Jesus.
