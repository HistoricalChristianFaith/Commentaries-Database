Moreover, the commandment, “Do not bear a burden on the sabbath day,” seems to me impossible. For by these words the Jewish teachers have fallen into “endless fables,” as the apostle says, by saying that it is not reckoned a “burden” if someone has shoes without nails, but that it is a “burden” if someone has gallic10 shoes with nails. And if someone carries something on one shoulder, they judge it a “burden,” but if he carries it on both shoulders, they will deny it is a burden.
