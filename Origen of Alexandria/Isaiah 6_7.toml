We read also in Isaiah that the prophet is purified with fire by “one of the seraphim which was sent to him, when he took with a pair of tongs one coal from those which were upon the altar; and he touched the lips of the prophet and said, Behold, I have taken away your iniquities.” These appear to me to be mystical and to indicate that the coals are put on the members of each in proportion to his sins, if he is worthy to be purified. For since the prophet says here, “I have unclean lips; also I dwell in the midst of a people who have unclean lips.” For this reason, “a coal taken up with a pair of tongs” by the seraphim cleanses his lips.… The cleansing of his lips indicates that Isaiah’s sin continually would be found only in words, but he would not have sinned in any act or deed. Otherwise, he would have said since I have an unclean body or I have unclean eyes, if he had sinned in desiring what belongs to something other than his lips. He would have said I have unclean hands, if he had polluted these with unjust deeds. But now since possibly he was aware of his transgression in word alone, about which the Lord says, “Likewise, you will give an account for every useless word on the day of judgment”; because it is difficult even for the perfect to escape the fault of the word, the prophet was likewise in need only of a purification of his lips.
