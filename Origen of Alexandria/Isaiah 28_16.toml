And if in reading the Scripture you stumble on a good thought that is a “stumbling stone and a rock of offense,” blame yourself. For do not despair that this “stumbling stone and rock of offense” have meanings so as to fulfill the saying, “And the one who believes will not be put to shame.” Believe first, and you will discover much holy aid beneath the supposed offense. For if we ourselves receive the commandment not to speak a “careless word as we will render an account of it on the day of judgment,” and if we earnestly aspire, as far as possible, to make it so that every word coming out of our mouth works both on us who speak it and on those who hear it, what else is there need to understand about the prophets than that every word spoken through their mouth was one which works? And do not be amazed if every word spoken by the prophets works a work which is fitting for a word. For I think that every extraordinary letter written in the words of God works, and there is not “an iota or one dot” written in the Scripture which does not work in those who know to use the power of the Scriptures.
