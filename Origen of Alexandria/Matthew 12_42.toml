The church of the Gentiles, which in truth is gathered “from the ends of the earth,” fulfills the place of the queen of the south, not providing gifts in “perishable things, silver” and spices, but faith, the incense of knowledge, the outpouring of an offering, the sweat of the virtues and the blood of martyrdom. For with such gifts the true Solomon is pleased, who is Christ, “our peace.” For “Solomon” is interpreted as “peaceful.”
