But I say, Has the Lord used iniquity to snatch the nations from the power of his enemies and recall them to faith in him and to his dominion? By no means. For “Israel” was once “the Lord’s portion,” but they made Israel turn from their God in sin, and because of their sins God said to them, “Behold, you have been separated by your sins and because of your sins you have been scattered under the whole heaven.” But again he says to them, “If your dispersion should be from one end of heaven to the other, from there I will gather you, says the Lord.” Because, therefore, “the princes of this world” had first invaded “the Lord’s portion,” “the good shepherd” had, necessarily, the ninety and nine having been left on the heights, to descend to the lands and seek the one sheep that was lost, and when it was found and carried back on his shoulders, to recall it to the sheepfold of perfection on high.
