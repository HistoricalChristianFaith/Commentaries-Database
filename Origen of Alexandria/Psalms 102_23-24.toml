That which is said is also fulfilled in the saint: “I will recall you from there in the end.” For the end is considered to be the perfection of things and the consummation of virtues. Indeed for this reason also another saint said, “Don’t recall me in the midst of my days.” And again the Scripture bestows testimony on the great patriarch Abraham since “Abraham died full of days.” This statement, therefore, “I will recall you from there in the end,” is as if he had said, Since “you have fought a good fight, you have kept the faith, you have finished the course,” I will now recall you from this world to the future blessing, to the perfection of eternal life, to “the crown of justice that the Lord will give in the end of the ages to all who love him.”
