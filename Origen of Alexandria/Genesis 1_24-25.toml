In the present text, I think the impulses of our outer man, that is, of our carnal and earthly man, are indicated by this which is said: “Let the earth bring forth the living creatures according to their kind, four-footed creatures, creeping creatures and beasts on the earth according to their kind.” In brief the text indicated nothing winged in these things that are said about the flesh, but only “four-footed creatures, creeping creatures and beasts of the earth.” According to that, to be sure, which is said by the apostle, that “no good dwells in my flesh” and that “the wisdom of the flesh is hostile to God,” those are certainly things that the earth, that is, our flesh, produces.
