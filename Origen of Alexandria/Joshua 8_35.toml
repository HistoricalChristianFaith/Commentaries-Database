But also even “women and infants and proselytes” are joined to the church of the Lord. If we understand women and infants and proselytes separately and consider each of them to be as though a certain follower of the church—because “in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels, but also wood and earthen”—we say that to strong men, indeed strong food is delivered. This is clearly to those of whom the apostle says, “Solid food is for the mature,” out of whom he prepares for himself a church “not having spot or wrinkle or anything of these.” But those whom he sets apart by the name of “women or infants or proselytes,” let us understand them to be persons who still “need milk” or as though “weak,” since they are women, “they feed upon vegetables.” But if everyone together is accepted to be the church, the “men,” indeed, are understood to be those who, perfect among all these, know to stand “armed against the wiles of the devil”;34 but the “women” are those who do not yet produce from themselves the things that are useful, but from imitating the men and following their example. They are even said to have their head from them: “For the head of a woman is man.” But the “infants” will be those who with the faith newly received are nourished by the gospel milk. “Proselytes” seem to be the catechumens, or those who now are eager to be associated with the faith. Even John, perceiving similar things about these separate groups, writes and determines in his epistle which deeds are peculiar to which individual ages. …For divine Scripture does not know how to make a separation of men and women according to sex. For indeed sex is no distinction in the presence of God, but a person is designated either a man or woman according to the diversity of spirit.
