The parable in the Gospel of Luke is about a man who went down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves. The priest and the Levite passed by him, but the Samaritan came on him on his journey, saw him, had compassion, approached him and bound up his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Now, if someone is able to prove that what is said about the Samaritan who healed this man who was half-dead and who had fallen among thieves refers to one other than the Savior, he will also show why the Savior did not deny that he was a Samaritan.
