Is it not the case then, if such a great man was under the earth and the medium did bring him up, that a little demon has sway over the soul of the prophet? What can I say? These things are recorded. Is it true or is it not true? To say that it is not true drives us to unbelief. It comes down on the heads of those who speak it. But to say it is true presents for us an enquiry and quandary.And we well know that some among our brothers look askance at the Scripture and say, I do not believe in the medium. The medium says that she saw Samuel. She is lying! Samuel was not brought up. Samuel does not speak. Just as there are false prophets who say, “Thus says the Lord,” and “The Lord did not speak,” so too this little demon lies when it proclaims that it brings up the one pointed out by Saul. For, “whom shall I bring up?” He says, “Bring up Samuel for me.” These things are said by those who state that this history is not true.

For what is it which has been written? “And the woman said, Whom shall I bring up for you?” Whose expression is the one which says, “The woman said”? Is it the expression of the Holy Spirit, from whom the Scripture is believed to be recorded, or is it the expression of someone else? For the narrative expression, as those involved with all sorts of words also know, is above all the expression of the author. And the author for all of these words has not been believed to be a human, but the author is the Holy Spirit who moves humans.
