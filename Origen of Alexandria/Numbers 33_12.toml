Raphaca [Dophkah] means “health.” You see the order of the progresses, how when the soul is once made spiritual and begins to have the discernment of heavenly visions, it arrives at health.… For the soul has many infirmities. Avarice is one of the worst of its infirmities; pride, anger, boasting, fear, inconstancy, timidity, and the like. When, Lord Jesus, will you cure me of all these infirmities? When will you heal me so that I may say, “Bless the Lord, O my soul, who heals all your infirmities” so that I may be able to make a stage at Raphaca [Dophkah], which is healing?
