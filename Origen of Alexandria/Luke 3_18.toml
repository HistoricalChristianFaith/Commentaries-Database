One who teaches the word of the gospel proclaims not just one thing but many.… Therefore John also preached “other things” to the people, which have not been recorded. But consider how many things there are that have been recorded. He proclaimed Christ. He pointed him out. He preached the baptism of the Holy Spirit. He taught the tax collectors salvation and the soldiers discipline. He taught that the threshing floor was being cleansed, trees cut down, and the rest, which the account in the Gospel narrates. Hence, apart from these things that have been written down, he is shown to have proclaimed other things which are not written down. For the Scripture says, “He also proclaimed many other things to the people and encouraged them.”
