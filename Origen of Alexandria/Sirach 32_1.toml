Joshua gave the inheritance to all of the children of Judah. He who gave it to Ephraim and to the half-tribe of Manasseh. He gave the inheritance to the glorious Caleb, son of Jephunneh, having sent three men from each tribe to go through the country and describe it in a book4 and return to show it to them. He himself drew the lots for all and reserved the last place for himself. Why do you think he wanted to be last? Certainly to be the first of all. He did not take this part of himself but received it from the people, who gave the inheritance to the one from whom they had received it. In fact, it is written, “The children of Israel gave the part to Joshua, son of Nun.” “But this happened to them as a sign,” that it might be proposed as a model for us and that we in turn might observe the precept he practiced, which says, “The greater you are, the more humble you will be, and thus you will find grace with the Lord,” and also that which is written, “If they have made you the head, do not exalt yourself but be among them as one of them.”
