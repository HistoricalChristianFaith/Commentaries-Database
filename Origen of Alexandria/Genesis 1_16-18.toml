As those lights of heaven that we see have been set “for signs and seasons and days and years,” that they might give light from the firmament of heaven to those who are on the earth, so also Christ, illuminating his church, gives signs by his precepts, that one might know how, when the sign has been received, to escape the “wrath to come,” lest “that day overtake him like a thief,” but that rather he can reach “the acceptable year of the Lord.” Christ, therefore, is the “true light which enlightens every man coming into this world.” From his light the church itself also having been enlightened is made “the light of the world” enlightening those “who are in darkness,” as also Christ himself testifies to his disciples saying, “You are the light of the world.”

Just as the sun and the moon are said to be the great lights in the firmament of heaven, so also are Christ and the church in us. But since God also placed stars in the firmament, let us see what are also stars in us, that is, in the heaven of our heart. Moses is a star in us, which shines and enlightens us by his acts. And so are Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, David, Daniel, and all to whom the Holy Scriptures testify that they pleased God. For just as “star differs from star in glory” so also each of the saints, according to his own greatness, sheds his light upon us.
