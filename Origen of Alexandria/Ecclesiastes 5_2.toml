[It might be that] a person dedicates himself rashly, without comprehending what is esoteric of the wisdom of God and of the Word who is “in the beginning with God” and who is himself God. And … it is by means of the Word and God and by means of the wisdom with him that one must examine and discover these things. [Then] it must happen that he, by falling into myths and nonsense and fictions, submits himself to the danger that surrounds impiety. For that reason one must remember also the commandment from Solomon in Ecclesiastes concerning such things, which says, “Do not hasten to express a word before the face of God. For God is in the heaven above, and you are on the earth below. Therefore let your words be few.”

The passage in Ecclesiastes “Be not in haste to utter speech before God, because God is in heaven above and you on earth below” is intended to show the gap which separates those who are in the “body of humiliation” from him who is with the angels exalted by the help of the Word and from the holy powers with Christ himself. For it is not unreasonable that he should be strictly “at the Father’s throne,” allegorically called heaven, while his church, termed earth, is a footstool at his feet.
