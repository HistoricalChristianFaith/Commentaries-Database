Scripture designates the children of adulterers as imperfect. Such a soul, to be sure, that prostrates itself totally to the tendencies of the flesh and bodily desires, has forsaken union with the spirit, and as if turned away from God will shamelessly hear, “You have the face of a harlot. You have made yourself shameless to all.” She will be punished, therefore, like a harlot, and her children will be ordered to be prepared for slaughter.
