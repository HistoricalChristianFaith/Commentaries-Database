Why does Paul mention only commendation from God and say nothing about condemnation? The reason seems to be that only that which is commendable will reach Godâ€™s ears; the rest will be passed over in silence. I would even go so far as to say that it is God who receives the commendable things we have done, whereas the rest goes straight to the devil.
