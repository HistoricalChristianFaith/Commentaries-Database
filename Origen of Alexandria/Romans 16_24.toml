Marcion, who interpolated both the Gospels and the Epistles, deleted this passage [Romans 16:24] from the text, and not only this but everything [after 16:25] as well. In other manuscripts not edited by Marcion we find this passage in different places. Some have it immediately after [16:25], and others have it here, at the end of the epistle.
