We should observe in reading the holy Scriptures how “to go up” and “to go down” are employed in each individual passage. For if we were to give diligent consideration, we would discover that almost never is anyone said to have gone down to a holy place, nor is anyone related to have gone up to a blameworthy place. These observations show that the divine Scripture was not composed, as it seems to most, in illiterate and uncultivated language but was adapted in accordance with the discipline of divine instruction. Nor is Scripture devoted so much to historical narratives as to things and ideas that are mystical.You will find it written, therefore, that those who are born of the seed of Abraham have gone down into Egypt and again that the sons of Israel have gone up out of Egypt. Indeed Scripture speaks thus also of Abraham himself: “But Abraham went up out of Egypt into the desert, he and his wife and all that was his, and Lot with him.”
