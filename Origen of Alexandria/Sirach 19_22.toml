In the book that among us is usually considered to be among the books of Solomon and is called Ecclesiasticus but among the Greeks is called the Wisdom of Jesus, son of Sirach, it is written: “All wisdom is from God.” Possibly we could interpret this to mean that even that wisdom of this world, which is said to be destined for destruction, is from God, and that of the rulers of this world, and if there is any other through which false wisdom is commended. However, in the same little book it was said later on: “For the wisdom of evil is not instruction.” By this he surely shows that all instruction that asserts anything false, even if it seems vigorous and truthful and the kind that could scarcely be undermined, nevertheless we should by no means attach the name of wisdom to knowledge of this sort. Well then, what is the meaning of the statement “All wisdom is from God”?To me the following sense seems apparent: we may designate as wisdom given by the Lord either every skill that is considered necessary for human use in a craft or the knowledge of any matter may be called wisdom given by the Lord. After all, in Job it is written, “Who has given women the wisdom to weave and the knowledge of embroidery?”
