The inhabited world arises in no other way than in the wisdom of God. For “wisdom gives strength to the wise beyond ten rulers who live in the city.” “And the one who despises wisdom and instruction is miserable, and his hope empty, and his labors unprofitable, and his works useless,” says the Book of Wisdom ascribed to Solomon. Hence insofar as possible, since the inhabited world is set aright in the wisdom of God, let us ourselves desire that our inhabited world, which perhaps has fallen, be set aright. For this inhabited world has fallen whenever we went to the place of affliction. This inhabited world has fallen whenever “we sinned, did wrong, acted wickedly,” and it has need of being set aright.
