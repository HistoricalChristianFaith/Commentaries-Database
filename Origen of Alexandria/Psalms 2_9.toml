It is necessary to consider how the Father gave the nations to the Son as an inheritance and the ends of the earth as a possession. He says to him, “You will break them like a clay pot.” For who gives an inheritance so that it may be broken by the heir? It must be demonstrated from Scripture, therefore, how the contrition of certain people proved so beneficial. We find in the fiftieth psalm, “Having brought a spiritual sacrifice to God, a contrite and humble heart God will not despise.” And it is said in another prophecy as instruction, “You will wail for the brokenness of your spirit.” There is a spirit within us, therefore, that it is necessary to destroy in order that it may become a contrite sacrifice to God.
