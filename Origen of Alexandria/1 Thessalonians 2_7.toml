But another might say that the perfect man is here called little, applying the word, “For he that is least among you all, the same is great.” He will affirm that he who humbles himself and becomes a child in the midst of all that believe, though he be an apostle or a bishop, and becomes such “as when a nurse cherishes her own children,” is the little one pointed out by Jesus. He will also affirm that the angel of such a person is worthy to behold the face of God. The little are here called perfect, according to the passage “He that is least among you all, the same is great.” Paul said, “Unto me who am less than the least of all saints was this grace given.” These are in harmony with the saying, “Whoever shall cause one of these little ones to stumble,” and “So it is not the will of my Father in heaven that one of these little ones should perish.”
