“Today you will be with me in paradise.” Through saying this, he also gave to all those who believe and confess access to the entrance that Adam previously had closed by sinning. Who else could remove “the flaming turning sword which was placed to guard the tree of life” and the gates of paradise? What other sentinel was able to turn the “cherubim” from their incessant vigil, except only he to whom “was given all power in heaven and in earth”? No one else besides him could do these things.

“I will recall you from there in the end.” I think this means that at the end of the ages his only-begotten Son descended even into the nether regions, for the salvation of the world and recalled “the first-formed man” from there. Understand that what he said to the thief, “This day you shall be with me in paradise,” was not said to him alone but also to all the saints for whom he had descended into the nether regions. In this man more than in Jacob the words will be fulfilled, “I will recall you from there in the end.”
