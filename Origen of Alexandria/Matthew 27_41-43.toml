“So also [as others were passing along and blaspheming him] the chief priests and the scribes” were passing along. Thwarted by his power and authority, they said to him, “He saved others; he cannot save himself.” In other words, they did not believe that he who was able to save others was much more able to save himself. They promised that they would “believe in” him as the king of Israel if they saw him “come down from the cross.” But he had no mind to do anything unworthy of himself out of revenge or to do what they considered beyond belief and extraordinary.
