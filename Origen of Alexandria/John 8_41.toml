In so far as we commit sins, we have not as yet put off the generation of the devil, even if we are thought to believe in Jesus. Consequently Jesus says to those Jews who have believed, “You do the works of your father,” “father” meaning the devil because of the statement “You are of your father the devil.” Now, if everyone “who commits sin is of the devil,” everyone who is not of the devil does not commit sin. In addition, if “the reason the Son of God appeared was that he might destroy the works of the devil,” to the extent that he has not yet destroyed the works of the devil in us, because we have not presented ourselves to him who destroys the works of the devil, we have not as yet put aside being children of the devil, since it is our fruits that show whose sons we are.

I ask whether those Jews who are said to have believed in him do not respond rather vindictively, because they were reproved as not being children of Abraham, by hinting in a veiled manner that the Savior was born of fornication. They assume this as probable because they do not accept his famous and widely discussed birth from the Virgin.

The Savior said that God was his Father and acknowledged no man as his father. Hence it is likely because of the statement “We have not been born of fornication,” that, to give offense, they in turn add, “We have one father, God.” It is as if they were saying, “We are the ones who have one Father, God, rather than you, who claim to have been born of a virgin, though you were born of fornication. You boast that you have been born of a virgin by saying that you have God alone as your one Father. We who acknowledge God as our Father do not deny that we also have a human father.”
