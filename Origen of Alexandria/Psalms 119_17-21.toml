We should ask the Father of the Word during each individual reading “when Moses is read,” that he might fulfill even in us that which is written in the Psalms: “Open my eyes, and I will consider the wondrous things of your law.” For unless he himself opens our eyes, how shall we be able to see these great mysteries that are fashioned in the patriarchs, that are pictured now in terms of wells, now in marriages, now in births, now even in barrenness?

Therefore, let us fall, if it is necessary, into your detractions so long as the church, which has already turned to Christ the Lord, may know the truth of the Word that is completely covered under the veil of the letter. For thus the apostle said, “if anyone turns to the Lord, the veil will be removed; for where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” Thus, the Lord, the Holy Spirit, must be entreated by us to remove every cloud and all darkness that obscures the vision of our hearts hardened with the stains of sins in order that we may be able to behold the spiritual and wonderful knowledge of his law, according to him who said, “Take the veil from my eyes, and I shall observe the wonders of your law.”
