Each of us, however small, however insignificant, even if he possesses no standing in the world, can be afflicted by the vice of pride. And nothing is as base and detestable, as Scripture says, as a proud poor person or a mendacious rich person. Sometimes this sickness of pride penetrates not only among the poor but assails even the very order of priests and Levites. At times we find it even among us, who are put forth as examples of humility and gathered around the altar as a mirror for those who watch, and yet among whom the vice of arrogance sends its stench. Thus it happens that from the altar of the Lord, which should burn with the sweet aroma of incense, emanates the pestilent odor of pride and self-importance.
