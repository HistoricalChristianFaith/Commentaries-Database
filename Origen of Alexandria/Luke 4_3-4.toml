Mark and Luke say that Jesus “was tempted for forty days.” It is clear that during those days the devil first tempted him from a distance to sleep, apathy, cowardice, and other such sins. Then, since he knew that Christ was hungry, the devil came closer to him and attacked him openly. Notice what he does. He had heard, both from John and from the voice that came from above, that “this man is a son of God.” He did not know that “the Son of God” had become man, for God concealed the inexpressible incarnation from him. So he assumed that Christ was a man who was pleasing to God because of his virtues. He was also jealous of him because of this honor just as he had been jealous of the old Adam. He was eager to cast this man down, just as he had cast Adam down. So he approaches Jesus and introduces the first temptation, that of gluttony, through which he had also captured the first Adam. Since there was no food anywhere, because the whole region was a desert, he knew that bread would satisfy Christ’s hunger. He himself does not produce bread, because Christ was not going to take it from the enemy. But he commands him to make bread from the stones that he points to. Look at Satan’s wiles and great wickedness—he tried to keep Christ from knowing his plot. He did not simply say, “Turn the stones into loaves of bread,” but he prefixed it with, “If you are a son of God.” He did this to show that he wanted this act done to prove that Christ is a son of God. For he was thinking that Christ would be provoked by his words and offended by the suggestion that he was not a “son of God.” He thought that Christ would not recognize the deception and, as a man who has power from God, turn the stones into bread. Then, when he saw the bread, he would yield to his stomach, since he was very hungry. But the devil did not escape the notice of him who “catches the wise in their craftiness.” Christ answered him and said, “It is written, ‘Man shall not live by bread alone,’ ” and the rest, because he knew the devil’s villainy. He did not perform the sign that the devil sought, because he worked his signs to help those who saw them.
