The expression “we have need” is applied to those things that are necessary for life. Consequently, applied to material things, it means that one does not need most things but only those of which Paul says, “but having food and clothing, we shall be satisfied with these things.” Those things, [by contrast], that are accumulated in wealth and luxury are the result of abundance among those who live luxuriously. They are not considered to be necessary and absolutely essential but to be superfluous. So, therefore, there are also things that are necessary for us in the realm of divine matters, which bring us into life and cause us to be in the one who says, “I am the life.” But what supersedes these things would be said to supersede need. It is said of such things, “Delight in the Lord, and he will give you the requests of your heart.” These include all the things that are considered in relation to the paradise of luxury and in relation to wealth and glory, the things in the left hand of wisdom according to him who said, “For length of life and years of life are in her right hand, but in her left hand are wealth and glory.” One would say that these go beyond necessity.
