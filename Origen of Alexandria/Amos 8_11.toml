When “Joseph was about thirty years old” he was released from his chains and interpreted Pharaoh’s dream. He was made the governor of Egypt. During the time of plenty, he gathered in the wheat, so that during the time of famine he would have some to distribute. I think that Joseph’s age of thirty came before as a type of the Savior’s thirty years. For this second Joseph did not gather in the kind of wheat that first Joseph did in Egypt. He, Jesus, gathers in true and heavenly wheat, so that in the time of abundance he might gather in the wheat that he will give out when famine is sent upon Egypt, “not hunger for bread or thirst for water, but hunger to hear the word of the Lord.”

It is prophesied, “Their young men will die by the sword, and their sons and daughters will perish in famine.” Those who hindered Jesus from teaching have not simply perished by the sword. But now, after the advent of the Lord, a more profound famine has come upon them. It is “not a famine of bread or thirst of water, but a famine of hearing the Word of the Lord.” For the “Lord almighty” no longer “speaks” with them. This famine portends that prophecy would cease. And why do I say prophecy? The Lord ceased teaching them. Even if they bear the title sage a thousand times with them, the Word of the Lord is still not among them, since the verse has been fulfilled: “The Lord took away from Judea and Jerusalem the strong man and strong woman, the giant and the strong man, and the soldier and judge and prophet and diviner and elder and captain of fifty and the admirable adviser and master builder and intelligent pupil.” For he is no longer able to say, “Like a master builder I laid a foundation.” The builders have passed over, have come to the church, have laid the foundation, Jesus Christ. Those who came after them have also built on him.
