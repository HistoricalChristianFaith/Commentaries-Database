They didn’t fall away in the daytime but at night, and it was on the night in which Jesus was betrayed. Peter also denied Christ at night, not during the day. Moreover, it was still in the middle of the night, since the cock had not yet crowed. Anyone who questions how the disciples could have fallen away after seeing such great signs and wonders and after hearing words of equal power (for the signs and wonders were performed by his words) should realize that Christ wanted to demonstrate through this warning that just as “no one can say that Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit,” so also no one is able to keep from falling away except by the Holy Spirit. When what Jesus had foretold came to pass, “You will all fall away from me this night,” it was still true that “the Holy Spirit had not yet been given because Jesus had not yet been glorified.” If we … who have already professed Jesus to be Lord by the Holy Spirit (for “all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God”), then fall away or deny him, we will not have an excuse like those who fell away or denied him without the Holy Spirit.
