Who of those who hear Jesus say of John, “If you wish to receive it, he is Elijah who is to come,” would not inquire how John says to those who ask, “Are you Elijah?” “I am not”? Will he not also inquire how one ought to consider John himself to be Elijah who is to come, according to Malachi’s statement: … “And behold, I am sending you Elijah the Tishbite before the great and renewed Day of the Lord comes, who will restore the heart of the father to his son and the heart of a man to his neighbor, lest I come and smite the earth utterly”?

And what is the source of your belief that Elijah who is to come will baptize? He did not even baptize the wood on the altar in the times of Ahab, when it needed a bath that it might be burned up when the Lord appeared in the fire. He commanded the priests to do this, and not only once, for he says, “Do it a second time, when also they did it for a second time.” And “Do it a third time, when also they did it a third time.” How, then, will he who did not baptize at that time but gave the task to others, baptize when he has come in fulfillment of things said by Malachi? Christ therefore does not baptize in water but his disciples. He reserves for himself the act of baptizing with the Holy Spirit and fire.
