Many attacks were made on the gospel when it was first preached, but Paul learned patience from the prophets who said: “Fear not the reproach of men, and be not dismayed at their revilings.” He knew that he should preach the gospel, “not in plausible words of human wisdom but in the power of the Spirit.” Therefore, defining what the gospel is, he proclaims: “It is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has faith, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.” When he says the power of God for salvation he implies that there is another power of God which is not for salvation but for damnation. It may be that it is because of these different powers that right and left are distinguished in God, so that the power for salvation would be identified with the right, and the power by which he condemns would be identified with the left.
