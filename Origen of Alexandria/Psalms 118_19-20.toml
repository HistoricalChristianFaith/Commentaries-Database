In this place, then, the gates of hades are spoken of; but in the Psalms the prophet gives thanks saying, “He who lifts me up from the gates of death that I may declare all your praises in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” And from this we learn that it is never possible for anyone to be fit to declare the praises of God, unless he has been lifted up from the gates of death and has come to the gates of Zion. Now the gates of Zion may be conceived as opposed to the gates of death, so that there is one gate of death, dissoluteness, but a gate of Zion, self-control; and so a gate of death, unrighteousness, but a gate of Zion, righteousness, which the prophet shows forth saying, “This is the gate of the Lord, the righteous shall enter into it.” And again there is cowardice, a gate of death, but courage, a gate of Zion; and want of prudence, a gate of death, but its opposite, prudence, a gate of Zion. But to all the gates of the “knowledge that is falsely so called” one gate is opposed, the gate of knowledge which is free from falsehood. But consider if, because of the saying, “our wrestling is not against flesh and blood,” etc., you can say that each power and world ruler of this darkness and each one of the “spiritual hosts of wickedness in the heavenly places” is a gate of hades and a gate of death. Let, then, the principalities and powers with which our wrestling is, be called gates of hades, but the “ministering spirits” gates of righteousness. But as in the case of the better things many gates are first spoken of, and after the gates, one, in the passage, “Open to me the gates of righteousness, I will enter into them and will make full confession to the Lord,” and “this is the gate of the Lord, by it the righteous shall enter”; so also in the case of those gates that are opposed, many are the gates of hades and death, each a power; but over all these the wicked one himself.

And it is not incredible that the gates that are said to open spontaneously are referred obscurely by some to the words “Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may go into them and praise the Lord; this gate of the Lord, into it the righteous shall enter”; and again, to what is said in the ninth psalm, “You that lift me up from the gates of death, that I may show forth all your praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion.” The Scripture further gives the name of “gates of death” to those sins that lead to destruction, as it calls, on the contrary, good actions the “gates of Zion.” So also “the gates of righteousness,” which is an equivalent expression to “the gates of virtue.” These are ready to be opened to one who follows after virtuous pursuits.
