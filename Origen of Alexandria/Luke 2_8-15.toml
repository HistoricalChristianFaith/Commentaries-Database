Listen, shepherds of the churches! Listen, God’s shepherds! His angel always comes down from heaven and proclaims to you, “Today a Savior is born for you, who is Christ the Lord.” For, unless that Shepherd comes, the shepherds of the churches will be unable to guard the flock well. Their custody is weak, unless Christ pastures and guards along with them. We read in the apostle: “We are coworkers with God.” A good shepherd, who imitates the good Shepherd, is a coworker with God and Christ. He is a good shepherd precisely because he has the best Shepherd with him, pasturing his sheep along with him. For “God established in his church apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers. He established everything for the perfection of the saints.”

After the Lord came to the earth, “He established peace through the blood of his cross, both for those upon the earth and those who are in heaven.” And the angels wanted people to remember their Creator. They had done everything in their power to cure them, but they were unwilling to be cured. Then the angels behold him who could effect a cure. They give glory and say, “Glory to God on high, and peace on earth.”
