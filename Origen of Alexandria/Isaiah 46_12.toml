The inner person has a heart. “Hear me, you who have lost heart.” They possessed a physical heart, that organ of the body. It was not that heart which they lost. But when a person neglects to cultivate his intellectual life, and in consequence of much idleness his thinking capacity has atrophied, he has lost his heart, and it is to such a person that the words are added, “Here me, you who have lost your heart.”
