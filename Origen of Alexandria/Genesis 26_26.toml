This Abimelech, as I see it, does not always have peace with Isaac, but sometimes he disagrees, at other times he seeks peace. If you remember how, in what precedes, we said of Abimelech that he represents the learned and wise of the world who have comprehended many things even of the truth through the learning of philosophy, you can understand how he can be neither always in dissension nor always at peace with Isaac, who represents the Word of God in the law. For philosophy is neither opposed to everything in the law of God nor in harmony with everything.For many of the philosophers write that there is one God who has created all things. In this they agree with the law of God. Some also have added this, that God made and rules all things by his Word and it is the Word of God by which all things are directed. In this they write in harmony not only with the law but also with the Gospels. Indeed, almost the total philosophy that is called moral and natural holds the same views we do. But it disagrees with us when it says matter is coeternal with God. It disagrees when it denies that God is concerned about mortal things but that his providence is confined beyond the spaces of the lunar sphere. They disagree with us when they appraise the lives of those being born by the courses of the stars. They disagree when they say this world is permanent and is to have no end. But there are also many other things in which they either disagree with us or are in harmony. And therefore in accordance with this figure, Abimelech is sometimes described as being at peace with Isaac and sometimes as disagreeing.

But also I do not think that this was of idle concern to the Holy Spirit, who writes these things, to relate that two others “came with Abimelech, that is, “Ahuzzath his kinsman and Phicol the leader of his army.”Now Ahuzzath means “containing” and Phicol “the mouth of all,” but Abimelech himself means “my father is king.” These three, in my opinion, figuratively represent all philosophy, which is divided into three parts among them: logic, physics, ethics, that is, rational, natural, moral. The rational is that which acknowledges God to be Father of all, that is, Abimelech. The natural is that which is fixed and contains all things, as depending on the forces of nature itself, which Ahuzzath, which means “containing,” professes to be. The moral is that which is in the mouth of all and pertains to all and is situated in the mouth of all because of the likeness of the common precepts. Phicol, which means “the mouth of all,” signifies this.
All these therefore come to the law of God in the learning of instructions of this kind and say, “We certainly saw that the Lord is with you, and we said, ‘Let there be an oath between us and you and let us establish a covenant with you, lest you do evil with us, but as we have not cursed you, so also you are blessed by the Lord.’ ”
Those three, who seek peace from the Word of God and desire to anticipate his fellowship with a covenant, can indeed represent the magi who come from parts of the East learned in the books of their fathers and in the instruction of their ancestors and say, “We certainly saw” “the one born king,” “and we have seen that God is with him,” “and we have come to worship him.”6
But also if there is anyone who has been instructed in learning of this kind, seeing that “God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself” and who has admired the majesty of his works, let him say, “We certainly saw that the Lord is with you, and we said, ‘Let there be an oath between us.’ ” For approaching the law of God he says necessarily, “I have sworn and am determined that I shall keep your commandments.”
