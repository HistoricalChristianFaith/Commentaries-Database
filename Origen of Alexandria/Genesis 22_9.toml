Many of you who hear these words are fathers in the church of God. Do you think any one of you from the mere relating of the story acquires so much steadfastness, so much strength of soul, that when a son perhaps is lost by a death that is common and due to all, even if he be an only son, even if he be a beloved son, might bring in Abraham as an example for himself and set his magnanimity before his eyes? And indeed this greatness of soul is not required of you, that you yourself should bind your son, you yourself tie him, you yourself prepare the sword, you yourself slay your only son. All these services are not asked of you. Be constant in purpose, at least, and mind. Offer your son to God with a joyful, immovable faith. Be the priest for your son’s life. It is not fitting that the priest weeps who offers to God.Do you wish to see that this is required of you? In the Gospel the Lord says, “If you were the children of Abraham, you would do the works surely of Abraham.” Behold, this is a work of Abraham. Do the works that Abraham did, but not with sadness, “for God loves a cheerful giver.” But also if you should be so inclined to God, it will be said also to you, “Ascend into the high land and into the mountain which I shall show you, and there offer your son to me.” “Offer your son” not in the depths of the earth or “in the vale of tears” but in the high and lofty mountains. Show that faith in God is stronger than the affections of the flesh. For Abraham loved Isaac his son, the text says, but he placed the love of God before love of the flesh, and he is found not with the affection of the flesh but “with the affection of Christ,” that is, with the affection of the Word of God and of the truth and wisdom.
