Let us see what Moses says after these words: “And Israel dwelt,” the text says, “in Egypt, in the land of Goshen.” Now “Goshen” means “proximity” or “nearness.” By this it is shown that although Israel dwells in Egypt, it is nevertheless not far from God but is close to him and near, as he himself also says: “I will go down with you into Egypt, and I will be with you.”And therefore, even if we appear to have gone down into Egypt, even if placed in the flesh we undergo the battles and struggles of this world, even if we dwell among those who are subject to Pharaoh, nevertheless if we are near God, if we live in meditation on his commandments and inquire diligently after “his precept and judgments”—for this is what it means to be always near God, to think the things which are of God, “to seek the things which are of God”3—God also will always be with us, through Christ Jesus our Lord, “to whom belongs glory forever and ever. Amen.”
