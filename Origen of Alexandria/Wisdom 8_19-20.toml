Do you not know that when the male child is forty days old, he is presented at the altar to be purified, being impure from the conception itself, on account of both the paternal seed and the mother’s womb? Thus every person is impure from his father and his mother, but only my Lord Jesus entered this life purely and was not defiled in the mother. He in fact entered an undefiled body. It was he who once said through Solomon, “Or rather, being good, I entered an undefiled body.” Consequently, he was not defiled in the mother, and certainly not in the father. In his generation, Joseph offered nothing other than his service and affection. Thus Scripture, for his faithful service of a father, also gives him the name. Indeed, Mary says in the Gospel, “I and your father have been searching for you in sorrow.” Christ alone, therefore, is “the high priest who was not defiled in either the father or the mother.”
