The Baptist’s leaping for joy in the womb of Elizabeth at Mary’s greeting was a testimony about Christ. He was testifying to the divinity of Christ’s conception and birth. For what indeed is John, except everywhere a witness and forerunner of Jesus? He precedes his birth and dies a little before the death of the Son of God, that, by appearing before the Christ not only to those in birth but also those awaiting the freedom from death through Christ, he might everywhere prepare for the Lord a prepared people.…Now since there was the beginning in which the Word was … and since the Word also existed, and life was made in him, and the life was the light of people … why then did he not come “to give testimony of the life,” or “to give testimony of the Word,” or “of the beginning,” or of any other aspect of the Christ whatsoever? Consider whether it is not [because] “the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light” and because “the light shines in the darkness” and is not overcome by it. Those who are in darkness, that is, men and women, need light. For if the light “shines in the darkness”—there is no activity of darkness at all there—we shall share in other aspects of the Christ in which we do not now participate.
