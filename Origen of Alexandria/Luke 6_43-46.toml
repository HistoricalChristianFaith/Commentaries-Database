“The good tree” is the Holy Spirit. The “bad tree” is the devil and his underlings. The person who has the Holy Spirit manifests the fruits of the Spirit, which the apostle describes when he says, “The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faith, gentleness, self-control.” The one who has the opposing power brings forth briars and thistles, the passions of dishonor.
