Everyone, therefore, who wants to enter into the portion of the children of Judah must first pass through the Salt Sea. That is to say, he must surmount the waves and billows of this life and escape from all things in this world that, by virtue of their own uncertainty and hazardousness, are compared with the waves of the sea. Then he may be able to reach the land of Judah and to approach the fountain of the sun. But what is the fountain of the sun, or of which sun? Of that sun, of course, about which it is written, “But for the ones fearing my name, the sun of righteousness will arise.” Therefore you will find the fountain of this sun in the land of Judah, if you move away from the Salt Sea. Which fountain? That one of which Jesus said, “The water that I give will become a fountain of water leaping up into eternal life within the person who drinks from it.” Therefore, when you have found the kind of fountain of this sun that we have described, you will also find its city.
