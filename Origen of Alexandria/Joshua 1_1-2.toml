The book does not so much indicate to us the deeds of the son of Nun as it represents for us the mysteries of Jesus my Lord. For he himself is the one who assumes power after the death of Moses; he is the one who leads the army and fights against Amalek. What was foreshadowed there on the mountain by lifted hands was the time when “he attaches [them] to his cross, triumphing over the principalities and powers on it.”2Thus Moses is dead; for the law has ceased, because “the law and the prophets extend only up to John.” Do you want me to bring forth proofs from the Scriptures that the law is called Moses? Hear what he says in the Gospel: “They have Moses and the prophets, let them listen to them.” Here, without any doubt, he calls the law Moses.
Therefore “Moses, the servant of God, is dead”; for the law is dead, and the legal precepts are now invalid.
