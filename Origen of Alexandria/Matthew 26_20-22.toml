Perhaps someone will ask: If the twelve apostles all had clean consciences (that is, if they were all innocent of any act of betrayal against the teacher), why were they “sorrowful” at the news that he would be betrayed, as though it could have been one of them to whom he was referring? I believe that each of the disciples knew from the things Jesus had taught them that human nature is unstable and vulnerable to be turned toward sin and that in struggling “against the principalities and powers and rulers of this world of darkness” a man can be besieged and fall or be so weakened by the power of the enemy that he becomes evil. Aware of these things, then, each disciple was “very sorrowful” because Christ had said “one of you will betray me.” And each disciple, not knowing what he might do in the future, began to inquire one by one: “Is it I, Lord?” Yet, if the apostles had good reason to fear that they might betray him, we who have not yet tasted of perfection must also be afraid of falling victim to future weakness. This is why the apostle said, “I am certain that neither death nor life … is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.” But whoever is not yet perfect should remain aware that he is still capable of falling.

Some one may argue, (e. g. The Ebionites) that because Jesus kept the Passover with Jewish observances, we ought to do the same as followers of Christ, not remembering that Jesus was made under the Law, though not that He should leave under the Law (Gal. 4:4.) those who were under it, but should lead them out of it; how much less fitting then is it, that those who before were without the Law, should afterwards enter in? We celebrate spiritually the things which were carnally celebrated in the Law, keeping the Passover in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, (1 Cor. 5:8. John 6:53.) according to the will of the Lamb, who said, Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall not have life in you.

Or, He spoke generally, to prove the nature of each of their hearts, and to evince the wickedness of Judas, who would not believe in One who knew his heart. I suppose that at first he supposed that the thing was hid from Him, deeming Him man, which was of unbelief; but when he saw that his heart was known, he embraced the concealment offered by this general way of speaking, which was shamelesness. This also shows the goodness of the disciples, that they believed Christ's words more than their own consciences, for they began each to say, Lord, is it I? For they knew by what Jesus had taught them that human nature is readily turned to evil, and is in continual struggle with the niters of the darkness of this world; (Eph. 6:12.) whence they ask as in fear, for by reason of our weakness the future is an object of dread to us. When the Lord saw the disciples thus alarmed for themselves, He pointed out the traitor by the mark of the prophetic declaration, He that hath eaten bread with me hath wantonly overthrown me. (Ps. 41:9.)
