Perhaps someone will ask: If the twelve apostles all had clean consciences (that is, if they were all innocent of any act of betrayal against the teacher), why were they “sorrowful” at the news that he would be betrayed, as though it could have been one of them to whom he was referring? I believe that each of the disciples knew from the things Jesus had taught them that human nature is unstable and vulnerable to be turned toward sin and that in struggling “against the principalities and powers and rulers of this world of darkness” a man can be besieged and fall or be so weakened by the power of the enemy that he becomes evil. Aware of these things, then, each disciple was “very sorrowful” because Christ had said “one of you will betray me.” And each disciple, not knowing what he might do in the future, began to inquire one by one: “Is it I, Lord?” Yet, if the apostles had good reason to fear that they might betray him, we who have not yet tasted of perfection must also be afraid of falling victim to future weakness. This is why the apostle said, “I am certain that neither death nor life … is able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus.” But whoever is not yet perfect should remain aware that he is still capable of falling.
