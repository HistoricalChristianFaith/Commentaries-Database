The Savior then commanded, “What God has joined together, let not man put asunder.” But man wishes to put asunder what God has joined together. He does this when, “falling away from the sound faith, he gives heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of demons, through the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron, and by forbidding” them not only to commit fornication but even “to marry.” In this way he dissolves even those who before had been joined together by the providence of God.

Do you still want me to show you what kind of fast it is appropriate for you to practice? Fast from every sin, take no food of malice, take no feasts of passion, do not burn with any wine of luxury. Fast from evil deeds, abstain from evil words, hold yourself from the worst evil thoughts. Do not touch the secret loaves of perverse doctrine. Do not desire the deceptive foods of philosophy which seduce you from truth. Such a fast pleases God. But “to abstain from the foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by the faithful” and to do this with those who crucified Christ cannot be acceptable to God.… However, we do not say this that we may loosen the restraints of Christian abstinence.
