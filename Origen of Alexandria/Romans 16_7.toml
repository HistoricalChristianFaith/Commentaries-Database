It may be that these were Paul’s kinsmen according to the flesh, but the expression “my fellow prisoners” is what fascinates me. When was Paul in captivity? It seems that this was the captivity of sin and that they were together with him in the blindness of unbelief. When Christ came they were set free, as was Paul.
