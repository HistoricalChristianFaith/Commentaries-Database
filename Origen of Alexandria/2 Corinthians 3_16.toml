The Lord himself, the Holy Spirit himself, must be entreated by us to remove every cloud and all darkness which obscures the vision of our hearts, hardened with the stains of sins, in order that we may be able to behold the spiritual and wonderful knowledge of his law.

Let us beware, therefore, lest not only “when Moses is read” but also when Paul is read “a veil” be “placed over” our “heart.” And clearly, if we hear negligently, if we bring no zeal to learning and understanding, not only are the Scriptures of the Law and Prophets but also of the apostles and Gospels covered for us with a great veil. I fear, however, lest by too much negligence and dullness of heart the divine volumes be not only veiled to us but also sealed, so that “if a book should be put into the hands of a man who cannot read to be read, he would say, ‘I cannot read’; if it should be put into the hands of a man who can read, he would say, ‘It is sealed.’ ”Whence we see that we must not only employ zeal to learn the sacred literature, but also we must pray to the Lord and entreat “day and night” that the lamb “of the tribe of Judah” may come and himself taking “the sealed book” may deign to open it. For it is he who “opening the Scriptures” kindles the hearts of the disciples so that they say, “Was not our heart burning within us when he opened to us the Scriptures?” May he, therefore, even now see fit to open to us what it is which he inspired his apostle to say, “But the Lord is a spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.”.

For thus the apostle said, “If anyone turns to the Lord, the veil will be removed; for where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.” Therefore, the Lord himself, the Holy Spirit himself must be entreated by us to remove every cloud and all darkness which obscures the vision of our hearts hardened with the stains of sins in order that we may be able to behold the spiritual and wonderful knowledge of his law, according to him who said, “Take the veil from my eyes and I shall observe the wonders of your law.”32.
