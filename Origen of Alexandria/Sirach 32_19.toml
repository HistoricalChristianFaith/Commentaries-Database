“Because the Lord loves judgment and will not abandon his holy ones.” In what sense does the Lord love judgment? Because nothing in him is not weighed thoroughly, nothing happens without a reason. Consequently you also, knowing that the Lord loves judgment, do everything with an honest and truthful judgment. Thus you will listen to the admonition of him who says, “Do everything sensibly, drink wine with prudence.”
