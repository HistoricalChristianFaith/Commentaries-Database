Better is the hospitality of vegetables served with friendship and grace than a fatted calf served with enmity. Often we accept simpler, more frugal hospitality offered in good conscience—as guests at the table of those who are unable to furnish us with more—in preference to elevated words “lifted up against the knowledge of God” and proclaiming with ample plausibility a sentiment alien to the Father of our Lord Jesus who has given the law and the prophets.
