Let it not escape our notice that in some manuscripts we find written “because your discourses are better than wine” instead of what we read: “because your breasts are better than wine.” Although it evidently seems to have meant those things which we have discussed in our spiritual interpretation, nonetheless we preserve in all matters the things written by the seventy translators, because we are certain that the Holy Spirit wanted the outlines of the mysteries to be concealed in the divine Scriptures and not to be revealed and out in the open.
