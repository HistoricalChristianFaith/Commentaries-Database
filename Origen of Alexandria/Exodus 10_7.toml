And the briefly recorded fact that the heart of Pharaoh experienced a kind of softening when he said, “But you shall not proceed far; you shall go a three days’ journey and leave your wives behind,” and whatever else he spoke when yielding before the marvelous works makes it clear that these signs had some effect even on him, though they did not entirely accomplish their object. Yet not even this would have happened if the idea held by most people about the words, “I will harden Pharaoh’s heart,” rightly represented what was wrought by him, that is, by God.
