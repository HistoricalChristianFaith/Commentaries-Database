Isaac builds indeed an altar even now in the law and pitches his tent, but in the Gospels he does not pitch a tent but builds a house and establishes a foundation. For hear Wisdom saying of the church: “Wisdom,” Scripture says, “has built herself a house and has set up seven columns.” Hear Paul also saying about this: “For no man can lay a foundation but that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.”80Where, therefore, there is a tent, even if it should be pitched, it is doubtless to be folded up. But where there are foundations and a house is built “upon a rock,” that house is never destroyed, “for it has been founded on a rock.” Nevertheless Isaac digs a well there too, nor does he ever cease digging wells until “the fountain of living water” arises and “the stream of the river makes the city of God joyful.”
