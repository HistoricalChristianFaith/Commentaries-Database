When we come to the grace of baptism, renouncing all the other gods and masters, we confess one God: Father, Son and Holy Spirit. But confessing this, if “we do not love the Lord our God with all our heart and all our soul” and do not adhere to him “with all our strength,” we have not become the Lord’s portion. Rather, like those who sit on the fence, on the one side we allow to continue the very offenses we were fleeing to remain in our lives, while on the other we do not appease the Lord to whom we fled because we do not love him with a complete and honest heart. The prophet cries over us because of this, because he sees a similar fickleness in our fluctuating when he says, “Woe to the double-minded,” and again: “How long will you limp on both of your knees?” But the apostle James also says, “The double-minded person is inconsistent in all his ways.” So, we who do not follow our Lord with an upright and perfect soul and who are removed from foreign gods stand, as it were, on the fence. On the one hand, we are treated like deserters by those foreign gods who cut us down, on the other, we are not defended by our Lord because we are unstable and hesitant.
