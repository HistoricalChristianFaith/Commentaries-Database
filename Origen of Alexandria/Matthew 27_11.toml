Mark how He that is ordained by His Father to be the Judge of the whole creation, humbled Himself, and was content to stand before the judge of the land of Judæa, and to be asked by Pilate either in mockery or doubt, Art thou the King of the Jews?

Or, Pilate spoke this affirmatively, as he afterwards wrote in the inscription, The King of the Jews. By answering to the Chief Priest, Thou hast said, He indirectly reproved his doubts, but now He turns Pilate's speech into an affirmative, Jesus saith unto him, Thou sayest it.

Truly Jesus "did not consider equality with God something to be grasped" and not once but often humbled himself on behalf of humanity. See now, "having been made judge of every creature" by the Father, the King of kings and Lord of lords, to what extent he humbled himself. He compliantly stood before the governor of the land of Judea, who asked him perhaps deridingly or doubtingly, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus thought this question was proper, and he replied, "It is as you say." Before that, having been adjured by the chief priest to say whether he was the Christ, the Son of God, he answered, "You have said it yourself." Notice the two questions. The first one, "If you are the Christ the Son of God," was germane to Christ as a Jew. The Roman governor did not state his question by saying, "Are you the Christ?" but rather, "Are you the king of the Jews?"
