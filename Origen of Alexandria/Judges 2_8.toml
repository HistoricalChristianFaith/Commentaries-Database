Joshua’s death is also recounted for us. But it is nothing unusual that he who was the “son of Nun” died, for everything that is owed to nature gets paid. Yet, because we have established that what is read here about the son of Nun must be seen as referring to our Lord Jesus Christ, we need to ask how is it befitting to say that “Jesus died.” It is my opinion, though speaking according to the authority of Scripture, that Jesus lives in certain persons and is dead in other persons. Jesus lives in Paul and in Peter and in all those who can rightly say, “It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.” and, again, “But for me to live is Christ and to die is profit.” In persons such as those, therefore, Jesus is rightly said to live. But in whom is Jesus dead? He is dead in those persons, undoubtedly, who are said to insult the death of Jesus by frequently repenting and then failing again, persons whom the apostle describes in his letter to the Hebrews as “crucifying the Son of God again for their own sake and holding him out for show.” You can see why, therefore, Jesus is not only said to be “dead” in those sinners but is also asserted to be “crucified” and “mocked” by them. But examine yourself as well and ask, when you have avaricious thoughts and desire to despoil others, if you are ever able to say that “Christ lives in me.” If you have thoughts of defilement, if you are harassed by fury, if you are inflamed with envy and aroused with jealousy, if you revel in drunkenness, if you are exalted with pride, or if you act with cruelty, will you be able to say in all of these things that “Christ lives in me”? Christ is dead in sinners, therefore, because no justice, no patience, no truth, nor anything else that Christ is operates within them. But for saints, on the other hand, Christ is said to be the one who enacts whatever they do, as the apostle declares: “I can do all things in him who strengthens me, Christ.”
