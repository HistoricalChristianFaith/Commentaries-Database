But I think that all betrayers of the truth, pretending to love the truth and using the sign of a kiss as a mark of affection, betray the Word of God. Cloaked in belligerence, brandishing clubs and the swords of battle and proffering insults, his enemies desire to take hold of him. And the traitor says to Jesus, “Master.” Indeed, all heretics, like Judas, address Jesus in the same way, “Master.” They kiss him even as Judas did. Jesus speaks peacefully to them all, since they are all Judases who betray him: “Judas, is it with a kiss that you betray the Son of man?” As for Judas, he is reproached by Christ for his false friendship. “Friend, why are you here?” We hear of no one who is good called by that name in the Scriptures. Moreover, to the wicked and the one not wearing a wedding garment he says, “Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?” Wicked too is that man in the parable of the denarius who hears the words, “Friend, I am doing you no wrong; did you not agree with me for a denarius? Take what belongs to you, and go. I choose to give to this last as I give to you.”

Perhaps what Peter did was a mystery, for the right ear of the Jewish people had to be cut off because of their malice toward Jesus. Though they seem to hear the law, they now hear with their left ear the shadowy tradition of the law but not the truth, since they are enslaved by words that profess the service of God but do not serve him in truth. The mystery of these words against Christ is found in the person of Christ’s adversary, the high priest Caiaphas. Now it seems to me, since all the Gentile believers were made one people in Christ, the very fact that they believed in Christ was the reason why the right ear of the Jews was cut off, according to what had been prophesied about them: “Make the ears of this people heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears … and turn and be healed.”
