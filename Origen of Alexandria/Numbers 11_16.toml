But the Lord also says to Moses, “Choose for yourself presbyters whom you yourself know to be presbyters.” Let us examine very carefully the word of the Lord. What does that addition appear to mean, which says, “Whom you yourself know to be presbyters”? Was it not obvious to the eyes of all that he was a presbyter, that is, old, who was bearing old age in his body? Why then is that special inspection commanded to Moses alone, such a great prophet, that those be chosen, not whom others knew, not whom the ignorant multitude recognized, but whom the prophet full of God should choose? For in respect to them it is not a judgment about their body or their age but about their mind.
