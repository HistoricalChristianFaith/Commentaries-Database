For when Jesus had come and sent His Spirit, every valley was filled with good works, and the fruits of the Holy Spirit, which if thou hast, thou wilt not only cease to become a valley, but will begin also to be a mountain of God.

Or you may understand the mountains and hills to be the hostile powers, which have been overthrown by the coming of Christ.
