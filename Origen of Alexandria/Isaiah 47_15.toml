And when God afflicts those who deserve punishment, how else is it intended except for their good? It is he who says to the Chaldaeans, “You have coals of fire; sit on them. They shall be a help to you.” Further, let them hear what is related in the seventy-seventh psalm, which is ascribed to Asaph, about those who fell in the desert. It says, “When he slew them, then they sought him.” It does not say that some sought him after others had been killed but that those who were slain perished in such a manner that when put to death they sought God. From all these illustrations it is plain that the just and good God of the Law and the Gospels is one and the same and that he does good with justice and punishes in kindness, since neither goodness without justice nor justice without goodness can describe the dignity of the divine nature.
