We do not find, therefore, that the expression “to be sent from God” is be used of anyone other than the saints. It occurs in the case of Isaiah … and in the case of Jeremiah, “You shall go to all that I shall send you”; and in the case of Ezekiel, “I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels, who have rebelled against me.”
