The High Priest also in obedience to the letter of the Law wore on his head the writing, 'Holiness to the Lord,' but the true High Priest and King, Jesus, bears on His cross the title, This is the King of the Jews; when ascending to His Father, instead of His own name with its proper letters, He has the Father Himself.

There are those who to this day do not have the Lord with them but do have his “garments”—namely, the words contained in Scripture. They do not have them in full but only in part. Nonetheless the prophet had spoken that prediction which was now fulfilled. Now, as to whether any of his clothes were torn apart when they divided his garments or whether any of them remained intact and just what those items were, nothing is said by the first three Evangelists. But in John we read that “when the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; so they said to one another, ‘Let us not tear it but cast lots for it.’ ” Therefore not all but only one of the soldiers who had cast lots received it. Now anyone debating the differences between those who have the Lord’s “garments” will doubtless find some people who, although they do not have the Lord in their teachings, do have the “tunic” that was “woven from top to bottom.”

“Whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed,” and all literature—whether Greek, Roman or Hebrew—gives evidence of his kingdom. And in place of a crown, “over his head” is written “This is Jesus king of the Jews.” There is no other reason for his death (nor was there) than that he was the “king of the Jews.” He spoke about this when he said, “I have been made king by him on Zion, his holy mountain.” And while the chief priest, in keeping with the letter of the law, wore on his head a type of sign with a petal bearing the inscription “the holiness of the Lord,” the true chief priest and king—Jesus on the cross—has a sign that reads “This is the king of the Jews.” Rising up to the Father and receiving him in himself, he has for his inscription and title the Father of renown and has the Father as his crown. He has been made worthy of him as a house worthy of God the Father, and he alone can fully possess the Father.
