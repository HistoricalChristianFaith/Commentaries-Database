Note that the talent is taken away from the wicked and slothful servant and is given “to him who has ten talents.” It is not easy to explain how what has been given to a person can be taken away and given to another who does good, so he may have it in addition to what he gained. It is possible, however, since God, who invariably makes good sense in the teaching of truth, by his divinity can take away the corresponding amount from him who made poor use of it and give it to him who multiplied his own.“For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have abundance; but from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away.” Furthermore, whatever someone has from natural creation, when he has exercised it, he receives that very thing also from the grace of God. In this way he may have abundance and be stronger in what he has. Concerning not only wisdom but also every good quality, we should reflect on the words of Solomon: “And if there is anyone perfect among the children of men, if your wisdom is taken away from him, he will be counted as nothing.”

If someone should wish to peruse Scripture elsewhere to hear from his Master the word faithful, I believe Abraham is a good instance: “Abraham believed God; and he reckoned it to him as righteousness.” Then there is the man who heard from his master the words “faithful servant.” Without doubt his faith was reckoned as righteousness to him, like the faith of him who was faithful in little things, so that every mystery of the resurrection and the administration of godly affairs may be entrusted to him. Everything in this life, by the way, consists of little things.Let us note also where that good and faithful servant is going who was faithful in the little things of this life. “Enter into the joy of your master,” he is told. Every delight and every joy will be there when those who weep here below will be merry hereafter and those who righteously mourn will receive a worthy consolation. He says this in effect both to the one “who had received the five talents” and to the one “who had received the two.” He says, “Enter.” Know what it is to approach me and to pass from this world to the next. Notice also that the master said to the second servant what he said to the first: “Well done, good and faithful servant; you have been faithful over a little, I will set you over much.” I wonder also, since the same words were said to both servants, whether by chance the one who had less ability and exercised it fully would be regarded less by God than the one who had more ability. I wonder if this is in fulfillment of what was said elsewhere: “He that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack.” Such is indicated also concerning the commandment of love for God or for one’s neighbor, according to the words “You shall love the Lord your God with all your whole heart and with all your soul and with all your strength.” Without doubt, when someone has loved God with all his heart and with all his soul and with all his strength, he has the same reward of love as the person with a bigger heart or with a more gifted soul or with greater ability. This alone is required: At whatever level one has received a gift from God, one should use it for God’s glory. It seems to me that “he who had received the one talent” was indeed among the believers, even though he was not among those who acted boldly in faith. He is among those who scatter their energies in trying to do everything but have nothing to show for it. Perhaps their behavior in other respects is not blameworthy. What they received they guard carefully, but they do not add to it, nor do they trade or faithfully transact with it. For that reason, the word does not bear any fruit in them, nor did anyone else gain from it. They even seem to be the type of people who fear God. They often see God as harsh and hard and implacable.

The master had three servants. After they believed and became his servants, they were given a task to do. They received money from their master. One of them “traded” with it and “gained.” The second one “gained,” but not as much. And the third, out of fear and being insufficiently faithful, “went away and hid” his master’s money. From his defensiveness it appears that he feared the master. He was in awe of the master even as the other had “zeal for God but not according to knowledge.” Diffidently, he “hid” his talent in the ground. Such are those who neither exert themselves nor question what has been said nor extend themselves to benefit souls, but they scatter their energies on what they have received and have been entrusted with.
