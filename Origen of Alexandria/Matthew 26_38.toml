“Stay here and keep watch with me.” It is as though Jesus had said, “Although I told the other disciples to ‘sit here while I go and pray’ but brought you three along with me, I don’t want you to come any further, for you are not yet able. So, stay here keeping watch as I keep watch, knowing that the others were commanded to sit over there because they are weaker and need to be protected from this agony. [But] I have brought you who are stronger with me to labor with me in watching and praying. Nevertheless, you remain here, that each one stand firm in the state of his calling,for every grace (however great it may be) has a superior.” What Jesus meant when he said “remain here” is explained by what was said next: “going a little farther, he fell on his face.” Therefore let us remain where Jesus commanded us to remain, as the apostle also admonished: “Everyone should remain in the state in which he was called.” And let us do everything in our power to keep watch with him who “neither slumbers nor sleeps, who keeps Israel.”

Or otherwise; My soul is sorrowful even unto death; as much as to say, Sorrow is begun in me, but not to endure for ever, but only till the hour of death; that when I shall die for sin, I shall die also to all sorrow, whose beginnings only are in me. Tarry ye here, and watch with me; as much as to say, The rest I bade sit yonder as weak, removing them from this struggle; but you I have brought hither as being stronger, that ye may toil with me in watching and prayer. But abide you here, that every man may stay in his own rank and station; since all grace, however great, has its superior.
