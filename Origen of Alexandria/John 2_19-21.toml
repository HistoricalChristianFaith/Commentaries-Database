It is likely, moreover, that what has been recorded in the Gospels according to Matthew and Mark in the name of the false witness who accuses our Lord Jesus Christ at the end of the Gospel contains a reference to the saying, “Destroy this temple and I will raise it up in three days.” For he … was speaking about the temple of his body, but they, supposing that the things said here were said about the temple built from stones, accused him.

Both, however (I mean the temple and Jesus’ body), according to one interpretation, appear to me to be a type of the church, in that the church, being called a “temple,” is built of living stones, becoming a spiritual house “for a holy priesthood,” built “on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus being the chief cornerstone.” And through the saying, “Now you are the body of Christ and members in part,” [we know] that even if the harmony of the stones of the temple appear to be destroyed, [or,] as it is written in Psalm 21, all the bones of Christ appear to be scattered in persecutions and afflictions by the plots of those who wage war against the unity of the temple by persecutions—we know that the temple will be raised up and the body will arise on the third day after the day of evil that threatens it and the day of consummation that follows. For the third day will dawn in the new heaven and the new earth, when these bones, the whole house of Israel, shall be raised up on the great day of the Lord, once death has been conquered. Consequently, the resurrection of Christ too, which followed from his passion on the cross, contains the mystery of the resurrection of the whole body of Christ.
