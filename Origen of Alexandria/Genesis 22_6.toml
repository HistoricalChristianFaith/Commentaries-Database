That Isaac carries on himself “the wood for the burnt offering” is a figure, because Christ also “himself carried his own cross,” and yet to carry “the wood for the burnt offering” is the duty of a priest. He therefore becomes victim and priest. But what is added also is related to this: “And they both went off together.” For when Abraham carries the fire and knife as if to sacrifice, Isaac does not go behind him but with him, that he might be shown to contribute equally with the priesthood itself.
