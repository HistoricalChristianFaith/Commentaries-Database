The closer our mind approaches Christ in a more exalted and lofty way and presents itself nearer the splendor of his light, the more it will it be made to shine more magnificently and clearly in his light as also he says through the prophet: “Draw near to me, and I shall draw near to you, says the Lord.” And again he says, “I am a God who draws near and not a God afar off.”
