If any reader is “a spiritual man who judges all things and he is judged by no one,” not only will he allegorize the major regions as Judea and Egypt and Babylon but also areas of the earth. And just as in Judea is Jerusalem and Bethlehem and other cities, so in Egypt when he reads, “Diospolis, Bubastis, Taphnis, Memphis, Syene,” he will understand the meaning of things figuratively. “Who is wise and understands these things? Or who is understanding and will know them?”

And to such a degree does the gospel desire that there should be wise people among believers, that for the sake of exercising the understanding of its hearers, it has spoken certain truths in enigmas, others in what are called “dark” sayings, others in parables, and others in problems. And one of the prophets—Hosea—says at the end of his prophecy, “Who is wise, and he will understand these things? Or prudent, and he shall know them?”
