The verse clearly teaches that the one who comes to the greatest virtue, to very great security, comes on account of faith in God.â€¦ The Savior, recognizing that thousands of the people of the circumcision were going to demand that he be crucified and knowing his own spirit of fearlessness (I say these things speaking in terms of the flesh), is able to say even these words.
