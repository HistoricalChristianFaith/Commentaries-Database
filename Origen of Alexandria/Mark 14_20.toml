Seeing that the disciples were disturbed, Jesus called the betrayer to accountability by poignantly recalling the prophetic words of the psalmist: “Even my bosom friend in whom I trusted, who ate of my bread, has lifted up his heel against me.” This corresponds to the Evangelist’s report of him saying: “It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me.” Judas the betrayer was thrusting his hand into the very same dish along with Jesus as they were eating the passover meal. This highlighted Judas’ shamelessness. The very one who was being generously received to a common table betrayed Jesus who had embraced him with such great affection. He betrayed the bestower of these good gifts for the promise of thirty pieces of silver. Isn’t this especially characteristic of extremely malevolent persons—to plot against those with whom they have shared bread and salt, who would in no way injure them?
