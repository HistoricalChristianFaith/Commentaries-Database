From this statement we will refute those who suppose that the Savior was a man but not also the Son of God. For they dared with many human evils to say even this, that the Only-begotten, the firstborn of all creation, could not be God. For “cursed is one who has hope in humankind.” It is evident that cursed are those who have hope in humankind. I may say that I do not have hope in people.
