By ascending through the individual levels of the dwellings [in the ark built by Noah during the flood], one arrives at Noah himself, whose name means rest or righteous, who is Jesus Christ. For what Lamech his father says is not appropriate to the ancient Noah. For “this one,” he says, “shall give us rest from the labors and the sorrows of our hands and from the earth that the Lord God cursed.” For how shall it be true that the ancient Noah gave rest to that Lamech or to that people who were then contained in the lands? How is there a cessation from the labors and sorrows in the times of Noah? Jesus only has given rest to humanity and has freed the earth from the curse with which the Lord God cursed it.
