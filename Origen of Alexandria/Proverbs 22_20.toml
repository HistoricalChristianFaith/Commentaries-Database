Solomon counsels that what we read “be transcribed in the heart in a threefold manner.” I shall make known to your ears that which occurs to my mind, even beyond the things that we have said, and you yourself [should] do what is written: “Let one speak and the rest judge.” Therefore, as I speak what I perceive, you consider and judge if it is correct or not correct.
