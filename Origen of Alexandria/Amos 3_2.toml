And each of us thinks, since he has not been an idolater, since he has not been immoral—would that we were pure in such areas—that after he has been set free from this life, he will be saved. We do not see that “all of us must appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive either good or evil according to what he has done in the body.” We do not hear what has been said: “You especially have I known out of all the tribes on the earth. Therefore I will punish you for all”—not just some and not others—“of your iniquities.”
