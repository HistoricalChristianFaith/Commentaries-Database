Yet it is not all barely, but all these; for there were other sayings which He must speak before He should be delivered up.

He said not, After two days will be, or will come, the feast of the Passover, but not meaning the ordinary annual Passover, but that Passover such as had never before been, the Passover will be offered1.

He foretels His crucifixion to His disciples, adding, And the Son of Man shall be delivered to be crucified; thus fortifying them against that shock of surprise, which the sight of their Master, led forth to crucifixion, would otherwise have occasioned them. And He expresses it impersonally shall be delivered, because God delivered Him up in mercy to the human race, Judas from covetousness, the Priest for envy, the Devil through fear that through His teaching the human race would be plucked out of His hand, little aware how much more that would be effected by His death, than either by His teaching or miracles.

We know that the Father had set the hour of his Passion. For he said to his mother at one point, “My hour has not yet come.” In another place, “Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour! No, this is why I came to this hour.” And elsewhere, “Father, the hour has come! Glorify your Son, that your Son may glorify you.” Since the Father set the hour of his Son’s Passion, he could not suffer anything from the time the devil had departed from him until his Passion.

He therefore used the verb impersonally—that is, “he will be delivered up.” He did not say by whom, because the words apply to all those who delivered him up. But not everyone delivered him up in the same way. God delivered him up out of mercy for the human race: he “has not spared even his own Son but has delivered him for us all.” But the rest delivered him up for a bad reason, each one according to his own malice:14 Judas out of greed, the priests out of jealousy and the devil out of fear—lest the human race be plucked from his hands because of Christ’s teaching, little knowing that the human race would be plucked away more through his death than through his teaching and miracles. He was in fact delivered up “to be crucified” so that, “disarming the principalities and powers,” he might triumph over them on the cross.
