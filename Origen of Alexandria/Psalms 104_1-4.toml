And, therefore, about this one [Jesus Christ] it is rightly said, “He has perfect hands to put on the holy things.” For this one is truly he who “put on holy things,” not those who were “bad examples” but these that are truly “holy.” But if you want to hear about his more lofty garments, take the prophetic words, “Clothed with light as a garment, the abyss as a garment is his clothing.” This is the appearance of my great high priest who is declared clothed with the depths of knowledge and the light of wisdom that truly are “holy” garments.
