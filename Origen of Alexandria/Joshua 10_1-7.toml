There is no doubt that when a human soul associates itself with the Word of God, it is immediately going to have enemies, and that those it once considered friends will be changed into adversaries. The soul should not only expect to suffer this from humans, but it should also know that such will likewise be forthcoming from opposing powers and spiritual iniquities. Thus it happens that whoever longs for friendship with Jesus knows he must tolerate the hostilities of many.…Even now, therefore, the Gibeonites, such as they are, are assaulted because of friendship with Jesus [Joshua], even though they are “hewers of wood and carriers of water.” That is, although you are the least worthy in the church, nevertheless, because you belong to Jesus, you will be assailed by five kings.
The Gibeonites, however, are not abandoned or scorned by Jesus [Joshua] or by the leaders and elders of the Israelites; instead they offer help for their weakness.
