It was not fit that the Lord should answer the High Priest's adjuration as though under compulsion, wherefore He neither denied nor confessed Himself to be the Son of God. For he was not worthy to be the object of Christ's teaching, therefore He does not instruct him, but taking up his own words retorts them upon him. This sitting of the Son of Man seems to me to denote a certain regal security; by the power of God, Who is the only power, is He securely seated to Whom is given by His Father all power in heaven as in earth. And there will come a time when the enemies shall see this establishment. Indeed this has begun to be fulfilled from the earliest time of the dispensation; for the disciples saw Him rising from the dead, and thereby saw Him seated on the right hand of power. Or, In respect of that eternity of duration which is with God, from the beginning of the world to the end of it is but one day; it is therefore no wonder that the Saviour here says, Shortly, signifying that there is but short time before the end come. He prophesies moreover, that they should not only see Him sitting at the right hand of power, but also coming in the clouds of heaven. These clouds are the Prophets and Apostles, whom He commands to rain when it is required, they are the clouds that pass not away, but bearing the image of the heavenly, (1 Cor. 15:49.) are worthy to be the throne of God, as heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Christ. (Rom. 8:17.)

It seems to me that the Son of man seated "at the right hand of Power" signifies enthronement and empowerment. He was seated therefore next to Power—the only power properly so called—and at the right hand. He received all power from the Father "in heaven and on earth." His adversaries too will see his enthronement, sometime after the blessed have seen him with joy.Now the passage according to Mark does not say "hereafter." It reads simply, "You will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power." This does not imply anything contrary to what we have said. However, in light of Matthew's words, "hereafter you will see" and Luke's words, "so will the Son of man be in his day," one may ask whether since the time the Savior had said these things, they were fulfilled to those who heard his words.… Our reply is that they appear to have been fulfilled, since from that time, that is, from the time of the dispensation, the Son of man has been seated "at the right hand of Power," and his disciples witnessed his resurrection from the dead. For this reason, as we noted before, they saw him seated "at the right hand of Power."

The prophets of God and the apostles of Christ are those living clouds which Jesus orders to rain down or not to rain down, as he sees fit, upon the fruitless vineyard. Now if anyone does not wish to become these clouds upon which and with which the Son of man will appear, Christ will know this. For God the Word and wisdom and truth and justice will always come upon these clouds and be with them, manifesting his coming to those worthy of himself. Furthermore, we speak of these clouds as though they bear a "sign from heaven," heavenly clouds that do not pass away. They have been made worthy of the throne of God and the kingdom of God as "heirs of God and coheirs of Christ." And they will reign with him.
