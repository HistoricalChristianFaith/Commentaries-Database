“Did Jesus come into the world for this purpose, that we [the Jews] should not believe him?” To which we immediately answer that he did not come with the object of producing unbelief among the Jews; but knowing beforehand that such would be the result, he foretold it and made use of their unbelief for the calling of the Gentiles. For through their sin salvation came to the Gentiles, respecting whom the Christ who speaks in the prophecies says, “A people whom I did not know became subject to me: they were obedient to the hearing of my ear”; and, “I was found by those who did not seek me; I became manifest to those who did not inquire after me.”
