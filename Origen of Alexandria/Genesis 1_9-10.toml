Let us labor, therefore, to gather “the water that is under heaven” and cast it from us that “the dry land,” which is our deeds done in the flesh, might appear. When this has been done, “men seeing our good works may glorify our Father who is in heaven.” For if we have not separated from us those waters that are under heaven, that is, the sins and vices of our body, our dry land will not be able to appear nor have the courage to advance to the light.… The dry land, after the water was removed from it, did not continue further as “dry land” but was named “earth” by God. In this manner also our bodies, if this separation from them takes place, will no longer remain “dry land.” They will, on the contrary, be called “earth” because they can now bear fruit for God.
