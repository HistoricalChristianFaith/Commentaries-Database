First, the punishments and the torments of sinners are decreed. The righteous will see their fate and understand the difference between a good and a bad life and from how many evils they have escaped by living well. And those condemned to punishment will see the righteous in glory and exclaim, “And we fools thought their life was madness!” After having thus seen the end of sinners, the righteous will be exalted and lifted up to heaven so as to inherit the earth. Now the psalm speaks and comforts us concerning the problem that almost constantly disturbs the heart of every person. Because often, when we suffer and see that the wicked and impious live surrounded by good fortune in this life—full of success, abounding in riches and honors, having fruitful and numerous children—we are scandalized and murmur in our hearts, Where is God’s justice? If human life were ruled by divine providence, would God allow this wicked and godless person to rise to such a degree of prosperity? That is why the divine word, speaking through the mouth of the righteous, says, “I have seen a godless person”—not merely exalted but “exalted and raised beyond all measure,” and not above any tree but “above the cedars of Lebanon.” He speaks of an exceedingly tall tree and a mountain above all, and yet, having seen all this, he says, “I passed by, and look—he was no more.”
