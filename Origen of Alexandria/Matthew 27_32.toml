“As they went out, they came upon a man of Cyrene, Simon by name; they compelled this man to carry the cross” of Christ. It was fitting not only for the Savior to take up his cross but also for us to carry it, doing compulsory service for our salvation. Furthermore, we did not benefit by taking up his cross then as much as we benefit by it now, since he takes it upon himself and carries it.
