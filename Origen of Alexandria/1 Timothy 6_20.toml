What is “the deposit” that each one of the faithful receives? For my part I think that we receive our soul itself and the body as a deposit from God. And do you want to see another greater “deposit” that you received from God? God entrusted “his own image and likeness” to your own soul. That deposit, therefore, must be restored by you just as intact as it was received by you. For if you are merciful, “as your Father in heaven is merciful,” the image of God is in you and you preserve the “deposit” intact. If you are perfect, “as your Father in heaven is perfect,” the deposit of God’s image remains in you. In like manner, in all other things, if you are pious, if you are just, if you are holy, if you are “pure in heart,” and if all things which are present in God through nature remain in you by imitation, “the deposit” of the divine image is safe within you.

To go into the way of the Gentiles is to adopt some Gentile teaching which is foreign to the “Israel of God” and to walk according to it. And to enter a city of the Samaritans is to be engaged in some knowledge falsely so-called of those who claim to devote themselves to the words of the law or the prophets or the Gospels or the apostles.

Celsus also says that “they were of one mind,” not seeing even here that from the outset there were disagreements among the believers about the interpretation of the books regarded as divine.… In the epistles of Paul, who was contemporary with those who had seen Jesus, there are some statements to be found which concern certain disputes about the resurrection, and about the view that it had already occurred, and about the question whether the day of the Lord was already present or not. Moreover, the words “Turning away from the profane babblings and oppositions of the knowledge falsely so-called, which some have professed and made shipwreck concerning the faith” show that from the beginning there were certain varieties of interpretation.
