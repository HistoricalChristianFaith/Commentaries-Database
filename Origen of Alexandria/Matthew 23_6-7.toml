What are we to say about those who “love the places of honor at banquets and the front seats in synagogues and the highest respect in public places and to be called rabbi by everyone”? We must first admit that this kind of delight is found not only among the scribes and Pharisees but also in the church of Christ, and not only at dinner, while taking places at the table, but also the front seats in church. These are the deacons, or those who wish to become deacons, yet who “squander the savings of widows, praying for a good opportunity” and yet “will receive a greater judgment.” They covet even more avidly the highly visible “first seats” of those called priests. Indeed, however, even they do not put as much effort into their scheming as those who are called bishops, the ones who love “being called rabbi by men.” It is they who ought most clearly to understand that a bishop is to be “above reproach” and so on, so that he would be called “bishop” not by men [only] but rather before God.
