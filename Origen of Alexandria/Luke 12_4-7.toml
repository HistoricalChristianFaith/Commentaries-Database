Literally, hereby is signified the quickness of the Divine foresight, which reaches even to the least things. But mystically, the five sparrows justly represent the spiritual senses, which have perception of high and heavenly things: beholding God, hearing the Divine voice, tasting of the bread of life, smelling the perfume of Christ's anointing, handling the Word of Life. And these being sold for two farthings, that is, being lightly esteemed by those who count as perishing whatever is of the Spirit, are not forgotten before God. But God is said to be forgetful of some because of their iniquities.

Notice that this commandment is not given to Jesus’ servants but to his friends. “Do not fear those who kill the body, and after that have no more that they can do.” The One to fear is he “who can destroy both soul and body in hell.” He alone, “after he has killed,” has “power to throw into hell.” He throws into hell those who fear those who kill the body and do not fear “him who, after he has killed, has power to cast into hell.” We may suppose that no matter who else has the hair of his head numbered, the verse is obviously true of those who are cut off for Jesus. We will confess the Son of God before people and not before gods, that he who is confessed may confess us in turn before God and his Father, and confess in heaven the one who confessed him on earth.
