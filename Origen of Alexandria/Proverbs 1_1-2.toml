He manifestly shows at once in the beginning of his Proverbs that he is establishing these foundations of true philosophy and an order of disciplines and institutions because the place of reason has not lain hidden or been rejected by him. First of all, he shows this by the very fact that he titled his book “Proverbs,” which name indicates that something is being said openly but something else is being indicated inwardly. The common use of proverbs teaches this fact. John too in the Gospel writes that the Savior says, “I have spoken these things to you in proverbs; the hour will come when I will no longer speak to you in proverbs, but will proclaim to you openly about the Father.” Meanwhile, these things have been said in the very inscription of the book.

A proverb is a cryptic saying that has an indirect meaning. [Solomon] ruled in Israel, in order to understand wisdom and instruction. Wisdom is the spiritual knowledge pertaining to God, bodiless hosts and judgment; it also includes teaching about providence and unveils contemplation on the subjects of ethics, natural sciences and theology. Or rather, wisdom is the knowledge of both physical and spiritual worlds and of the judgment and providence pertaining to them. On the other hand, instruction is the disciplining of the passions of that passionate or unreasonable part of the soul. One who has advanced to the level of theology has learned wisdom.

Solomon, who seems to have served the will of the Holy Spirit in those three books, is called in Proverbs, “Solomon, the Son of David, who ruled in Israel.” … Therefore, in the first book, Proverbs, when he grounds us in moral disciplines, he is said to be “king” in “Israel”—but not yet in Jeruslem—because although we are said to be “Israel” because of our faith, nonetheless we have not yet arrived to that level so that we seem to have arrived at “the heavenly Jerusalem.”
