Anyone who searches the Scriptures with some diligence will see that there were two curtains, an inner curtain which covered the Holy of Holies and another curtain exterior to either the tabernacle or the temple. These two curtains are figures of the holy tabernacle which the Father prepared from the beginning.

This is what the prophet wrote concerning this very event: “All [namely, the disciples of Christ] who saw these things trembled and every one was afraid.”
