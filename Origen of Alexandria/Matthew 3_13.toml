By this act Jesus showed himself to be “meek and lowly in heart,” coming to those inferior to him, doing all that followed in order to humble himself and become obedient “unto death.” It is not always the case that the one who baptizes is greater than the one who is baptized. Ananias was not greater than Paul. And while Philip baptized, Peter gave the Spirit through the laying on of hands.
