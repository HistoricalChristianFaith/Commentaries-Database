“Be holy, for I also am holy.” But however much one might advance in sanctity, however much purity and sincerity one might acquire, a human being cannot be holy like the Lord, because he is the bestower of sanctity, the human being its receiver, he is the fountain of sanctity, the human being the drinker from the fountain, he is the light of sanctity, the human being the contemplator of the holy light. Thus “there is none holy like the Lord, there is none besides thee.” What it means to say “There is none besides thee,” I do not understand. If it had said, “There is no God but you” or “There is no creator but you” or had added something like this, there would be no problem. But if it now says “There is none besides thee,” this is what it seems to me to mean here: none of those things which are possess their existence by nature. You alone, O Lord, are the one to whom your existence has not been given by anyone. Because all of us, that is the whole creation, did not exist before we were created; thus, that we are, is [due to] the will of the Creator. And because there was a time when we were not, it is not wholly right if it is said of us, without qualification, that we exist.… For the shadow is nothing in comparison with the body; and in comparison with the fire, smoke too is nothing.
