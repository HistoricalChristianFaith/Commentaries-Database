Now let us also consider Jesus’ statement, “I have proceeded and come from God.” It seems useful to me to juxtapose to these words the following words from Micah: “Hear my words, you people, and let the earth and all who are in it pay attention; and the Lord shall be among you for a witness, the Lord from his holy house. Therefore behold, the Lord proceeds from his place and will come down and tread upon the high places of the earth, and the mountains will be shaken under him, and the valleys will be dissolved like wax, before fire and like water tumbling down in a waterfall.” Now consider whether the statement, “I have proceeded from God,” is equivalent to the statement, “The Lord proceeds from his place,” since, when the Son is in the Father, being in the form of God before he empties himself, God is his place, as it were.… Unless you understand that the Son is in the Father in a different way than he was before he proceeded from God, it will seem contradictory that he has both proceeded from God, and, after he has proceeded from God, is still in God.

“I have descended,” the text says, “to see.” When responses are delivered to Abraham, God is not said to descend but to stand before him, as we explained above. “Three men,” the text says, “stood before him.” But now because sinners are involved, God is said to descend.Beware lest you think of ascending and descending spatially. For these metaphors are frequently found in the sacred literature, as in the prophet Micah. “Behold,” Scripture says, “the Lord departed from his holy place and came down and will tread upon the high places of the earth.” Therefore God is said to descend when he deigns to have concern for human frailty. This should be discerned especially of our Lord and Savior, who “thought it not robbery to be equal with God but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant.” Therefore he descended. For “no other has ascended into heaven, but he that descended from heaven, the Son of man who is in heaven.” For the Lord descended not only to care for us but also to bear what things are ours. “For he took the form of a servant,” and although he himself is invisible in nature, inasmuch as he is equal to the Father, nevertheless he took a visible appearance “and was found in appearance as a man.”
