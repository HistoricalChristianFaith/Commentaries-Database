The text wants you to make a more daring assertion if your hearing will still follow. What is the “sacrifice” that is offered “for sin” and is “very holy” except “the only begotten Son of God,” Jesus Christ my Lord? He alone is the “sacrifice for sins,” and he is “a very holy offering.” But since it added that “the priest who offers it will eat it,” it seems to be hard to understand. For that which it says must be eaten seems to be referring to the sin, just as in another place the prophet says concerning the priests that “they will eat the sins of my people.” This also shows that the priest ought to eat the sin of the one who is offering. We frequently show from holy Scripture that Christ is also the sacrifice that is offered for the sin of the world and the priest who brings the offering.
