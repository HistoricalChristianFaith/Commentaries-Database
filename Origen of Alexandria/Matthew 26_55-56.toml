There is now much to choose from the prophets, such as their sayings that were fulfilled when Christ said he had to suffer these things. Moveover, it is customary for scholars to collect prophetic words that were fulfilled. And in the psalm you may find a number of things reflected in those who came with Judas to seize Jesus, even as you may find things said about Judas in that psalm. “Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.” Fearing the crowds and Judas at their head, they fled because they did not yet have the Spirit (“since Jesus had not yet been glorified”)34 and the “Spirit of power and love.” If they had the Spirit, they would not be weak nor would they need anything besides divine love.
