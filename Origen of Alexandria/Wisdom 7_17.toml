In John it is written, “As the Father knows me, so I know the Father.” And in Psalm 45 it is written, “Be still and you will know that I am God.” Therefore the principal end of knowledge is to know the Trinity, and secondly to know what has been created by him, after the one who said, “Indeed, he gave me true knowledge of what exists.”

You see that the human heart is not small, because it understands many things. And you must not suppose that human greatness is in the size of the body but in the capacity of the senses, which can grasp so effectively the knowledge of the truth. And so that you might believe concerning the greatness of the human heart, I will offer some simple examples drawn from everyday life, such as the following. If we pass through a city, we preserve it in our spirit. In our heart are present the characteristics and locations of its squares, its walls and its buildings. We remember, both as an image and as a description, the street by which we entered and the sea we crossed to get there. As I said, the human heart is not small, which can understand so many things. Since it understands many things (and therefore is not small), in it the way of the Lord is prepared and the path straightened, so that the word and the wisdom of God might walk on them. Prepare the way of the Lord by good behavior, and level the path with excellent works, so that the Word of God might walk in you without encountering obstacles, making you know his mysteries and his coming.
