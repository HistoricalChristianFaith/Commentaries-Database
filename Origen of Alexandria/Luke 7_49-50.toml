A first forgiveness is the one by which we are baptized “for the remission of sins.” A second remission is in the suffering of martyrdom. The third is the one that is given through alms. The Savior says, “But nevertheless, give what you have and, behold, all things are clean for you.” A fourth forgiveness of sins is given for us through the fact that we also forgive the sins of our brothers. The Lord and Savior says, “If you will forgive from the heart your brothers’ sins, your Father will also forgive you your sins. But if you will not forgive your brothers from the heart, neither will your Father forgive you.” He taught us to say in prayer, “Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors.” A fifth forgiveness of sins is when “someone will convert a sinner from the error of his way.” Divine Scripture says, “Whoever will make a sinner turn from the error of his way will save a soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.” A sixth forgiveness comes through the abundance of love. The Lord himself says, “Truly I say to you, her many sins are forgiven because she loved much.” The apostle says, “Because love will cover a multitude of sins.” There is still a seventh forgiveness of sins through penance, although admittedly it is difficult and toilsome. The sinner washes “his couch in tears,” and his “tears” become his “bread day and night.”
