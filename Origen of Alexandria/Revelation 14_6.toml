It is Moses who hears from God all that is written down in the law of Leviticus, whereas in Deuteronomy it is the people who are represented as listening to Moses and learning from him what they could not hear from God. This indeed is why it is called Deuteronomy, meaning the second law; a fact that some will think points to this, that when the first law given through Moses came to an end, a second legislation was apparently composed, and this was specially delivered by Moses to his successor Joshua; and Joshua is certainly believed to be a figure of our Savior, by whose second law, that is, by the precepts of the Gospels, all things are brought to perfection. We must also see, however, whether the Scriptures may not perhaps indicate this further truth, that just as the legislation is presented with greater clearness and distinctness in Deuteronomy than in those books that were written at the first, so also we may gather from that coming of the Savior that he fulfilled in humility, when he “took upon him the form of a servant,” an indication of the “more splendid and glorious second coming in the glory of the Father,” at which coming, when in the kingdom of heaven all the saints shall live by the laws of the “eternal gospel,” the figure of Deuteronomy will be fulfilled. And just as by his present coming he has fulfilled that law which was a “shadow of the good things to come,” so also by that glorious coming the shadow of his first coming will be fulfilled and brought to perfection. For the prophet has spoken of it thus: “The breath of our countenance is Christ the Lord, of whom we said that under his shadow we shall live among the nations,” that is, at the time when he shall duly transfer all the saints from the temporal to the eternal gospel, to use a phrase employed by John in the Apocalypse, where he speaks of the “eternal gospel.”
