To say that the person who has two coats should give one to someone who has none fits the apostles better than the crowd. To understand that this command fits the apostles more than the people, listen to what the Savior says to the apostles, "Do not take two coats on a journey." Therefore, there are two garments with which each one is clothed. The command is to "share with him who has none." This denotes an alternate meaning: just as we may not "serve two masters," the Savior does not want us to have two coats, or to be clothed with a double garment. Otherwise, one would be the garment of the old man, the other of the new man. On the contrary, he desires that we strip ourselves of the old man and put on the new man. Up to this point, the explanation is easy.
