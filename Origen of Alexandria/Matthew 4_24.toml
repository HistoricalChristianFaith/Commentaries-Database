You will see the variety of evils in prodigality or avarice, boorishness or licentiousness, in silliness, knavery, insolence, cowardice and every opposing vice; and the soul’s trials are money, fame, poverty, obscurity. And while the demons dishonor bodies, they cause souls to become active in sinning and madness. But the epileptic has a “dumb and deaf” demon. Such passions trouble the soul at intervals, rendering it deaf to the saving word; as, for example, anger is a paralysis of souls, such that, when they succumb to it, their vigor is slackened both for action and for living. And “weakness” of the soul is a term used by Greeks, in a general sense, for any sickness arising from vice; more specifically, for that which is opposed to endurance, a sort of giving up in the face of patience and sufferings and anguish.
