Jesus Christ our Savior has been crucified. The author of this crime and father of this wickedness is, without doubt, the devil. It is written: “When, however, the devil had entered the heart of Judas Iscariot that he should betray him.” The devil is the father of sin. He fathered Judas as his first son in this wickedness, but Judas alone could not execute the betrayal. What then is written? “Judas departed,” Scripture says, “to the scribes and Pharisees and chief priests and said to them: ‘What will you give me, and I will deliver him to you?’ ” The third and fourth generation of sin was born from Judas.
