Those who teach with a dishonest and defiled soul steal. Of them it might be said, “All who came before me are thieves and robbers.” Such people use the gospel without being affected by it in faith or in living. Instead, they use the good news of the word in a way in which it was not intended. Such a person is a thief, and it will be said of him, “you who preach not to steal—you still steal.”
