That declaration in the Gospel, “If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have had sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin,” makes it clear to all who are rational just how long a time a person is without sin and just when he is liable to sin. By participating in the word or reason, people are said to have sinned, that is, from the time they are capable of understanding, from the time that the reason implanted within them suggests to them the difference between good and evil. After they have begun to know what evil is, they are liable for any sin they commit.This is the meaning of the expression that “people have no excuse for their sin,” namely, that from the time the divine word or reason has begun to show them internally the difference between good and evil, they ought to avoid and guard against evil: “For to the one who knows to do good and does not do it, to him it is sin.”
