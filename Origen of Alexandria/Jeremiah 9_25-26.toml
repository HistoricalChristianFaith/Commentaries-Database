The novelty of the expression may perhaps deter not only the Jews but even some of our brothers. For Paul, who introduces “circumcision of the heart,” seems to assume things that are impossible. For how shall it be possible that a member be circumcised that, covered by the internal viscera, lies hidden even from the view of people? Let us return, therefore, to the words of the prophets that, with the aid of your prayers, these matters about which we are inquiring might become clear. Ezekiel the prophet says, “No stranger uncircumcised in heart and uncircumcised in flesh shall enter my sanctuary.” Likewise elsewhere no less the prophet, reproaching, says, “All strangers are uncircumcised in the flesh, but the sons of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart.” It is pointed out, therefore, that unless one has been circumcised in the heart and the flesh, “he shall not enter the sanctuary” of God.
