You will also find similar things in the times of Elisha, when the son of Jader, king of Syria, came up against Samaria and besieged it. “And there was a great famine in Samaria for so long,” Scripture says, “that a donkey’s head became worth fifty shekels of silver and a quarter of pigeon dung five pieces of silver.” But suddenly an amazing change occurs through the word of the prophet, who says, “Hear the word of the Lord. Thus says the Lord: ‘Tomorrow, at this hour a measure of the finest wheat flour shall be one shekel and two measure of barley shall be one shekel, in the gates of Samaria.’ ”Notice, therefore, what is inferred from all these texts: when famine prevails over a land, not only does it not prevail over the just, but rather through them, a remedy is brought to the threatened destruction.
