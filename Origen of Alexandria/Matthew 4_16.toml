He spoke of “the shadow of death” and not simply “death.” This is because of the inability of sin utterly to corrupt the soul. Such complete corruption happens to bodies in death. But sin brings forth the shadow of death. And the words “light is sprung up” signify that it did not spring up upon us who were looking for it, but it shone upon those who were unprepared for it.
