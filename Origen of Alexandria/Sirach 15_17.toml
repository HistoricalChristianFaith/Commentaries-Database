“He must reign until all things are placed under his feet,” until “the last enemy to be destroyed will be death.” Once this is destroyed, there will be only the Life20 in which we believe. And while death is present among people, those whom it holds prisoner do not believe in Life. But once death is done away with, then all will believe in Life. In the Law, however, you will find both the words, “I have placed before you life and death,” and, “You will live in constant suspense. You will never be sure of your life.”
