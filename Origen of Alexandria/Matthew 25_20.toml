We earnestly believe that we are incapable of explaining such things, unlike those who infer from the perceptible events of the Scriptures more inspired meanings. These are spiritual meanings that Solomon calls "divine" and which Jeremiah calls "faculties of the heart" and which Paul in his epistle to the Hebrews calls "faculties trained by practice to distinguish good from evil." The persons in the first group are those who in addition to the "five talents" gained five more, trading with them and capitalizing on their ability. Successfully negotiating and zealously teaching, they traded and acquired five more talents. Indeed, no one readily benefits from another's ability unless he has that ability to begin with. A wise man grows in wisdom, a trustworthy man in trust."He brought five talents more." Note this: What each man knows, he can teach to another, up to the level of as much as he knows. This he can teach to another and no more. Therefore whatever someone has in himself, by teaching this to another, he gains it in the other, making that person have what he too has. Consequently he who had received the "five talents" is said not to have gained more than the five which he had and "he who had received the two talents" not more than the two which he had.

He who had received five talents comes first with boldness before his Lord.
