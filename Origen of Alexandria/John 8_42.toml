If, then, the [conditional] proposition is true, “If God were your father, you would love me,” it is clear that the [conditional] contrary to this is also true: If you do not love me, God is not your Father. God is not the Father, therefore, of those who do not love Jesus. And there was a time when Paul did not love Jesus. There was a time, then, when God was not Paul’s Father. Paul, therefore, was not a son of God by nature, but later he became a son of God.

Now, at what other time does God become one’s father than at the time one keeps his commandments? It is because of these commandments that one who was not formerly a son of the father in heaven becomes his son, when the Father leads the one who becomes his son to regeneration, and is called “Father.”

But when one compares the condition that resulted from having taken up the form of a servant after he had emptied himself with that former condition of the Son, you will understand how the Son has proceeded from God and has come to us, and [how he] has come out, as it were, of the one who sent him, even if, in another manner, the Father has not left him alone but is with him, and is in the Son just as also the Son is in the Father. For unless you understand that the Son is in the Father in a different way than he was before he proceeded from God, it will seem contradictory that he has both proceeded from God and, after he has proceeded from God, is still in God.

I think these words were spoken because there were some who came without being sent by the Father. Jeremiah teaches of such people who promise some teaching or prophecy, where it is written, “I did not send these prophets, yet they ran.” COMMENTARY ON THE GOSPEL OF JOHN 20.160.THEY DO NOT BELIEVE. AUGUSTINE. And they could not hear because they refused to believe and amend their lives.
