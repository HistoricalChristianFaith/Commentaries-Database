And He said not, I will be, but I am in the midst of them; because straightway, as soon as they have agreed together, Christ is found among them.

And this also is the reason why our prayers are not granted, because we do not agree together in all things upon earth, neither in doctrine, nor in conversation. For as in music, unless the voices are in time there is no pleasure to the hearer, so in the Church, unless they are united God is not pleased therein, nor does He hear their words.

Or, In whatever the two testaments are in agreement, for this every prayer is found acceptable to God.
