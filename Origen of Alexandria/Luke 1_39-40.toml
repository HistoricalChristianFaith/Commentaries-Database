Better men go to weaker men to give them some advantage by their visits. Thus the Savior came to John to sanctify John’s baptism.… Jesus was in her womb, and he hastened to sanctify John, who was still in his own mother’s womb. Before Mary came and greeted Elizabeth, the infant did not rejoice in her womb. But as soon as Mary spoke the word that the Son of God, in his mother’s womb, had supplied, “the infant [John] leaped in joy.” At that moment Jesus made his forerunner a prophet for the first time.
