God has then said to us, “Return, you children, and when you return, I will heal your afflictions.” And when we see our afflictions and the promise of healing, we answer and say immediately, “Behold, we will be yours because you are the Lord our God.” So when we obey and say, “We will be yours,” let us remember that we submitted ourselves to God in saying, “We will be yours.” And by saying, “We will be yours,” we belong to no other, not to the spirit of anger, or the spirit of grief or the spirit of desire; let us not belong to the devil or his angels. But after we were called and said, “Behold, we will be yours,” let us show by works that when we have promised to become his, we have devoted ourselves to none other than him.
