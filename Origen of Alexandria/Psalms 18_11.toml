It is said of God in the eighteenth psalm that “God made darkness his hiding place.” This is a Hebrew way of showing that the ideas of God that people understand in accordance with their merits are obscure and unknowable, since God hides himself as if in darkness from those who cannot bear the radiance of the knowledge of him and who cannot see him, partly because of the defilement of the mind that is bound to a human “body of humiliation,” partly because of its restricted capacity to comprehend God.… Moreover, our Savior and Lord, the Logos of God, shows the depth of the knowledge of the Father, and that, although a derived knowledge is possessed by those whose minds are illuminated by the divine Logos himself, absolute understanding and knowledge of the Father is possessed by himself alone in accordance with his merits, when he says, “No one has known the Son save the Father, and no one has known the Father save the Son, and him to whom the Son will reveal him.” Neither can anyone worthily know the uncreated and firstborn of all created nature in the way that the Father who begat him knows him; nor can anyone know the Father in the same way as the living Logos who is God’s wisdom and truth. By participation in him who took away from the Father what is called darkness, which he made “his hiding place,” and what is called his covering, “the great deep,” thus revealing the Father, anyone whatever who has the capacity to know him may do so.

The reasons of the divine dispensation and providence are most obscure. For “God made darkness his hiding place.” Those desiring audaciously and rashly to examine this darkness and appropriating for themselves one thing from another have fallen headlong into the dense “darkness” of errors.
