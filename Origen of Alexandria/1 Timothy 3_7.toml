Therefore let us see by what order the high priest is appointed. It says, “Moses called together the congregation and said to them, ‘This is the Word that the Lord commanded.’ ” Although the Lord had given them commands about appointing the high priest and had made his choice, the congregation was still called together. For in ordaining a priest, the presence of the people is also required that all may know and be certain that from all the people one is chosen for the priesthood who is more excellent, who is more wise, who is more holy, who is more eminent in every virtue, lest afterwards, when he stands before the people, any hesitation or any doubt should remain. This is also what the apostle taught when he spoke about the ordination of a priest: “It is necessary to have a good witness from those who are outside.”
