There is the ability of those to whom “five talents” were given, the ability of those to whom “two talents” were given and the ability of those to whom “one talent” was given. Also, one person did not receive the same amount as the other. And “he who had received the one talent” received by no means a paltry sum, for even one talent from this master is considerable. However, three in number are the servants of him who “set out like a man going abroad,” just as in another parable those who bear fruit are three in number: “some” of them. Again “one hundred, some sixty and some thirty.” But he who gains thirty is saved.

The master’s words scold him “who had received the one talent” and “hid it in the ground.” And I wonder whether those who received “five talents” can be deemed to be more mature than those who study and receive the more noble and sublime context of Scripture. Now those who received “two talents” improved somewhat on the original sum given but were unable to gain more. Those in the third group, however, were unable to capitalize on the amount they had first received. It is entirely a matter of numbers, therefore, in those words that form a fitting discourse of our Lord and Savior—namely, five and two and one.
