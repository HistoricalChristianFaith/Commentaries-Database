We are not to suppose that each individual must contend with all these adversaries, which would be impossible for anyone.… For I think that human nature has definite limitations, even though there is a Paul, of whom it is said, “He is a chosen vessel unto me,” or a Peter against whom “the gates of hell shall not prevail,” or a Moses, “the friend of God.” For not even one of these could face the whole crowd of opposing powers at once without destruction to himself, except perhaps on the condition that there was working within him the power of him who said, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” …I do not think that human nature alone can maintain a contest with angels and with the powers of the “height” and of the “depth” or with “any other creature.” But when it feels the presence of the Lord dwelling within it, confidence in the divine help will lead it to say, “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? The Lord is the protector of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?”

We are persecuted when God allows the tempter the power to persecute us. But when God does not want us to suffer this, even in the world that hates us, we wondrously have peace and are of good cheer because of him who said, “Be of good cheer, I have overcome the world.” And truly he has overcome the world, because the world is strong only insofar as its Victor wants it to be. He has received from the Father the victory over the world. And because of his victory we can indeed be of good cheer.
