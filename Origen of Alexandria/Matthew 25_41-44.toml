He could have said to the unrighteous, “I was sick, and you did not visit me; I was in prison, and you did not come to me.” Instead he abbreviated his discourse and compressed both phrases into one, saying, “I was sick and in prison, and you did not visit me,” for it was proper for a merciful judge to embellish the good deeds of people but to skim over their evil deeds. The righteous, however, dwell on each word, saying, “When did we see you hungry, and feed you; or thirsty, and give you drink?” And “when did we see you a stranger, and take you in; or naked, and clothe you?” Or “when did we see you sick or in prison, and come to you?” For it is characteristic of the righteous, out of humility, studiously to make light of each of their good deeds held up to them. It is as though to the Lord’s words, “This, that and the other good thing you did to me,” they disavowingly reply, “Neither this, that nor the other thing did we do to you.” The unrighteous do not treat each item individually but are quick to say, “When did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you, for we ministered the word to you.” They refer to everything they did and tend to play down their evil actions, which might appear worse if enumerated one by one, for it is characteristic of wicked people to mention their faults, by way of excuse, as being either nonexistent or few and far between.
