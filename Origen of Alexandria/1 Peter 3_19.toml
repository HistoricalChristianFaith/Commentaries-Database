If the passage about John the Baptist not being worthy to untie Jesus’ shoes possesses a hidden meaning, we ought not to pass over it. I think that the incarnation, when the Son of God takes on flesh and bones, is one of the shoes, and the descent into hell is the other. It is said in Psalm 16: “You will not leave my soul in hell.” And Peter, in his general epistle, mentions Jesus’ descent into hell. Therefore the one who can show the meaning of both sojourns in a worthy manner is able to unloose Jesus’ shoes.
