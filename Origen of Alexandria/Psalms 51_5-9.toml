Celsus has not explained how error accompanies the “becoming,” or product of generation; nor has he expressed himself with sufficient clearness to enable us to compare his ideas with ours and to pass judgment on them. But the prophets, who have given some wise suggestions on the subject of things produced by generation, tell us that a sacrifice for sin was offered even for newborn infants, as not being free from sin. They say, “I was shaped in iniquity, and in sin did my mother conceive me”; also, “They are estranged from the womb”; which is followed by the singular expression, “They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.”
