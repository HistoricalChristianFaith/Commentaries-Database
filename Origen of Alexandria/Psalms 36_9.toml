What other light of God can we speak of, in which a person sees light, except God’s spiritual power, which when it lightens a person causes him either to see clearly the truth of all things or to know God, who is called the truth? Such then is the meaning of the saying, “In your light shall we see light”; that is, in your word and your wisdom, which is your Son, in him shall we see you, the Father.
