These words require a concerned and attentive hearer. For this part of the statement is new: “And the angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven.” But what the text adds is not new. For “I shall certainly bless you” has already been said earlier, and “I shall certainly multiply you” has been promised earlier, and “your seed shall be as the stars of heaven and as the sand of the sea” also had been announced previously. What therefore is there now in addition which is declared a second time from heaven? What new word is added to the old promises? What additional reward is given in that which the text says, “Because you have done this thing,” that is because you have offered your son, because you have not spared your only son? I see nothing additional. The same things are repeated which were previously promised. Will it, therefore, seem superfluous to go over the same things again and again? On the contrary, it is necessary. For all things that happen occur in mysteries.One promise would have sufficed if Abraham had lived only “according to the flesh” and had been the father of one people whom he begot “according to the flesh.” But now, to show in the first place that he is to be the father of those who are circumcised “according to the flesh,” the promise that should affect the people of circumcision is given to him at the time of his circumcision. In the second place, because he was to be the father also of those who “are of faith” and who come to the inheritance through the passion of Christ, the promise that should apply to that people which is saved by the passion and resurrection of Christ is renewed at the time, no less, of the passion of Isaac.
The same things indeed appear to be repeated, but they are widely different. For those things that are said first and apply to the previous people are said on the earth. For thus the Scripture says: “And he brought him forth”—from the tent, of course—“and said to him, ‘Look at the stars of heaven. Can they be numbered in their multitude?’ ” And he adds, “So shall your seed be.” But when the promise is repeated the second time, the text designates that it is said to him “from heaven.” The first promise is given from the earth, the second “from heaven.” Does not this clearly seem to represent that which the apostle says: “The first man was of the earth, earthly; the second man from heaven, heavenly.” This latter promise, therefore, which applies to the faithful people is “from heaven,” the former from the earth.
