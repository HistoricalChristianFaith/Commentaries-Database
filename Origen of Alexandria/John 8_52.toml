The majority, even of the wise, think that every kind of sin, of which one form is also the sin against reason, has no other source than mistaken judgments. But those who have believed in the holy Scriptures as divine think that the things people do contrary to right reason are not accomplished apart from demons or some such hostile powers. The Jews, too, therefore, assumed that it was the result of the activity of a demon that Jesus said, “Truly, truly I say to you, if anyone shall keep my word, he will not see death forever.” And they had this impression because they had neither kept the word nor perceived the meaning of what was said. For here he was speaking of the death of those who are at enmity with the Word [or reason] who die forever because they do not keep his word. But they think he is talking about that death which is common to all, and so when he says that everyone who has kept his word will not die forever, [they think that he] has lost his wits, since Abraham and the prophets died.

There is a difference between tasting death and seeing death. The Jews, as unintelligent hearers, confused the saying of the Lord and instead of “he will not see death” said “He will not taste death.”
