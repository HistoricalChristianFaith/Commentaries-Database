As long as Jesus was present, his disciples did not sleep. After he had walked away a short distance, they were unable to watch for even one hour in his absence. For this reason we should pray that Jesus will not leave us for even a short while but will fulfill what he promised when he said to us, "And I am with you all days, even to the end of the world." In this way will we keep watch as he banishes sleep from our souls, to make it possible for us to fulfill his command: "Do not give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids, that you may escape as a doe from the nets and a bird from the snare of the fowlers." But coming to the disciples and finding them asleep, he arouses them with a word and tells them to listen, so he may as it were say to those who are listening: "How is it that you were not able to watch with me for even one hour?"He orders us then to be wakeful so we may keep watch and pray. Now that person watches who does good works, that person watches who diligently attends to the truth of the faith lest he be ensnared by any shady teaching. He who watches and prays in this way will have his prayer heard. This is what the Lord means when he says, "Watch and pray." We should first watch and, while watching, we should pray.
