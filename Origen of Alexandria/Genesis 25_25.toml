This Esau proceeded from his mother’s womb “hairy all over like a skin,” but Jacob was smooth and simple. Thus Jacob received his name from wrestling or supplanting, but Esau—as those who interpret Hebrew names say—received his name either from redness or from earth, that is, “red” or “earthly,” or, as it seemed to others, his name appears to mean “something made.”Certainly, as the apostle says, both sons were conceived “from our one father Isaac.” But why these prerogatives are given is not mine to know. Neither do I know why one “supplanted his brother” and was born smooth and simple, nor why the other was born “hairy all over” and shaggy and, so to speak, enwrapped in the squalor of sin and vileness. This is not mine to discuss.
