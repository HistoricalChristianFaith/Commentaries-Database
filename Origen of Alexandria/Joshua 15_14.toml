But who are those sons of vain humility whom Caleb drove out? First Sheshai, which is interpreted "outside me," that is, "outside the holy," because the son of vain humility is outside the holy, and indeed outside God. And another is Ahiman, which means "my brother outside counsel" just as if we said, "brother without counsel." For it is certain all brothers who are born from vain humility are outside counsel. Third is Talmai, which means "precipice" or "suspension." This indicates that there is nothing stable in him, but all things are unsettled and rushing headlong into great danger.
