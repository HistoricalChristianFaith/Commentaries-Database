The kingdom of God, according to the word of our Lord and Savior, “comes not with observation”; and “neither shall they say, Behold here, or behold there”—but “the kingdom of God is within us” (for “the word is very near to us,” in our mouths and in our hearts). So one who prays for the coming of the kingdom of God rightly prays that the kingdom of God might be established in himself, that it might bear fruit and be perfected in himself. Every saint, being ruled by God as king and obedient to the spiritual laws of God, as it were, dwells within this kingdom as in a well-ordered city. The Father is present to such a one, and Christ reigns with the Father in the soul that is maturing. This is in accord with the promise that “we will come to him and make our abode with him.”
