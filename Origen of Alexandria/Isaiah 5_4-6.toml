See then how very bad sinning is, that they may be delivered to Satan, who holds captive the souls of those forsaken by Godâ€”though God does not forsake without cause or judgment those whom he has abandoned. For when he sends the rain for the vineyard and the vineyard bears thorns instead of grapes, what else will God do except order the clouds not to sprinkle rain on the vineyard?
