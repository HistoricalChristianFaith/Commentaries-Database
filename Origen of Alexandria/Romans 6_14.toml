Once again note the subtlety of Paul’s language. When he talks about us he says that “sin” will have no dominion over us, but when he talks about Christ he says that it is “death” which will have no dominion over him, for there was room for death in Christ but not sin.The law of which he speaks here is the law in our members, which is opposed to the law of the mind. It is clear that those who have put to death their members will not be under the law of their members but under the grace of God. If someone wants to read this as referring to the law of Moses, the text will doubtless mean that we are not under the law of the letter, which kills, but under the law of the Spirit, which gives life and which Paul here calls grace.
