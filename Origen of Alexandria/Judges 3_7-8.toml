Now Chusarsaton’s name is translated as “humiliation.” They were delivered, then, to the hands of one who would humiliate them. And it was because they acted wickedly on the heights of the mountains against the Most High that he sent them to their humiliation. But I don’t want you to think that it is only in relation to the ancients that divine providence delivers those who were exalted in wickedness for the purpose of humiliating them and that they may be healed by such a wholesome remedy. Presently as well, almighty God’s healing providence is [not] lacking in relation to his church. Even now, there is a “Chusarsaton king of Mesopotamia” to whom souls are handed over for humiliation and affliction, souls who had moved themselves from despised Christian humility into pride and arrogance. The vice of pride is utterly hateful in the sight of God, for, as Scripture says, “pride is the beginning of departure from God” and, again, “God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.”
