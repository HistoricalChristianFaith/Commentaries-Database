Faith relies on the grace of the justifier. Works rely on the justice of the rewarder. When I consider the greatness of Paul’s speech, by which he says that the worker receives what is due to him, I can hardly persuade myself that there is any deed which could claim a reward from God as its due.… Therefore, it seems that Paul is really referring here to evil deeds, of which Scripture frequently says that they get their due reward.
