We ought not to overlook this passage. The apostle is not merely complaining about those who worship idols, but he should also be understood to be refuting the Anthropomorphites, who are found inside the church, who say that the bodily image of man is as such the image of God, ignoring the fact that it is written in Genesis that the whole person is created in the image of God, which must be understood as it is interpreted by the apostle, when he said: “You have put off the old man with his behavior and you have put on the new man, which is created according to God.” … Elsewhere Paul calls this the “inner man” and regards the corrupt bodily image as the “outer man.” … The mistake of those who think that it is this outer man which is the image of God is therefore obvious.

These people have lowered to a body without soul or sense the identity of the One who gives to all sentient and rational beings not only the power of sentience but also of sensing rationally, and to some even the power of sensing and thinking perfectly and virtuously.
