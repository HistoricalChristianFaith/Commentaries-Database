Indeed at that time, when the people went out of the land of Egypt, “they carried dough in their clothes.” And when the dough had run out and they had no bread, God rained manna on them. But when they came to the holy land and “took the fruit of the province of the palms, the manna ceased for them,” and then they began to eat of the fruit of the land.In this manner, three kinds of food in general are described. The first one we certainly enjoy when going out of the land of Egypt, but this suffices for only a little time. Manna follows after this. But the third fruit we receive now from the holy land. By this diversity, as my insignificant perception comprehends, I think it is indicated that the first food that we carry with us when leaving Egypt is this little school learning (or even more advanced learning if, by chance, anyone has acquired it) that is able to help us only a little. But, placed in the desert, that is, in the condition of life in which we now are, we enjoy the manna only through what we learn by the instructions of the divine law. But the one who will deserve to enter the land of promise, that is, to obtain that which has been promised by the Savior, that one will eat fruits from the region of the palms. For truly that person who arrives at these promises after having conquered the enemy will discover the fruit of the palm. For it is certain that however great those things are that we are now able to understand or to know in the law of God or in divine learning, those things that the holy ones will deserve to see “face to face” when the enigma is over, will be far more sublime and lofty. For “what the eye has not seen or the ear heard, what has not ascended into a person’s heart, these are the things God has prepared for those who love him.”
