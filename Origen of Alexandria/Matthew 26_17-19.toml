The opportunity which Judas sought is further explained by Luke, how he might betray him in the absence of the multitude; (Luke 22:6.) when the populace was not with Him, but He was withdrawn with His disciples. And this he did, delivering Him up after supper, when He was withdrawn to the garden of Gethsemane. And from that time forward, such has been the season sought for by those that would betray the word of God in time of persecution when the multitude of believers is not around the word of truth.

Some one may argue, (e. g. The Ebionites) that because Jesus kept the Passover with Jewish observances, we ought to do the same as followers of Christ, not remembering that Jesus was made under the Law, though not that He should leave under the Law (Gal. 4:4.) those who were under it, but should lead them out of it; how much less fitting then is it, that those who before were without the Law, should afterwards enter in? We celebrate spiritually the things which were carnally celebrated in the Law, keeping the Passover in the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth, (1 Cor. 5:8. John 6:53.) according to the will of the Lamb, who said, Except ye eat my flesh and drink my blood, ye shall not have life in you.

I think that the man “carrying a jar of water” whom the disciples met when they entered the city and whom Jesus wanted them to follow into his house was bringing it into the house not only that the house might be clean but also more richly endowed. He was serving the head of the household (that is, the intellect), bearing purifying water in an earthen vessel “that the heights of power might belong to God.” Or perhaps he was supplying potable water in the earthen vessel so that the Son of God could provide new growth to the vine, for the servant of the intellect is the water of the Law and the Prophets, which must be mixed with the wine of the evangelical word. But we who wish to belong to the church and to celebrate the Passover with Jesus follow that man, whom I believe to be Moses, giver of the law, who bears this kind of water, carrying spiritual doctrine about in historical vessels.
