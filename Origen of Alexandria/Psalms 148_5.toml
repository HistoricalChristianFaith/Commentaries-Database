This is not the time to prove that the Creator did not become the servant of the Word and make the world and to show that the Word became the servant of the creator and prepared the world. For according to the prophet David, “God spoke, and they were made; he commanded, and they were created.” For the uncreated God “commanded” the firstborn of all creation, and “they were created.” This includes not only the cosmos and the things in it, but also all that remains, “whether thrones, or dominations, or principalities or powers; for all things have been created through him and for him, and he is before all things.”
