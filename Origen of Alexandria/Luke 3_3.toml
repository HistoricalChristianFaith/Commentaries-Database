Jordan is the same as descending, for there descends from God a river of healing water. But what parts would John be traversing but the country lying about Jordan, that the penitent sinner might soon arrive at the flowing stream, humbling himself to receive the baptism of repentance. For it is added, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.

"Jordan" means "descending." It is the "descending" river of God, one running with a vigorous force. It is the Lord our Savior. Into him we are baptized with true, saving water. Baptism is also preached "for the remission of sins."

The precursor of Christ—the voice of one crying in the wilderness—preaches in the desert of the soul that has known no peace. Not only then, but even now, a bright and burning lamp first comes and preaches the baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. Then the true Light follows, as John himself said: "He must increase, but I must decrease." The word came in the desert and spread in all the countryside around the Jordan.
