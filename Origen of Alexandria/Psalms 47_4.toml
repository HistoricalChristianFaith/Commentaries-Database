But what does it profit me, if the seed of Abraham, “which is Christ,” should possess “the cities of his enemies for an inheritance” and should not possess my city? If in my city, that is, in my soul, which is “the city of the great king,” neither his laws nor his ordinances should be observed? What does it profit me that he has subjected the whole world and possesses the cities of his enemies if he should not also conquer his enemies in me, if he should not destroy “the law that is in my members fighting against the law of my mind and that leads me captive in the law of sin”? So, therefore, let each one of us do what is necessary that Christ may also conquer the enemies in his soul and in his body, and, subjecting and triumphing over them, may possess the city even of his soul.
