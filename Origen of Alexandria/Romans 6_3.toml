Paul is saying by this that if we have died to sin then we must necessarily be buried with Christ in baptism, but â€¦ if we have not died to sin, then we cannot be buried with Christ. For nobody is buried while still alive. Then too, anyone who is not buried together with Christ has not been validly baptized.
