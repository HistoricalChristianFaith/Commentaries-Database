We must keep in mind, however, that the Word promises to the righteous through the mouth of Isaiah that days will come when not the sun but the Lord will be to them an everlasting light, and God will be their glory. And it is from misunderstanding, I think, some pestilent heresy that gave an interpretation to the words “let there be light,” as if they were the expression of a wish merely on the part of the Creator, that Celsus made the remark, “The Creator did not borrow light from above, like those persons who kindle lamps at those of their neighbors.”
