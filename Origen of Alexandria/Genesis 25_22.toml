So therefore also now it is related of Rebekah: “She departed to inquire of the Lord.” As we have said, she should be considered to have departed not by the steps of her feet but by the advances of her mind.You also therefore will be said to have de-parted “to inquire of the Lord” if you have begun to contemplate not those things “which are seen but those which are not seen,” that is, not carnal but spiritual things, not present but future things.
Tear yourself away from your old manner of life and from the fellowship of those with whom you have lived shamefully and notoriously. Associate yourself with honorable and religious actions, when you shall have been searched for among companions of shamefulness and shall never have been found in crowds of the guilty. If so, then it will be said also of you: “He departed to inquire of the Lord.”
So therefore the saints depart not from one place to another but from one life to another, from beginning instructions to more advanced instructions.
