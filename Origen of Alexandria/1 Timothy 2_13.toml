But you should not be surprised that she [the church] who is gathered out of the dispersion of the nations and prepared to be the bride of Christ has sometimes been guilty of these faults. Remember how the first woman was seduced and was in the transgression and could find her salvation, so the Scripture says, only in bearing children, which for our present purpose means those who continue in faith and love with sanctity. The apostle, therefore, declares what is written about Adam and Eve thus, “This is a great mystery in Christ and in the church.” Christ so loved her that he gave himself for her, while she was yet undutiful, even as he says, “When as yet we were ungodly according to the time, Christ died for us”; and again, “While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.”
