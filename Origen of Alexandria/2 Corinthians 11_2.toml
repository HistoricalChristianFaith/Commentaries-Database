The apostle Paul says, “But I want you all to present yourselves as a pure virgin to one man, Christ. For I fear lest, as the serpent seduced Eve by his cunning, your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity which is in Christ.” Therefore, Paul wants “all the Corinthians” to present themselves as a pure “virgin to Christ”; certainly he would never want that unless it would seem possible. Whence also it would appear wonderful how these, who although corrupted by diverse sins, came to the faith of Christ, all at once are called “a pure virgin”; a virgin which is so holy and so pure that she is worthy also to be joined in marriage to Christ. However, since we cannot refer these things to the chastity of the flesh, it is sure that they refer to the chastity of the soul, whose “simplicity of the faith which is in Christ,” according to the understanding of Paul himself, was called his virginity.
