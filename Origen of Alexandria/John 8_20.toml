The Evangelist would not have added these words were it not to convey something useful.… Whenever it says “these are the words that he spoke in such and such a place,” you will discover a reason for the addition.…The treasury was a place where coins were contributed for the honor of God and the support of the poor. What else would these coins be than the divine words that have the image of the great King stamped on them and that are examined by trustworthy money changers who know how to separate counterfeit coins from the genuine ones?…
But if everyone contributed to the temple treasury in support of the needy for the common good, Jesus, more than anyone else was surely a worthy contributor. He gave the words of eternal life and his teaching about God and himself. His statement, “I am the light of the world,” which was spoken in the treasury, was more valuable than any coin … as were all his other teachings in that place. And all the gold of the others who brought what they had into the treasury was like a bit of sand in comparison to the words of Jesus, for every word of his was wisdom.
