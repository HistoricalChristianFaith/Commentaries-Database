As long as a people serves God, they are not “delivered into the hands of plunderers.” But when they “abandon the Lord” and begin to serve their own passions, then it is said of them that “God gave them over to shameful passions” and, again, “He gave them over to a reprobate mind, that they would do unsuitable things.” Why? Because, he says, “they were filled with every iniquity, wickedness, fornication, greed” and all other evils. It was because “they served and worshiped Baal and Ashtaroth” that “God delivered them into the hands of plunderers and handed them over to their enemies.” This, as I have often said before, the Jews read as though it were merely a record of past events. We, however, “for whose sake this was written,” it is said, ought to know that if we sin against the Lord and against our own souls by indulging the desires of the flesh as though we were worshiping our God, we also betray ourselves and concede our apostolic authority into the hands of Zebulun. Listen, then, to [Paul] speaking about one who sins: “I delivered this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit might be saved.” You can see, therefore, that it was not only through his apostles that God “delivered” sinners “over to their enemies,” but even now, through those who govern the church and have the power not only of releasing but also of binding, sinners “are delivered for the destruction of the flesh” when they are separated from the body of Christ for their crimes.
