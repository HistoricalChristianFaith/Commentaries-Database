He wrote, in the way the son of Nun was able at that time, to depict the law upon the stones of the altar; and, to the extent he was capable, he dimly sketched types. Let us see, however, how our Jesus wrote Deuteronomy “on living” and “whole stones.”Deuteronomy is called, so to speak, a “second law.” If therefore you wish to see how, after the first law was annulled, Jesus wrote the second law, hear him saying in the Gospel, “It was said in former times: You shall not kill. But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother is a murderer.” And again, “It was said in former times: You shall not commit adultery. But I say to you, if anyone has looked upon a woman to desire her, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart.” And, “It was said in former times: You shall not swear falsely. But I say to you, do not swear at all.” You see Deuteronomy, which Jesus wrote “on living” and “whole stones; not on stone tablets, but on the fleshly tablets of the heart; not with ink, but by the Spirit of the living God.”

How was he able to depict so large a book to the sons of Israel—or even to those standing and remaining there—so that they did not disperse until the writing of so many verses was finished? Or even how were the stones of the altar able to bear the contents of such a large book? Such things let those Jewish defenders of the letter who are ignorant of the spirit of the law tell me. In what manner is the truth of the narrative demonstrated in this? Yet among those former ones “to this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their heart.” But for us, “who have turned to the Lord” Jesus, “the veil is taken away” because “where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom of understanding.”15Therefore our Lord Jesus does not need much time in order to write Deuteronomy, in order to set up the “second law” in the hearts of believers and imprint the law of the Spirit in the minds of those who are worthy to be chosen for the construction of the altar. For immediately when anyone believes in Jesus Christ, the law of the gospel is written down in that person’s heart and written down “in the sight of the sons of Israel.”
