Now, if you please, let us compare also the Egyptian people with the Israelite people.For it is said subsequently that after the famine and bondage the Egyptian people should offer a fifth part to Pharaoh. But on the contrary the Israelite people offer tithes to the priests. Behold also in this that the divine Scripture is supported by remarkable reasonableness. See the Egyptian people weighing out contributions with the number five; for the five senses in the body are designated, which carnal people serve; for the Egyptians always submit to things visible and corporal. But on the other hand the Israelite people honor ten, the number of perfection; for they received the ten words of the law, and, held together by the power of the Decalogue, they entered upon, by the bestowing, divine mysteries unknown to this world. But also in the New Testament likewise ten is venerable as the fruit of the Spirit is explained to sprout forth in ten virtues and the faithful servant offers his lord ten pounds in profits from his business dealings and receives authority over ten cities. …
Behold, therefore, from all these things the difference between the Egyptian people and the people of Israel.… If you still serve the carnal senses, if you still pay tax with the number five and look to those things which are “visible” and “temporal” and do not look to those things which are “invisible” and “eternal,” know that you belong to the Egyptian people.
