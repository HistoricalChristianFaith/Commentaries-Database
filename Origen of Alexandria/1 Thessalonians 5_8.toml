But if we must also examine the statement, “And it was night,” so that it has not been interjected to no purpose by the Evangelist, we must say that the perceptible night at that time was symbolic, an image of the night that was in Judas’s soul when Satan, the darkness that lies over the abyss, entered him. “For God called the darkness night,” of which night, indeed, Paul says we are not children, nor of darkness, when he says, “Therefore, brothers, we are not of the night, nor of darkness,” and, “But let us who are of the day be sober.”
