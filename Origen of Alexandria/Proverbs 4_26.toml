“Invite the poor,” he says, those who are poor in words, so that you can make them rich. Invite “the crippled,” those whose minds are injured, so that you can heal them. Invite “the lame,” those who limp in their reason, so that they can make “straight paths.” Invite the blind, who do not have the faculty of contemplation, so that they can see the true light.
