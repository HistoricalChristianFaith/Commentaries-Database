These are the works of darkness, which are also called the “works of the flesh,” in which people bind their flesh to luxury and uncleanness rather than to holiness or the Lord. “Reveling” refers to dishonorable and extravagant banqueting, which inevitably is prone to sexual immorality.… “Quarreling and jealousy” are really acts of the mind, but like everything else here, they are called acts of the flesh.
