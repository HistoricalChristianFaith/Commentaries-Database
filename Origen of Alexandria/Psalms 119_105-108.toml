Nevertheless, I remember, when we explained that verse of Psalm 118 [LXX], in which it is written, “Your law, Lord, is a lamp to my feet and a light to my paths,” we showed the difference between “lamp” and “light” as best we could. For we said that “the lamp” was allotted “for the feet,” that is, the lower parts of the body; but “the light” was given “for the paths,” which “paths” are called in another passage “eternal paths.” Therefore, because according to such a mystical understanding this world is understood as the lower parts of creation, therefore “the lamp” of the law is mentioned as having been lit for these who are in this world as the feet of the whole creation. But the eternal “light” will be for those “paths” through which each one in accordance with his merits will advance into the future age.
