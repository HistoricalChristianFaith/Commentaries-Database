The strong in soul are spoken of with approval. For also among the Greeks the strong and the greatness of the rational soul are continually named. For whenever anyone throws himself into great deeds, has worthwhile objectives, always considers what is right and how he can live in accordance with right reason, wishing not to know anything abject and small, such a person has in the soul the strong and the great. The others, then, the ones the Word disparaged since they were poor, did not hear, the prophet said; they did not hear for this reason: since they were poor. I will go to the strong and speak to them, and if it is so that the blessed person is meant in the saying the ears of those who hear one is blessed if he should ever meet a strong and great listener.
