Just as it sufficed for the Lord only to taste “vinegar mixed with gall,” so also was it sufficient for our benefit that he only taste death, which lasted no longer than three days. The other wine, however, which was not “mixed with gall” or with anything else, he took and drank, and “when he had given thanks,” he gave it to his disciples, promising that he would drink it “anew in the kingdom of God.”
