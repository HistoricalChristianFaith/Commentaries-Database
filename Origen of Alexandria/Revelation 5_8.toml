We regard the spirit of every good person as an altar from which arises an incense that is truly and spiritually sweet-smelling, namely, the prayers ascending from a pure conscience. Therefore it is said by John in the Revelation, “The odors are the prayers of the saints”; and by the psalmist, “Let my prayer come before you as incense.” And the statues and gifts that are fit offerings to God are the work of no common mechanics but are wrought and fashioned in us by the Word of God, to wit, the virtues in which we imitate “the firstborn of all creation,” who has set us an example of justice, of temperance, of courage, of wisdom, of piety, and of the other virtues.
