Or, by the kingdom of heaven is reasonably understood the holy Church, in which the Lord works what He speaks of in this parable. By the man is sometimes represented the Father, as in that, “The Kingdom of heaven is like to a king, who made a marriage for his son;” and sometimes the Son; but here we may take it for both, the Father and the Son, who are one God. God is called a King, inasmuch as He created and governs all things.
Or, by the servants of this King are signified all mankind whom He has created for His own praise, and to whom He gave the law of nature; He takes account with them, when He would look into each man’s manners, life, and deeds, that Hemay render to each according to that He has done; as it follows, “And when Hehad begun to reckon, one was brought unto Him which owed Him ten thousand talents.”He says, “And when he began to take account,” because the beginning of the judgment is that it begin from the house of God.
Man who sinned of his own will and choice, has no power to rise again by his own endeavour, and has not wherewith to pay, because he finds nothing in himself by which he may loose himself frown his sins; whence it follows, “And when he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and payment to be made.” The fool’s wife is folly, and the pleasure or lust of the flesh.
That he says, “falling down,” shows how the sinner humbled himself, and offered amends. “Have patience with me,” expresses the sinner’s prayer, begging respite, and space to correct his error. Abundant is the bounty of God, and His clemency to sinners converted, seeing He is ever ready to forgive sins by baptism or penitence, as it follows, “But the lord of that servant had mercy upon him, and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.”.
So by him who owed ten thousand talents are represented those that commit the greater crimes; by the debtor of a hundred denarii those who commit the lesser.
That is, he pressed him hardly, that he might exact vengeance from him.
Or perhaps they represent the Angels, or the preachers of the holy Church, or any of the faithful, who when they see a brother whose sins are forgiven refusing to forgive his fellow servant, they are sorrowful over his perdition. "And they came, and told their lord what was done.” They came not in body, but in spirit. To tell their Lord, is to show the woe and sorrow of the heart in their carriage. It follows, “Then his lord called him.” He called him by the sentence of death, and bade him pass out of this world, and said. unto him, “Thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, becausethou prayedst me.”.
And it is to be known, that we read no answer made by that servant to his lord; by which it is shown us, that in the day of judgment, and altogether after this life, all excusing of ourselves shall be cut off.
