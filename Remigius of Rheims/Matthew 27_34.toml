For this Simon was not a man of Jerusalem, but a foreigner, and denizen, beinga Cyrene an; Cyrene is a town of Lybia. Simon is interpreted ‘obedient,’ and aCyrene an ‘an heir;’ whence he well denotes the people of the Gentiles, which was strange to the testaments of God, but by believing became a fellow-citizen of the saints, of the household, and an heir of God.
