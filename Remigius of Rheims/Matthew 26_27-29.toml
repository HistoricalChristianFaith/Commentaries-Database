The Lord having given His disciples His Body under the element of bread, well gives the cup of His Blood to them likewise; showing what joy He has in our salvation, seeing He even shed His Blood for us.

For thus it is read, Behold the blood of the covenant which the Lord hath made with you. (Exod. 24:8.)

And it is to be noted, that He says not, For a few, nor, For all, but, For many; because He came not to redeem a single nation, but many out of all nations.

And He taught us to offer not bread only, but wine also, to show that they who hungered and thirsted after righteousness were to be refreshed by these mysteries.

For it should be known, that as John speaks, The many waters are nations and people. (Rev. 17:15.) And because we ought always to abide in Christ and Christ in us, wine mixed with water is offered, to show that the head and the members, that is, Christ and the Church, are one body; or to show that neither did Christ suffer without a love for our redemption, nor we can be saved without His Passion.

Or otherwise; I will not drink of the fruit of this vine, i. e. I will no longer take pleasure in the carnal oblations of the Synagogue, among which the immolation of the Paschal lamb held an eminent place. But the time of My resurrection is at hand, and the day in which exalted in the Father's kingdom, that is, raised in immortal glory, I shall drink it new with you, i. e. I shall rejoice as with a new joy in the salvation of that people then renewed by the water of baptism.
