Understand, ‘of God;’ for though temporal blessings are also proclaimed, yet they are not called The Gospel. Hence the Law was not called a Gospel, because to such as kept it, it held out not heavenly, but earthly, goods.
It should be known that those whom He healed outwardly in their bodies, He also healed inwardly in their souls. Others cannot do this of their own power, but can by God’s grace.
But when the Son of God looked down from heaven upon the earth, to hear the groans of the captives , straight a great harvest began to ripen; for the multitude of the human race would never have come near to the faith, had not the Author of human salvation looked down from heaven. And it follows, “Then said he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is great, but the labourers are few.”.
For the number of the Apostles was small in comparison of so great crops to bereaped. The Lord exhorts His preachers, that is, the Apostles and their followers, that they should daily desire an increase of their number; “Pray yetherefore the Lord of the harvest, that he would send forth labourers into his harvest.”
