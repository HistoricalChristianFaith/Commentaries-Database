These words overthrow the error of those who said that the Lord should not continue in the same form of a servant. By “his majesty,” He means His divinity, in which He is equal to the Father and the Holy Spirit.
“And all nations shall be gathered before Him.” These words prove that the resurrection of men shall be real.
And it is to be noted, that the Lord here enumerates six works of mercy which who so shall study to accomplish shall be entitled to the kingdom prepared for the chosen from the foundation of the world.
