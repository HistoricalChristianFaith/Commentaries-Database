Ignorance was not His reason for asking them, but that from their answering, “seven,” the miracle might be noised abroad, and become more known in proportion to the smallness of the number. It goes on: “And He commanded the people to sit down on the ground." In the former feeding they lay down on grass, in this one on the ground. It continues, “And He took the seven loaves, and gave thanks, and brake." In giving thanks, He has left us an example, that for all gifts conferred on us from heaven we should return thanks to Him. And it is to be remarked, that our Lord did not give the bread to the people, but to His disciples, and the disciples to the people. For it goes on, “and gave to His disciples to set before them; and they did set them before the people." And not only the bread, but the fish also He blessed, and ordered to be set before them.
