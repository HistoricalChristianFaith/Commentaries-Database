Or else, by the fuller are meant holy preachers and purifiers of the soul, none of whom in this life can so liveas not to be stained with some spots of sin; but in the coming resurrection allthe saints shall be purged from every stain of sin. Therefore the Lord will make them such as neither they themselves by taking vengeance on their own members, nor any preacher by his example and doctrine, can make.
