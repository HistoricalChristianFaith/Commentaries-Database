Capharnaum was the metropolis of Galilee, and a noted town of that province, and therefore the Lord mentions it particularly, saying, “And thou, Capharnaum,shalt thou indeed be exalted to heaven? Thou shalt go down even to hell.”.
And they have made the sins not of Sodom only and Gomorrah, but of Tyre and Sidon light in comparison, and therefore it follows, “For if the mighty works which have been done in thee had been done in Sodom, it would perhaps have remained unto this day.”.
The Lord, who knows all things, here uses a word expressing uncertainty—”perhaps,” to show that freedom of choice is left to men. “But Isay unto you, it shall be easier for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.” And be it known, that in speaking of the city or country, the Lord does not chide with the buildings and walls, but with the men that inhabit there, by the figure metonymy, putting the thing containing for the thing contained. The words, “It shall be easier in the day of judgment,” clearly prove that there are divers punishments in hell, as there are divers mansions in the kingdom of heaven.
