He says therefore, “Hear Him,” as much as to say, Let the shadow of the Law bepast, and the types of the Prophets, and follow ye the one shining light of the Gospel. Or He says, “Hear ye Him,” to show that it was He whom Moses had foretold, “The Lord your God shall raise up a Prophet unto you of your brethren like unto me, Him shall ye hear.” Thus the Lord had witnesses on all sides; from heaven the voice of the Father, Elias out of Paradise, Moses out of Hades, the Apostles from among men, that at the name of Jesus every thing should bowthe knee, of things in heaven, things on earth, and things beneath.
Whereas the holy Apostles fell upon their faces, that was a proof of their sanctity, for the saints are always described to fall upon their faces, but the wicked to fall backwards.
Or, because if His majesty should be published among the people, they should hinder the dispensation of His passion, by resistance to the chief Priests; and thus the redemption of the human race should suffer impediment.
