Or; He withdrew from thence as avoiding the designs of His own when they persecuted Him; or because that was not the time or place for Him to suffer, for “It cannot be that a Prophet should perish out of Jerusalem,” as He Himself spake.The Lord also shunned those who persecuted Him through hatred, and went thither where He found many who were attached to Him from affection, whence it follows, “And there followed him many.” Him whom the Pharisees with one consent plotted against to destroy, the untaught multitude with one consent love and follow; whence they soon received the fulfilment of their desires, for it follows, “And he healed them all.”.

The Lord Jesus Christ is called the servant of the Almighty God , not in respect of His divinity, but in respect of the dispensation of the flesh which He took upon Him because bythe cooperation of the Holy Spirit He took flesh of the Virgin without stain of sin. Some books have, “Elect, whom I have chosen,” for He was chosen by God the Father, that is, predestinated that He should be the Son of God, proper, not adopted.
That he says, “My soul,” is not to be understood as though God the Father had asoul, but by way of adaptation, showing how God is disposed towards Him. And itis no wonder that a soul is ascribed to God in this manner, seeing that all other members of the body are likewise.

The Greek , is in Latin called ‘latitudo.’ No one therefore has heard His voice in the streets, because He has not promised pleasant things in this world to those that love Him, but hardships.
And it should be known, that the meaning not only of this passage, but of many others also, is supported by this testimony from the Prophet. The words, “Behold my servant,” may be referred to the place in which the Father had said above, "This is my Son.”
