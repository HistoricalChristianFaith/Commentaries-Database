He clearly shows that the Apostles had uttered something harsh against her, when He says, “Why trouble ye the woman?” And beautifully He adds, “She hath wroughta good work in me;” as much as to say, It is not a waste of ointment, as yesay, but a good work, that is, a service of piety and devotion.
“For the poor ye have ever with you.” The Lord shows in these words as of set purpose, that they were not to be blamed who ministered of their substance to Him while He dwelt in a mortal body; forasmuch as the poor were ever in the Church, to whom the believers might do good whensoever they would, but He would abide in the body with them but a very short time. Whence it follows, “But me ye shall not have always.”.
Or, it is to be explained by supposing this spoken to Judas only; and He said not, Ye have not, but “Ye shall not have,” because this was spoken in the person of Judas to all his followers. And He says, “Not always,” though they have it at no time, because the wicked seem to have Christ in this present world, while they mix among His members and approach His table, but they shallnot always so have Him when He shall say to His elect, “Come, ye blessed of my Father.”
