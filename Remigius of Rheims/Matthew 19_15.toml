For it was a custom among the ancients that little children should be brought to aged persons, to receive benediction by their hand or tongue; and according to this custom little children are now brought to the Lord.
Also laying His hands upon them, He blessed them, to signify that the lowly inspirit are worthy His grace and blessing.
