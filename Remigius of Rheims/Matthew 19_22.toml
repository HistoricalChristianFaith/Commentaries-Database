And Jesus, condescending as to a weak one, most graciously set out to him the precepts of the Law; Jesus said, “Thou shalt do no murder;” and of all these precepts follows the exposition, “And thou shalt love thy neighbour asthyself.” For the Apostle says, “Whoso loveth his neighbour has fulfilled the Law?” But it should be enquired, why the Lord has enumerated only the precepts of the Second Table? Perhaps because this young manwas zealous in the love of God, or because love of our neighbour is the step by which we ascend to the love of God.
But to those who would be perfect in grace, He shows how they may come to perfection, “Jesus saith unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go, and sell all that thou hast, and give to the poor.” Mark the words; He said not, Go, and consume all thou hast; but Go, and sell; and not some, as did Ananias andSapphira, but “All.” And well He added, “that thou hast,” for what we have areour lawful possessions. Those therefore that he justly possessed were to besold; what had been gained unjustly were to be restored to those from whom they had been taken. And He said not, Give to thy neighbours, nor to the rich, butto the poor.
