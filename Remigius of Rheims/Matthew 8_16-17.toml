quote='''
Christ the Son of God, the Author of human salvation, the fount and source of all goodness, furnished heavenly medicine, He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all that were sick. DÃ¦mons and diseases He sent away with a word, that by these signs, and mighty works, He might shew that He was come for the salvation of the human race.

He took the infirmity of human nature so as to make us strong who had before been weak.
