An example of life for doctors; that they should not be inactive, they are instructed in these words, “And Jesus went about.”.
That they should not be acceptors of persons the preachers are instructed in what follows, “the whole of Galilee.” That they should not go about empty, bythe word, “teaching.” That they should seek to benefit not few but many, in what follows, “in their synagogues.”.
That the teacher should study to commend his teaching by his own virtuous conduct is conveyed in those words, “healing every sort of disease and malady among the people;” maladies of the body, diseases of the soul.
By these he would have us understand various but slighter diseases; but when he says, “seized with divers sicknesses and torments,” he would have those understood, of whom it is subjoined, “and who had daemons.”.
‘Lunatics’ are so called from the moon; for as it waxes in its monthly seasons they are tormented.
