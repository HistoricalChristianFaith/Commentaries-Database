The life in this place is not to be understood as the substance, (the soul,)but as this present state of being; and the sense is, He who findeth his life,i.e. this present life, he who so loves this light, its joys and pleasures, asto desire that he may always find them; he shall lose that which he wishes always to keep, and prepare his soul for eternal damnation.
