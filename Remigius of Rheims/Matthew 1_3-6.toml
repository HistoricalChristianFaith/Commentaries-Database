It is asked, why this epithet King is thus given by the holy Evangelist to David alone? Because he was the first king in the tribe of Judah. Christ Himself is Phares 'the divider,' as it is written, Thou shalt divide the sheep from the goats; (Mat. 25:33.) He is Zaraml, 'the east,' Lo the man, the east is His name; (Zech. 6:12.) He is Esromm, 'an arrow,' He hath set me as a polished shaft. (Is. 49:2.)

Christ is also Boozt, because He is strength, for, When I am lifted up, I will draw all men unto Me. (John 12:32.) He is Obeth. 'a servantu,' for, the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to minister. (Mat. 20:28.) He is Jesse, or 'burntx,' for, I am come to send fire on earth. (Luke 12:49.) He is Davidy, 'mighty in arm,' for, the Lord is great and powerful; (Ps. 24:8.) 'desirable,' for, He shall come, the Desire of all nations; (Hag. 2:7.) 'beautiful to behold,' according to that, Beautiful in form before the sons of men. (Ps. 45:3.)
