The words which here follow depend on those that went before; “By thy wordsthou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned.” There is no doubt but that every man shall he condemned for his evil words which he speaks; but none shall be justified for his good words, unless they proceed from his inmost heart, and from a entire purpose.
