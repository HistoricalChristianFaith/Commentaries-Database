The sense therefore is: we need not fear that should we ask of God our Father bread, that is doctrine or love, He will give us a stone; that is, that He will suffer our heart to be contracted either by the frost of hatred or by hardness of soul; or that when we ask for faith, He will suffer us to die of the poison of unbelief. Thence it follows, “If then ye being evil.”.
And be it known that where Matthew says, “He shall give good things,” Luke has, "shall give his Holy Spirit.” But this ought not to seem contrary, because all the good things which man receives from God, are given by the grace of the Holy Spirit.
