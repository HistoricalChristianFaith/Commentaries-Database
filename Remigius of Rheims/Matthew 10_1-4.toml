The Evangelist had related above that the Lord exhorted His disciples to pray the Lord of the harvest to send labourers into His vineyard; and He now seems to be fulfilling what He had exhorted them to. For the number twelve is a perfect number, being made up of the number six, which has perfection because it is formed of its own parts, one, two, three, multiplied into one another; and the number six when doubled amounts to twelve.

Wherein is openly showed that the multitude were troubled not with one single kind of affliction, but with many, and this was His pity for the multitude, to give His disciples power to heal and cleanse them.

(ap. Raban.) There have been some who in this name Peter, which is Greek and Latin, have sought a Hebrew interpretation, and would have it to signify, 'Taking off the shoe,' 'or unloosing,' or 'acknowledging.' But those that say this are contradicted by two facts. First, that the Hebrew has no letter P, but uses PH instead. Thus Pilate they call Philate. Secondly, that one of the Evangelists has used the word as an interpretation of Cephas; The Lord said, Thou shalt be called Cephas, (John 1:42.) on which the Evangelist adds, which being interpreted is Petrus. Simon is interpreted 'obedient,' for he obeyed the words of Andrew, and with him came to Christ, or because he obeyed the divine commands, and at one word of bidding followed the Lord. Or as some will have it, it is to be interpreted, 'Laying aside grief,' and, 'hearing painful things;' for that on the Lord's resurrection he laid aside the grief he had for His death; and he heard sorrowful things when the Lord said to him, Another shall gird thee, and shall carry thee whither thou wouldest not. (John 21:18.)
And Andrew his brother.

Andrew is interpreted 'manly;' for as in Latin 'virilis' is derived from 'vir,' so in Greek Andrew is derived from ἀνὴρ. Rightly is he called manly, who left all and followed Christ, and manfully persevered in His commands.

(e Beda.) James is interpreted 'The supplanter,' or 'that supplanteth;' for he not only supplanted the vices of the flesh, but even contemned the same flesh when Herod put him to death. John is interpreted 'The grace of God,' because he deserved before all to be loved by the Lord; whence also in the favour of His especial love, he leaned at supper in the Lord's bosom.
Philip and Bartholomew. (e Beda.) Philip is interpreted, 'The mouth of a lamp,' or 'of lamps,' because when he had been enlightened by the Lord, he straightway sought to communicate the light to his brother by the means of his mouth. Bartholomew is a Syriac, not a Hebrew, name, and is interpreted 'The son of him that raiseth watera,' that is, of Christ, who raises the hearts of His preachers from earthly to heavenly things, and hangs them there, that the more they penetrate heavenly things, the more they should steep and inebriate the hearts of their hearers with the droppings of holy preaching.
Thomas, and Matthew the Publican.

(e Beda.) Thomas is interpreted 'an abyss,' or 'a twin,' which in Greek is Didymus. Rightly is Didymus interpreted an abyss, for the longer he doubted the more deeply did he believe the effect of the Lord's passion, and the mystery of His Divinity, which forced him to cry, My Lord and my God. (John 20:28.) Matthew is interpreted 'given,' because by the Lord's bounty he was made an Evangelist of a Publican.
James the son of Alphæus, and Thaddæus.

It is well said, the son of Alphæus, that is, 'of the just,' or 'the learned;' for he not only overthrew the vices of the flesh, but also despised all care of the same. And of what he was worthy the Apostles are witness, who ordained him Bishop of the Church of Jerusalemb. And ecclesiastical history (Hegesippus. ap. Euseb. ii. 23.) among other things tells of him, that he never ate flesh, drunk neither wine nor strong drink, abstained from the bath and linen garments, and night and day prayed on his bended knees. And so great was his merit, that he was called by all men, 'The just.' Thaddæus is the same whom Luke calls Jude of James, (that is, the brother of James,) whose Epistle is read in the Church, in which he calls himself the brother of James.

Jude is interpreted 'having confessed,' because he confessed the Son of God.

Scarioth is interpreted 'The memory of the Lord,' because he followed the Lord; or 'The memorial of death,' because he plotted in his heart how he might betray the Lord to death; or 'strangling,' because he went and hanged himself. It should be known that there are two disciples of this name, who are types of all Christians; Jude the brother of James, of such as persevere in the confession of the faith; Jude Scarioth of such as leave the faith; and turn back again.
