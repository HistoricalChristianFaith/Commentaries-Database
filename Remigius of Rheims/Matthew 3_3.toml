In these words we have not only time, place, and person, respecting St. John, but also his office and employment. First the time, generally; “In those days.”.
The man is mentioned in the words “came John,” that is, showed himself, having abodeso long in obscurity.
ap. Anselm: His office; “the Baptist;” in this he prepared the way of the Lord, for had not men been used to be baptized, they would have shunned Christ’sbaptism.His employment; “Preaching.”.
The place; “the desert of Judaea.”Maximus, Hom. in Joan. Bap. nat. 1: Where neithera noisy mob would interrupt his preaching, and whither no unbelieving hearer would retire; but those only would hear, who sought to his preaching from motives of divine worship.
“The Kingdom of Heaven” has a fourfold meaning. It is said, of Christ, as “The Kingdom of God is within you.” And all these significations may be here understood.
Though as far as historical fact is concerned, he chose the desert, to be removed from the crowds of people. What the purport of his cry was is insinuated, when he adds, “Make ready the way of the Lord.”
