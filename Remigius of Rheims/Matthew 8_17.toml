Christ the Son of God, the Author of human salvation, the fount and source ofall goodness, furnished heavenly medicine, “He cast out the spirits with aword, and healed all that were sick.” Daemons and diseases He sent away with aword, that by these signs, and mighty works, He might show that He was come forthe salvation of the human race.
He took the infirmity of human nature so as to make us strong who had before been weak.
