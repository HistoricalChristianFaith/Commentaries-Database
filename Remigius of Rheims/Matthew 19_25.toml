Whence in Mark the Lord expounding the meaning of this saying, speaks thus, “Itis hard for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of heaven.” They trust in riches, who build all their hopes on them.
This must not be so understood as though it were possible for God to cause that the rich, the covetous, the avaricious, and the proud should enter into the kingdom of heaven; but to cause him to be converted, and so enter.
