Observe the beautiful order of His miracles; how after He had given sight to the  blind, He restored speech to the dumb, and healed the possessed of the daemon; by which He shows Himself the Lord of power, and the author of the heavenly medicine. For it was said by Isaiah, “Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped, and the tongue of the dumb loosed.” Whence it is said, “When they were gone forth, they brought unto him a man dumb, and possessed with a daemon.”.
Thus the Scribes and Pharisees denied such of the Lord’s miracles as they could deny; and such as they could not they explained by an evil interpretation, according to that, “In the multitude of they excellency thy enemies shall lie unto thee.” .
For the Gentiles were dumb; not being able to open their mouth in the confession of the true faith, and the praises of the Creator, or because inpaying worship to dumb idols they were made like unto them. They were afflicted with a daemon, because by dying in unbelief they were made subject to the power of the Devil.
They who brought the dumb to be healed by the Lord, signify the Apostles and preachers, who brought the Gentile people to be saved before the face of divine mercy.
