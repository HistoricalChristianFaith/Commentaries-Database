For the Lord is said to have had three places of refuge, namely, the ship, the mountain, and the desert. Asoften as He was pressed upon by the multitude, He used to fly to one of these. When therefore the Lord saw many crowds about Him, as man, He wished to avoid their importunity, and ordered His disciples to go over to the other side.
