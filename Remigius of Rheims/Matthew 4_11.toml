Wonderful infatuation in the Devil! To promise earthly kingdoms to Him who gives heavenly kingdoms to His faithful people, and the glory of earth to Him who is Lord of the glory of heaven!.
Other copies read, “Get thee behind me;” i.e. remember thee in what glory thouwast created, and into what misery thou hast fallen.
