Ap. Raban.: Thus either the hearer, being predestined to eternal life, will follow the heavenly word when he hears it; or if there be none who will hear it, the preacher himself shallnot be without fruit; for his peace returns to him when he receives of the Lord recompense for all his labour.
The Lord therefore taught his disciples to offer peace on their entering into ahouse, that by means of their salutation their choice might be directed to aworthy house and host. As though He had said, Offer peace to all, they wills hew themselves either worthy by accepting, or unworthy by not accepting it; for though you have chosen a hose that is worthy by the character he bears among his neighbours, yet ought you to salute him, that the preacher may seem rather to enter by invitation, than to intrude himself. This salutation of peace in few words may indeed by referred to the trial of the worthiness of the house or master.
ap. Raban.: Or because themen of Sodom and Gomorrah were hospitable among their sensuality, but they had never entertained such strangers as the Apostles.
Sodom and Gomorrah are especially mentioned, to show that those sins which are against nature are particularly hateful to God, for which the world was drowned with the waters of the deluge, four towns were overthrown, and the world is daily afflicted with manifold evils.
