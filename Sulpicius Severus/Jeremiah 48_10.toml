When you repeat a psalm, consider whose words you are repeating and delight yourself more with true contrition of soul than with the pleasantness of a thrilling voice. For God sets a higher value on the tears of one thus praising him than on the beauty of his voice; as the prophet says, “Serve the Lord with fear, and rejoice with trembling.” Now, where there is fear and trembling, there is no lifting up of the voice but humility of mind with lamentation and tears. Display diligence in all your doings; for it is written, “Cursed is the one who carelessly performs the work of the Lord.” Let grace grow in you with years; let righteousness increase with age; and let your faith appear the more perfect the older you become.
