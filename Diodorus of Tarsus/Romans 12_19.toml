Paul uses the word wrath to describe God’s punishment, not because it is some kind of passion in God but because men would find it difficult to understand God’s judgment if they did not hear it compared to wrath. For since men respond to those who sin against them in wrath and anger, Scripture uses the same words to describe God’s reaction, because then the average person can hear and understand it.
