He did well to focus his attention on providence in general, asking … “Who is the one who shaped me in the womb, who is the one who brought me from the womb, who is the one who nourished me at maternal breasts and brought me to this stage of life?” Having anticipated my needs and provided me with such benefits when I contributed nothing, then, will you now cut me adrift when I both perceive your kindness and am able to give thanks? What, then? “Do not keep your distance from me, because tribulation is nigh, because there is no one to help me”: as you provided all these benefits … therefore, now too, when they all advance against me with intrigues and you are the only one left for my salvation, lend help.
