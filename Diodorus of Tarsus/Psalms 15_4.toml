Whoever abhors the wicked, even if they are very rich, while “honoring those who fear the Lord,” even if they are very lowly and poor, will live in honor and respect. There is therefore need to consider how in the apparent reply of God complete instruction in virtue emerges, the intention being for a person first to attend to piety and righteousness, then to keep one’s distance from all wicked behavior, and after this not to admire the deportment of the rich if piety does not accompany wealth.… One should have especial regard for the poor provided they did not have a change of heart for the worse as a result of poverty but rather continued to be devoted to a godly way of life.
