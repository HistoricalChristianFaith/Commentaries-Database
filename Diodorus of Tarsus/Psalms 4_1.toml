There are therefore two forms of tribulation: we either inflict tribulations and sufferings on ourselves as a result of mismanagement, or we fall foul of them despite our best intentions. The former tribulation requires us to show endurance and patience, the sufferers being aware that there is nothing harmful in what comes from God, and it is they themselves who reap the thorns they personally sow. The righteous request, by contrast, is a case of the latter tribulation of which we fall foul despite our best intention, when as often happens we are the victim of brigands, we suffer shipwreck or we come close to death by illness, in all of which cases the righteous request brings joy. It is in regard to them that David confirms that often when he was involved involuntarily in distress and begged God’s assistance, he was not only rescued but even was vouchsafed more generous providence—the sense of given space, since though tribulation constricts and depresses the soul, relief and joy expand and elate it.
