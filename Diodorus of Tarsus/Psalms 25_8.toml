How is it, if God is naturally loving and merciful, that he allowed some people to be subjected to punishments? David added “and upright” to bring out that justice accompanies goodness. He goes on, in fact, “Hence he will legislate for sinners in the way”: for this reason, that justice also is an attribute of his, “he will legislate for sinners in the way,” that is, he will correct sinners so as to bring them to uprightness. In regard to sinners, he is saying, God gives evidence of justice, whereas in regard to others it is goodness.… Nevertheless, whether people are punished or enjoy happy outcomes, they find everything happening to their own benefit, provided the mind is set on God and does not waver.
