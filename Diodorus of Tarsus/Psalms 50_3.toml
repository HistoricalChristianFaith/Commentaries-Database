He presents his whole discourse as if God personally were present and judging, thus his addition of “he will not keep silence,” that is, he will choose to judge the judges in no other way than by personal inspection and as though by his very presence. Then, to bring out that he arrives in retribution and as a cause of deep fear, attended by sanctions like bodyguards, he goes on, “A fire will burn in his presence, with a severe storm around him”: just as the rulers of the earth have heralds going ahead to inspire submission with their shouting, so too God comes in person with fire going ahead and a severe storm to inspire fear in those due to be judged. By “storm” he refers to a power capable of drawing down to hades.
