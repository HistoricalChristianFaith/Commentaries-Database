All wisdom comes to be known by reflection and dissemination. So his meaning is, I deliberate on some wise ideas, and with the intention of disseminating them I want you all to be hearers of what is said by me. Hence his reference to “pondering,” for each person to realize that far from coming to instruction by accident, they are brought to learn by deep pondering and much practical experience.
