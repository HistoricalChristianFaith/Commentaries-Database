Since your speech has ceased, and you have not been able to reply to the words spoken to you, now you think you can be supported by this argument, so that you can say, what we tried to demonstrate with our points is confirmed by the judgment of God, that is, that he is guilty of a crime. In fact, divine revenge would have not had any right against him if it had not found any evil action in him. “He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches.” I was not involved, as you know, in his debate, nor did he provoke me to bitterness after assuming the intention to speak against me. Therefore, the words that I speak are not suggested by indignation but by reason.
