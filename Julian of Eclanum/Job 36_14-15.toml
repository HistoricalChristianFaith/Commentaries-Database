“They will die in the tempest of their soul, and their life among the effeminate.” Since he had said above, “God will not be humble before the powerful,” here he has rightly said that the one who through his scorn inflames the wrath of the avenger will die among the effeminate, that is, he deserves to be deprived of all his strength by the misfortunes that will happen to him. “He will take the poor away from his anguish and will reveal his ear in tribulation.” Through the voices of the facts themselves he will teach them that he has not forgotten the cry of the poor.
