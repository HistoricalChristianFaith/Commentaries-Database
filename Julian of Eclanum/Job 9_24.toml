“The earth is given into the hand of the wicked.” With regard to the context of the passage, Job seems to state that his earthly part, that is, his body, is given to torments and vexations. The permission to afflict it is granted to the impious. Therefore, it certainly happens that those who see cannot express a fair judgment on the merits of the one who is afflicted. Passing to the prophetic aspect, that which vindicates the merits of the person, Job appears to wander from the context of the debate and to speak of future mysteries. The passion of the Lord is predicted. Job’s friends could not recognize this because the earthly vileness of Job’s external appearance is his internal dignity. - "Exposition on the Book of Job 9.24"
