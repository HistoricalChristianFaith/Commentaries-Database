He declares the reason by which he walks in the narrow path of God without his feet ever turning aside. This compels him to be the dedicated guardian of his precepts, “I conceived with my mind, he says, this esteem for God, because he is the only one for whom this name [of God] is truly fitting.” As for those who are called gods, he does not accept any of those who are called gods, who do not participate in his power. For him everything is easy to do and nobody can oppose his force and will.
