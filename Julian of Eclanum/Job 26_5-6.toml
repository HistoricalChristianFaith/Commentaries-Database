“Behold, giants groan under the waters.” After proposing the division that he made between power and wisdom, Job puts forward his evidence. He distinguishes the deep and the underworld. Both those that live in the deep of the sea, even if they are of tremendous size (and for this reason he calls them “giants,” which we understand as “wild beasts”) and those in the underworld itself (which prevents the sight of viewers as if in a thick fog)—both these realms remain constantly within the realm of God’s power and exposed to his eyes. “Behold, giants groan under the waters.” The Greek text reads, “Will the giants receive the service of the midwife under the waters, and in their neighbor?” This must be interpreted as asking whether the dead will resurrect if they are under the waters on earth. In saying “they will resurrect,” the thought is that “it will be as if they had the service of a midwife.” It is interpreted according to the metaphor of a woman giving birth. The meaning is this, “The art of midwifery takes the child out of the womb.” If so, is it possible to raise the dead from the underworld, when this realm belongs only to God? “The underworld is naked before him.” It is impossible, he says, to hold back the dead when God wants to resurrect them. Only at his command [the earth] is forced to throw up those which it has devoured. “There is no cover to perdition.” Even though [the underworld] is covered by the thickness of darkness, it appears transparently before the eyes of the Almighty.
