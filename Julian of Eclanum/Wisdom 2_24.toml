Generation is properly attributed to the sexes, whereas imitation is always carried out by souls. This inclination of the soul to imitate, if it can, what it wants to, at times accuses a person and at times is to his credit, depending on the situation. Thus, in the good, imitation is spoken of regarding God, the angels and the apostles. Of God, “Be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.” Of the angels, “Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.” Of the apostles, “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.” In evil, by contrast, people imitate the devil, as it is written, “Those who belong to him imitate him.” People also imitate other people: “Do not assume a melancholy air, like the hypocrites who disfigure their faces.” They imitate animals, as is implied in the warning, “Do not be like the horse or the mule, without intelligence.” By these words, both of persuasion and dissuasion, the inclination to imitation is indicated. Surely, if this were not possible, it would not be suggested to avoid it.
