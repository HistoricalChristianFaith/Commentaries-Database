The immensity itself of the unbounded separation [between God and humanity] can teach you that God may neither be offended by your evil actions, nor be benefited by your good deeds. “Look at the heavens and see; observe the clouds, which are higher than you.” Through the testimony of divine Providence he wants to accuse him of an impudent action, because he had said that he desired to have a trial with God on an equal level, and then he applies himself to approve the eminence of [God’s] works and benefits.
