Deep affect is tightly united with this verse. Not even at the time, he says, when the sweetness of the harp softened my ears did I allow any lustful feeling to dwell in my heart, even though the sounds tuned with art affected the senses. “I have made a covenant with my eyes.” After the search for justice and the feeling of mercifulness, he places the virtue of chastity in the highest position.
