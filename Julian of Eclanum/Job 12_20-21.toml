“By changing the speech of those who speak truly.” He is not referring here to those who speak truly, so much as to those who believe they speak truly. He convinces them of their falsehood when he makes what they had predicted happen in a different way.“By taking away the doctrine of the elders,” Job shows them that the frustration of their projects occurs without any consideration for their authority. “He pours contempt on princes,” both those who are entrusted with teaching and the leaders who take care of the administration of common goods. When God opposes them, they lose completely the high position they previously had where they stood. “He lifts up those who were oppressed.” After showing what God can do to these people, who are considered to be illustrious, he includes the wealth and protection he can grant to the humble, so that the divine power may be known by both these classes of people.
