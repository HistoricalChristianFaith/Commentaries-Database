This is the true description of the beast according to the faithful [understanding] of the story. There must be no doubt about their great size because of the power of the Creator. However, [these words] are also addressed to a plane of higher intellect, so that we may believe through them that something else is signified as well, and therefore the strength of spiritual iniquity may be perceived more easily in the image of the bodies. As these [beasts] are deadly for the body, so they are for human morality, and as the sin of pride must be imputed to them, so it must be punished.
