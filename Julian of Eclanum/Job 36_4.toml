The author of the book, while distributing the chapters of the different speeches to us, connects the words that follow to the beginning. Since he had stirred the attention of the listeners by discussing the providence of God, he also asks their patience for the things that he is about to say. - "Exposition on the Book of Job 36.1â€“2"
