“His robbers came together, and through me they made their own way.” Either Job employs use of the simile that he had chosen in order to say that he is exposed to the attack of the enemies and that they go back and forth without any obstacle on their open way, or he refers to the messenger who announced to him those misfortunes that had befallen him. Indeed, the text says, “While he was still speaking, another messenger came.” “His robbers came together.” He has developed the metaphor that he had suggested with the name enemy. In fact, since Job said that God came as a king to fight him as an enemy, he now adds, “His robbers came together.” It is as if he said, his soldiers, because Scripture usually calls the spies of the enemies “robbers.”
