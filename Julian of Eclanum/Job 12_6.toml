Certainly the subtlety of your entire conjecture leans toward this, that is, to a reflection on the merits for prosperity and misfortune, so that you want to show that I am guilty, and you righteous, because not even a contrary breath blows against you. This is a plain accusation against the justice of God or a way to lay blame on his patience. “The tents are abundant,” those, whom above he had called “rich,” he now accuses of corruption by the name of “robbers.” - "Exposition on the Book of Job 12.6"
