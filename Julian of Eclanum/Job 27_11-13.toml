“I will teach you through the hand of God.” He says that he will describe to them with his teaching the afflictions that are given to the hypocrites through the hand of God. In order to show his full knowledge of the things that he will describe, he adds a full account of them. They cannot ignore what he is going to relate. The Greek text reads, “I will announce to you the things that are in the hand of God, the things that are with the Almighty, and I will not lie.”
