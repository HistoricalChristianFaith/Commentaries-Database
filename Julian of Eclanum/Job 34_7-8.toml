“Who is there like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water?” [Job is compared with one] who reproves God’s judgments, despises them and thinks that they must be considered vile. “Who goes in company with evildoers”; since he has an ill feeling against the judgments of God, he does not differ at all from those who are proven to be impious by the injustice of their actions.
