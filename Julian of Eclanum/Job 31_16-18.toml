“If I have withheld anything that the poor desired.” In order that it might not appear that by humanely treating his servants, he did not practice a real liberality but only took care of his property, he says that he tended the hand of mercy and benevolence to strangers as well. In a different sense, one who does not wait to satisfy the desire of the needy donates without the slightest hesitation. “Or if I have caused the eyes of the widow to fail.” The caring affection of the merciful offers everything, because he thinks that everything must be asked of him.
