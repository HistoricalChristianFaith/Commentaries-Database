This is what holy Job had said above, “Do you want me to reap the iniquities of my youth?” Therefore, [Elihu] refutes this as a blasphemy, that is, the fact that holy Job had believed that no fault could be found in him; he was blameless in his mature age but was punished severely for the errors committed in his youth. - "Exposition on Book of Job 33.8–10"
