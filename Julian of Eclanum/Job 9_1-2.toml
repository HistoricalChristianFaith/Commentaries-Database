“Then Job answered, ‘Indeed I know that this is so, and that a mortal formed by God will not be justified.’ ” He asserts that he does not agree entirely with Bildad’s judgment but only with a part of it. In fact, Bildad had maintained that God, who is equally endowed with justice and power, opposes the impious and supports the righteous. The holy Job agrees that this is true. But Job declares that the assumption that God wanted to show that he was a sinner on the basis of what had happened to him is false. In a different sense, Job does not agree with the judgment of Bildad’s speech but states that the words that he had pronounced earlier are true. That is, “Inquire now of past generations, and consider what their ancestors have found.” No one is found among mortals who, in Job’s judgment, does not choose to oppress the inferior in an attempt to please the superior.
