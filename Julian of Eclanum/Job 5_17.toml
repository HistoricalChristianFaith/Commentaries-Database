Since holy Job was dejected because of the misfortunes that befell him against his hope, Eliphaz now says that after his calamity Job must not despair about God being propitious again. Indeed, the restraint of sin’s dissoluteness through scourging testifies to the divine love. “How happy is the one whom God reproves.” Because he had enumerated different kinds of miseries that beset sinners, they did not want to appear to be guilty in anything or obtain forgiveness through the confession of their iniquity. He says that a person, when he is led through severity and the scourge to his correction and admission of guilt, must not consider himself as a man who is in misery.
