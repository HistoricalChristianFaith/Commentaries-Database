“I have suffered this without committing iniquity.” You have a good reason to be upset, because there was no cause for such a torment. “I have suffered this.” Job is knowingly in pain against his merits. Therefore, he does not want the fact that he has been given to torments to remain hidden, but he desires what he suffers to be under the light. Job has no desire for the memory of his passion to be buried in oblivion but wants what he suffers to reach everybody’s ears, because he is certain of the innocence of his life.… Therefore it is especially reserved for the righteous that their passions and their deaths not be hidden in the course of their struggles.
