Do you think that by speaking many words you will improve your position and reduce us to silence and amazement with a long speech? Since the holy Job was not only proven innocent of any crime by using just arguments but also called God to his trial as a witness of his upright life, Zophar tries to accuse him first of verbosity and then of unrighteousness. By demonstrating Job’s biased opinion about God’s power and wisdom, Zophar tries to show what had inconsiderately erupted in the freedom of Job’s words. It would have been fitting [for Job] to remember the weakness of his nature.
