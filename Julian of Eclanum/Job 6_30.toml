While convincing his friends that they are not acting friendly but speaking against common sense, Job now tries to show that he cannot appropriately be accused of speaking harshly or of desiring death by just judges. “And judge by saying what is just.” Be judges of the words that we said in common, so that your judgment may be in compliance with justice and not with a feeling of hostility. - "Exposition on the Book of Job 6.29"
