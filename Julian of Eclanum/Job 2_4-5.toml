Since the devil had seen that at the first attack of temptation the stability of the holy man had not tumbled down, the devil came again before God, and by claiming that the temptation was not serious enough, he asserted that Job had now to be tested. The test would focus on Jobâ€™s own person, rather than his external circumstances. In fact, Satan supposed that Job had suffered the loss of his goods by hiding under a false appearance, according to the custom of all other people. Job did so to avoid the danger spiteful words against God would pose to his salvation. Humans typically drive away the greatest losses by suffering smaller damages. Often, by opposing the hand, we ward off a vital danger to the head.
