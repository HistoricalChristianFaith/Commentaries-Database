“He said, you do not like what is virtuous.” Elihu says that holy Job had a wrong opinion about God, and these words are gathered from his reflections, because God is offended by this fact, as Job ascribes to him the errors of others. “What advantage will you get if I sin?” This concept is even more evident in another passage, “What advantage did I get from not committing sin?” That is, What else would I have suffered because of the iniquity of my actions, if I received such misfortunes after my dedication to virtue? “I will answer you and your friends with you.” Since your friends taught you to agree with a wrong opinion about the judgments of God, so that you think to be righteous. Whereas God is unjust, now I will take care to answer in order to confute you and them.
