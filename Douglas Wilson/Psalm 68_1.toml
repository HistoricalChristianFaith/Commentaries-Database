Psalms: we need to stop singing “Jesus is my girlfriend” songs, and start singing Psalm 68. “God shall arise and by His might, put all His enemies to flight . . .” If you start singing psalms, you will find yourself singing things you have never sung before in your life. You will realize that the writers of contemporary praise choruses don’t have any enemies, and that the psalmists did have them. Just like we do.
