Let brotherly love continue.  Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.  Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.  Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.  Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee. [Joshua 1:5] So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.
