For it is you, Master, the heavenly “King of eternity,” who gives the sons of men glory and honor and authority over the earth’s people. Direct their plans, O Lord, in accord with “what is good and pleasing to you” so that they may administer the authority you have given them with peace, consideration and reverence, and so win your mercy.
