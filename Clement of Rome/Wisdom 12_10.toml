We look over all the generations, and we note that from generation to generation the Master "gave room for repentance" for all those who wanted to turn to him. Noah preached repentance, and all who listened to him were saved. Jonah predicted the destruction of the Ninevites, but, repentant for their sins, God looked favorably on them, and they received salvation, though they were foreigners to God. 1 - "Clement 7.5–7"
