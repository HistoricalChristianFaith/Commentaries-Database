So let us devote ourselves to those at peace in their devotion to God, and not to those who seek peace through hypocrisy. For he says in one place: “This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me.” And again: “They blessed with their mouth, but they cursed in their heart.” And again he says: “They flattered him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues. Their heart was not steadfast toward him; they were not true to his covenant.”
