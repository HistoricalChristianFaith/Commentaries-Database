Let us cleave, therefore, to those who cultivate peace with godliness, and not to those who hypocritically profess to desire it. For [the Scripture] says in a certain place, "This people honours me with their lips, but their heart is far from me." [Isaiah 29:13] And again: "They bless with their mouth, but curse with their heart." [Psalm 62:4] And again it says, "They loved Him with their mouth, and lied to Him with their tongue; but their heart was not right with Him, neither were they faithful in His covenant." [Psalm 78:36-37] Let the deceitful lips become silent, [and "let the Lord destroy all the lying lips, ] and the boastful tongue of those who have said, Let us magnify our tongue: our lips are our own; who is lord over us? For the oppression of the poor, and for the sighing of the needy, will I now arise, says the Lord: I will place him in safety; I will deal confidently with him." [Psalm 12:3-5]

Let us, then, attach ourselves to those who are religiously devoted to peace, and not to those who wish for it hypocritically. For somewhere it is said, “This people honors me with its lips, but its heart is far removed from me.” And again, “They blessed with their mouth, but they cursed with their heart.” And again it says, “They loved him with their mouth, but they lied to him with their tongue. Their heart was not straightforward with him, and they were not faithful to his covenant. Therefore let the deceitful lips that speak evil against the righteous be struck dumb.” And again, “May the Lord destroy all deceitful lips and the tongue that boasts unduly and those who say, ‘We will boast of our tongues; our lips are our own; who is Lord over us?’ Because of the wretchedness of the poor and the groans of the needy I will now arise, says the Lord. I will place him in safety: I will act boldly in his cause.”
