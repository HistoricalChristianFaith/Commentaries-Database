And to those who err by reason of the false scriptures He fitly showed the cause of their error, saying, `Ye do therefore err, not knowing the true things of the Scriptures;.
But somewhere also He says, wishing to exhibit the cause of their error more distinctly to them, `On this account ye do err, not knowing the true things of the Scriptures, on which account ye are ignorant also of the power of God.'
