Brothers, the Lord of the universe has need of nothing; he requires nothing of anyone, except that confession be made to him. For David, the chosen one, says, “I will confess to the Lord, and it shall please him more than a young bullock with horns and hoofs. Let the poor see it and be glad.” And again he says, “Sacrifice to God a sacrifice of praise, and render to the All-High your vows; and call on me in the day of affliction, and I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.” “For a contrite spirit is a sacrifice to God.”
