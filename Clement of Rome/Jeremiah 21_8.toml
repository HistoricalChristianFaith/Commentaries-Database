Through your works you have revealed the everlasting structure of the world. You, Lord, created the earth. You are faithful throughout all generations, righteous in your judgments, marvelous in strength and majesty, wise in creating and prudent in establishing what exists. You are good in all that is observed and faithful to those who trust in you. You are merciful and compassionate. You forgive us our sins and our injustices, our transgressions and our shortcomings. Do not take into account every sin of your servants and slave girls, but cleanse us with the cleansing of your truth and “direct our steps to walk in holiness and righteousness and purity of heart,” and “to do what is good and pleasing in your sight” and in the sight of our rulers. Yes, Lord, “let your face shine on us” in peace “for our good,” that we may be sheltered “by your mighty hand” and delivered from every sin “by your uplifted arm”;23 deliver us as well from those who hate us unjustly. Give harmony and peace to us and to all who dwell on the earth, just as you did to our ancestors when they reverently “called on you in faith and truth,” that we may be saved, while we render obedience to your almighty and most excellent name, and to our rulers and governors on earth.
