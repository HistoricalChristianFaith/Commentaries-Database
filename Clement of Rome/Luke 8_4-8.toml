Let us consider, beloved, the resurrection: the night sleeps, and the day arises; the day departs, and night returns. Let us look at the crops to see how and in what manner the planting takes place. “The sower went forth” and cast each of the seeds into the ground, and they, falling on the ground dry and bare, decay. Then from their decay, the greatness of the Lord’s providence raises them up, and from one seed many grow up and bring forth fruit.
