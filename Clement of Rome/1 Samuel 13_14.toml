What shall we say of the celebrated David, to whom God said, “I have found a man after my own heart, David the son of Jesse, in eternal mercy I have anointed him.” But even he says to God, “Have mercy on me, O God, according to your great mercy, and according to the multitude of your tender mercies blot out my iniquity. Wash me yet more from my iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin; for I knew my iniquity, and my sin is always before me.”
