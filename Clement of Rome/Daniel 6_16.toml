For what shall we say? Was Daniel cast into the den of lions by those who feared God? Were Ananias and Azarias and Mishael shut up in a furnace of fire by those who observed the great and glorious worship of the Most High? Far from us be such a thought! Who, then, were they that did such things? The hateful, and those full of all wickedness, were roused to such a pitch of fury that they inflicted torture on those who served God with a holy and blameless purpose [of heart], not knowing that the Most High is the defender and protector of all such as with a pure conscience venerate his all-excellent name.â€¦ But they who with confidence endured [these things] are now heirs of glory and honor and have been exalted and made illustrious by God in their memorial for ever and ever.
