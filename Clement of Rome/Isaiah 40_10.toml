We must … be zealous in doing good, for all things are from him. [Isaiah] warns us, “Behold, the Lord comes, and his reward is before his face, to pay each person according to his work.” He therefore urges us who believe in him with all our heart not to be lazy or careless in any good work. Let our glorying and our confidence be in him. Let us be subject to his will.
