All the generations from Adam to this day have passed away; but those who were made perfect in charity by the grace of God live among the saints; and they shall be made manifest at the judgment of the kingdom of Christ. For it is written, “Enter into your chamber a little while, until my wrath and anger pass, and I remember the good day and will raise you up out of your graves.”
