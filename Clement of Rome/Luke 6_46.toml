But salvation is in this, that you do His will of whom you have conceived a love and affection through the gift of God; lest that saying of His be addressed to you which He spoke, `Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not what I say? '.
For on this account our Jesus Himself said to one who often called Him Lord, but did none of the things which He prescribed, `Why call ye me Lord, Lord, and do not the things which I say? '
