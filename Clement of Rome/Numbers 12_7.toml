Moses was called “faithful in all God’s house.” God used him to bring his judgment on Egypt with scourges and torments. Yet even he, despite the great glory he was given, did not boast. But when he was granted an oracle from the bush, he said, “Who am I that you send me? I have a feeble voice and a slow tongue.” And again he says, “I am but steam from a pot.”
