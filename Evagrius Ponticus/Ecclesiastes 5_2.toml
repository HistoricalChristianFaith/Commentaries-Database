“We do not know how to pray as we ought.” He is not so much talking [about prayer] at this point as issuing a command not to theologize thoughtlessly. Indeed, anyone who belongs to this material world and whose thoughts have their origin in this world cannot speak about God without error—or on other matters that elude the senses. That is why he says, “And let your words be few,” that is, they should be true and well chosen. I think also that “few” means the same as in the following texts: “Better a little with righteousness than an abundance of riches with sinners.” And, “Better is the receiving of a little with righteousness.” But to those who do not observe this, he says, “For as a dream comes when there are many cares, so is the fool’s voice with many words.” … He also talks about “the voice of a fool,” coming up with false words and beguiling the soul. This is “the voice of the slanderer and reviler.” He is also able to apply this to the voice of the fool who “by a multitude of words you will not escape sin.” –.
