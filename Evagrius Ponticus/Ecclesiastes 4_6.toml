The “chasing after wind,” I believe, refers to the will of the soul caught up with passions. That is why a handful of virtue is better than two handfuls of wickedness, ignorance and “chasing after wind.” … It is as if someone said it is better to learn contemplation of one spiritual thing than to have numerous visions of foolish wisdom.
