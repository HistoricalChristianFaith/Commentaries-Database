The cowl is a symbol of the charity of God our Savior. It protects the most important part of the body and keeps us, who are children in Christ, warm. Thus it can be said to afford protection against those who attempt to strike and wound us. Consequently, all who wear this cowl on their heads sing these words aloud: “If the Lord does not build the house and keep the city, in vain does the builder labor and the watchman stand his guard.” Such words as these instill humility and root out that long-standing evil, which is pride and which caused Lucifer, who rose like the day star in the morning, to be cast down to the earth.
