I have seen, he says, every sort of wickedness and boldness in the one who is evil. For, such a one [as Satan] thinks he is brave even when in [his] ungodliness he oppresses the poor or again, sees himself as a “creature” who was “made to be mocked by the angels” of God. Also I have seen all the jealousy that he has acquired towards human beings, which is vain and governs his heart, since God certainly “will become all in all.” And when God does so, this will fulfill the prayer of Christ, which said, “Grant that they also may be one in us, as you and I are one, Father.” .
