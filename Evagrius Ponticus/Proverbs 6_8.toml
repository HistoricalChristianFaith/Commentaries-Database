By “ant” Solomon seems to indicate the practical way, while the “bee” designates contemplation of creation and of the Creator. Both the pure and the impure, the wise and the foolish apply [this saying] for the benefit of their souls. It seems to me that the wax corresponds to the realities of creation, while the honey symbolizes the contemplation thereof. And while wax perishes, as it is written, “Heaven and earth will pass away,” the honey does not perish. By the same token, the words of Christ our Savior do not pass away, about which Solomon says, “Pleasant words are like a honeycomb, their sweetness is health to the soul.” Also, David says, “How sweet are your words to my taste, sweeter than honey to my mouth!”
