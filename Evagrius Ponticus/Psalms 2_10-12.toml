If you remember the Judge only when you are in difficulties as one who inspires fear and who is incorruptibly honest, then you have not as yet learned to “serve the Lord in fear and to rejoice in him with trembling.” For understand this point well: one is to worship him even in spiritual relaxations and in times of good cheer with even more piety and reverence.
