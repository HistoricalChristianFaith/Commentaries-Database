Those who forget the law are the ones who violate it; yet those who remember the law are the ones who live in accordance with the law. Likewise, those who observe the sayings of God are those who keep them, and those who destroy them are those who do not want to follow them. “For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but it is the doers of the law who will be justified.”
