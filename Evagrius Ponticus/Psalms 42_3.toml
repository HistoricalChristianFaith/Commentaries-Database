Seeing that God is Creator, he is in everything made; seeing that he is excellence and wisdom, he is in all holy powers.â€¦ God is even in people sometimes in excellence, sometimes in accomplishment: it is of angels to behave always according to God; of demons, never; of people to behave sometimes rightly, sometimes not.
