If fighters find themselves being assailed and assailing in return, and if the demons fight against us, then they too when they assail us will be assailed by us in return. Scripture says, “I will assail them, and they will not be able to stand”; and again, “Those who assail me and are my enemies, they have weakened and fallen.”
