“A man’s gift” is called an upright life. It is that gift that “makes room for him” and makes him worthy of the fullness of God. It is that very thing which is called the “throne” of the holy powers. Indeed, the “throne” of the mind is that excellent state which they maintain who are seated in a position that is fixed or immovable. .
