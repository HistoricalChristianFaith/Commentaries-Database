One acquaints the heart with what one has decided to investigate. The heart in turn longs to know more about these things, which is why it is said, “I turned my heart to know.” Those “spheres” are the matters [of inquiry]. The one who directs the heart by meditating on these spheres causes the heart to know them. However, one should note that those spheres that encircle human beings and those that the heart knows are not the same, because we may look into a lot of things, yet only know a very few of them.
