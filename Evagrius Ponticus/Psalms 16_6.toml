If the line is measured, how is it written the Gospel of John: “For God gives the Spirit without measure” and “I will pour out my spirit on you.” Perhaps by chance it is called “measure” not in terms of knowledge itself but on account of him who receives it, because its receptivity cannot be greater. The rain itself also may exceed the measure, yet it is measured in that vessel in which it is received.
