For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another.  For all the law is fulfilled in one word, even in this; Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [Leviticus 19:18] But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.
