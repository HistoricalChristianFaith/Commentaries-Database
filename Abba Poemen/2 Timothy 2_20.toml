A brother asked Abba Poemen saying, “Why do the demons persuade my soul to look up to him who is superior to me and make me despise him who is my inferior?” The old man replied, “About that, the apostle has this to say: ‘In a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and earthenware; and if anyone purifies himself from what is ignoble, then he will be a vessel for noble use, consecrated and useful to the master of the house, ready for any good work.’ ”
