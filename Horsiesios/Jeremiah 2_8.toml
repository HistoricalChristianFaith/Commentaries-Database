God has also entrusted a deposit to us: the brothers’ way of life. While laboring on their behalf, we look forward to future rewards, lest this be said of us as well, “Let this people go,” and lest, if we forsake the traditions of our ancestors, this be hurled at us: “Those who have my law do not know me; the shepherds have rebelled against me.”
