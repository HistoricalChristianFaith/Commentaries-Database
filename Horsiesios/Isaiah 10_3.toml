[Christ] said to Peter, the prince of the apostles, “Simon, [son] of John, do you love me more than these?” He answered, “Lord, you know I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my lambs.” He asked him a second time, “Simon [son] of John, do you love me?” He answered, “Yes, Lord, you know I love you.” He said to him, “Feed my sheep.” And he ordered him to feed his sheep a third time, and in Peter he enjoined this office on all of us, diligently to feed the sheep of the Lord, that on the day of his visitation we may, for our toil and watchfulness, receive what he promised us in the gospel, saying, Father, I wish that where I am, there also shall be my minister. Let us look to the promises and rewards; then in an attitude of faith we will more easily stand all our pains, walking as the Lord himself walked, who is the one promising the rewards.
