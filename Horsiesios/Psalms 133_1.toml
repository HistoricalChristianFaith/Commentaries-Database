The apostle taught us that our community, the communion by which we are joined to one another, springs from God, when he said, “Do not forget good works and communion, for God takes pleasure in such sacrifices.” We read the same thing in the Acts of the Apostles: “For the multitude of believers had one heart and soul, and no one called anything his own. They held everything in common. And the apostles gave witness to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus with great power.” The psalmist is in agreement with these words when he says, “Behold, how good and how delightful it is for brothers to live together.” And let us who live together in the Koinonia and who are united to one another in mutual charity, so apply ourselves that, just as we deserved fellowship with the holy fathers in this life, we may also be their companions in the life to come. We know that the cross of our life is also the foundation of our doctrine and that “we must share Christ’s sufferings,” and we must realize that without trials and difficulties no one attains victory. “Happy the one who endures trial, for when he has proved himself, he shall receive the crown of life.”
