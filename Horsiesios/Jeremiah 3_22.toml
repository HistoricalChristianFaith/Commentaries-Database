Let us return to the Lord our God, and whenever we pray, he, who daily urges us to pause and get to know him, will hear us. And in another place he says, “Return to me, and I will return to you.” And again, “Return to me, my backsliding children, and I will rule over you.” Ezekiel likewise calls on us, saying, “Why will you die, O house of Israel? I want not the death of the sinner, only that he turn from his evil ways and live.” The most merciful Lord and source of all goodness cries out to us in the Gospel and declares, “Come to me, all you who labor and are overburdened, and I will give you rest. Carry my yoke on you and learn of me, for I am gentle and humble of heart, and you will find rest for your souls.” Let us consider that the goodness of God calls us to repentance, and holy people encourage us to salvation. Let us not harden our hearts and collect against ourselves a store of divine anger for the day of wrath. Then, on that day, shall be revealed the just judgment of God, who will repay each one according to his deeds. But let us return to the Lord with our whole heart. According to the words of Moses, who reminds us, “If you return to the Lord with your whole heart, he will purify your heart and the heart of your descendants.” - "The Testament of Horsiesi 33"
