Prayer sometimes brings the dead back to life, but sometimes it may slay the living, as happened with the godly Peter: he brought Tabitha back to life by prayer, but he effected the death of Ananias and Sapphira. Elisha, that spiritual man, brought to life the young son of the Shunammite woman, but he brought to their end the wicked children, through the bears that he brought out against them with the course. The case of Hezekiah was also astonishing: through prayer he added to the days of his life as king and routed the mighty army of the Assyrians with the help of a spiritual being.
