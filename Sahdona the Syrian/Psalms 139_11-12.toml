Likewise we Christians who are Christ’s servants should truly stand valiantly in wakefulness like “good and faithful servants” who are eager to do honor to their master. Let us gird ourselves in asceticism, inwardly strengthened by austerity, having the lamps of our hearts filled with the oil of grace39 from the Spirit and illumined by prayer; in this way we shall valiantly do battle with the powerful incitement provided by the sweetness of sleep. In this way “the dark will be light for us,” just as the prophet said, “and night will be illumined by our faces”: the darkness will not make our minds dark, so let us spend the dark night awake as if it were bright daylight.
