Girded with such things to serve as invincible armor, let us take our stand against the evil one, being wakeful and well prepared, as though it was day. Let us pierce him with the mighty arrows of the Spirit’s words and cut off all his hopes, joining David, the son of Jesse, in adjuring him by the covenant that does not fail: “Depart from us and go to your ill fate, you mad dog” that audaciously barks against its master, for we have sworn to the Lord and make our vow to the God of Jacob that we shall “not allow sleep to touch our eyes, or drowsiness our eyelids, until we have found a place for the Lord to rest in our souls, a tent for the God of Jacob” to dwell in our hearts. We will certainly not cease from vigil, prayer, toil and labor until the Lord is pleased at our soul and chooses it as a place in which to live, saying, “This is my resting place for eternal ages; here shall I reside, for I have desired it.”
