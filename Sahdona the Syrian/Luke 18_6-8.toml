As our Savior pointed out, even the cruel and wicked judge eventually looked into the poor widow’s case because she had wearied him with her insistence. It is quite clear that God does not neglect us. Even if he makes us wait, he will nonetheless answer us and see to our case all of a sudden. When we pray all the time, we should not weary. We should eagerly cry out to him day and night, begging him with a broken heart and a humble spirit. “A humble spirit is a sacrifice to God, and God will not reject a broken heart.”
