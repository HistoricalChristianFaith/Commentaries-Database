Truly great and mighty is the power of God’s word. For the word of God has changed the “offspring of vipers” into children of God. So let us constantly sow it within the hard soil of our heart, waiting for [the word] to soften [our heart] so that the wheat ear of life may sprout up in it. For the word of God is at the same time the seed and the water; and even though we have a “heart like stone,” it will be softened and split up by the water of the Spirit, so that it can bring forth holy fruit that is pleasing to God.Therefore let no one neglect meditation on the divine words or the labor of reading the appointed measure. As our honored teacher said, from such meditation the soul acquires great benefit and finds salvation.
