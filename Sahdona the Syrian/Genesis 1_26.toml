These are the virtues that man acquires by considering and controlling his own senses. He “takes off the old man, who was corrupted in the convolutions of his error,” “and wears the new one, who is renewed in knowing the image of his Creator,” and he becomes as a whole an effigy, likeness and image of his God. Like a living sacrifice, suitable and pleasing to God, he employs his body for his rational service. He consecrates and somehow presents to God the vows and the offerings of all his limbs and offers the sacrifices suitable for the action of grace, which are the rational fruits of the lips of those who confess his name by incessantly celebrating God in their body and soul, God to whom they belong now in definitive oblations.
