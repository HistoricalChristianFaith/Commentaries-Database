Such was the offering of the murderous Cain that was rejected. He had been told by God, “If you act well, I will receive it.” Such again were all the offerings of the Israelites that were rejected, whereby they received the curse of the prophet who says, “Cursed is the man who has a ram in his flock, and he vows and sacrifices to the Lord one that is sickly.” He rebukes and reproaches them, saying, “Try offering it to your ruler, to see if he will be pleased with it or show you favor; this is what the Lord says.” So how will any address made to God during the ministry of prayer that shows any contempt prove acceptable to God—an address that is full of all sorts of distractions, that is sickly and broken up by interruptions? This sort of thing would not be acceptable even to the most insignificant of human beings if he were thus addressed. The offering of turbulent prayer and the ministration of a heart that shows contempt are exactly like the sacrifice of a blemished ram.
