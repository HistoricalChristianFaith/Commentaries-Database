We should be discerning and aware of the grace that has been effected in us, giving thanks for it to the Maker, praising God for this great and “ineffable gift” to us. We should put aside from ourselves any hateful habits of slackness and neglect which only destroy our lives; instead, we should persevere from the beginning to the end of the times of our offices. And we should behave with all the greater awe and love during the great and perfect mysteries of our salvation, standing firmly before God continually with wakefulness of heart in spiritual service, resembling servants who are eagerly at the ready to serve their master.
