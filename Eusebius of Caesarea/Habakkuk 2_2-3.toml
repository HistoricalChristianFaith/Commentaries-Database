He is blessed who is named by another prophet, “He that comes,” in the passage, “Yet a little while, and he that comes will come and will not tarry,” who also came in the name of the Lord God his Father. And he is the Lord God that appeared for us. For he insists that he has come in the name of his Father when he says to the Jews, “I have come in my Father’s name, and you receive me not. If another comes in his own name, you will receive him.” He, then, who appeared for us—the Lord God, the blessed, who comes in the name of the Lord—was also the stone that those of old built up on the foundation of the Mosaic teaching, which they set aside and which, though set aside by them, has become the head of the corner of the church of the Gentiles. The oracle says it is wonderful, not to all that look on it but only to the eyes of the prophets, when it says, “And it is wonderful in our eyes.”
