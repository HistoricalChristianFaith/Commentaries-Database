From what I have said already, we have learned what sort of end the one who is powerful in wickedness will obtain.  But as for me, says David, since I have been taught this by the Holy Spirit, I would never be exalted over abundance of wealth, nor over the vanity of mortal life.  For "vanity of vanities, all is vanity." But also, as I flee from the path of the one who is powerful in wickedness, I would not sharpen my tongue and my words for the destruction of others, but rather for the benefit of souls and the service of the words of salvation.  And in my other actions too, I would become so flourishing and fruitful that my soul would be compared with an ever-flourishing and richly fruitful plant that has been planted in the house of God.  For this reason, I say:  "But I am like a fruitful olive tree in the house of God"—or, according to Symmachus' translation:  "But I am like a flourishing olive tree in the house of God."  For I did not turn away at all from the house of God; rather, after being planted inside it, as it were in God's own garden, and while enjoying the streams of the spring in the house of God, I became richly fruitful and ever-flourishing, in accordance with the pattern of the planted olive tree that has been received among the ever-flourishing [plants]. 

But observe that when David said this, he was not in Jerusalem, which the Jewish people considered to be the house of God—for it had not yet been built; and neither was he in the tabernacle built by Moses, which did still exist at that time among the Jews.  For when he was fleeing from Saul, he passed his time among others—and yet he did indeed know that he had been planted in the house of God, since he understood the "house of God" to be the pious way of life. And because he was fruitful—not bearing bitter fruits but sweet fruits full of compassion,[36] he was rightly compared to a fruitful olive tree:  the pattern signifying mercy towards one's neighbors and compassion toward all.  Therefore, since he was overflowing with this sort of good things, he logically added, "I have put my hope in the mercy of God forever, even forever and ever."
