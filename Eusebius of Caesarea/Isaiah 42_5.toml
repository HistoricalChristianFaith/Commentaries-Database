The name by which he will be praised as the Lord and God of all, [Isaiah] says, “I will give to no other” but to you alone, whom I shall grant to be light to the nations. Hence, in the promise the Christ of God is called Lord and God by all the nations, the Father having granted him alone that glory. Next comes “nor will I give my powers to the carved images,” or, according to Aquila, “my worship to carved images,” or, with Symmachus, “my praise to carved images.” … According to this, Christ alone is called God since to him alone and to no other has God, who is above all things, given his glory and power.
