The blessed Blandina … rejoiced in her death as though she had been invited to a bridal banquet instead of being a victim of the beasts. After the scourges, the animals and the hot griddle, she was at last tossed into a net and exposed to a bull. After being tossed a good deal by the animal, she no longer perceived what was happening because of the hope and possession of all she believed in and because of her intimacy with Christ. Thus she too was offered in sacrifice.… But not even this was enough to satisfy their madness and their viciousness toward the Christians. For these wild and barbarous people once stirred up by the wild beast were difficult to satisfy, and their wickedness found another special form in what they did to the bodies of the dead. The [pagans] were not humiliated by their defeat, because they lacked human comprehension; rather, it enflamed their bestial anger, so that both the governor and the populace showed toward us the same undeserved hatred, that the Scriptures might be fulfilled: “Let the wicked be wicked and the righteous perform righteousness.”
