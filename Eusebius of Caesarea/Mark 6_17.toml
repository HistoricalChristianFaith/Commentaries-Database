Not long after this, John the Baptist was beheaded by the younger Herod, as stated in the Gospels. Josephus also records the same fact, mentioning Herodias by name, and stating that, although she was the wife of his brother, Herod made her his own wife after divorcing his former lawful wife, the daughter of Aretas, king of Petra, and separating Herodias from her husband while he was still alive. It was on her account also that he killed John, and waged war with Aretas, because of the disgrace inflicted on the daughter of the latter. Josephus wrote that in this war, when they came to battle, Herodâ€™s entire army was destroyed, and that he suffered this calamity on account of his crime against John.
