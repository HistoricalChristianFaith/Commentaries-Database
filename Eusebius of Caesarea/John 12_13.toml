As, therefore, hosanna is said in the psalm we are considering, which is translated “Save us now,” and the Hebrew has “Lord, save us,” and the words “blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord” are taken from the same psalm, and these words can only refer to the Christ of God, we naturally apply the rest of the prediction to him as well.
