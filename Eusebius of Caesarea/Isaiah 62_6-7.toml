Instead of “there is none like you, until he sets Jerusalem right and makes it a shining example on the earth,” Symmachus has, “do not be silent and do not let him be silent until he prepares and makes Jerusalem to sing on the earth.” … For with the prophetic choir asking such questions, the Holy Spirit is encouraging them and exhorting them to continue in those prayers on behalf of those mentioned. So he says, “Don’t be silent and give no silence, that is, to the Lord who promises these things, until he has prepared and makes Jerusalem to sing on the earth.” He provides for the intercession made by the powers of all the people, that it should not be quiet or ever fall silent, but with shouts and unrestrained cries rouse him. The people’s intercession should never give God peace.
