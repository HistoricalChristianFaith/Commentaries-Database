And what follows in the psalm would agree with him alone, where it says, “The Lord said to me, You are my Son. Today have I begotten you. Ask of me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance and the utmost parts of the earth for your possession.” For surely only in him has this part of the prophecy received an indubitable fulfillment, since the voice of his disciples has gone forth into all the earth and their words to the ends of the world. And the passage distinctly names Christ, saying as in his own person, that he is the Son of God, when it says, “The Lord said to me, You are my Son. Today I have begotten you.” With which you may compare the words in the Proverbs, also spoken in his own person: “Before the mountains were established, before all the hills he brings me forth.” And also the address by the Father to him in Psalm 109 [LXX]: “I begat you from my womb before the morning star.” Understand then how the holy Scriptures prophesy that one and the same being, Christ by name, who is also Son of God, is to be plotted against by people, to receive the nations for his inheritance and to rule over the ends of the earth, showing his dispensation among people by two proofs: the one being the attacks on him and the other the subjection of the nations to him.
