He did not add next something like “he will deliver me out of the mouth of the lion,” for he saw in the spirit that his death was all but at hand. So he adds to his words, “And I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.” He says: “The Lord will deliver me from every evil work and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom,” indicating his speedy martyrdom, which he foretells even more clearly in the same writing, when he says, “For I am even now ready to be sacrificed, and the time of my dissolution is at hand.”
