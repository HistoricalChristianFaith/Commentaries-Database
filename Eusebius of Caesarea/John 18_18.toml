See how clearly this description of the day of our Savior’s passion, a day in which “there shall be no light,” was fulfilled, since “from the sixth hour to the ninth hour there was darkness over all the earth.” And also the “frost and cold,” since according to Luke: “They led Jesus to the palace of the high priest. And Peter followed afar off. And while they kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, he sat down,” according to Mark, with the others to warm himself. And John, too, especially mentions the cold, saying, “The servants and the ministers stood, having made a fire of coals, for it was cold, and they warmed themselves.” And this day, he says, was known to the Lord and was not night. It was not day, because, as has been said already, “there shall be no light.” This was fulfilled when “from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the earth until the ninth hour.” Nor was it night, because “at eventide it shall be light” was added, which also was fulfilled when the day regained its natural light after the ninth hour.
