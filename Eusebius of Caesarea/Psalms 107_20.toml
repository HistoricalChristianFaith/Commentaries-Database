For, if it would be unreasonable to suppose that the unbegotten and immutable substance of God the Almighty was changed into the form of man and, in turn, that the eyes of the beholders were deceived by the illusion of something created and that such things were falsely invented by the Scripture, who else could be proclaimed God and the Lord who judges all the earth and passes sentence, appearing in the shape of a man—if it is not proper to call him the first cause of all things—than his preexistent word alone?” And concerning him it was also said in the Psalms: “He sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions.” Of him Moses speaks very clearly, calling him a second Lord after the Father, when he says, “The Lord rained upon Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord.” The divine Scripture also calls him God, when he again appeared to Jacob in the form of a man, saying to Jacob: “Your name shall not be called Jacob, but your name shall be Israel, because you have been strong with God,” when also he called the name of the place “the Vision of God,” saying, “For I have seen God face to face, and my soul has been saved.”

This clearly proclaims the good news of the descent of God the Word from heaven … and of the result of his coming. For it says, “He sent his Word and healed them.” And we say distinctly that the Word of God was he who was sent as the Savior of all humankind, whom we are taught by the holy Scriptures to consider divine. And it sadly suggests that he even came down to die for the sake of those who had died before him. By revealing the redemption of those who would be saved by him, it gives the reason of his coming. For he saved without assistance from any one of those who had gone before him even to the gates of death; he healed and rescued them from their destruction. He did this simply by breaking what are called the gates of death and crushing the bars of iron. And then the prophecy proceeds to predict the state of desolation of those who rejected him when he came. For it says, “He turned rivers into a wilderness and rivers of waters into thirst, a fruitful land into a salty waste for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.” You will understand this if you think of Jerusalem of old, the famous city of the Jewish race, its glory and its fruitfulness, devoid now of its saintly citizens and pious people. For after the coming of Christ it became, as the prophet truly says, without fruit or water and quite deserted, “a salty waste for the wickedness of them that dwell therein.”35To this is added very much in the prophetic manner a veiled prediction of the change of the longtime desert and thirsty land, referring either to the individual soul or to the turning of the Gentile church to holiness and of its fertility in divine words. This is clearly predicted in a veiled way when it says, “He made the desert into pools of water,” and that which follows. But to understand this, one must have wisdom from God; according to the admonition at the end of the psalm, which says, “Who is wise, and he will keep this?” and that which follows.
