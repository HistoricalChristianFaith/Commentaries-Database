According to one interpretation, this refers to the lowly and Jewish people. According to another, this is the entire gathering of souls that make up the godly spiritual commonwealth. According to a still further interpretation, this is the angelic order about which the apostle says, “She is the free Jerusalem of above that is our mother,” and “you have come to Zion, the mountain and city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.” The present word is addressed to the godly communion that formerly comprised the Jews. But they were brought down and suffered a fall, forfeiting their place to the church of the Gentiles.

If some come “from the north” and some “from the sea,” that is, from the western parts, and others come “from the land of the Persians” (meaning the highlands), then those in the first clause who are from the land far away are called “of the midday,” since the uncircumscribable southern country lies among the midday people. These people are the ones who “shall come from a distance.” But the word prophesies that they will come from all over, from the four latitudes to God and will receive the promises spoken to them.
