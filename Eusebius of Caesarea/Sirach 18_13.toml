“Salvation is far from sinners, since they have not sought your decrees. Many are your mercies, Lord. Give me life according to your judgment.” It is said, “The compassion of a person is toward his neighbor: but the mercy of God is on all flesh.” As much as one might appear extremely just when compared with human beings, before God’s severe judgment he has need of mercy. Even the very fact that he seems just is due to the mercy of God, since who has ever done anything worthy of eternal blessedness and the kingdom of heaven without God’s help?
