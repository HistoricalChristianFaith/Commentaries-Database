He cried out with a loud voice to the Father, “I commend my spirit” and freely departed from the body. He did not wait for death, which was lagging behind as it were in fear to come to him. Instead, he pursued it from behind and drove it on and trampled it under his feet as it was fleeing. He burst the eternal gates of death’s dark realms and made a road of return back again to life for the dead bound there with the bonds of death.
