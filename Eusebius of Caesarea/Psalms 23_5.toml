In place of the ancient sacrifices and whole burnt offerings the incarnate presence of Christ … was offered. And this very thing he proclaims to his church as a great mystery expressed with prophetic voice.… As we have received a memorial of this offering that we celebrate on a table by means of symbols of his body and saving blood according to the laws of the new covenant, we are taught again by the prophet David to say, “You have prepared a table before me.” … Here plainly the mystic chrism and the holy sacrifices of Christ’s table are meant, by which we are taught to offer to almighty God through our great High Priest all through our life the celebration of our sacrifices, bloodless, reasonable and well-pleasing to him.
