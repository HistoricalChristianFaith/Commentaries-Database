Here he expressly foretells the opposition of the Jews to him and how they will see him and not understand who he is. He foretells how they will hear him speaking and teaching them but will be quite unable to grasp who it is that speaks with them or the new teaching he offers them. And John the Evangelist witnesses to the fulfillment of these words referring to our Savior where he says, “Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him, that Isaiah the prophet’s words might be fulfilled which he spoke, ‘Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?’ Therefore they were not able to believe, because again Isaiah said, ‘He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they should not see with their eyes, and understand with their heart and be converted, and I should heal them.’ Isaiah said these things when he saw his glory and bore witness of him.” Thus the Evangelist most certainly referred the theophany in Isaiah to Christ and to the Jews who did not receive the Lord that was seen by the prophet, according to the prediction about him.
