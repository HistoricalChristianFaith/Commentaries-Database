The 33rd Psalm was spoken by David when he "changed his countenance before Abimelech, and he sent him away, and he left."  The current Psalm would be the one following that Psalm in historical sequence.  For the Scripture says in Kingdoms, "And one of the servants of Saul was there that day."  And this indicates the time at which David came into the house of Abimelech and ate the "loaves of offering," receiving them from the high priest.  For at the very same point in time, Doeg the Syrian, the tender of Saul's mules, came to Saul and said, "I have seen the son of Jesse having come to Nob, to Abimelech the son of Ahitub, the priest, and all the sons of his father; and he inquired on his behalf through God, and he gave him provisions.  And the king sent someone to call Abimelech the priest, and all the sons of his father, the priests of the Lord in Nob, and they all came before the king," at which point, on Saul's order, this same Doeg put to death the priests of the Lord—" men who bore the ephod, and he smote the city of Nob with the edge of the sword, including men and women, infants and babies, and calves and donkeys and sheep."

So when David learned that this had been done in this way, he uttered the words before us, which contain neither an ode, nor a hymn, nor anything else of that sort.  For how, in the face of the disaster that happened to so many priests, could he have sung odes of theirs and psalms?  Hence, nothing of the kind is written as epigraph, but it was only said "to the end" and "of understanding":  ["To the end,"] since the final elements of his words recount the good things, when he says, "But I am like a fruitful olive tree," etc.; and ["of understanding," since discerning] the meaning of the words put forth here requires the understanding that comes from God.  Now then, when he was with Abimelech and tasted the priestly nourishment, he changed his "taste"—or his "ways," according to the interpretation of the others—and raised blessings and thanksgivings to God, saying:  "I will bless the Lord at all times; the praise of him is always in my mouth," etc.  But now, when he had learned of the actions of Doeg the slanderer—how he had destroyed so many priests, doing a diabolical deed—he marshalled the words of the present passage as though against him
