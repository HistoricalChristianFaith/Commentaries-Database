House of David, from this time on when you encounter your enemies, call upon the one who is named Immanuel. The meaning of the title, which is “God with us,” reveals the power of the Word. Believe this sign, be courageous, and do not call upon the gods of Damascus. Do not enlist those who have no assistance to offer. Rather, call upon Immanuel, the God who will “be with” people at the appropriate time. Take heart with confidence, trusting in the power of the title.… If the prophet had said, “They will call his name Immanuel,” he would have been speaking only of a future time. This would have caused doubt for some, because when the Savior was born of the virgin his name was not Immanuel but Jesus, as the angel had instructed Joseph, saying, “Do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” If the prophecy was “they will call his name Immanuel,” then how would the Savior had fulfilled it, when his name was Jesus and not Immanuel? But this is not how it was written, because not everyone would call him by this title. The prophetic word says accurately, “You shall call.” … Some scribes, because they did not understand this, wrote, “they will call” rather than “you shall call” in the Gospel of Matthew, even though the prophecy does not read this way. The Hebrew word translated in the passage is “you shall call,” as is used by all the translations. Some translators translate the word for “virgin” as “young woman.” There is no reason to think that the virgin was not also a young woman; in fact it is likely that the virgin who conceived the Savior was not fully grown but a young maiden.
