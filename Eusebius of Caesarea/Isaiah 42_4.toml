With truth and boldness to all, he proclaims the judgment of God, which has not ceased to operate. Rather, God’s judgment is like light shining through the resurrection of the dead, which the prophetic word announced, saying, “He will give light and not be crushed.” For those who planned Christ’s death tried to crush him and extinguish him. For it is the nature of all mortal species to be crushed by death. But it did not crush him. Christ was the only person of all time who was shown to be stronger than death. - "Commentary on Isaiah 2.22"
