He would be born nowhere else but in the place at Bethlehem, near Jerusalem, in the spot that is even now pointed out. For no one is witnessed to by all the inhabitants as having been born there—in accordance with the Gospel story, no one remarkable or famous among all people, except Jesus Christ. Bethlehem is translated “House of Bread,” bearing the name of him who came forth from it, our Savior, the true Word of God, and nourisher of spiritual souls, which he himself shows by saying, “I am the Bread that came down from heaven.”
