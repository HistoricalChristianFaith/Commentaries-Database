He says that he will tell the name of his Father first to the apostles, who he calls his brothers. And after them, with swift progress, he promises that he will teach the hymn of his Father to the church founded in his name throughout all the world. It is just as if some supreme teacher of philosophy should give a course of instruction in the midst of his pupils for them to hear and understand, that he in the midst of the church says, “I will hymn your praise,” that the church, learning and hearing his words, might in fit manner sing back the praises, no longer of the demons but of the one almighty God, by him that preached him.
