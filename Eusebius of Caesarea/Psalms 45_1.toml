It seems right for me to add what I am accustomed to quote in every question that is debated about his Godhead, that reverent saying: “Who shall declare his generation?” … For such expressions are connected with mental imagery alone and are accordingly subject to the laws of metaphor. And so the words “My heart has produced a good word” may be explained as referring to the constitution and coming into being of the primal Word, since it would not be right to suppose any heart, save one that we can understand to be spiritual, to exist in the case of the supreme God.
