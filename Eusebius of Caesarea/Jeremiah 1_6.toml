The Hebrew Scripture introduces Moses at first as declining the leadership of the people by what he said to God who conversed with him: “I beg you, O Lord, appoint someone else who is able, whom you will send.” Afterwards it portrays Saul as hiding himself to avoid assuming the kingdom and the prophet Jeremiah as humbly declining his mission. - "Preparation for the Gospel 12.9"
