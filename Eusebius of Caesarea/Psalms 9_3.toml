These things, he said, I will assuredly do “when my enemies are turned back.” But who is such an enemy unless it is death, the enemy of life about which it is said, “You knew the enemy death will be destroyed.” Destruction will be Death’s end when he is turned back. But “back” where, unless the return into the pristine condition when he did not exist? “For God did not make death, but through the envy of the devil, death entered into the world.” When, therefore, as death is turned back, it will no longer be, then all the rest of the enemies will be enfeebled and the enemies of your Word will be destroyed before your face.
