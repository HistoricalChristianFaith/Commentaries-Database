But our Lord and Savior, not very long after the beginning of his preaching, called the twelve apostles and to them alone of all his disciples he gave the name of apostles as a special honor. Later he proclaimed seventy others, and them also he sent out two by two in advance of himself into every place and city where he himself was to come.

If you listen to Luke, you will not hear him calling Matthew a publican nor subordinating him to Thomas, for he knows him to be the greater, and puts him first and Thomas second. Mark has done the same.â€¦ So Luke honored Matthew, according to what they delivered, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word.
