From the text “No one has seen God at any time,” perhaps it might be thought that the above quotation contradicts the Savior’s words, as implying that the invisible is visible. But if they are understood, like our former quotations, of the Word of God, who was seen by the fathers “in many and various ways,” no contradiction is involved.
