They say these things will happen in the time of the advent of that Savior. Then all the powers of the adversaries and those hidden and secret enemies of God who have turned their backs on the Savior will be laid low. All who receive that Savior will rise from the first fall. Therefore, Simeon says, “Behold, this child is destined to cause the rising and falling of many,” namely, the ruin of his enemies and adversaries and the resurrection of those who, having fallen once, have been rescued by him.
