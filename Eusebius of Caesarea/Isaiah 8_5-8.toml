Obviously the only way to preserve the understanding of this passage is to explain its spiritual meaning. By the softly proceeding water of Siloam it means the gospel teaching of the word of salvation, because Siloam means “sent with a message.” This would be God the Word, who was sent by the Father, of whom Moses says, “A ruler will not fail from Judah, nor a prince from his loins, until the one for whom it is stored up comes, and he is the expectation of the nations.” For rather than “for whom it is stored up” the Hebrew has “Siloam.” The same word, Siloam, is used the same way in this passage for Isaiah, that is to say, “the one who is sent.”
