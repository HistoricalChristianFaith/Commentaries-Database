Immediately following, the prophet himself explains why he called them rulers of Sodom and people of Gomorrah: “Your hands are full of blood.” Again a little later he says, “They have proclaimed their sin as Sodom and made it manifest. Woe to their souls, because they have taken evil counsel with themselves, saying, ‘We will bind the just one, for he is a burden to us.’ ” Since he overtly speaks of blood and a plot against a just man, there is nothing else this could be than the plot against our Savior Jesus Christ.
