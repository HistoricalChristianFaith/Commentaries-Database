In approaching the account of his coming to humanity, the prophecy before us tells first of his divine kingdom, in which it says that the prophet saw him sitting on a throne high and exalted. This is that throne that is mentioned in the psalm of the Beloved. … John the Evangelist supports my interpretation of this passage, when he quotes the words of Isaiah, where it is said, “For this people’s heart has become fat, and their ears are dull of hearing, and they have closed their eyes,” referring them to Christ, saying, “This is what Isaiah said when he saw his glory and bore witness of him.” The prophet then seeing our Savior sitting on his Father’s throne in the divine and glorious kingdom, and moved by the Holy Spirit and being about to describe next his coming among humanity and his birth of a Virgin, foretells that his knowledge and praise would be over all the earth.
