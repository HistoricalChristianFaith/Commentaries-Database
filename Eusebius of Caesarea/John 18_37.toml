His kingdom and throne were not human. They were not of this world. Therefore he said before Pilate, “My kingdom is not of this world.” And when he was asked by him if he were a king, Jesus answered, “For this also I have been born.” So if he has been born for this, he will remain for this … for the kingdom of this world is not able to endure forever, nor is it endless as if extended indefinitely.

The throne of the kingdom conferred on Jesus is nothing mortal or temporal. Rather, it truly extended throughout the whole world like light shining as the moon established forever, enlightening understanding souls through his divine and heavenly teaching.
