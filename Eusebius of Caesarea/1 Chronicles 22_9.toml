This [passage quoted, 1 Kings 8:26-27] is also found in the same words in Chronicles. God then promised David he would raise up a king from his body and would be his father, so that the offspring of the seed of David should be called the Son of God and should have his throne in an eternal kingdom. This was prophesied to David by Nathan in the Second Book of Kings. … The same is also said in Chronicles, and in the 88th [89th] Psalm. … And so Solomon, being unique in wisdom, understanding this oracle given to his father, and perceiving it to be no slight thing, but something beyond human nature, and more suitable to God than to himself, son of David though he was, and knowing who was meant by God by the Firstborn, and who was clearly foretold as the Son of God, was overjoyed at the message and prayed that the words of the prophecy might be confirmed and that he who was foretold might come, calling him Firstborn and Son of God.
