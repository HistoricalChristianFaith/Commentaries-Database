I promised to you by grace beforehand—if you no longer struggle with these promises—that no fear of attack by war would touch you. Therefore rejoice in my commandments, for if you do so, these kinds of fears will not affect you—unless you do not guard the commandments and fall into the fear of human reproach. And so, I testify to you and say, “You will be far from oppression, and you will not fear. Terror shall not come near you.” Rather, you will remain close to me and will act in a godly way according to the following words of Isaiah: “the proselytes will come to you.” But they will not come apart from my will, for it says they also will come “through me.”
