When the Master gave them gloomy prophecies, if they paid attention to the things he said to them … they demonstrated the strength and depth of their nature, since it is evident they had no fear of disciplining the body, nor did they run after pleasure. And their master too, as one who himself would not soothe them by deceit, was like them in renouncing his property. And so, when he prophesied about the future in such an open and honest way, he convinced them to choose his way of life. These were prophecies of what would happen to them for his name’s sake that told how they would be brought before rulers and kings and undergo all sorts of punishments, not for any wrong they had done due to any reasonable charge, but solely for this: his name’s sake. And we who see it now fulfilled ought to be struck by the prediction. For the confession of the name of Jesus always inflames the minds of rulers. And even though one who confesses Christ has done no evil, they still punish him with every kind of contempt “for his name’s sake,” as the worst of evildoers. But if someone else swears away the name and denies that he is one of Christ’s disciples, he is let off scot-free, even if he has been convicted of many crimes.
