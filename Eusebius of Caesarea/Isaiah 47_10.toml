And since Isaiah could not find one man to address, he spoke to the daughter of the Chaldeans, promising these things especially: The astrologers of heaven maintained and supported you, announcing to you what was coming to you from heaven. For in this way we are taught that what the Lord wishes to give to each nation cannot be known by the lovers of learning.… But to us each word is gathered into two principal ones, first to the human customs of every city and to their good “daimons,” and second to oppose any sorcerers and deceivers and cheats, destroying and turning from the truth into the deceitfulness of human beings.
