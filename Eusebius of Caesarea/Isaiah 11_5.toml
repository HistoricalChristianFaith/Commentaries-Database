“Righteousness shall be the girdle of his waist, and truth the girdle of his loins.” As a king has a belt made of gold and precious stones, so in a prophetic manner, he speaks about the belt made of righteousness and truth. By the belt we may also understand the divinity of the Word, because he is righteousness, according to the apostle: “He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption.” He is also the truth, according to Evangelist: “I am the way, and the truth, and the life.” The Word being the righteousness and the truth that comes from the root of Jesse, his waist [belt] points out to his attribute as king and warrior as the Word who conquers the invisible powers and hosts.
