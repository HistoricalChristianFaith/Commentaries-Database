Since the seed of Abraham is spread over all the earth, he speaks about this.… In the same way Paul the apostle shows the Jews, “first it was necessary that the word be proclaimed to you, but since you turn away, we are going to the Gentiles.” Isaiah addresses those among them, therefore, who would obey the calling and the Gospel word that is handed on: “You whom I took from the ends of the earth and called from its farthest corners.” Many from the Jews, during the apostolic times, handed on the word of Christ, not only to the land of Judah but also to the rest of the nations. For the seed of Abraham rises quickly, until the time when God remembers the election of the apostolic chorus, and he says to them, “you are my son,” or, according to the other interpretations, “you are my servant; I have chosen you and not abandoned you.” Probably the divine apostle equates the servant with himself, made present as one worthy of the honor of being a servant of the Savior, since also from the first the word proclaimed this, saying, “great to you are those called ‘my servant.’ ” - "Commentary on Isaiah 2.20"
