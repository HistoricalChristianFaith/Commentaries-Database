Aquila translates “like wine and milk” so as to say not only water but also wine and milk are promised to the thirsty. “Water” is clearly the gospel message that flows from the spring of the Savior, but “wine and milk” hymn the mystery of the rebirth in Christ.… One should be mindful of the fact that according to the old covenant mystical milk is given to those reborn in Christ along with the body and blood of the new covenant. It is said to be kept even now as a custom in some churches, if not in a bodily at least in a spiritual way, in that the mystical blood is provided for those deemed worthy of the new life in Christ in the form of wine and milk. If with the Septuagint we read “and suet”—the fat and richness and nourishment of the spiritual food that is in Christ is here praised, just as our Savior revealed, saying, “Unless you eat my flesh and drink of my blood, you shall not have life in you.” So just as in Isaiah his body is called “suet” and as the blood is called wine, we understand the suet to mean his incarnate economy and the wine to mean the mystery of his passion.
