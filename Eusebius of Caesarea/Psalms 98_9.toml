It is prophesied here that the coming of the Lord will be the cause of great benefits to the nations, which have been proved to have actually accrued to them, through the manifestation of our Savior. For of a truth from then and not before the new song of the new covenant has been sung among all people, and his wonders have been known and heard by all people through the written Gospels. And salvation also, by the resurrection of the Lord from the dead, has been revealed to all nations, and the true righteousness, by which it has been clearly proved that God is not the God of the Jews only, but of the Gentiles. “Since there is one God,” in the words of the holy apostle, “who will judge the circumcised from their faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.” And the words “for he, comes to judge the earth,” might refer also to his second coming.”
