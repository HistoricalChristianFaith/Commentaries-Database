Here too the Lord himself teaches in the passage before us about another Lord. For he says, “I am the Lord thy God,” and adds, “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain.” The second Lord is here mystically instructing his servant about the Father, that is to say, the God of the universe. And you could find many other similar instances occurring in Holy Scripture, in which God speaks as if in a second voice about another. The Lord himself speaks as if about another.
