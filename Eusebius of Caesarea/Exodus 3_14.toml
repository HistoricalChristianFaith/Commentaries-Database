Everything that has ever existed or now exists derives its being from the One, the only existent and preexistent being, who also said, “I am the existent.” … As the only being and the eternal being, he is himself the cause of existence to all those to whom he has imparted existence from himself by his will and his power and gives existence to all things and their powers and forms, richly and ungrudgingly from himself.
