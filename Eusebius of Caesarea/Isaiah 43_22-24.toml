For there was no mention at all of such things required from you in the laws of the new covenant that I established through my servant whom I chose. But you did not offer these things to me. If it had been necessary to say such things, you still probably would have done something contrary. “In your sins is your preference” or as the other interpreters put it, “in your sins and in your unrighteous acts you called on me.”
