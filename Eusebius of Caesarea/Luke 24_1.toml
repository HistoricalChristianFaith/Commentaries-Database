The Instrument of the Word lay dead, but a great stone enclosed the sepulcher, as if death hadled Him captive. But three days had not yet elapsed, when life again puts itself forth after asufficient proof of death, as it follows, And they found the stone rolled away.
The messengers of the health-bearing resurrection and their shining garments stand for tokens of pleasantness and rejoicing. For Moses preparing plagues against the Egyptians, perceived an angel in the flame of fire. But not such were those who appeared to the women at the sepulcher, but calm and joyful as became them to be seen in the kingdom and joy of the Lord. And as at the Passion the sun was darkened, holding forth signs of sorrow and woe to the crucifiers of our Lord, so the angels, heralds of life and resurrection, marked by their white garments the character of the health-bearing feast day.
For he alone believed the women saying that they had seen Angels; and as he was of more ardent feelings than the rest, he anxiously put himself foremost, looking every where forthe Lord; as it follows, And stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves.
