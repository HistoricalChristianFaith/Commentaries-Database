[[commentary]]

O friends and priests of God, you are clothed with holy robe and heavenly crown of glory, the inspired unction and the priestly raiment of the Holy Spirit. To you, of youthful pride of God’s holy temple, honored by God with wisdom that is aged but revealed in choice deeds and works of a flourishing valor that is youthful, God himself, who encompasses the whole world, has given the distinguished honor of building his house on earth and of restoring it for Christ, his only-begotten and his firstborn word, and for his holy and sacred bride. One indeed might wish to call you a new Bezalel, the builder of a divine tabernacle, or a King Solomon, king of a new and far better Jerusalem, or even a new Zerubbabel, who bestowed far greater glory or even a new Zerubbabel on the temple of God.
