These words are spoken by the Lord, our redeemer and the one who has freed us from a life of hard labor.… Or as Symmachus puts it, “You will no longer be called queenly. For I was angry with my people and harmed my inheritance.” And I, for reasons of the right discipline, handed my people into your hands, as part of my taming them, but you showed fellow sufferers no kindness by treating them excessively harshly. - "Commentary on Isaiah 2.32"
