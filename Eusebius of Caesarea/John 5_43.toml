Holy Scripture records that this prophecy was fulfilled when our Lord and Savior Christ entered Jerusalem.… And the words “blessed is he that comes in the name of the Lord” explain the words that follow: “The Lord is God and has appeared to us.” It was, then, one and the same Lord God who appeared to them, that is to say, the Word of God. It is he who is therefore blessed, because he came among people in the name of the Lord his Father who sent him. It was therefore to reprove the Jews who disbelieved in him that he said, “I came in the name of my Father, and you received me not. But if one comes in his own name, him will you receive.” So the Holy Spirit suitably addressed the opening verses of the psalm not to the Jewish people but to all the nations.
