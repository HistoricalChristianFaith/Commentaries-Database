It is to impel us to ask why the Father forsook him, that he says, “Why have you forsaken me?” The answer is, to ransom the whole human race, buying them with him precious blood from their former slavery to their invisible tyrants, the unclean demons and the rulers and spirits of evil. And the Father forsook him for another reason, namely, that the love of Christ himself for people might be set forth. For no one had power over his life, but he gave it willingly for people, as he teaches us himself in the words, “No one takes my life from me: I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again.”
