Note how clearly was fulfilled the prophecy of our Savior’s passion. It was to be a day in which “there shall be no light.” “From the sixth hour to the ninth hour there was darkness over all the earth.” … This was also fulfilled figuratively by his priestly persecutors, for among them came darkness, cold and ice, following upon their indignities to the anointed One. Their understanding also was darkened, so that the light of the gospel did not shine in their hearts, and their love to God grew cold. Then in the evening the light of the knowledge of the Christ arose, so that they who sat in darkness and the shadow of death saw a great light.
