He has built traps for no one. He has dug a pit for no one. He has despised iniquity. Knowing the future destruction of the wicked at judgment, he said, “I will give thanks to the Lord according to his righteousness,” my righteous works having been brought forth at the tribunal; and “I will sing to the name of the Lord most high,” bound by the hope that I am going to be received into the choir of those who are going to follow after salvation through him, through his merit.
