We have often seen the mass of the other nations called “the woodlands.” These are the beasts of God’s calling worthy to be called up due to their fear. Aquila has instead, “all the beasts,” “all his living beings,” and then, the second time, “all his living things.” Do they belong to someone or to God? For he does not call them simply “beasts” but “his.” Isaiah made mention of the nations of other tribes and the forest of beasts, and he saw in the Spirit that these would obey the call; yet so many of the Jews were persistent in unbelief.
