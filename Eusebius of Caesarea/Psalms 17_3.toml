Who can with confidence say, “I am pure from sins”? Christ alone is truly and properly able to say these words.… When gold is tested by fire, it remains pure and shining. According to Isaiah, out of all people since the beginning of the age, Christ alone “did not sin, nor was there any deceit found in his mouth.”
