Along with my prayers I now add book 10 to the Church History and dedicate it to you, my most consecrated Paulinus, and blazon you as the seal of the whole work. It is appropriate that in a perfect number2 I shall here provide a completed account in celebration of the restoration of the churches, in obedience to the divine Spirit who urges us:

    Sing to the Lord a new song, for he has done marvelous things;
    His right and his holy arm have wrought salvation for him.
    The Lord has made known his salvation:
    His righteousness he has revealed in the sight of the heathen.

Accordingly, let me now sing the new song, since after those grim and horrifying scenes and narratives, I was now privileged to see and to celebrate what many righteous people and martyrs of God before me desired to see but did not see and to hear but did not hear. But they hurried on to far better things in the heavens, caught up into a paradise of divine bliss, while I, admitting that even the present circumstances are more than I deserve, have been totally astonished at the magnitude of grace he has conferred and offer him my total awe and worship, confirming the truth of the prophecies that declare:

    Come and behold the works of the Lord,
    What wonders he has wrought on the earth,
    Making wars to cease to the ends of the world.
    He will break the bow and shatter the spear,
    And the shields he will burn with fire.

Rejoicing that all this has been clearly fulfilled, let me proceed with my narrative.
