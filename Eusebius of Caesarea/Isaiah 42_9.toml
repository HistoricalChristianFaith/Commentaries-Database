“Behold, the first things,” he says, “came to pass. But I proclaim new things, and before they arise, I will cause these things to be heard by you.” Just as he says “the first things” would be fulfilled through my works, as I promised Abraham concerning his “seed,” so indeed I acted. I fulfilled also those things foretold by Moses and the rest of the prophets; “now I promise to everyone what was proclaimed before” and to make them come to light through the prophecies, for “I caused these things to be heard by you.”
