Isaiah sees that in the ensuing time a very great number of people will arise who all “will be ashamed” and who will cease from their continual error. They will be ashamed and hide their faces. If they persist in their error, however, they will be given over to destruction at the time of judgment. But this word is also for those of us now in the present.
