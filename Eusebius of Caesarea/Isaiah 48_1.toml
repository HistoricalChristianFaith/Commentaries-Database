He calls them the house of Jacob as not being worthy of the name of their forefather. Rather, “those called by the name Israel” are not really Israel, and those bearing that name are not called such here. And he adds, “and coming forth from the water of Judah.” For they had nothing of the worthiness of the patriarchal soul, although they were descended from his fluid and bodily seed. For they were children only in the physical and carnal sense and not true children of the soul. But “Judah through the water” means the “kingly race” from David’s line that in the days of the prophets remained in Jerusalem. They were those who, being not truly worthy of these names, used “Jacob” and “Israel” and “Judah” falsely; for they were those who praised the name of the Lord and made mention of the God of Israel with only their lips and mouth.… For they did “not” take their oaths “in truth” if they were [at the same time] consulting oracles. But they even thought they were being loyal to the city which was dedicated to God when, in fact, they were resisting God and performing this hypocrisy. - "Commentary on Isaiah 2.33"
