“The beasts of the forest” means the nations. For a forest denotes the group of nations of different branches that he invites to the spiritual banquet. According to Aquila, he does not call them simply wild beasts, but “his wild beasts.” Why “his”? Why “God’s”? Because, captured by the devil, they became wild beasts under his tyranny and while alive they were hardly human. Yet God calls these as his own to his spiritual banquet, to eat the bread of life and to rejoice.… For although they were away from him for a long time, they were able through faith to come close to him and to share in the bread that strengthens the heart of humankind.
