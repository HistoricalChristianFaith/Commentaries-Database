He rewarded the confession of the thief on the cross when he said, “Today you will be with me in paradise.” “He comes” to those who believed “and will call a people who have been ransomed by the Lord.” For it was not an elder or an angel but the Lord himself who has saved us. He says “the city shall be called ‘sought out,’ that is, worthy of memory. For it was formerly abandoned.
