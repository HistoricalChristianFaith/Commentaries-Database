“Father, if this is not able to pass, then let your will be done.” The Father received this prayer and then pointed to the time of the resurrection after death, saying, “In a time of favor I have answered you.” Some dislike this interpretation and think it not persuasive, saying that the Son failed in his prayer to form a prayer that fit with God’s plan. However, even before this [prayer], it was necessary that death could in no way be avoided except through him undergoing the cross and its death. Therefore, such an earnest intercession demonstrates the guilt of those Jewish leaders who exposed him to such shameful suffering against his will. For there was no previous discussion as to whether he should be given the death sentence. “For I have come down from heaven not to do my own will but the will of him who sent me.” So he used their cruelty as a means to an end: the salvation of the world. He also provided an example for us not to fall into temptation but to pray to God. And so these words have special meaning for those who are chosen, “In a time of favor I have answered you.” For the mystery of Christ was in existence before the foundation of the world, but it was put into action for us at a time when it pleased the Almighty. So he calls the time of the incarnation “day,” as does the divine apostle: “Now is the acceptable time, now is the day of salvation.”
