In the translators the prophet holds forth like one caught up in delight: “For Zion’s sake I will not keep quiet.” For I will cry to God and ask to see the perfecting of what has been said—a time when “righteousness and the salvation of Jerusalem” will enlighten all. For after this a “light to the nations” will be passed on. For the choir of apostles extended the teaching to all the kingdoms, “and the kingdoms were like a jewel in the hand of God,” and so on. This was the blessing of those who fulfilled the promises first of all, that is, the community among the Jews called Jerusalem. Some call these new, for the apostles of the church were the firstfruits. “And I will not stop,” therefore, until God will fulfill his promises to it, the salvation through Christ for all the earth. For God is not of Israel alone but also of the nations. Some think that the words “my righteousness and my salvation” are actually spoken by the mouth of God promising to fulfill all these things.Christ is righteousness and salvation, just as a light in the world, saying, “When I am in the world, I am the light of the world,” which was formerly discordant in godlessness and all shadows. “Righteousness and glory” are terms that once more name Christ. For we are justified in him, and we are enriched with glory from him.
To the newness of life, in place of the synagogue is rendered the name “church” and house and city of God, in which David said, “Glorious things are said of you, city of God.”
