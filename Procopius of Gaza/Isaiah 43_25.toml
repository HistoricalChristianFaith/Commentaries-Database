Nature is too weak to gain righteousness by works. For the human disposition is inclined toward evil from an early age, as David clearly says, “If you kept record of our transgressions, who would stand? For with you there is atonement.” For I myself am merciful, and I wish that those in trouble remember their Savior and give him thanks through all things. For this is what the saints do.… And do not be ashamed to confess your sins. For the Pharisee did not do so, and he was condemned. But the tax collector did so, and he was justified. …“You transgressed against me”—this is given great force. For it is not a transgression against humanity or created nature. For the idolater rejects the divine nature as he robs the same of its transcendence and glory, which are to be worshiped. As God says in Jeremiah, “Why have you spoken to me? You have all acted unrighteously and impiously toward me,” says the Lord Almighty.
