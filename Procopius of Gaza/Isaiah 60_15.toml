Those who are strangers to godliness are said to be cut off and hated and to have no help. But those from the wild olive branch come to take their place and are made to be joined into one people out of each. And in the Savior’s power there is made the full number of those being saved, the one city out of both tribes that is called Zion, and to it is the following promise made. Some say that it has been humbled on account of its insubordination against Christ and that yet it will be saved through acknowledging this. And so the words that follow are, “I will place you in eternal gladness and joy for all ages.” For this is the hope of immortality in the church of God, the everlasting life and glory and kingdom of heaven, and there is no place for shame. “And you will drink the milk of the nations.” This means the ever-new sacramental mystery and the fundamental teaching of those being reborn through faith in Christ.
