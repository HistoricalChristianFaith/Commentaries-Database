The text of Chronicles makes a list of the Levites according to the importance and dignity given them by the great Moses. It demonstrates how the successors of Moses were chosen for this purpose and how Zadok was appointed as the high priest, along with his nephew Eleazari, and also Abimelech, nephew of Itamari. It includes two lineages, one of which is connected with Itamari which it attributes to those who descend from them. Also Luke mentions this genealogy in his Gospel, considering Zechariah as belonging to the lineage of Abijah. The aforementioned book [of Chronicles] shows that Abija was the seventh to obtain by lot this inheritance.
