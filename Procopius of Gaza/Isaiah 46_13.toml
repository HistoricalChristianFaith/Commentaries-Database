For God did not hate those whom he took out of Israel but intended salvation for them, just like the cutting and draining done by doctors. For all punishment was carried out for their advantage. He adds to the underlying form of the particular its significance for the human race. For the salvation through Cyrus is particular. That through Christ is universal. “I will not delay” is similar to “a little time it will come and will not delay.” “Zion” we take to be the church, in which we receive his salvation in glory, thus being complete in the spiritual Israel; that is, we gain a mind that, seeing God, fulfills us as children according to the promises of Abraham.
