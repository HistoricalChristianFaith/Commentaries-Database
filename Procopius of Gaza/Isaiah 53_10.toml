“His soul will see his offspring grow.” On the day after his suffering, the spiritual conception of that indescribable, indwelling birth came. The divine power was vindicated in accordance with the promises to Abraham in the undoing of death-bearing sin and the access to redemption. And where the [LXX] text has “And the Lord wills to alleviate his soul from its suffering,” Symmachus renders, “And the will of the Lord prospered in his hand.” And this fits the Savior well. He gave light to himself so that others would be illuminated through his being just, but he also gave understanding. For the spirit of wisdom and understanding was resting on him to give others understanding and “to justify those worthy of being justified.” Others interpret in this way: the Lord wills to turn the sorrow on the cross to gladness through revealing himself to those who had once been deceived in darkness who were now being transformed into light. For as Paul said, “We who were once darkness are now light in the Lord” and “recreated in understanding,” as though being changed from glory into glory.…God is said to have made one new humanity from two peoples, that is, to have made a transformation. For the Only Begotten considered our salvation to be his own reward. By taking a body, he thus suffered on our behalf. And so, it was necessary for the Father to make the “alleviation of suffering”—which is said about Christ—our healing and to make his light our illumination, exchanging what we had for something better as we were recreated in the understanding of God. For Christ did not come to be served but, as he said himself, to serve the working out of the plan of our salvation in his incarnation.
