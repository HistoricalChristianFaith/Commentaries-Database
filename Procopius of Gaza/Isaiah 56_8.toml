The Savior, however, is gentle not only with the nations. For he says, “I will gather the scattered of Israel.” For these were far from the community in the law, being far away from Judah, and [they] were idol worshiping and teaching doctrines and precepts of human invention. Those who were thus gathered included the godly of old and even the disciples of the Savior.
