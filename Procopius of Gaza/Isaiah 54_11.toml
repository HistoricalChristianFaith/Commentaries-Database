Some think that Jesus is here called “coal” since he was placed as a foundation in Zion and those who believe in him will not be ashamed. Similarly Amos calls him “adamantine” in these words, “I will place adamantine in the middle of the people of Israel.” And Zachariah, “Look, I will give the dawn over my servant. And the stone that I will give before the face of Joshua, on that stone there are seven eyes.” For Christ is the all-seeing one. This coal, he says, is also the support and the foundation stone, to which, since they approximate to it, the apostles, too, are here called “foundations” and are spoken of as marked out by the name of sapphire, as in the seventeenth psalm, which says, “The springs of waters are uncovered and the foundations of the earth are revealed at your chastisement and from the breath of your Spirit, O Lord.” For those in Israel were shaken by what the apostles dared to do through Christ, when purification through water first appeared. The disciples of the Savior receive this title, but the prophets are also called foundation, as Paul says, “building on the foundation of the apostles and prophets.” Sapphire is the color of heaven, and again Paul tells us that this denotes the citizenship of heaven. … But “anthracite” [coal], according to another interpretation that has been handed down, refers to stones that adorn, just as the sainted martyrs who have been tested by fire adorn with stimei [a type of eyeliner] the eyes of the bridegroom of Christ.
