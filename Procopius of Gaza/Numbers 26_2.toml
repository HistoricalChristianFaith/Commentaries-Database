After Scripture has indicated that the people arrived at the border established by God, God again asks for a census of the men suitable for military service. For, since the fathers who had been counted previously had died, their sons are summoned for a census. David attests that the Lord said, “If they shall enter into my rest” and what follows. Their sons were the type of the faithful people who receive Christ, the end of the law.There is a spiritual stain of blood that is also circumcision, as Paul attests: “For we,” he says, “are the circumcision, as many of us as worship God in spirit.” And again, “You have been circumcised without the ministry of hands.” Joshua is the type of these men, for he circumcises those who came after him. But because that circumcision was not the true one, Scripture says elsewhere, “Cut away the hardness of your hearts.”
So Moses counts the sons of the dead but not in the way it had been done previously—that is, first counting the tribes that come from free women and then those born of slave women. He has no reason to distinguish these two sorts. He first enumerates the five sons of Leah, apart from the beloved tribe of Levi, since that tribe is destined to have its own place, namely, that of sacred ministry. Then he counts Gad and Asher, sons of the slave girl. Then he counts the three sons of the free woman Rachel, among whom he first counts the sons of Joseph, according to the order of their generation: Manasseh and Ephraim, and then Rachel’s last son, Benjamin. To these he adds the sons of the slave girl, Dan11 and Naphtali. He has before his eyes the union of Israel, who was led by the spirit of servitude, and us, who are called through adoption into the spirit of freedom. Thus the words of Moses, “The nations rejoiced with this people.” And the Savior said, “There will be one flock and one shepherd.” The numbers of the remaining tribes decreased from the previous census, but the tribe of Levi increased. For the elect people always grows, while the people opposed to them diminishes.
