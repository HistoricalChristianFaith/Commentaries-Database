“Awake, Awake, Deborah!” Increase righteousness, establish the people, arise for the glory of God and the salvation of the people. “Gathering strength, arise Barak!” Arise and establish [the people] as was said to Moses, “Stand by me.” David likewise said, “Our feet stand in your courts, O Jerusalem.” “He set my feet upon the rock.” Therefore, gathering strength, arise and say, “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me!” “You are my strength and my song, O Lord.” But also you, Deborah, strengthen Barak. For the saints also give courage to us in the power of the Lord, instructing our souls against our enemies. But every mind should be held captive to the obedience of Christ. And if, Deborah, you should fall in your work, like what happened to Jonathan [when he tasted the honey], may your soul be strengthened by the sweet taste of prophecy.
