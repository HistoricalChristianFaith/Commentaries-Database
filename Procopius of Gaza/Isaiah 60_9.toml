He calls the ships “from Tharsis,” those that come from Tharsis in India, which is situated in the far east and puts us in mind of Jonah. These will come to Jerusalem not for its sake but for God, who wished to ratify the promise made to the ancestors through his great mercy. And next, “And strangers will build you walls.” This can now be seen, for the Gentiles lead the churches and fence them round with their teachings, so that there is no place for a contrary word of counsel. “And their kings will minister to you.” For even today the leaders of the Roman administration and the fear of kings restrain those plotting against the churches. Indeed, “minister” means their subordination. For they listen to the church’s holy oracles and value the gospel message with all consideration.
