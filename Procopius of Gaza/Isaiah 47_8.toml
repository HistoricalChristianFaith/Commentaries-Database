Thinking that you would prove to be better than the Persians, you said, “I am and there is no other,” and you were encouraged by the oracles of demons and astrologers. And you called on a hope that was fornication and that was far removed from God. For the association between God and all humanity by nature is very different from that between demons and humans, which provides communion through sorcery. So Paul likens idol worship to a spell when he writes of “idol worship, sorcery.” But for the Babylonians and others, idolatry does not lead to pardon or deliverance but to destruction.
