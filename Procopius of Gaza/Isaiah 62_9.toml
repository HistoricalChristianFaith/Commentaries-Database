“They will eat and drink in the courts of my sanctuary.” These are the many mansions with the Father. He mentions “courts,” or “dwellings” as some prefer, and so consequently mentions the temple. He says, “Go out through my gates,” meaning the heavenly city with its mansions and gates, which will be revealed to the saints in the future, in the place of those called. For no one will enter who is crippled by hate, or anyone who seeks to enter under false pretences. No demon will enter, or anyone who has obstructed the kingdom. “Make a road for my people,” he says to the angelic powers. But some take these powers to signify the churches of the world, and that the stones in that road are snares laid by the enemy. But the guards (that is, the disciples) are told to keep those who enter on the way free from harm. For the Jews … like to dwell in legal figures, while Greeks stumble against the strange teaching. For they refer to words that the Jewish scribes have written. But the spiritual leaders cut down the wild thickets of scandalous unclarity and remove every obstacle to the knowledge of God. Therefore, Paul says to those from the circumcision, “There is neither circumcision nor uncircumcision” but only the keeping of God’s commands.
