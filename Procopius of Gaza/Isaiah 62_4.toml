Because she will be adorned and established in incomparable beauty, he adds, “You will be a beautiful garland.” For every holy soul and the whole church must be compared with a garland put together from many flowers and a royal jewel. For David says that the church is adorned in gold-embroidered and multicolored clothing similar to what is said in our text. “In the hand of God” means “under his shelter.” For he says, “Under my hand I will shelter you.” And Christ concerning his own sheep said, “No one can steal them from the Father’s hand.” Some say that the garland of Christ are those corrected by him. And the jewel of his kingdom are those martyrs for his sake, whom in his hand the Father had chosen to put round the Son, garlanding him and placing as a royal jewel, with the fullness of those who have been saved through him and by him. Among these taking a new name, she will no longer be called “she who is left deserted” but “my will,” that is, according to my will. This means that she who was previously deserted12 will be saved and placed with him, rather than deserted.…He says “will,” meaning those doing his will, those who love him, as a young man loves a virgin.… For he protects and keeps her as virgin, according to the mystery mentioned by Paul when he discusses Christ and the church. He shows the present state of the churches under the guidance of the priests day and night. While the people are unconscious of God, the priests become their defending wall, unconquered and placing a faithful guard against any approach of the devil.
