“I have glorified you in the world.” By this glory Christ has led the blind people into the light. For the sun of righteousness does not allow us to be children of the night and shadows but rather of day, as the divine apostle says. When Paul says, “They have been gathered,” this in fact has not yet taken place, and he is obviously speaking prophetically, meaning “they will be gathered.” For speaking of things to come as if they had happened is customary in the Scriptures; another example of such is “I have given my back to the rod” and “they divided my clothing among them.” - "Commentary on Isaiah 43.1–13"
