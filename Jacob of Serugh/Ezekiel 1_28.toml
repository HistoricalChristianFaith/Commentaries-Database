The prophet wonderful-in-revelations told this account.
He who ate the scroll full of the symbols of creative power
Disgorged a memra at whose meaning intellects are dazzled.
He discoursed about the chariot and about its transformations
And about its forms and the faces that were joined in it.
About the faces and the wings and eloquent wheels
And the living spirit that was in the wheels being turned,
About the movement of service of the cherubs,
And about the high throne that is established on their backs,
And about the appearance of the image of the Son of God
Which was borne on the chariot with great awe;
And about the voice of that service that is the cherubs’ own,
Which with great movement bless the most high in his place.
All these things from Ezekiel, the son of the exile,
Did the world learn about the chariot’s awesome appearance.
For neither Moses nor David published this account
Nor any prophet told [of it] like Ezekiel.
