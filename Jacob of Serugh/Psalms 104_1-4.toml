That through visible things the world might learn who is its Lord
And what Moses omitted from his account, and what was not written,
David expressed in the book of his psalm.
“He made his angels and his ministers of fire and wind.”
Thus David caused to be written in his excellent book of Psalms
So that the world might learn that angels too were created works
And with the created things they come to birth from the Creator.
For what the great Moses did not write about concerning the angels
David wrote down, but single is the spirit of their revelations.
And the world learned through Moses as well as through David
That he is one who created all creatures with his gesture.
And David showed on what day the angels came into being
For their creation was made plain to the world, when and how
In that gesture with which heaven and earth were created.
In it all the hosts of heavenly beings arose.
Through the word of the Lord heaven was made, David showed.
And together with it [his word] were the hosts made through the Spirit from his mouth.
Moses demonstrated that the Lord created the heaven and the earth
And David demonstrated how the hosts came into being. Isaiah, too, through that revelation of his prophecy, brought to the world an account of that power of the seraphim.
