In yet another passage, contemplating the still more wonderful benevolence of God in Christ, he says: “Him who knew no sin, he has made sin for us, that we might be made the justice of God in him.” In view of these utterances and other similar ones, we are under the strictest obligation, unless we have received in vain the grace of God, first, to free ourselves from the dominion of the devil who leads a slave of sin into evils even against his will. Secondly, each of us, after denying himself present satisfactions and breaking off his attachment to this life, must become a disciple of the Lord, as he himself said: “If any man will come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.”.
