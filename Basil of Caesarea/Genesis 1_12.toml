When I hear “grass,” I think of grass, and in the same manner I understand everything as it is said: a plant, a fish, a wild animal and an ox. Indeed, “I am not ashamed of the gospel.” … (Some) have attempted by false arguments and allegorical interpretations to bestow on the Scripture a dignity of their own imagining. But theirs is the attitude of one who considers himself wiser than the revelations of the Spirit and introduces his own ideas in pretense of an explanation. Therefore, let it be understood as it has been written.

At this saying all the dense woods appeared; all the trees shot up…. Likewise all the shrubs were immediately thick with leaf and bushy; and the socalled garland plants … all came into existence in a moment of time, although they were not previously on the earth…. “Let the earth bring forth.” This brief command was immediately a mighty nature and an elaborate system which brought to perfection more swiftly than our thought the countless properties of plants. ,

The adornment of the earth is older than the sun, that those who have been misled may cease worshiping the sun as the origin of life.
