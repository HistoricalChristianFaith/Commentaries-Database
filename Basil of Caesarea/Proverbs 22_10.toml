If some persist in their disobedience, finding fault in secret and not openly stating their grievance, thus becoming the cause of quarreling in the community and undermining the authority of the commands given, they should be dismissed from the community as teachers of disobedience and rebellion. For the Scripture says, “Cast out the scoffer from the council, and contention shall go out with him” and also, “Put away the evil one from yourselves, for a little leaven corrupts the whole lump.”
