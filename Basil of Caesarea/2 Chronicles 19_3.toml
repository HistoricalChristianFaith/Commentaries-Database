If you see your neighbor committing sin, take care not to dwell exclusively on his sin, but think of the many things he has done and continues to do rightly. Many times, by examining the whole and not taking the part only into account, you will find that he is better than you. God does not examine humans according to the part, for he says, “I come to gather together their works and thoughts.” Furthermore, when he rebuked Josaphat for a sin committed in an unguarded moment, he mentioned also the good he had done, saying, “But good works are found in you.”
