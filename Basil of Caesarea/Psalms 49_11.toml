One who is dead through sins does not dwell in a house but a sepulcher, since his soul is dead.… The thoroughly depraved person dwells in a sepulcher and does not even lay down a foundation of penance because of his dead works, but he is “like a whited sepulcher, which outwardly is very conspicuous but inwardly is full of dead men’s bones and of all uncleanness.” Therefore, when such a one speaks, he does not open his mouth in the word of God, but he has an open sepulcher as his throat.
