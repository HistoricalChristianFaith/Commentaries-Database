“Who has known the mind of the Lord or who rather has been his counselor?” This passage is not merely a rhetorical question. If it were, “who” could not possibly refer to anyone. Rather, the use of “who” indicates a rare personage.… All these questions … have the same answer: “For the Father loves the Son and shows him all that he himself is doing.”
