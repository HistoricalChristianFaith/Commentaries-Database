Therefore he called the beginning of time not a “first day” but “one day,” in order that from the name it might have kinship with eternity. For the day that shows a character of uniqueness and nonparticipation with the rest is properly and naturally called “one.” If, however, the Scripture presents to us many ages, saying in various places “age of age” and “age of ages,” still in those places neither the first nor the second nor the third age is enumerated for us. By this, differences of conditions and of various circumstances are shown to us but not limits and boundaries and successions of ages. “The Day of the Lord is great and very terrible,” it is said.
