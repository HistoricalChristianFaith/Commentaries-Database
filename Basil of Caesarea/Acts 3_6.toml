Faith is superior to rational methodologies when it comes to drawing the soul to assent. It is not the logical necessity of deductive proofs that engenders faith, but the activity of the Spirit. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, arise and walk! [Acts 3.6]. What followed this command was the work of the Spirit, and those who witnessed this miracle were compelled to admit the divinity of the Only-Begotten. Tell me, what is more compelling for assent, a complicated set of syllogistic premises entailing the logical conclusion, or a clearly seen miracle so great that it surpasses all that is humanly possible? Yet currently such things are not held in high regard. Indeed, what now inspires confidence when discussing God is not the works of the Spirit, but rather elaborate demonstrations which place their hope in the plausibility of the wisdom of the world, not in the powerful and clear revelation of the Spirit. It was through those who believed God in simplicity of heart without engaging in futile investigations that the Spirit gave this revelation for the salvation of many. - "On Psalm 115. Chapter 1."
