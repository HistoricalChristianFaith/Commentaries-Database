Now we must observe, that conjectures concerning the stars are necessary to the life of man, as long as we do not push our searches into their signs beyond due limits. For it ispossible to discover some things with respect to coming rain, still more concerning heat and the force of the winds, whether partial or universal, stormy or gentle. But the great advantage that is rendered to life by these conjectures is known to every one. For it is of importance to the  sailor to prognosticate the dangers of storms, to the traveler the changes of the weather, to the  husbandmen the abundant supply of his fruits.
