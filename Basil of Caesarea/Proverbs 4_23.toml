Whoever, therefore, would be truly a follower of God must sever the bonds of attachment to this life, and this is done through complete separation from and forgetfulness of old habits. We must wrest ourselves from both fleshly ties and worldly society, being transported, as it were, to another world in our manner of living, as the apostle said: “But our commonwealth is in heaven.” Without this it is impossible for us to achieve our goal of pleasing God, inasmuch as the Lord said specifically, “So likewise every one of you that does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple.” And having done this, we should watch over our heart with all vigilance.

Believe these words of mine that proceed from the fraternal charity of my heart. Have recourse to older men who make themselves difficult of access and in no way harm the young by their charm of countenance but animate them to virtuous deeds by sayings from Proverbs. “With all watchfulness, keep your heart”; for, like golden treasure, it is the object of the constant vigilance of thieves, night and day, and in an unguarded moment it is stolen without your being aware of it. See that the adversary does not seduce you into the sin of our first parent and cast you with all speed out of the paradise of delight.
