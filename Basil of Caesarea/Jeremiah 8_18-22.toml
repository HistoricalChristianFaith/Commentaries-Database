“Shall not he that falls rise again, and he that is turned away, shall he not turn again?” Why, then, is the virgin “turned away with a stubborn revolting,” even though she heard Christ, her spouse, saying through Jeremiah: “And when she had committed all these fornications, I said: Return to me, and she did not return?” “Is there no balm in Gilead? Or is there no physician there? Why, then, is not the wound of the daughter of my people closed?” Indeed, you will find many safeguards against evil in the divine Scripture, and many remedies which from destruction bring salvation. There are the mysteries of death and resurrection, the words of terrible judgment and everlasting punishment, the doctrines of repentance and the forgiveness of sin and those innumerable examples of conversion. There are the drachma, the sheep and the son who spent his livelihood with harlots, who was lost and found, was dead and lived again. Let us use these safeguards against evil. Through them, let us heal our soul.…While we can, let us lift ourselves from the fall. Let us never despair of ourselves, if only we depart from evil. Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners. “O come, let us worship and fall down; let us weep before him.” The Word who invited us to repentance calls aloud, “Come unto me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.” There is, then, a way of salvation, if we want it. “Death in his might has swallowed up, but again the Lord has wiped away tears from off all faces” of those who repent. The Lord is faithful in all his words. He does not lie when he says, “Though your sins are scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they are red like crimson, they shall be as wool.” The great Physician of souls who is the ready liberator, not of you alone, but of all who are enslaved by sin, is ready to heal your sickness. From him come the words, it was his sweet and saving lips that said, “They who are whole do not need a physician but those who are sick.… I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.” What excuse have you, what excuse has anyone, when he speaks in this way? The Lord wishes to cleanse you from the trouble of your sickness and to show you light after darkness. The good Shepherd who left those who had not wandered away is seeking after you. If you give yourself to him, he will not hold back. He, in his love, will not disdain even to carry you on his own shoulders, rejoicing that he has found his sheep that was lost. The Father stands and awaits your return from your wandering. Only come back, and while you are yet far off, he will run and fall on your neck, and, now that you are cleansed by repentance, will enfold you in embraces of love. He will clothe with the chief robe the soul that has put off the old person with all his works. He will put a ring on hands that have washed off the blood of death and will put shoes on feet that have turned from the evil way to the path of the gospel of peace. He will announce the day of joy and gladness to those who are his own, both angels and human beings, and will celebrate your salvation far and wide. For “truly I say unto you,” he says, “there is joy in heaven before God over one sinner who repents.”
