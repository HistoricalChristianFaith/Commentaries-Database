Not only Paul but generally all those to whom is committed any ministry of the word never cease to testify but call heaven and earth to witness, on the grounds that now every deed is done within them, and they will be present with the judged in the examination of all of life. So it is said, “He shall call to the heavens above and to earth, that he may judge his people.” And so Moses, when about to deliver his oracles to the people, says, “I call heaven and earth to witness this day”; and again in his song he says, “Give ear, O you heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.”
