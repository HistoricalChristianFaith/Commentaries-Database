According to the words of the wise Solomon in the Proverbs, he was created. “The Lord,” he says, “created me.” And he is called “the beginning of the evangelical way” which leads us to the kingdom of heaven, since he is not a creature in substance but was made the “way” in the divine dispensation. For “being made” and “being created” have the same meaning. In fact, as he was made a way, so also was he made a door, a shepherd, a messenger, a sheep, and, in turn, a high priest and apostle, different names given according to the different conceptions.
