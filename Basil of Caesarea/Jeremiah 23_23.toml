He also observes the rule, “Whether you eat or drink or whatever else you do, do all to the glory of God.” But one who departs from the strict observance of the commandment in performing his actions clearly shows that he has given small thought to God. Mindful, therefore, of the voice of him who said, “Do I not fill heaven and earth? declares the Lord” and again, “Am I a God at hand and not a God afar off?” Also, “Where there are two or three gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them.” We should perform every action as if under the eyes of the Lord and think every thought as if observed by him. Thus, fear will abide constantly within us who hate iniquity, as it is written, insolence, pride, and the ways of the wicked, and love will be made perfect, fulfilling the words of the Lord: “I seek not my own will but the will of him that sent me.”
