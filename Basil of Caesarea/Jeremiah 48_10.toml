It is hazardous for a superior to be delinquent, since he holds the position of arbiter in everything. It is both injurious and detrimental for those under their charge when they are disobedient. It is especially perilous if, in addition, the one who is in a superior position is scandalous. Each one who shows in his own place a tireless zeal, fulfilling the apostle’s precept, “in carefulness not slothful,” merits praise for his promptness. But for negligence he deserves the opposite, that is, unhappiness and woe. For the prophet says, “Cursed is the one who does the work of the Lord negligently.”

What condemnation, then, ought we to expect to fall on those who are frivolous and irresponsible in the management of goods that are already consecrated to the Lord? Are they not liable to the sentence of doom pronounced on the negligent, as it is written, “Cursed is he who does the work of the Lord negligently”?

Do not allow another to do the work that is rightly yours, so that the reward as well may not be taken from you and given to another and he be enriched with your wealth while you are put to shame. Perform the duties of your ministry decently and with care as if you were serving Christ, for “cursed,” says the prophet, “is everyone who does the work of the Lord negligently.” Fear, as if the eye of the Lord were on you, the perversity that arises from fastidiousness and contempt, even though the task in hand seems to you a menial one. The work of the ministry is an exalted work and leads to the kingdom of heaven.

Elsewhere, he expresses his condemnation more vividly: “Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire that was prepared for the devil and his angels.” Then he alleges not the commission of any forbidden act but the omission of commended ones, saying, “For I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink,” and so on. There are many passages like that that one might find to prove that not only are those who do wicked things worthy of death—for whom has been prepared the inextinguishable fire as well—but that along with these those are condemned who leave good works undone or who perform them negligently. For it is written, “Cursed is every person who does the work of the Lord negligently.”
