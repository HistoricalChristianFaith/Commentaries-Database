For he himself has bound the strong man and stolen his goods, that is, humanity itself, whom our enemy had abused in every evil activity. God has created “vessels fit for the Master’s use,” that is, us who have been perfected for every work through the preparation of that part of us which is in our own control. Thus we gained our approach to the Father through him, being translated from “the power of darkness to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light.”
