Moses was the writer of a great part of the law. Did he not add to it a threat against the transgressor or the negligent? He presents a general malediction upon all violators. This is seen in his introduction to the announcement of this most frightful penalty: “Cursed be every man that abides not in all that is written in the book of this law”; and elsewhere, “Cursed be he that does the work of the Lord negligently.” If he is accursed who does the work of the Lord negligently, what does he deserve who does not follow the law at all?
