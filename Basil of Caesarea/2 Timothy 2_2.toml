One does not speak of the Spirit and of angels as if they were equals. The Spirit is the Lord of life. The angels are our helpers, our fellow servants, faithful witnesses of the truth. It is customary for the saints to deliver God’s commandments in the presence of witnesses. St. Paul says to Timothy: “what you have heard from me before many witnesses entrust to faithful men.” He asks the angels to testify with him, because he knows that angels will be present when the Lord comes in the glory of his father to judge the world in righteousness.
