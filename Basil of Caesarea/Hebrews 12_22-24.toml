Some give the definition that a city is an established community, administered according to law. And the definition that has been handed down of the city is in harmony with the celestial city, Jerusalem above. For there it is a community of the firstborn who have been enrolled in heaven, and this is established because of the unchanging manner of the life of the saints, and it is administered according to the heavenly law. Therefore, it is not the privilege of human nature to learn the arrangement of that city and all its adornment. Those are the things “no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him,” but there are myriads of angels there, an assembly of saints and a church of the firstborn that are enrolled in heaven. Concerning that, David said, “Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of God.” To that city through Isaiah God has promised, “I will make you majestic forever, a joy from age to age. Devastation and destruction shall no more be within your borders; you shall call your walls Salvation.” Therefore, having raised the eyes of your soul, seek, in a manner worthy of things above, what pertains to the city of God. What could anyone consider as deserving of the happiness in that city which the river of God makes joyful and of which God is the craftsman and creator?
