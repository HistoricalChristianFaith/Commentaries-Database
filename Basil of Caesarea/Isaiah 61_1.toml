To name Christ is to confess the whole, for it is to point to God [The Father] who has anointed the Son; and to the Son who has been anointed, and to the unction itself, which is The Spirit. This accords with Peter’s teaching in Acts: ‘God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10.38) and with the teaching of Isaiah: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me’ [Isaiah 61.1]. The Psalmist simply says, ‘Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness’ (Ps 45.7). - "On The Holy Spirit, 12"
