If two yardsticks are compared with each other, their straightness is in agreement. But if a distorted piece of wood is compared with a ruler, the crooked one will be at variance with the straight. Since, therefore, the praise of God is righteous, there is need of a righteous heart, in order that the praise may be fitting and adapted to it. “No one can say ‘Jesus is Lord,’ except in the Holy Spirit.” So how can one offer due praise if one does not have the right spirit in one’s heart?
