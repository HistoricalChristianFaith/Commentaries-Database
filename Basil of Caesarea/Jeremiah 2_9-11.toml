This alone among all evils is without comparison. This is a new act of shamelessness in life. “Go over to the islands of Kittim and see,” the Lord says. “Send to Kedar and consider carefully whether anything like this has ever been done—if a nation has changed its gods? (Yet they are not gods at all.).” But the virgin “has changed her glory,” and her glory is in her shame.
