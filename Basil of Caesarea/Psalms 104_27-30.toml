But, if we must go on with our discussion and make a deeper study, let us, from this point, contemplate especially the divine power of the Holy Spirit. We find three creations mentioned in the Scripture; the first, the bringing forth from nonexistence into existence; the second, the change from worse to better; and the third, the resurrection of the dead. In these you will find the Holy Spirit co-operating with the Father and the Son. Take, for instance, the calling into existence of the heavens. And what does David say? “By the word of the Lord the heavens were established, and all their power by the spirit of his mouth.” Now, humankind is created a second time through baptism, “for if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature.” And what does the Savior say to the disciples? “Go, make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” You see here, also, the Holy Spirit present with the Father and the Son. But what would you say concerning the resurrection of the dead, when we shall have departed and returned into our dust, “for we are dust and to dust we shall return”? “And he will send forth the Holy Spirit, and he will create us, and he shall renew the face of the earth.” For what Paul spoke of as the resurrection, David called renewal.

Resurrection from the dead is accomplished by the operation of the Spirit: “You send forth your Spirit, and they are created; and you renew the face of the earth.” If “creation” means the conversion of sinners to a better way of life (the Scripture often understands it this way; for example, the words of Paul: “If any one is in Christ, he is a new creation.”), and the renewal of this earthly life and changing our earthly, passionate life into heavenly citizenship, then we should know that our souls attain such a high degree of exaltation through the Spirit. Understanding all this, how can we be afraid of giving the Spirit too much honor? We should instead fear that even though we ascribe to him the highest titles we can devise or our tongues pronounce, our ideas about him might still fall short.
