Here, also, one who examines each word minutely can gain a very accurate knowledge of the meaning of the Holy Scripture, so that there is no excuse for any of us being led astray into the snare of sin by an erroneous belief that some sins are punished while others may be committed with impunity. For, what says the apostle?— “destroying counsels and every height that exalts itself against the knowledge of God”; so that every sin, because it is an expression of contempt for the divine law, is called a “height that exalts itself against the knowledge of God.”
