It is shameful, indeed, that they who are sick in body place so much confidence in physicians that, even if these cut or burn or cause distress by their bitter medicines, they look upon them as benefactors, while we do not share this attitude toward the physicians of our souls when they secure our salvation for us by laborious discipline. The apostle says, however: “Who is he then who can make me glad, but the same who is made sorrowful by me.” … It behooves one who looks to the end, therefore, to consider him a benefactor who causes us pain which is according to God.
