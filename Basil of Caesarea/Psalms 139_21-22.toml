Yet, it is not hard for us, if we wish it, to take up a love for justice and a hatred for iniquity. God has advantageously given all power to the rational soul, as that of loving, so also that of hating, in order that, guided by reason, we may love virtue but hate vice. It is possible at times to use hatred even praiseworthily. “Have I not hated them, O Lord, that hated you and pined away because of your enemies? I have hated them with a perfect hatred.”
