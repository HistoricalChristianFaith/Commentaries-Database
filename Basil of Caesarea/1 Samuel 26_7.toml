If Saul had been asked the reason for his hostility, he would have been compelled to admit that it was the favors received from David’s hand. Moreover, even though Saul had been found asleep by David during the very time that the latter was being pursued, and although Saul lay, an easy victim, before his enemy, his life was again spared by that just man, for he refrained from doing him violence.
