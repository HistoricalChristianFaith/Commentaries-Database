The beasts prove your faith. Do you believe in the Lord? “You will tread upon the asp and the adder, you trample down the lion and the serpent.” And you have the power to walk over snakes and scorpions. Don’t you see that the snake that bit Paul as he gathered sticks did him no harm, since the holy man was found to be full of faith. If you have no faith, fear less the beast than your own faithlessness through which you make yourself susceptible to every type of corruption.
