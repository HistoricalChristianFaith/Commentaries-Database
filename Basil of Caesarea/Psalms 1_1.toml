Like the foundation in a house, the keel in a ship and the heart in a body, so is [Psalm 1 as a] brief introduction to the whole structure of the Psalms. For when David intended to propose in the course of his speech to the combatants of true religion many painful tasks involving unmeasured sweats and toils, he showed first the happy end, that in the hope of the blessings reserved for us we might endure without grief the sufferings of this life.

What is truly good is principally and primarily the most blessed. And that is God.… For truly blessed is Goodness itself toward which all things look, which all things desire, an unchangeable nature, lordly dignity, calm existence; a happy way of life, in which there is no alteration, which no change touches; a flowing fount, abundant grace, inexhaustible treasure. But stupid and worldly people, ignorant of the nature of good itself, frequently bless things worth nothing, riches, health, renown; not one of which is in its nature good, not only because they easily change to the opposite but also because they are unable to make their possessors good. What person is just because of his possessions? What person is self-controlled because of his health? On the contrary, in fact, each of these possessions frequently becomes the servant of sin for those who use them badly. Blessed is the one, then, who possesses that which is esteemed of the greatest value, who shares in the goods that cannot be taken away. How shall we recognize that person? “He who has not walked in the council of the ungodly.”

Why, you say, does the prophet single out only man and proclaim him happy? Does he not exclude women from happiness? By no means. For the virtue of man and woman is the same, since creation is equally honored in both; therefore, there is the same reward for both. Listen to Genesis: “God created humankind,” it says, “In the image of God he created him. Male and female he created them.” They whose nature is alike have the same reward.

He put before us three acts that must be guarded against.… In accordance with the nature of things, he set up this order by his words. First, we take counsel with ourselves; next, we strengthen our resolution; then, we continue unchanged in what has been determined.

The “chair” here refers to steady and lasting persistence in the choice of evil. This we must guard against because the practice of assiduously occupying ourselves with sins engenders in our soul a certain condition that can scarcely be removed. An inveterate condition of the soul and the exercise of evil strengthened by time are hard to heal or even entirely incurable, since, for the most part, custom is changed into nature. Indeed, not to attach ourselves to evil is a request worth praying for. But there remains a second way: immediately after the temptation to flee it as if it were a venomous sting, according to words of Solomon concerning the wicked woman: “Do not set your eye on her, but leap back; do not delay.” Now, I know that some in their youth have sunk down into the passions of the flesh and have remained in their sins until their old age because of the habit of evil. As the swine rolling about in the mire always smear more muck on themselves, so these bring on themselves more and more each day the shame of pleasure. Blessed is it, therefore, not to have had evil in your mind; but, if through the deceit of the enemy, you have received in your soul the counsels of impiety, do not stay in your sin. And, if you have experienced this, do not become established in evil. So then, “do not sit in the chair of pestilence.”
