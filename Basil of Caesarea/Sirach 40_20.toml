Prayer is the request for good made to God by pious persons. In no way do we limit such requests merely to words. We do not believe that God needs to be reminded of things with words. He already knows the things that are good for us, even when we do not ask for them. So, what are we saying? That our prayer should not consist in syllables but in the soul"s purpose and in virtuous actions that spread throughout our entire life. "Whether you eat," says the apostle, "or drink or do any other thing, do everything to the glory of God." Seated at table, pray. Taking your bread, thank him who gave it to you. Fortifying the weakness of the body with wine, remember him who offers you this gift for the gladness of your heart and comfort in illness. Do you no longer feel the need for food? Do not allow the memory of the Benefactor to fade! If you put on your tunic, give thanks to him who gave it to you. If you wrap yourself in your cloak, let your love for God grow, who has given you suitable clothing in both winter and summer, to care for your life and to cover what is shameful. Has the day ended? Give thanks to him who lavished sunlight in service of the affairs of the day and fire to illuminate the night, for dealing with what is left to be done. - "On the Martyr Julitta"
