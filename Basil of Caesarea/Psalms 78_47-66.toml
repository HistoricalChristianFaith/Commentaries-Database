The Spirit speaks with the authority of the Lord: “The Spirit said to [Peter], ‘Rise and go down, and accompany them without hesitation; for I have sent them.’ ” Are these the words of an abject inferior? “Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” Does a slave give commands like this? Isaiah says, “The Lord God and his Spirit have sent me,” and “the Spirit came down from the Lord and led them.” Do not try again to convince me that this “leading” by the Spirit is some lowly service. Scripture testifies that it is the work of God: “He led forth his people like sheep,” it says, and “You who lead Joseph like a flock,” and “He led them in safety so that they were not afraid.” Therefore, when you hear that “the Comforter will bring to remembrance all that I have said to you and will guide you into all truth,” do not quibble over the meaning.
