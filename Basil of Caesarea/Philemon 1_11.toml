All bound slaves who flee to religious communities for refuge should be admonished and sent back to their masters in better dispositions, after the example of St. Paul who, although he had begotten Onesimus through the gospel, sent him back to Philemon. He had convinced Onesimus that the yoke of slavery, borne in a manner pleasing to the Lord, would render him worthy of the kingdom of heaven. Paul not only urged Philemon to annul the threat against his servant, being mindful of the Lord’s own words: “If you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also your offenses.” But also, in order that Philemon might be more kindly disposed toward Onesimus, Paul writes: “For perhaps he therefore departed for a season from you that you might receive him again forever; not as a servant, but instead of a servant, as a most dear brother.” If, however, it should be the case of a wicked master who gives unlawful commands and forces the slave to transgress the command of our Master, the Lord Jesus Christ, then it is our duty to oppose him, so that the name of God not be blasphemed by that slave’s performing an act displeasing to God.
