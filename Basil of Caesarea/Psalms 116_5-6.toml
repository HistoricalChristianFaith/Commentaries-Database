“The Lord is merciful and just.” Everywhere Scripture joins justice with the mercy of God, teaching us that neither the mercy of God is without judgment nor his judgment without mercy. Even while he pities, he measures out his mercies judiciously to the worthy; and while judging, he brings forth the judgment, having regard to our weakness, repaying us with kindness rather than with equal reciprocal measurement.“And our God shows mercy.” Mercy is an emotion experienced toward those who have been reduced beyond their desert and that arises in those sympathetically disposed. We pity the person who has fallen from great riches into the uttermost poverty, one who has been overthrown from the peak of vigor of body to extreme weakness, one who gloried in the beauty and grace of body and who has been destroyed by most shameful passions. Though we at one time were held in glory, living in paradise, yet we have become inglorious and humble because of our banishment; “our God shows mercy,” seeing what sort of people we have become from what we were. For this reason he summoned Adam with a voice of mercy, saying, “Adam, where are you?” He who knows all things was not seeking to be informed, but he wished to perceive what sort Adam had become from what he had been. “Where are you?” instead of “to what sort of a ruin have you descended from so great a height?”

“The Lord is the keeper of little ones; I was humbled, and he delivered me.” According to natural reason human nature would not stand unless the little ones and those still infants were kept by the Lord. For, unless it was preserved by the custody of God, how could the fetus in the mother be nourished or moved while it was in such narrow spaces, with no room for turning, and while it lived in dark and moist places, unable to take a breath or to live the life of people, but, on the contrary, was borne around in liquids like the fish? And how would it last even for a short time after it had come out into this unaccustomed place and, lacking the warmth within the mother, had become chilled all over by the air, unless it was preserved by God? Therefore, “the Lord is the keeper of little ones; I was humbled, and he delivered me.” Or, you may understand these words thus. When I was turned and became as a little child and received the kingdom of heaven as a child and through innocence brought myself down to the humility of children, “the Lord, the keeper of little ones,” since I was humbled, “delivered me.”
