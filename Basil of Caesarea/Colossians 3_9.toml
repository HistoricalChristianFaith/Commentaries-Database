Seek nothing with exterior gold and bodily adornment; but consider the garment as one worthy to adorn him who is according to the image of his Creator, as the apostle says: “Stripping off the old man, and putting on the new, one that is being renewed unto perfect knowledge ‘according to the image of his Creator.’” And he who has put on “the heart of mercy, kindness, humility, patience and meekness” is clothed within and has adorned the inner man.
