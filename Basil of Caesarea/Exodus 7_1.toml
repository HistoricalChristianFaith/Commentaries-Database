Moses was appointed god of the Egyptians when he who was giving the revelation spoke to him in this manner: “I have appointed you the god of Pharaoh.” Therefore the title conveys an indication of some power, either protective or active. But the divine nature in all the names which may be contrived remains, just as it is, inexplicable, as is our teaching.
