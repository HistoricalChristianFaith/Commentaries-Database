The apostle also showed how much incontinency is to be dreaded by including it among the signs of apostasy, when he said, “In the last days shall come dangerous times. Men shall be lovers of themselves.” Then, after enumerating several forms of iniquity, he adds, “slanderers, incontinent.” Also, for selling his birthright for one portion of food, Esau was charged with incontinency as the greatest of evils. The first disobedience befell men as a consequence of incontinency.
