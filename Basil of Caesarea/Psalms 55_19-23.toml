All of them will stand about Job when the Judge of human life will gather together the universal church, when the trumpet that is to announce the coming of the King calls loudly to the tombs and demands the bodies that have been entrusted to their charge. Then, they who now appear to be dead will take their place before the Maker of the whole world more quickly than will the living. For this reason, I think, the Lord allotted to Job a double portion of his other wealth but judged that he would be satisfied with the same number of children as before. Do you see how many blessings the just Job reaped from his patience? You, also, should therefore bear patiently any harm that may have come to you from yesterday’s fire enkindled by a demon’s treachery, and alleviate your feelings of distress over your misfortune with more courageous thoughts, in accordance with the words of the Scripture: “Cast your care on the Lord, and he will sustain you.”

But do not lament a burden that surpasses your strength. For if you were the one destined to bear this responsibility alone, it would not be merely heavy but utterly unendurable. But, if the Lord is the one who helps you bear it, “Cast your care on the Lord,” and he himself will bear it. Only, let me urge you in all things to guard against this—that you be not carried along with others by wicked customs, but that through the wisdom given to you by God you change the formerly adopted evil practices into something good. For Christ has sent you, not to follow others but that you yourself may guide those who are being saved.
