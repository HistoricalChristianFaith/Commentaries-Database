We are not capable of glorifying God on our own; only in the Spirit is this made possible. In him we are able to thank God for the blessings we have received. To the extent that we are purified from evil, each receives a smaller or larger portion of the Spirit’s help that each may offer the sacrifice of praise to God. If we offer glory to God, in the Spirit, we mean that the Spirit enables us to fulfill the requirements of true religion.… The words of Paul are appropriate: “I think I have the Spirit of God.” … Likewise it is said concerning Daniel, “the Holy Spirit of God is in you.”
