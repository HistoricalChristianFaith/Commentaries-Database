Peter’s words to Sapphira—“How is it that you have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? You did not lie to men, but to God”—show that sins against the Holy Spirit and against God are the same. And thus you might learn that in every operation the Spirit is closely conjoined with, and inseparable from, the Father and the Son. While God works the differences of operations and the Lord the diversities of administrations, the Holy Spirit is present also, administering in his own power the distribution of the gifts according to each recipient’s worth.
