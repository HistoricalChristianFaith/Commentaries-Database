No sensible person, then, will be proud of his wisdom … but will follow the excellent advice of blessed Hannah and of the prophet Jeremiah, “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom and let not the strong man glory in his strength and let not the rich man glory in his riches.” But what is true glory and what makes one great? “In this,” says the prophet, “let him that glories, glory, that he understands and knows that I am the Lord.” This constitutes the pinnacle of human dignity, this is his glory and greatness: truly to know what is great and to cleave to it, and to seek after glory from the Lord of glory. - "On Humility"
