Therefore, let the church of God be saluted and let it be taught to say what we were just saying: “Give us help from trouble; for the help of people is worthless.” So, perhaps, the meaning of the psalm does not at all permit us to allege weakness, if indeed affliction is a patron of help and not an occasion of infirmity. To those, then, who were rejected through sin but then received again through the kindness of God, it is appropriate to say, “O God, you have cast us off and have destroyed us; you have been angry and have had mercy on us.”
