Let those who do nothing right in life and think they are justified by the length of their prayer listen to these words. For the words of the prayer are not useful by themselves but only when they are offered up with earnest intent. Now the Pharisee also seemed to multiply his supplication. But what does the Scripture say? “The Pharisee stood and prayed thus to himself,” not to God, for he turned back toward himself, since at all events he was in the sin of arrogance.
