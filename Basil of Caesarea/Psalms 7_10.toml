My help is not from wealth or from corporal resources or from my own power and strength nor from human ties of kinship, but “my help is from God.” What assistance the Lord sends to those who fear him, we have learned elsewhere in a psalm that says, “The angel of the Lord shall encamp round about them that fear him and shall deliver them.” And in another place: “The angel who has delivered me.”
