If you remain unruffled, you silence your insolent assailant by giving him a practical illustration of self-control. Were you struck? So also was the Lord. Were you spat on? The Lord also suffered this, for “he did not turn his face from the shame of the spittle.” … You have not been condemned to death or crucified.
