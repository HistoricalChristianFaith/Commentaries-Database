Pay close attention to the Lord’s words; whenever he instructs us about the Father, he knows that by using terms of personal authority, such as “I will; be clean”; and “Peace! Be still!” and “But I say to you”; and “You deaf and dumb spirit, I command you”; and other similar expressions, we will be led to recognize his authority as master and creator. By these encounters we are meeting the Father of the Son, the Father who creates through the Son. This does not insinuate that the Father’s creation is imperfect, or that the Son’s energy is feeble, but shows their unity of will.
