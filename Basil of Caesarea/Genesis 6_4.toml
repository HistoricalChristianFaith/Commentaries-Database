Strength of arm, swiftness of foot and comeliness of body—the spoils of sickness and the plunder of time—also awaken pride in man, unaware as he is that “All flesh is grass and all the glory of man as the flower of the field. The grass is withered and the flower is fallen.” Such was the arrogance of the giants because of their strength. Such also was the Goddefying pride of the witless Goliath. Homily , Of Humility.
