These words seem to contain some boastfulness and to be very much like the prayer of the Pharisee who was exalting himself, but, if one considers them reasonably, the prophet will be seen to be far from such a disposition.… “According to my justice” [means] according to that attainable by people and possible for those living in the flesh. “And according to my innocence,” [in this] he names his innocence as if it were simplicity and ignorance of things useful to know according to the saying in the Proverbs: “The innocent believes every word.” Since, therefore, we people through ignorance fall unguardedly into many sins, he entreats God and asks to meet with pardon because of his innocence. From this it is evident that these words show the humility of the speaker rather than arrogance.
