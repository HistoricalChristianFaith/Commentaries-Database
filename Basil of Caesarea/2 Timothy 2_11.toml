Having been planted with him in the likeness of his death, we will assuredly be raised up together with Christ (for the planting implies this eventuality). But in the present life, we are formed in the inner man according to the measure of the incarnation in newness of life and obedience unto death, fully persuaded of the truth of his words, so that we may become worthy to say with truth, “And I live, now not I, but Christ lives in me.” That this obtains also for the future life. The same apostle has strongly affirmed this in these words: “For if we be dead with him, we shall also live with him. If we suffer, we shall also reign with him.”
