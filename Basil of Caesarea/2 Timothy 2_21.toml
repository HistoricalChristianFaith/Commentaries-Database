The infinite God, remaining changeless, assumed flesh and fought with death, freeing us from suffering by his own suffering!… He himself has bound the strong man and plundered his goods—that is, us, who had been abased in every manner of evil—and made us vessels fit for the Master’s use, the use of our free will being made ready for any good work.
