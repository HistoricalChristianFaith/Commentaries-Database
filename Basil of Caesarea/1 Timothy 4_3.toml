It should also be laid down as essential that continency is inexorably demanded of combatants for godliness, so that they may bring the body into subjection, “for every athlete exercises self-control in all things.” However, to avoid being classed with the enemies of God who are seared in their conscience and, therefore, abstain from food which God has made for the faithful to partake of with thanksgiving, we should taste each dish when occasion offers so as to indicate to those looking on that “all things are clean to the clean” and that “every creature of God is good and nothing to be rejected that is received with thanksgiving; for it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.” The aim of continency must nevertheless be kept in mind also, to the extent that we satisfy our need with the plainer foods and those necessary to sustain life, avoiding the evil of taking our fill of them and abstaining absolutely from those foods whose sole purpose is to give delight.
