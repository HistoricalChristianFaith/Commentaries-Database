If we offer glory to God in the Spirit, we mean that the Spirit enables us to fulfill the requirements of true religion. According to this usage, then, we say we are in the Spirit, but it is not objectionable for someone to testify, “the Spirit of God is in me, and I offer glory because his grace has given me the wisdom to do so.” The words of Paul are appropriate: “I think that I have the Spirit of God,” and “guard the truth that has been entrusted to you by the Holy Spirit who dwells within us.”
