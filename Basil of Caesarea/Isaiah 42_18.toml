It is evident, indeed, that some possess ears better able to hear the words of God. But to those who do not have those ears, what does he say? “Hear, you deaf, and, you blind, behold.” Also, “I opened my mouth and panted,” and “You have broken the teeth of sinners.” All these things were said in reference to the faculties that render service for spiritual food and spiritual doctrine. - "Homilies on the Psalms 16.13. (Psalm 33)"
