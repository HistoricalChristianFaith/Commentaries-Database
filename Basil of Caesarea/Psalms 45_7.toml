To name Christ is to confess the whole, for it is to point to God [The Father] who has anointed the Son; and to the Son who has been anointed, and to the unction itself, which is The Spirit. This accords with Peter’s teaching in Acts: ‘God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit (Acts 10.38) and with the teaching of Isaiah: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me’ (Isaiah 61.1). The Psalmist simply says, ‘Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness’ [Ps 45.7]. - "On The Holy Spirit, 12"

The flesh of the Lord was anointed with the true anointing, by the coming of the Holy Spirit into it, which was called “the oil of gladness.” And he was anointed above his fellows; that is to say, all people who are members of Christ. Therefore, a certain partial sharing of the Spirit was given to them, but the Holy Spirit descending on the Son of God, as John says, “abode on him.”
