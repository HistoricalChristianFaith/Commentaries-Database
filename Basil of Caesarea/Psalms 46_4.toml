Some give the definition that a city is an established community, administered according to law. And the definition that has been handed down of the city is in harmony with the celestial city, Jerusalem above. For there it is a community of the first-born who have been enrolled in heaven, and this is established because of the unchanging manner of life of the saints, and it is administered according to the heavenly law. Therefore, it is not the privilege of human nature to learn the arrangement of that city and all its adornment. Those are the things “eye has not seen nor ear heard, nor has it entered into the human heart, what things God has prepared for those who love him,” but there are myriads of angels there, and an assembly of saints and a church of the firstborn that are enrolled in heaven. Concerning that David said, “Glorious things are said of you, O city of God.” To that city through Isaiah God has promised, “I will make you to be an everlasting glory, a joy unto generation and generation, and there shall not be wasting nor destruction in your borders, and salvation shall possess your walls.” Therefore, having raised the eyes of your soul, seek, in a manner worthy of things above, what pertains to the city of God.
