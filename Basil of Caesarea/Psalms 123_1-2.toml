“Behold the eyes of the Lord are on them that fear him.” Elsewhere, it says, “The eyes of the Lord are on the just,” but here, “on those that fear him.” When we look upon the Lord and our eyes are on him, so that we say, “Behold as the eyes of the servants are on the hands of their masters, so are our eyes unto the Lord our God,” then, we, as it were, draw the he eye of the Lord to watch over us.
