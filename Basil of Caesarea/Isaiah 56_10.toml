In souls, pure and cleansed from all defilement, the prophetic gift shines clear. In a foul mirror you cannot see what the reflection is, neither can a soul preoccupied with cares of this life and darkened with the passions of the lust of the flesh receive the rays of the Holy Spirit. Every dream is not a prophecy, as Zechariah says, “The Lord shall make bright clouds and give them showers of rain … for the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have spoken false dreams.” Those who, as Isaiah says, “dream and love to sleep in their bed” forget that an instigation of error is sent to “the children of disobedience.”
