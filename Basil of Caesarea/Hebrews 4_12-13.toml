And Scripture calls by the name of “sword” the Word which has the power of trying and of discerning thoughts and which “extends even to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow.” … Every soul at the time of the passion was subjected to a sort of test, as it were, according to the words of the Lord, who said, “You will all fall away because of me.” Simeon prophesies concerning Mary that, standing beside the cross and looking at what was happening and hearing his words51—even after the testimony of Gabriel, after the secret knowledge of her divine conception, after the great showing of miracles—“Even you will flee,” he says, “a certain perplexity about your soul.” For the Lord must taste of death for the sake of all, and, being made a propitiation for the world, he must justify all people in his blood. Therefore, some doubt will touch even you yourself who have been taught from above concerning the Lord. That is the sword. “That the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed,” meaning that, after the scandal which happened at the cross of Christ to both the disciples and to Mary herself, some swift healing will follow from the Lord, confirming their hearts in their faith in him. Thus we see that even Peter, after having stumbled, clung more firmly to his faith in Christ. What was human, therefore, was proved unsound in order that the power of the Lord might be manifested.
