Since no one has the capacity to receive all spiritual gifts, but the grace of the Spirit is given proportionately to the faith of each, when one is living in community with others, the grace privately bestowed on each individual becomes the common possession of the others.â€¦ One who receives any of these gifts does not possess it for his own sake but rather for the sake of others.
