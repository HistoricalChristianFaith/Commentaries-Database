We know two psalms with the title “For Idithun,” the sixty-first and the thirty-eighth. We think that the composition of the work is owed to David; that was given to Idithun for his use that he might correct the passions of his soul and also as a choral song to be sung in the presence of the people. Through it, also, God was glorified, and those who heard it amended their habits. Now, Idithun was a singer in the temple, as the history of the Paralipomenon testifies to us, saying, “And after them Heman and Idithun sounded the trumpets and played on the cymbals and all kinds of musical instruments to sing praises to God.” And a little later it says, “Moreover David the king and the chief officers of the army separated for the ministry the sons of Asaph, and of Heman and of Idithun: to prophesy with harps, and with psalteries and with tympana.”
