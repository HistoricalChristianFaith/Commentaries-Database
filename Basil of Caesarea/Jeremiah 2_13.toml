Is he not one who bewitches the sheep of our patriarch, that they may not drink from the pure water that springs up unto life everlasting but may draw down on themselves the saying of the prophet: “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dug for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water”? Because they should confess that the Father is God, the Son is God and the Holy Spirit is God, as the divine Word teaches and as they who have pondered it more deeply have taught.

“He has opened a pit and dug it.” We do not find the name of “pit” ever assigned in the divine Scriptures to something good or a “well” of water to something bad. That into which Joseph was thrown by his brothers is a pit. There is a slaughter “from the firstborn of Pharaoh to the firstborn of the captive woman that was in prison.” In the Psalms, “I am counted among those who go down to the pit.” In Jeremiah it is said, “They have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and have dug to themselves cisterns, broken cisterns that can hold no water.”
