[Solomon] leads toward understanding especially when he says, “Possessions are of no advantage in the day of wrath.” For he infused your heart with the knowledge that an abundance of money will be of no help to you in that day, nor will it remove eternal punishment. And when he says, “The innocent will inherit the earth,” he clearly means the earth of which the meek are also heirs, for first the psalmist said, “But the meek will inherit the earth,” and then the Lord, when preaching about beatitude, said, “Blessed are the meek, for they will possess the earth.”
