Benefactions to the needy, financed by unjust gains, are not acceptable with God. Even one who refrains from committing injustices, and yet does not share the goods he possesses with anyone, is not deserving of praise.â€¦ If you will make an offering to God from the fruits of injustice and rapine, it would be better not to possess such wealth and not to make an offering.
