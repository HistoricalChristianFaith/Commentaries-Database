Consider the following words also: “In our image.” What do you say to this? Surely, the image of God and of the angels is not the same. Now it is absolutely necessary for the form of the Son and of the Father to be the same, the form being understood, of course, as becomes the divine, not in a bodily shape, but in the special properties of the Godhead…. To whom does he say: “In our image”? To whom else, I say, than to the “brightness of his glory and the image of his substance,” who is “the image of the invisible God”? Homilies on the Hexameron
