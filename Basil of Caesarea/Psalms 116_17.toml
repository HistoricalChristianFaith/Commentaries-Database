It is for this raisin that to you I will sacrifice [Ps 115.8] neither quadrupeds with the hoof dividd who chew the cud, nor clan birds, nor fine flour mid with oil, nor pure frankincense, nor the incense of the mixture. For this are offers to you, Lord, from the earth. Instead I will offer that which is my very own personal possession and the offspring of my heart, namely, I will glorify you from my very own mind, as if from an altar. And I will sacrifice to you a sacrifice of praise [Ps 115.8], which is more precious to you than innumerable whole burnt offerings. For you, God, are self-sufficient and perfect. You do not demand the sacrifice of material goods, of which the affluent have more than their fair share; you demand instead confession from a good disposition and true heart which is something that all can share in equally if they wish to do so. - "On Psalm 115. Chapter 5."
