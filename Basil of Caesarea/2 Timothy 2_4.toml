Where is Christ, the King? In heaven, to be sure. In this direction it behooves you, soldier of Christ, to direct your course. Forget all earthly delights. A soldier does not build a house. He does not aspire to the possession of lands. He does not concern himself with devious, coin-purveying trade.â€¦ The soldier enjoys a sustenance provided by the king. He need not furnish his own nor vex himself in this regard.
