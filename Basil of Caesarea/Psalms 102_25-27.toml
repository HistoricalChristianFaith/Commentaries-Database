For this very reason, a certain one of the interpreters seems to me to have handed over beautifully and accurately the same thought58 through another title, saying, “For the lilies,” in place of, “For them that shall be changed.” He thought that it was appropriate to compare the transitoriness of human nature with the early death of flowers. But, since this word has been inflected in the future tense (it is said: “For them that shall be changed,” as if at some time later this change will be shown to us), let us consider whether there is suggested to us the doctrine of the resurrection, in which a change will be granted to us, but a change for something better and something spiritual. “What is sown in corruption,” he says, “rises in incorruption.” Do you see the change? “What is sown in weakness rises in power; what is sown a natural body rises a spiritual body,” when every corporeal creature will change together with us. Also, “The heavens shall grow old like a garment, and as a robe” God “shall change them, and they shall be changed.” Then, according to Isaiah, “The sun will be sevenfold, and the moon like the present size of the sun.”
