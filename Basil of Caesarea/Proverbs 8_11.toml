“Accept discipline, not silver,” so that at a time of calamity or physical illness or domestic trouble, you would think nothing at all perverse of God, but accept the blows meted out by him with great patience as though you were being castigated for your sins. Thus, conscious of being disciplined, say, “I will bear the wrath of the Lord because I have sinned against him.”
