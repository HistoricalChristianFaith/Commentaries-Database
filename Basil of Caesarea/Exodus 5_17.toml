Even Pharaoh knew that it was proper for one to seek God when he was unoccupied, and for this reason he reproached Israel: “You are unoccupied, you are idle, and you say, ‘We shall offer prayers to the Lord, our God.’ ” Now leisure itself is good and useful to him who is unoccupied, since it produces quiet for the acquisition of salutary doctrines. But the leisure of the Athenians was evil, “who used to spend all their leisure telling or listening to something new.” Even at the present time some imitate this, misusing the leisure of life for the discovery of some newer teaching.
