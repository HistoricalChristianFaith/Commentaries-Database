This we must also keep in mind—that he who labors ought to perform his task not for the purpose of ministering to his own needs but that he may accomplish the Lord’s command, “I was hungry and you gave me to eat,” and so on. To be concerned for oneself is strictly forbidden by the Lord in the words, “Be not concerned for your life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you shall put on,” and he adds, “for the heathens seek after all these things.” Everyone, therefore, in doing his work, should place before himself the aim of service to the needy and not his own satisfaction. Thus, he will escape the charge of self-love and receive the blessing for fraternal charity from the Lord, who said, “As long as you did it to one of these, the least of my brothers, you did it to me.” Nor should anyone think that the apostle is at variance with our rule when he says, “that working they would eat their own bread.” This is addressed to the unruly and indolent, and means that it is better for each person to minister to himself at least and not be a burden to others than to live in idleness.
