Whoever would truly be a follower of God must break the bonds of attachment to this life. This is done through complete separation from and forgetfulness of old habits. It is impossible for us to achieve our goal of pleasing God unless we snatch ourselves away from fleshly ties and worldly society. We are then transported to another world in our manner of living. The apostle said, “But our citizenship is in heaven.” The Lord specifically said, “Likewise every one of you that does not renounce all that he possesses cannot be my disciple.”
