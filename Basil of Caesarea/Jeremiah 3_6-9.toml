In addition to these things, “when people fall, do they not rise again? If one turns away, does he not return?” Why, then, is the virgin “turned away with a stubborn revolting,” even though she heard Christ, her spouse, saying through Jeremiah, “And when she had committed all these fornications, I said, ‘Return to me, and she did not return’?” “Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why then has the health of the daughter of my people not been restored?” Indeed, many safeguards against evil would you find in the divine Scripture and many remedies which from destruction bring salvation—the mysteries of death and resurrection, the words of the terrible judgment and everlasting punishment, the doctrines of repentance and the forgiveness of sin, those innumerable examples of conversion, the drachma, the sheep, the son who spent his livelihood with harlots, was lost and found, was dead and alive again. Let us use these safeguards against evil. Through them, let us heal our soul.
