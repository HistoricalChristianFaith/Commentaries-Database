If we count, we do not add, increasing from one to many. We do not say, “one, two, three,” or “first, second, and third.” God says, “I am the first, and I am the last.” We have never to this present day heard of two gods.… How does one and one not equal two gods? Because we speak of the emperor and the emperor’s image—but not two emperors.… The image of the emperor is an image by imitation, but the Son is a natural image.
