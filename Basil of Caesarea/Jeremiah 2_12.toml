Not only Paul, but generally all those to whom is committed any ministry of the word, never cease from testifying but call heaven and earth to witness on the ground that now every deed that is done is done within them, and that in the examination of all the actions of life they will be present with the judged. So it is said, “He shall call to the heavens above and to the earth, that he may judge his people.” And so Moses when about to deliver his oracles to the people says, “I call heaven and earth to witness this day,” and again in his song he says, “Give ear, O heavens, and I will speak. Hear, O earth, the words of my mouth.” Isaiah invokes: “Hear, O heavens. Listen, O earth.” Jeremiah describes astonishment in heaven at the tidings of the unholy deeds of the people: “The heaven was astonished at this and was horribly afraid, because my people committed two evils.” - "On the Spirit 13.30"
