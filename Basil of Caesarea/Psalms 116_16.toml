But now I am returning and running back to my original Lord, and I acknowledge my enslavement of old. You have broken through my bonds [Ps 115.7]. You freed me from the bonds of sin by descending into hell and releasing humanity when it was in the bonds of death and detained in the inescapable prisons of hell. - "On Psalm 115. Chapter 5."
