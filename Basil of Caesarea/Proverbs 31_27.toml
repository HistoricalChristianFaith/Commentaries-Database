Why should we dwell upon the amount of evil there is in idleness, when the apostle clearly prescribes that he who does not work should not eat? As daily sustenance is necessary for everyone, so labor in proportion to one’s strength is also essential. Not vainly has Solomon written in praise: “and she has not eaten her bread idle.”
