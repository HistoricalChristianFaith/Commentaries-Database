We attribute to God, as it were, every state that corresponds to our circumstances. For this reason, when we are half asleep and behaving slothfully, God, since he judges us unworthy of his observant watchfulness over us, is said to be asleep. But, when, after noticing at some time the harm that comes from his sleeping, we shall say, “Arise, why do you sleep, O Lord?” “Behold, he shall neither slumber nor sleep at that time, that keeps Israel.” Some others, as it were, turn their eyes away from God because of their shameful deeds and their acts unworthy of the eyes of God. These, on repenting, say, “Why do you turn your face away?” Besides these, there are others who have cast out the memory of God and, as it were, are producing in him forgetfulness of themselves, and these say, “Why do you forget our want and our trouble?” In a word, people do the very things that are humanly spoken about God, making God behave in ways appropriate to the manner in which they have been made. Therefore, “I will extol you, O Lord, for you have upheld me; and you have not made my enemies to rejoice over me.” And I will suffer nothing low or abject in my life.
