And so he will deserve to fulfill, likewise, those other words that have a bearing in this connection: “buried together with him by baptism unto death.” For what purpose? “That as Christ is risen from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in newness of life.” He who is dead must be buried, and he who is buried in the likeness of death must rise again by the grace of God in Christ. No longer, because of sin, should he bear about in the inner man a countenance like a blackened kettle, but, after his sins have been made manifest by fire and pardon has been granted through the blood of Christ, he should shine forth in newness of life, by the justifications of Christ, more precious than any jewel.
