Remember the calf in Exodus, which they fashioned through idolatry, which Moses beat to powder and gave to the people to drink. In a manner similar to that calf, he will utterly destroy all Lebanon3 and the practice of idolatry prevailing in it. “And as the beloved son of unicorns.” The only-begotten Son, he who gives his life for the world whenever he offers himself as a sacrifice and oblation to God for our sins, is called both Lamb of God and a sheep. “Behold,” it is said, “the lamb of God.” And again, “He was led like a sheep to slaughter.” But, when it is necessary to take vengeance and to overthrow the power attacking the human race, a certain wild and savage force, then he will be called the Son of unicorns. For, as we have learned in Job, the unicorn is a creature irresistible in might and unsubjected to human beings. “For you cannot bind him with a thong,” he says, “nor will he stay at your crib.” There is also much said in that part of the prophecy about the animal acting like a free person and not submitting to humans. It has been observed that the Scripture has used the comparison of the unicorn in both ways, at one time in praise, at another in censure. “Deliver,” he says, “my soul from the sword … and my lowness from the horns of the unicorns.” He said these words complaining of the warlike people who in the time of passion rose up in rebellion against him. Again, he says, “My horn shall be exalted like that of the unicorn.” It seems that on account of the promptness of the animal in repelling attacks it is frequently found representing the baser things, and because of its high horn and freedom it is assigned to represent the better. On the whole, since it is possible to find the “horn” used by Scripture in many places instead of “glory,” as the saying, “He will exalt the horn of his people,” and “His horn shall be exalted in glory,” or also, since the “horn” is frequently used instead of “power,” as the saying, “My protector and the horn of my salvation,” Christ is the power of God; therefore, he is called the Unicorn on the ground that he has one horn, that is, one common power with the Father.
