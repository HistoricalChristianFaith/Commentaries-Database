If someone says the Father deserves a higher place and the only-begotten Son deserves to sit in a lower place, he will find himself imagining that all the resulting conditions of the body attach to this creature of his imagination. These are the deliriums of drunken delusion that stretch the limits of insanity. The Lord taught that “he who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father.” Therefore, how can anyone consider himself a follower of true religion if he refuses to worship and glorify with the Father him who in nature, in glory and in dignity is joined with the Father? What can we say? What just defense will we have in the day of the awful universal judgment of all creation? The Lord has clearly announced that he will come “in the glory of his Father.” Stephen saw Jesus standing at the right hand of the Father. Paul testified in the Spirit concerning Christ “that he is at the right hand of God.” The Father says, “Sit at my right hand.” The Holy Spirit attests that he has sat down at “the right hand of the majesty” of God. Shall we attempt to degrade him from his condition of equality to a lower state when he shares the honor and the throne with the Father? The fact that he sits as opposed to standing suggests, I believe, a nature that is fixed and absolutely stable, as Baruch also said when he wanted to exhibit God’s immutability and immobility: “You sit forever while we are forever perishing.” Moreover, the place at the right hand indicates, in my judgment, equality of honor. - "On the Holy Spirit 6.15"
