So that we may know clearly what is meant by not having a share in the works which do not bear fruit, let us first inquire as to what sort of actions merit the attribute unfruitful—whether those only that are forbidden or such also are commendable but are not performed in good dispositions. In the Old Testament, the prophet, comparing the saints with the tree, says, “which shall bring forth its fruit in due season.” Solomon declares, “The work of the just is unto life, but the fruit of the wicked is sin”; and Hosea, “Sow for yourselves in justice, reap the fruit of life.”
