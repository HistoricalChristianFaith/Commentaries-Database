To name Christ is to confess the whole, for it is to point to God [The Father] who has anointed the Son; and to the Son who has been anointed, and to the unction itself, which is The Spirit. This accords with Peter’s teaching in Acts: ‘God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit [Acts 10.38] and with the teaching of Isaiah: ‘The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me’ (Isaiah 61.1). The Psalmist simply says, ‘Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness’ (Ps 45.7). - "On The Holy Spirit, 12"

Do not be misled because the apostle frequently omits the names of the Father and the Holy Spirit when he speaks of baptism. Do not imagine because of this that the invocation of their names has been omitted. St. Paul says, “As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ” and … “all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death.” To address Christ in this way is a complete profession of faith, because it clearly reveals that God anoints the Son (the anointed One) with the unction of the Spirit. We can learn this from Peter’s words in Acts, “God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit,” or from Isaiah, “The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me, because the Lord has anointed me,” or from the Psalms, “Therefore God, your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows.” But the Scripture also speaks of baptism in the context of the Spirit alone, for example, “For by one Spirit we are all baptized into one body.” There are other passages that agree with this: “You shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit,” and “He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.” No one would claim that on the basis of these passages the invocation of the Spirit’s name alone makes baptism complete and perfect.
