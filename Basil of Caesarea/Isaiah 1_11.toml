How do you hope to find any redemption for your souls through sacrifices that are offered in quantity but with no repentance worth mentioning? For God is merciful not through the blood of animals or through slaughter on the altar but upon the contrite heart. For “the sacrifice to God is a contrite heart.”It is fitting for the same to be said to those who are lavish in their expiations but do not repent through their deeds.… Scripture says, “What is the multitude of your sacrifices to me?” So it dismisses the multitude and seeks after the single sacrifice.

Observe that God does not say that he does not wish for any blood, but for this particular blood from these particular animals. For he would not say that he does not wish for the blood that was poured out “in the last times for the annulment of sins,” “which speaks more effectively than that of Abel,” but he changes the sacrifices to the spiritual plane, since “the change of priesthood” is about to happen. For if he rejects the physical sacrifices, he manifestly rejects the high priest according to the law.… They of the stock of Aaron are cast out, therefore, so that he [Christ] according to the order of Melchizedek might enter instead. The “continuous sacrifices” are no more, no more the sacrifices of the Day of Atonement, no more “the ashes of the heifer which purify those that partake.” For the sacrifice is one, the Christ, and the mortification of the saints according to him; the sprinkling is one, the bath of regeneration;14 the absolution of sins is one—the blood poured out for the salvation of the world. Because of this God renounces the former things, so that he may establish the latter.
