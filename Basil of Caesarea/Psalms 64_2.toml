What, really, does our spiritual father intend to teach? “I will teach you the fear of the Lord.” When he ordered us above to fear the Lord, he also showed the profit that comes from fear, saying, “Those who fear him do not lack anything.” At present also, they hand down to us a certain teaching of divine fear. Now it is in the power of every one, even of the private individual, to say that it is necessary to be healthy; but, to say how health must be obtained, that certainly belongs to him who understands the art of medicine. Every fear is not a good and saving feeling, but there is also a hostile fear, which the prophet prays may not spring up in his soul, when he says, “Deliver my soul from the fear of the enemy.” Fear of the enemy is that which produces in us a cowardliness with regard to death and misleads us to cower before distinguished persons. How, in fact, will he who fears these things be able in time of martyrdom to resist sin even to death and to pay his debt to the Lord, who died and rose again for us? He also, who is easily scared by the demons, has the fear of the enemy in him. On the whole, such a fear seems to be a passion born of unbelief. For no one who believes that he has at hand a strong helper is frightened by any of those who attempt to throw him into confusion.
