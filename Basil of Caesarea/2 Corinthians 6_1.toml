That man, indeed, is in danger who does not throughout his whole life place before himself the will of God as his goal, so that in health he shows forth the labor of love by his zeal for the works of the Lord and in sickness displays endurance and cheerful patience. The first and greatest peril is that by not doing the will of God, he separates himself from the Lord and cuts himself off from fellowship with his own brothers; secondly, that he ventures, although undeserving, to claim a share in the blessings prepared for those who are worthy. Here also we must remember the words of the apostle: “And we helping do exhort you that you receive not the grace of God in vain.” And they who are called to be brothers of the Lord should not receive in a wanton spirit so great a divine grace nor fall from so high a dignity through negligence in doing the will of God but rather obey the same apostle, saying: “I, a prisoner in the Lord, beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation in which you are called.”4.
