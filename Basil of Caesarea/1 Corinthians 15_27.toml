He makes your subjection his own, and because of your struggle against virtue, he calls himself subjected… He calls himself naked, if any of you are naked… When one is in prison, he said that he himself was the one imprisoned. For he himself took up our infirmities and bore the burden of our ills. And one of our infirmities is insubordination, and this he also bore. Therefore, even the adversities which happen to us the Lord makes his own, taking upon himself our sufferings because of his fellowship with us. An Apology to the Caesareans, Letter
