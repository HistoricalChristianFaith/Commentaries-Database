He says not, 'doing,' as if by chance, but so doing. For not only conquest is honorable, but to contend lawfully, which is to perform each thing as we have been commanded.
The body indeed is not divided, so that one part indeed should be exposed to torments, the other escape. For this is a fable, nor isit a part of just judgment when the whole has offended that half only should suffer punishment; nor is the soul cut in sunder, seeing that the whole possesses a guilty consciousness, and cooperates with the body to work evil; but its division is the eternal severing of the soul from the Spirit. For now although the grace of the Spirit is not in the unworthy, yet it seems ever to be at hand expecting their turning to salvation, but at that time it will be altogether cut off from the soul. The Holy Spirit then is the prize of the just, and the chief condemnation of sinners, since they who are unworthy will lose Him.

When I consult the New Testament, I find that our Lord Jesus Christ does not absolve from punishment even sins committed in ignorance, although he attaches a harsher threat to deliberate sins. “And that servant who knew his master’s will but did not make ready or act according to his will shall receive a severe beating. But he who did not know and did what deserved a beating shall receive a light beating.” I hear something like this from the lips of the onlybegotten Son of God and consider the anger of the holy apostles against sinners. I observe that the sufferings of those who have transgressed in even one particular are not less serious but rather more serious than those cited from the Old Testament. I then comprehend the severity of the judgment. Our Lord says, “To whomever much is given, much will be required of him.” .
