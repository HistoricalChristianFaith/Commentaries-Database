But, before I take up the matter itself of the profession of faith, the following warning should be given: It is impossible to express in one word or one concept, or to grasp with the mind at all, the majesty and glory of God, which is unutterable and incomprehensible, and the Holy Scripture, although for the most part employing words in current use, speaks obscurely 'as through a glass (1 Cor 13.12),â€™ even to the clean of heart. They have been promised to those who are accounted worthy in the life to come. But now, even if a man be a Paul or a Peter, even though he truly sees what he sees and is not misled nor deceived by his imagination, yet he sees through a glass and in a dark manner, and he looks forward with great joy to perfect knowledge in the future of that which he receives now in part with thanksgiving. - "Homily on Faith"
