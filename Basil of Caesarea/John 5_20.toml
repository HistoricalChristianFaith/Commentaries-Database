Let us rather, in a sense befitting the Godhead, perceive a transmission of will, like the reflection of an object in a mirror, passing without note of time from Father to Son. “For the Father loves the Son and shows him all things,” so that “all things that the Father has” belong to the Son, not gradually accruing to him little by little, but are rather with him all together and at once.

He says that “the Son can do nothing of his own accord.” Where is the source of his perfect wisdom? “The Father … has himself given me his command of what to say and what to speak.” Through all these words he guides us to the knowledge of the Father; he directs our amazement at everything he has made so that we may know the Father through him. The work of the Father is not separate or distinct from the work of the Son. Whatever the Son “sees the Father doing … that the Son does likewise.” The Father enjoys our awe at everything which proceeds from the glory of the Only Begotten. He rejoices both in his Son who accomplishes such deeds and in the deeds themselves, and he exults in being known as the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, “for whom and through whom all things exist.”
