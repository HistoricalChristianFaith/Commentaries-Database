Thus, then, the Lord knew how to bring to nothing the counsels of nations. We learned in the time of Ahithophel how he cast away the counsels of the princes, when David prayed, saying, “Infatuate the counsel of Ahithophel.” Therefore, when you hear someone making great threats and announcing that he will bring upon you all sorts of ill treatment, losses, blows or death, look up to the Lord who brings to nothing the counsels of nations and rejects the devices of the people.
