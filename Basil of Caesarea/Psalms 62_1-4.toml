“For he is my God and my savior; he is my protector, I shall be moved no more.” The Son, who is from God, is our God. He is also Savior of the human race, who supports our weakness, who corrects the disturbance that springs up in our souls from temptations. “I shall be moved no more.” Humanly he confesses his disturbance. “More.” For it is impossible that there should not be some disturbance from temptations in the human soul. While we are committing small and few sins, we are in a way mildly disturbed, being tossed about like the leaves by a gentle breeze; but, when our vices are more and greater, in proportion to the increase of our sins the disturbance is apt to be intensified.

“How long do you rush in upon a person? You all kill, as if you were tearing down a leaning wall and a tottering fence.” Again the homily speaks out against the depraved ministers of the devil, charging them with a lack of moderation in the snares they lay. Certainly, people are weak animals; but you rush on, not content with the first attack, but you attack a second and a third time, until you subdue the soul that has fallen beside you to such an extent that it is very similar to a leaning wall and a tottering fence. Now, a wall, as long as it maintains an upright position, remains steadfast; but, when it leans, since it has been weakened, it is destined to fall. For if heavy bodies are joined together, they stand erect after leaning, but those which are composed of several parts no longer stand erect when pressure has been put on one part of them. The homily shows, therefore, that the nature of humankind, which is composite, was not susceptible to plots for a second fall. “You are God’s tillage, God’s building,” it is said. The enemy has shattered this building; the Craftsman has repaired the rents made in it. Thus the fall was necessary because of sin, but the resurrection was great because it brings immortality.

“But they have thought to cast away my price; they ran in thirst: they blessed with their mouth but cursed with their heart.” The price of [humanity’s redemption] is the blood of Christ: “You have been bought,” it is said, “with a price; do not become the slaves of people.” The soldiers of Satan planned, therefore, to make this price useless to us, leading again into slavery those who had once been freed. “They ran in thirst.” He is speaking of the eager plots of the demons, because they run against us, thirsting for our destruction. “They blessed with their mouth but cursed with their heart.” There are many who approve evil deeds and say that the witty person is charming; the foulmouthed, statesmanlike; the bitter and irascible they name as one not to be despised; the miserly and selfish they praise as thrifty; the spendthrift, as bountiful; the fornicator and lewd, as one devoted to enjoyment and ease; and, in general, they gloss over every evil with the name of the proximate virtue. Such people bless with their mouth but curse with their heart. For by the auspiciousness of the words, they bring every curse on their life, making themselves liable to condemnation on the day of judgment because of those things that they approved.
