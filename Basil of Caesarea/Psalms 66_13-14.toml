If you require evidence from the Old Testament also in order for me to convince you that the judgment of God occurs in this way [as I have presented it], Moses says, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your mind and with all your strength,” and “You shall love your neighbor as yourself.” To this the Lord adds, “On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets.” The apostle also bears witness in the words: “Love, therefore, is the fulfilling of the law.” Moreover, they who do not observe these commands and do not perform the acts of justification that derive from them are liable to punishment, as Moses declares in the words “Cursed is every one who does not abide in all that is written in this book.” And David says, “If I have contemplated iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.” In another place, also, he says, “There have they trembled for fear where there was no fear; for God has scattered the bones of those who attacked you.” There is need, then, of great diligence and of ceaseless care, lest, perhaps, in carrying out the commandment improperly as regards any of the details we have discussed, we may not only lose a reward so great and so blessed but also become the objects of threats so terrible.
