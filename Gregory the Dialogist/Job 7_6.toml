“My days pass more swiftly than the weaving of cloth by the weaver.” In a very suitable image, the time of the flesh is compared with a cloth web. As the web advances thread by thread, so this mortal life passes day by day; in proportion as the web increases, so it advances to its completion. Just as we said before, while the time in our hands passes, the time before us is shortened. Moreover, of the whole length of our lives, the days to come are proportionally fewer to those days that have gone by. - "Morals on the Book of Job 8.26"

26.  By a very suitable image the time of the flesh is compared to a web.  For as the web advances by threads, so this mortal life by the several days; but in proportion as it grows to its bigness, it is advancing to its cutting off.  For as we have also said above, whilst the time in our hands passes, the time before us is shortened.  And of the whole space of our lives those portions are rendered fewer that are to come, in proportion as those are many in number that have gone by.  For a web, being fastened above and below, is bound to two pieces of wood that it may be woven; but in proportion as below the part woven is rolled up, so above the part that remains to be woven is being unwound, and by the same act, by which it augments itself in growth, that is rendered less which remains.  Just so with the periods of our life, we as it were roll up below those that are past, and unwind at top those that are to come, in that in the same proportion that the past become more, the future have begun to diminish.  But because not even does a web suffice for the setting forth of our span of time, for the rapid course of our life surpasses the speed and quickness even of that too, it is well said in this place, My days are past away more swiftly than a web is cut off by the weaver.  For to the web there is a delay of growth, but to the present life there is no delay of coming to an end.  For in the one when the hand of the workman is stopped, the end of the arrival is deferred, but in this latter, because we consume without end time ending every instant, even while resting we are brought to the end of our way, and along the course of our passage, we go on even in sleeping.  Therefore the Elect, seeing that the moments of the present life run past at speed, never in this journey of most rapid motion fix the purpose of their hearts.  And hence it is well added upon that,
And are spent without any hope.
27.  The minds of lost sinners are bound fast with such love for the days of their present life, that they long to live for ever here in the same way.  So that, if it were possible, they desire never to have the course of their life brought to an end.  For they are too indifferent to take account of the future, they place all their hope in transitory things, they aim to have nothing but such objects as pass away.  And while they think too much of transitory things, and never look forward to those that shall remain, the eye of their heart is so closed in insensible blindness, that it is never fixed on the interior light.  Whence it often happens, that distress already shakes the frame, and approaching death cuts off the power of the breath of life, yet they never cease to mind the things that are of the world.  And already the avenger is dragging them to judgment, and yet they themselves, occupied with the concerns of time, in the busy management of them, are only thinking how they may still live on in this world.  In the act of leaving every thing, they dispose of all as if they were entering upon the possession of them, in that the hope of living is not broken, at the very moment when life is at an end.  They are already being forced to judgment in feeling [per sentemtiam], yet they still cleave to the hold of their goods in solicitude.  For by the hardened soul death is still believed to be far off, even when his touch is felt.  And the soul is so separated from the flesh, that by keeping itself in excessive love for things present, when it is led to everlasting punishment, it does not know this mere thing, whither it is being led; and in leaving all that it would not love with bounds, it suddenly finds without bounds things that it never anticipated.  But, on the other hand, the mind of the righteous is stretched in intentness after the eternal world, even when the present life goes smoothly along with it.  It enjoys the high health of the flesh, yet the spirit is never hindered by dependence on it.  No atom [articulum] of death as yet breaks forth, still he daily regards it as present to him.  For because life is unceasingly slipping by, the expectation of living is wholly cut short for him.  Therefore it is well said of the passing days, And are spent without hope.  As if it were declared in plain terms; ‘I have not placed confidence of heart in the present life, in that all that is passing I have dismissed from my hopes, treading it under foot.’
