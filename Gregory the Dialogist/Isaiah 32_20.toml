What else is meant by “seed” but the word of preaching? It is as the truth says in the Gospel, “A sower went forth to sow”; and the prophet says, “Blessed are you who sow upon all waters.” What else but the church ought to be understood by the threshing floor? Of this it is said by the voice of the forerunner: “And he will thoroughly purge his floor.” - "Morals on the Book of Job 6.31.9"

By water, peoples are denoted, as it is said by John, “Now the waters are peoples.” By water likewise, not only the tide of peoples drifting away, but also the minds of good men who follow the preachings of faith are denoted, as the prophet says, “Blessed are you who sow upon all waters.” And it is said by the psalmist, “The voice of the Lord is upon the waters.” - "Morals on the Book of Job 19.6"
