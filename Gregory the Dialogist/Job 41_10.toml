38. In which two verses He fully stated both the might of His own power, and the whole weight of the reason. For on account of His power He said, For who can resist My countenance? And on account of the reason He added; Who hath first given to Me, that I should repay him? As if He said, I do not rouse him up as one that is cruel, because I both rescue by My might My Elect from his power, and again, I condemn the reprobate not unjustly, but with good reason. That is, I am both able to rescue marvellously those whom I mercifully elect, and those whom I reject, I do not unjustly abandon. For no one has first given any thing to God, in order that the Divine Grace should follow him. For if we have prevented God by our good works, where is that which the Prophet says; His mercy shall prevent me? [Ps. 59, 10] If we have given any good works, in order to deserve His grace, where is that which the Apostle says, By grace are ye saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, but it is the gift of God, not of works? [Eph. 2, 8] If our love prevented God, where is that which John the Apostle says; Not that we loved God, but that He first loved us? [l John 4, 10] Where is that which the Lord says by Hosea; I will love thee of My own accord? [Hos. 14, 4] If without His gift, by our own strength we follow God, where is that which the Truth protests in the Gospel, saying, Without Me ye can do nothing? [John 15, 5] Where is that which He says; No man can come to Me, except the Father, Which hath sent Me, hath drawn him? [ib. 6, 44] Where is that which He says again; Ye have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you? [ib. 15, 16] If we only prevent the gifts of good works by thinking aright through our own strength, where is that which is again said so salutarily by Paul, that all self-confidence of the human mind might be cut away from the very root of the heart, when he says; Not that we are sufficient to think anything of ourselves as of ourselves, but our sufficiency is of God? [2 Cor. 3, 5] No one therefore prevents God by his merits, so as to be able to hold Him as his debtor. But the All-just Creator has in a wonderful manner both chosen some beforehand, and justly leaves some in their own wicked habits.
39. But yet He does not display to His Elect mercy without justice, because He here weighs them down with hard afflictions. Nor again does He exercise on the reprobate justice without mercy, because He here patiently endures those, whom He condemns hereafter for ever. If therefore both the Elect follow the grace which prevents them, and the reprobate receive according to that which they deserve; both the Elect find something to praise in His mercy, and the reprobate have nothing to blame in His justice. It is, therefore, well said; Who hath first given to Me, that I should repay him? As if it were plainly said; I am not compelled by any reason to spare the reprobate, because I am not bound to them as a debtor by any doings of theirs. For they therefore receive not the eternal rewards of the heavenly country, because now, when they could deserve, they have of their free will despised them. But this very free will is fashioned aright in the Elect, when their mind is raised above earthly desires, by the inspiration of grace.
40. For the good which we do belongs both to God, and to ourselves. It is Godâ€™s by preventing grace, our own by the free will which follows. For if it is not of God, why do we return Him thanks for ever? Again, if it is not our own, why do we hope for rewards to be conferred on us? Because then we do not give thanks undeservedly, we know that we are prevented by His grace. And again, because we do not seek for recompense undeservedly, we know that by the compliance of free will, we have chosen good deeds to perform. It follows; All things that are under heaven are Mine. It is clear to all persons, that not only those things that are under heaven, but that those very things, which from being created above the heavens, are called heavenly, subserve the will of Him by Whom they remember they were created. Why then does He speak only of things below and say,
All things that are under the heaven are Mine?
41. But because He is speaking of Leviathan, who no longer dwells in the abode of the ethereal heaven, He asserts that all things that are under the heaven are His, in order to teach that he also who has fallen from heaven, is subject to His power. As if He said, This Leviathan has lost indeed My blessedness, but he has not escaped My authority: because even those very powers, which oppose Me by their evil doings, are subservient to Me.
