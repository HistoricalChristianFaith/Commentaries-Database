Because people had seen that John the Baptist was endowed with astonishing holiness, they believed … that he was the Christ, as is said in the Gospel. The people were deliberating, all questioning in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ, and they asked him, “Are you the Christ?” If John had not been a valley in his own eyes, he would not have been full of the grace of the Spirit. To make clear what he was, he answered, “There comes after me one who is stronger than I, the strap of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.” Again he said, “He who has the bride is the bridegroom. The friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom’s voice. This joy of mine is now full. He must increase, but I must decrease.”
