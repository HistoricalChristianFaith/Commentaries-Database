In their persons too our Lord condemns all those within the holy Church, who, when brought near to God by sacred Orders, do not seek the recompense of righteousness, but the interests of this present life. To follow our Lord, when filled with bread, is to use Holy Church as a means of livelihood; and to seek our Lord not for the miracleâ€™s sake. but for the loaves, is to aspire to a religious office, not with aview to increase of grace, but to add to our worldly means.
