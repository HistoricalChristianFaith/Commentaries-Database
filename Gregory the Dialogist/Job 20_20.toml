For the ‘belly’ of the wicked man is avarice, in that there is collected together in it whatsoever is swallowed with wrong desire.  But it is plain that avarice is not extinguished, but increased by the objects desired.  For like fire, when it has got fuel to feed on, it increases; and from the same cause that the flame appears to be restrained for a moment, it is seen a little while after to spread itself out.  And it often happens that when Almighty God is greatly wroth with the covetous soul, He first lets all things accrue to it according to its wish, and afterwards takes it away in vengeance, that it may undergo eternal punishments on account of them.  And hence it is added;
And when he shall have that which he desired, he shall not be able to possess it.
24.  For it is a mark of greater indignation, when that thing is given which is desired amiss, and therefrom there ensues sudden retribution, because he got that likewise, which he went after when God was wroth the while.  And hence it is said by the Psalmist, where the people are described as having lusted after flesh for food in a wrong way; But while their meat was yet in their mouths, the wrath of God came upon them, and slew the most of them. [Ps. 78, 30. 31]  For the judgments of God are used to be slower in appearing, when wrong wishes are hindered that they should not be put in execution.  For the quicker that a bad wish is suffered to be fulfilled, it is usually punished the more speedily in proportion.  And so by the very act, whereby the hypocrite is aggrandized in haste to become powerful, it is brought to pass with proportionate rapidity, that he should not be.  For the trees too that grow slower, last to number many years, and those which make way in a short space of time, wither the sooner, and in a manner, whilst they are hasting to be, they are going the way not to be.
