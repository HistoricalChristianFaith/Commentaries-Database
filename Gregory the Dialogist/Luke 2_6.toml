Bethlehem is by interpretation the house of c bread. For itis the Lord Himself who says, I am the bread of life which came down from heaven. The place therefore where the Lord was born was before called the house of bread, because it was there that He was to appear in His fleshly nature who should refresh the souls of the elect with spiritual fullness.
And that Hemight show that on account of the human form which He took upon Him, He was born as in astrange country, not according to His power but according to His nature.
