44.  But there is nothing more happy than simplicity of heart, in that in proportion as it shows forth innocency towards others, there is nothing it dreads to meet with from others.  For it has its simplicity as a kind of citadel of strength, nor is it suspicious of undergoing what it has no remembrance of having itself done.  Whence it is well said by Solomon, In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence.  Who also says again, A secure mind is like a perpetual feast.  For the mere repose of security is like the continuance of refreshment.  Whereas, on the other hand, the evil mind is always set in pains and labours, since it is either contriving mischiefs that it may bring down, or fearing lest these be brought down upon it by others; and whatever plot it hatches against neighbours, it is afraid of being hatched by neighbours against itself.  It is on every side full of suspicions, on every side full of alarms.  Everyone that occurs to mind is supposed to be making out things hostile to him, and so he, to whom the repose of security is wanting, has surely ‘a dreadful sound in his ears’ always.  And it often happens that his neighbour, whoever he be, speaks to him with a single intention, and designs nothing hostile, but ‘when there is peace, he suspecteth plots;’ in that he, who is always dealing craftily, calculates that there is not single dealing towards himself.  And whereas it is written, When the wicked man cometh into the pit of sinners, he contemneth, he being encompassed with the darkness of his iniquity henceforth despairs of light.
