44.  As the ‘famine’ of the flesh is the withdrawal of the support of the body, so the hunger of the soul is the silence of divine revelation.  Hence it is rightly delivered by the Prophet, I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst of water, but a famine of hearing the word of the Lord. [Amos 8, 11]  And forasmuch as when the divine communication leaves the human soul, the temptation of the flesh gains force against it, it is fitly brought in, And in war from the power of the sword.  For we suffer a war, when we are assailed by the temptations of our flesh.  Concerning which same war the Psalmist saith, Cover my head in the day of battle. [Ps. 140, 7]  Therefore, whereas the reprobate, whilst their strength fails from a ‘famine’ of the word of God, are furthermore pierced with ‘the sword of war,’ the Lord both ‘in famine redeems’ His Elect ‘from death,’ and ‘in war’ He hides them ‘from the sword.’  For while He refreshes their souls with the food of His word, He makes them strong to resist the temptations of the body.  Yet there be some, who, though they recruit themselves, out of the store of the word of God, from the famine of the interior, though they be already stayed up against the temptations of the body by the virtue of continency, yet still fear to be stricken with the slanders of their fellow-creatures, and oftentimes, whilst they dread the arrows of the tongue, they strangle themselves with the noose of sin.
