Since the life of the elect is lofty in merits, while the condition of malignant spirits is lowly, what does it mean that there is said to be an ascent by which Jonathan tries to reach the garrison of the Philistines? For concerning these same Philistines as a type of demons, it was said not far above: "Going up, they encamped at Michmash" (1 Kings 13:5). But they are said to be above us insofar as we appear lesser in strength. They are also known to be above us in that which we cannot penetrate through understanding. Therefore, as often as we resolve to contend with reprobate spirits, we must prepare our strength for the ascent, because as men we strive to fight against angels. Hence also that vigorous athlete, powerfully encouraging his fellow soldiers, says: "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places" (Eph. 6:12). For because he had foreknown that he would fight against the spiritual wickedness of principalities and powers, he was certainly preparing the strength of his mind for the ascent to the heights. When wicked spirits subject the hearts of sinners to themselves, they indeed dominate them through manifold vices. If therefore we strive to overcome them there as well, it is very necessary for us to ascend, so that we may be able to powerfully strike their ranks. For the lustful must be saved in one way, the slothful in another; the vainglorious in one way, the proud in another. But in order that the chosen teacher may be equal to all these things, because he raises his mind through the keen counsels of constant meditation, he strengthens himself as if for the ascent to the Philistines.

Well indeed, not one ascent is affirmed, but many ascents are said to exist, because innumerable enemies must be met by many paths. This is done well when fitting and proper remedies are applied to individual vices. For, to touch briefly on some of them, the spirit of fornication is driven away by the virtue of continence; but it is more easily overcome if the flesh diminishes its assault through abstinence, lest, conquered, it submit itself to worldly desire. Gluttony is broken by abstinence; but he who does not fill his mind with spiritual food cannot maintain abstinence from bodily food. For he powerfully weakens the body who inflames his heart with love of heavenly things, because while he strongly loves spiritual things, he forcefully suppresses the desires of the flesh. Against the vice of avarice the good of voluntary poverty is opposed, but he who does not yet know how to love eternal treasures cannot be poor in spirit. Thus indeed anger is conquered if, through love of heavenly things, all earthly things are perfectly despised, because he who does not fear temporal loss no longer has reason to be angry. Thus also the vice of sloth, that is, weariness of heart, is driven away if heavenly goods are always contemplated. Indeed, the mind that joyfully beholds such pleasant goods can in no way grow weary. The distressing evil of sadness is also swallowed up by the broad field of spiritual joy; but that spiritual joy does not pour itself into the mind that does not know how to transcend the distresses of temporal life through contemplation. Sadness is indeed well conquered if the rewards of temporal labors are seen, because from the very thing by which the chosen mind considers itself afflicted temporally, it hopes to rejoice eternally in the heavenly homeland. Because, therefore, the preacher uses a great diversity of counsel for curing the various diseases of souls, and because that same counsel is grasped by deep consideration of the mind, well are the places where Jonathan desired to cross over to the garrison of the Philistines said to be ascents. And because many difficulties stand in the way of driving out evil spirits from the hearts of sinners, rocks are mentioned as being among the ascents. For what is signified by these two rocks, namely Boses and Seneh, except desire and sin? For Boses is said to mean "primacy," and Seneh "sun" or "hearing." Well does the name "primacy" suit desire, because it first occupies the mind before the mind submits itself to sin. By the name "sun" the delight of sin is also rightly figured, because it closes the eyes of the mind from the sight of truth and opens them to vanity. Whence also to the first humans it is said by the seducing spirit through the serpent: "On whatever day you eat from the tree that is in the midst of paradise, your eyes shall be opened" (Genesis 3). In that eating, indeed, the eyes of the transgressors were opened by sinning, so that they perceived the rays of false light in the experience of transgression, and grew dim from the lofty contemplation of heavenly brightness. Indeed, the Psalmist, fleeing from opening his eyes to this light, beseeches the Lord, saying: "Turn away my eyes, lest they see vanity" (Psalm 118:37). Blessed Job, despising this with a lofty mind, longing to be counted among the merits of the perfect, said: "For now I would be sleeping in silence, and I would rest in my sleep; or, like a hidden miscarriage, I would not exist; or like those who, having been conceived, did not see the light" (Job 3:13). Who are these, except those who strongly guarded themselves from sinning? One crag, therefore, is called Boses, the other Seneh, because if desire claims a place for itself in the mind, it lifts the eyes of that same mind toward the pleasing allurement of sin, as if toward seeing the light of the sun. Well also are they called rocks, because these two things attach themselves to the minds of the wicked, so that they no longer easily allow preachers to lead them back to themselves. But they are also called crags, because on this side and that, namely both in mind and body, they maintain the steep habit of wickedness. For while they are made firm by no integrity of character and no integrity of works, they are, in the manner of a crag, steep on every side. And because they are said to be in the shape of teeth, what does this give us to understand except what we often see — that those who despise the exhortations of preachers attempt to bite their lives with slander? But concerning the same crags it is added: (Verse 5) "One jutting out to the north, opposite Michmash, and the other to the south, opposite Gibeah."
