For in holy Scripture a “bed,” a “couch” or “litter” usually represents the heart’s secret depth. Hence, the spouse in the Song of Songs, urged by the piercing darts of holy love, speaks under the likeness of each separate soul: “By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loves.” For “the beloved is sought by night and lying in bed,” much as the appearance of the invisible Creator is found in the chamber of the heart, apart from every image of a bodily appearing. Thus “Truth” says to those same lovers of him, “The kingdom of God is within you.” And again, “If I do not go away, the Comforter will not come.” As if it were in plain words, “If I do not withdraw my body from your gaze, I will not lead you by the Comforter, the Spirit, to the perception of the unseen.” The psalmist also states concerning the just, “The saints shall be joyful in glory, they shall rejoice upon their beds”; for when they flee the mischief of external things, they exult in safety within the recesses of their hearts. But the joy of the heart will then be complete when the fight of the flesh shall have ceased outwardly. It is as if when the wall of the house is shaken, the bed itself is disturbed. This is so as long as the flesh allures.
