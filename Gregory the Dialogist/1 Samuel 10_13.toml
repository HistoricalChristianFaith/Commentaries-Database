29. He comes to a high place after the ministry of prophecy, who raises his mind to the heavenly joys which he preaches, and lifts himself up by loving those things which he displays by speaking. Teachers indeed preach plain things with those of lesser rank; when they are with those whom they teach, they are, as it were, on level ground. And because after the words of preaching they prepare themselves by good works to merit the things they preach, they are said to come to a high place. Those who are certainly sublime in word and deed are not so in thoughts of pride. They always do great things, but never desire to appear great.
