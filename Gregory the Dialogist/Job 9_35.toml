63.  For the holy man, because he beholds the Redeemer of the world coming in meekness, does not assume fear towards a Master, but affection towards a Father.  And he looks down on fear, in that through the grace of adoption he rises up to love.  Hence John says; There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear. [1 John 4, 18]  Hence Zachariah says, That we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve Him without fear. [Luke 1, 74]  Therefore fear had no power to raise us from the death of sin, but the infused grace of meekness erected us to the seat of life.  Which is well denoted by Elisha when he raised the child of the Shunamite. [2 Kings 4]  He, when he sent his servant with a staff, never a whit restored life to the dead child; but upon coming in his own person, and spreading himself upon the dead body, and contracting himself to its limbs, and walking to and fro, and breathing several times into the mouth of the dead body, he forthwith quickened it to the light of new life through the ministering of compassion.  For God, the Creator of mankind, as it were grieved for His dead son, when He beheld us with compassion killed by the sting of iniquity.  And whereas He put forth the terror of the Law by Moses, He as it were sent the rod by the servant.  But the servant could not raise the dead body with the staff; because, as Paul bears witness, The Law made nothing perfect. [Heb. 7, 19]  But when He came in His own Person, and spread Himself in humility upon the dead body, He contracted Himself to match the limbs of the dead body to Himself.  Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God; but made Himself of no reputation, and took upon Him the form of a servant, and was made in the likeness of men; and found in fashion as a man. [Phil. 2, 6—8.]  He ‘walks to and fro’ also, in that He calls Judaea nigh at hand, and the Gentiles afar off.  He breathes upon the dead body several times, in that by the publishing of the Divine gift, He bestows the Spirit of sevenfold grace upon those that lie prostrate in the death of sin.  And afterwards it is raised up alive, in that the child, whom the rod of terror could not raise up, has been brought back to life by the Spirit of love.  Therefore let him say in himself, and in the voice of mankind, Let Him take His rod away from me, and let not His fear terrify me.  Then would I speak, and not fear Him.  Where it is fitly added,
For I cannot respond whilst I fear.
64.  We are said to respond to any one, when we pay back deeds worthy of his doings.  Therefore to ‘respond’ to God, is to render back our services in return for His previous gifts.  And hence it is that certain of the Psalms, in which holy practice is set forth for imitation are prenoted as written ‘to respond.’  Thus God created man upright, and bore with him in long-suffering, when he let himself out to do froward deeds.  Every day He beholds sin, and yet does not quickly cut off the periods of life.  He lavishes His gifts in loving-kindness, and exercises patience towards evildoers.  Man ought to respond to so many benefits, yet ‘he is not able to respond whilst he fears,’ in that everyone that continues to dread with a slavish fear the Creator of mankind, assuredly does not love Him.  For we then only render real services to God, when we have no fear of Him through the confidence of our love, when affection, not fear, directs us to good works, when sin is now no longer pleasing to our mind, even if it were allowed us.  For everyone that is restrained by fear alone from the practice of evil, would gladly do evil things if liberty were given him.  He then is in no whit really righteous, who is still not free from the hankering after evil; and so it is well said, For I cannot respond while I fear.  In that we do not render real service to God, so long as we obey His commandments from fear, and not much rather from love.  But when the love of His sweetness is kindled in our mind, all desire of the present life goes for little, fondness is turned into weariness, and the mind endures with sorrow this same, which she formerly served, under the dominion of an accursed love.
