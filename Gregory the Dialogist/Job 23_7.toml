For who else saving the Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, is denoted by the title of ‘equity?’  Concerning Whom it is written, Who of God is made unto us wisdom and righteousness. [I Cor. 1, 30]  And whereas this same righteousness came into this world against the ways of sinners, we get the better of our old enemy, by whom we were held captive.  So let him say, I would not that He should contend with me with great power, nor oppress me with the weight of His mightiness.  Let Him put forth equity against me, and my judgment shall come unto victory.  i.e. ‘for the rebuking of my ways, let Him send His Incarnate Son, and then the plotting foe, by the sentence of mine absolving, I as victor will turn out.’  For if the Only-begotten Son of God had so remained invisible in the strength of the Divine Nature, as not to have admitted aught derived from our weakness, when could weak men ever have found the access of grace to Him?  For the weight of His greatness, being considered, would rather have oppressed than aided him; but the Strong above all things came weak among all things, that whereas He agreed with us by assumed weakness, He might elevate us to His own abiding strength.  For in Its loftiness the Divine Nature could never have been apprehended by us, inasmuch as being too little, but He bowed Himself down to man through human nature, and we as it were mounted up on Him laid low; He rose, and we were lifted up.  Whence this too is added directly, whereby the Divine Being may be showed invisible and incomprehensible.
