81.  Iniquity is on this account likened to cold, because the mind that sins it binds up with insensibility.  Hence it is written; As a fountain has made her waters cold, so she has made her wickedness cold.  Contrariwise charity is ‘heat,’ in this respect that it fires the soul it fills.  Of which ‘heat’ is written, Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold.  And there are some who while they shun the cold or their wickednesses come to true faith or to the wearing of sanctity, but because they presume on their own faculties for perceiving more than should be, oftentimes in the faith which they receive they are minded to pry curiously into the things that they do not take in, so as to be held fast in God rather by reason than by faith.  But because the mind of man has not power to dive into the mysteries of God; all that they cannot get to the bottom of by reason, they care not to believe, and by overmuch investigation they fall into error.  So these, when they did not as yet believe, or were still busied for works of wickedness, were ‘snow waters;’ but when abandoning carnal deeds, in the faith to which they have been brought they aim to dive deeper than they have capacity for, they are hot beyond what they ought to be.  And so touching this wicked kind of person the sentence of one prophesying only and not wishing the thing is rightly delivered.  Let him pass in overmuch heat from the snow waters.  As if it were said in plain speech; ‘he that is not restrained in humility under the fetters of self-discipline, from his unbelief, or from the coldness of bad practice, through immoderate wisdom falls into error.  Whence too the great Preacher getting quit of this excessive heat of too refined wisdom from the hearts of his disciples saith well, Not to be wise of himself above that he ought to be wise; but to be wise unto sobriety. [Rom. 12, 3]  Lest perchance excessive heat might destroy those, of whom ‘snow waters,’ i.e. unbelief, or the fruits of deadened actions, held possession in the way to die.  And because it is very difficult for him who accounts himself wise to bring down his mind to humility and believe those that preach right things, and reject the view of his own wrong thought.

82.  For sin is ‘brought even to hell,’ which before the end of the present life is not by chastening reformed unto repentance.  Of which same sin it is said by John, There is a sin unto death, I do not say that he shall pray for it.  For ‘a sin unto death’ is a sin even until death in this way, that the pardon of that sin is sought in vain which is not corrected here.
