My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

If we follow the history alone, it appears plain that the skin of the blessed man was blackened by the multitude of ulcers. But according to the mystery of allegory, 'the skin' of Holy Church is understood as her outer appearance. For in the time of persecution the exterior appearance of Holy Church is blackened, because she is seen by persecutors as vile and contemptible. Her 'bones are burned with heat' when those in her who are strongest are afflicted with the burning of tribulation. For as the bones hold together the body, so the strong ones in the Church hold together the weak by their example and preaching.
