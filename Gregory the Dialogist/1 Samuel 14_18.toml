Why does Saul command Ahijah the priest to bring the ark near, unless because they hear the manner of the battle from the scouts? And indeed this is rightly done in a spiritual sense by the chief priests, when they do not judge the things they hear from reporters until they seek their reasoning in the counsel of inward meditation. And, because they often follow the counsels even of another's mind, Ahijah is commanded to bring the ark near. For the priest has the ark who does not have a mind empty of spiritual knowledge. Therefore Saul commands Ahijah to bring the ark near, when the chief teacher seeks counsel from his lesser and learned ones. For counsel is to be sought there where the grace of spiritual knowledge shines forth. Whence it is also added: (Verse 18.) For the ark of God was on that day with the children of Israel.

As if to say: He commanded to apply what he knew to exist. To seek the counsel of religion from the irreligious, or wisdom from fools, is not to receive counsel but to rush headlong. Therefore it is well said: "For the ark of God was there," because in doubtful matters we ought to consult those whom we openly know not to lack spiritual gifts. But there are certain things that are improved through counsel, and certain things that are improved through aid. For where the necessity is open and undoubted, there the delay of counsel is not fitting, but rather the swiftness of assistance. Doubtful and obscure matters we handle better by consulting, but open and known matters we relieve by assisting and hastening.
