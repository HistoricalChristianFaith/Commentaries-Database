"And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and you shall speak my words to them."

In that the Lord says to the prophet, "You shall speak my words to them," what else does He do but place a bridle of restraint upon his mouth, lest he presume to speak outwardly what he has not first heard inwardly? For false prophets spoke their own words and not God's, of whom it is written: "Do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you and deceive you; they speak a vision of their own heart, not from the mouth of the Lord." And again: "I did not speak to them, and they themselves prophesied." From this it must also be gathered that whoever as an expositor in the explanation of sacred Scripture composes something by lying, perhaps to please his hearers, speaks his own words and not the Lord's—if indeed he lies from a desire to please or to seduce. For if one seeking the power in the Lord's words should understand them differently than he through whom they were uttered understood them, even if under another interpretation he seeks the building up of charity, the words he relates are the Lord's, because God speaks to us through all of sacred Scripture for this one purpose alone: that He may draw us to love of Him and of our neighbor.
