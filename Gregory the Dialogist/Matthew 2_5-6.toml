For when questioned by Herod, they specify the place of His birth, which they had learned by the authority of Scripture. And they bring forth the testimony by which Bethlehem is shown to be honored by the birth of a new ruler, so that their very knowledge might become both a testimony of damnation for them and an aid to belief for us. Isaac indeed aptly prefigured them when he blessed his son Jacob; for with eyes grown dim yet prophesying, he did not see his son present before him, to whom he foresaw so many things in the future, because indeed the Jewish people, filled with the spirit of prophecy yet blind, did not recognize in His present coming the One about whom they had foretold so many things concerning the future.
