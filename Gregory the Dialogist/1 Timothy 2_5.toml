For there were two lives, of which we knew one and did not know the other. One indeed is mortal, the other immortal; one of corruption, the other of incorruption; one of death, the other of resurrection. But the Mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus, came, took up the one, and showed forth the other. He endured the one by dying, and showed forth the other by rising again. If therefore He had promised us, who knew only mortal life, the resurrection of the flesh, and yet had not visibly displayed it, who would believe His promises? Therefore, having been made man, He appeared in the flesh, deigned to die by His own will, rose again by His own power, and showed by example what He promised us as a reward.

But Simon Peter came following him and entered the tomb, because the Church of the Gentiles, coming after, both recognized the mediator between God and men, the man Jesus Christ, dead in the flesh, and believed him to be the living God.
