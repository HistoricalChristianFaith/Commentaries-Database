This is the distinction, dearest brothers, that usually exists between the delights of the body and those of the heart: bodily delights, when they are not possessed, kindle in themselves a serious desire, but when possessed and consumed, they immediately turn the one eating them into disgust through satiety. Spiritual delights, on the contrary, when not possessed are treated with disgust, but when possessed they are desired; and the more they are hungered for by the one eating, the more they are also consumed by the one hungering. In the former, the appetite pleases but the experience displeases; in the latter, the appetite is of little account, but the experience pleases more. In the former, appetite generates satiety, and satiety generates disgust; but in the latter, appetite generates satiety, and satiety generates appetite. For spiritual delights increase desire in the mind while they satisfy, because the more their flavor is perceived, the more one recognizes what should be loved more eagerly. And therefore, when not possessed, they cannot be loved, because their flavor is unknown. For who is able to love what he does not know? Hence the Psalmist admonishes us, saying: "Taste and see that the Lord is sweet." As if he were saying openly: You do not know his sweetness if you do not taste it at all. But touch the food of life with the palate of your heart, so that by proving its sweetness you may be able to love it. Man lost these delights when he sinned in paradise; he went outside when he closed his mouth to the food of eternal sweetness. Hence we also, born into the hardship of this pilgrimage, have come here already full of disgust, nor do we know what we ought to desire; and the disease of our disgust increases all the more as the soul distances itself further from eating that sweetness; and it no longer desires internal delights precisely because it has long since lost the habit of consuming them. Therefore we waste away in our disgust, and we are wearied by the long plague of fasting. And because we are unwilling to taste inwardly the sweetness prepared for us, we wretches love our hunger outside. But the heavenly mercy does not abandon those who abandon it.

For he recalls those despised delights to the eyes of our memory, and sets them before us; in his promise he shakes off our torpor, and invites us to repel our disgust. For he says: "A certain man made a great supper, and invited many." Who is this man, except he of whom it is said through the Prophet: "And he is a man, and who has known him?" He made a great supper, because he prepared for us the fullness of inward sweetness. He invited many, but few come, because sometimes those very ones who are subject to him through faith contradict his eternal banquet by living wickedly.

But first it must be asked whether this reading in Matthew is the same one that is described in Luke under the name of a supper. And indeed there are some things that seem to be discordant with each other, because here a dinner is mentioned, there a supper; here the one who entered the wedding feast without proper garments was rejected, there no one who is said to have entered is reported to have been rejected. From this matter it is rightly concluded that both here the present Church is signified by the wedding feast, and there the eternal and final banquet is signified by the supper, because some enter this one who are going to depart, and whoever has once entered that one will no longer go out. But if perhaps anyone contends that this is the same reading, I think it better, with faith preserved, to yield to another's understanding than to serve contentions, since it can perhaps also be suitably understood that Matthew said what Luke was silent about concerning the casting out of him who had not come with a wedding garment. But that it is called a supper by the one and a dinner by the other does not at all oppose our understanding, because since among the ancients dinner was daily at the ninth hour, that same dinner was also called supper.
