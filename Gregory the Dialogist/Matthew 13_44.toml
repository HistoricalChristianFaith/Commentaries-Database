(Hom. in Ev. xi. 1.) Otherwise; The treasure hidden in the field is the desire of heaven; the field in which the treasure is hidden is the discipline of heavenly learning; this, when a man finds, he hides, in order that he may preserve it; for zeal and affections heavenward it is not enough that we protect from evil spirits, if we do not protect from human praises. For in this present life we are in the way which leads to our country, and evil spirits as robbers beset us in our journey. Those therefore who carry their treasure openly, they seek to plunder in the way. When I say this, I do not mean that our neighbours should not see our works, but that in what we do, we should not seek praise from without. The kingdom of heaven is therefore compared to things of earth, that the mind may rise from things familiar to things unknown, and may learn to love the unknown by that which it knows is loved when known. It follows, And for joy thereof he goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that field. He it is that selleth all he hath and buyeth the field, who, renouncing fleshly delights, tramples upon all his worldly desires in his anxiety for the heavenly discipline.

The kingdom of heaven, dearest brothers, is said to be like earthly things so that from those things which the mind knows it may rise to things unknown, that by the example of visible things it may carry itself off to invisible things, and through those things which it has learned by experience, being as it were rubbed together, it may grow warm, so that through knowing how to love what is known, it may learn to love also things unknown. For behold, the kingdom of heaven is compared to a treasure hidden in a field, which when a man finds, he hides, and for joy of it goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. In this matter it should also be noted that the found treasure is hidden so that it may be kept safe, because the pursuit of heavenly desire is not sufficient to guard from malign spirits if one does not hide it from human praises. For in the present life we are as it were on a road by which we journey to our homeland. But malign spirits beset our journey like certain robbers. Therefore he who carries treasure openly on the road desires to be plundered. But I say this not so that our neighbors may not see our good works, since it is written: Let them see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven, but so that through what we do we may not seek praises from without. Let the work be in public in such a way that the intention remains in secret, so that we may both offer an example to our neighbors from our good work, and yet through the intention by which we seek to please God alone, we may always desire secrecy. The treasure is heavenly desire, and the field in which the treasure is hidden is the discipline of heavenly pursuit. This field indeed one purchases by selling all things, who, renouncing the pleasures of the flesh, tramples all his earthly desires through the guardianship of heavenly discipline, so that nothing which the flesh flatters may please him, nothing which kills the carnal life may the spirit dread.
