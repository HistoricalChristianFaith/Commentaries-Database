11.  But herein that seems to be exceedingly hard which is added, So man lieth down, and riseth not.  Wherefore do we so toil and labour, if we are not straining after the recompense of the Resurrection?  And how is it said, and riseth not, when it is written: We shall all rise again, but we shall not all be changed? [1 Cor. 15, 51 Vulg.]  And again, If in this life only we have hope of life in Christ, we are of all men most miserable [ver. 19]: and when ‘Truth’ says by Itself, All that are in the graves shall hear His voice, and shall come forth; they that have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil unto the resurrection of damnation. [John 5, 28. 29.]  But the sentence subjoined points out what distinction there is concealed in the sentence preceding.  For it is added;
Till the heavens be no more they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.
12.  For it is plain that they shall not rise again, that is, till the heavens be no more, in that except the end of the world come, the race of mankind shall not wake to life from the sleep of death.  Not, then, that he shall not rise again at all, but that before the crumbling of the heavens the human race shall not rise again, is what he teaches.  Moreover it is a thing to be marked, why after he had called man dead above, below he designates him not dead, but sleeping, and tells that he shall never rise again from his sleep until the heaven be crumbled in pieces, which is no otherwise than that it is plainly given us to understand, that by the likeness of the tree quickened afresh to life, he designates man a dead sinner, i.e. extinct from the life of righteousness; but when he speaks of the death of the flesh, he preferred to call this not death but sleep, teaching us surely the hope of the Resurrection; in that as a man quickly awakes out of sleep, so shall he rise in a moment at the nod of his Creator from the death of the body.  For the name of death is horribly feared by weak minds, but the title of sleep is not feared.  Hence Paul in charging his disciples saith, But I would not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep, that ye sorrow not as men without hope.  For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which are fallen asleep in Jesus will God bring again with Him. [1 Thess. 4, 13. 14.]  How is it that the great Preacher calls the death of the Lord death, but the death of the servants of the Lord he names not death, but sleep; but that, having regard to the weak hearts of his hearers, he mixes the medicine of his preaching with wonderful art, and Him, Whom they knew to have risen already, he does not doubt to teach them was dead, while those, who had not as yet risen again, that he might teach the hope of the Resurrection, he calls not dead, but sleeping?  For he did not fear to call Him dead Whom his hearers knew to have already risen, and He was afraid to call those dead, whose rising again they scarcely believed.  Thus blessed Job, seeing that he does not doubt of those that are dead in the flesh waking again to life, calls them sleeping rather than dead.
