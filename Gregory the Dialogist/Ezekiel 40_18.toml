But in this matter we must vigilantly observe that the prophet, after he had described the treasury chambers, added: "The pavement round about." And below he added: "The treasury chambers round about the pavement." So that both the treasury chambers appear to be round about the pavement, and the pavement round about the treasury chambers. Indeed the pavement and the treasury chambers are distinguished in such an order that the treasury chambers were laid between the pavement and the pavement between the treasury chambers. This is not without great mystery, brothers, that the pavement is said to be round about the treasury chambers, and the treasury chambers are said to be round about the pavement. For the pavement has treasury chambers round about, because the tongue of teachers daily instructs and guards the life of the hearers. For good teachers keep watch in the words of holy instruction, now with the encouragements of sweetness, now with the harshness of rebuke, so that they may defend the life of their hearers from vices. But those same treasury chambers also have the pavement round about, because often the heart of teachers is also touched by temptations of vices, so that now it is lifted up by the pride of boasting, now it is inflamed by the goads of anger. But when they consider the life of their good hearers and reflect that it has made progress through their exhortations, they are ashamed not to be such as they see others have become through themselves with God as author, and they establish themselves in their mind before they fall completely into fault. For when their own words return to the memory of teachers, they are ashamed not to keep what they say. Hence it is also said through Solomon: "The soul of one who labors labors for himself, because his mouth compelled him." For our mouth compels us to labor, when through what we say we are restrained from vices, because it is too shameful for us to fall by negligence there, from where by preaching we have endeavored to lift others. Therefore the treasury chambers have the pavement round about, because the venerable life of hearers is a great safeguard for teachers. And their own speech becomes a help to them, because they are ashamed not to resist the assaults of vices, who have armed others against vices.

For as long as we live in this life, what else do we do against malignant spirits but stand in battle array? As we have said before, the mind of a teacher is perhaps struck by some pride. But whether lest he himself perish, or lest through his example he drag others to perdition, he vigilantly and swiftly looks around himself, he gnaws at himself in his thoughts; bringing the life of his hearers to memory, he humbles himself, and in whatever ways he is able he acts lest pride rule in his mind, lest it dominate in his work. For it is written: The beginning of all sin is pride. What then will be the fruit of good work before the eyes of God, if it has rotted from the root of pride? Often, as has been said, his mind is tempted by anger; but more quickly he collects himself by looking around at himself, and pressing himself down with the weight of discipline he acts lest the motion of his mind pass into speech, lest it burst forth in voice. And it happens that the anger of a disturbed mind, where it arises through negligence, there being suffocated by judgment it dies. From this it is brought about that from conceived fault the mind brings forth virtue, because even if it was unwilling to guard itself strongly lest it rise to motion, nevertheless it strongly conquered itself in the commotion. Hence it is well said by Solomon: The patient man is better than the strong man, and he who rules his spirit than the conqueror of cities. Rightly, however, the patient man is preferred to the conqueror of cities, because in that action of victory a man is victor over men, but in this gentleness of patience the mind is victor over itself.

If we refer the length of the gates to the place in which the gates had been constructed, according to the length of the gates the pavement was lower, because however much the place of the gates could hold, so much did the pavement which was lower extend. Therefore the length of the pavement from the gates was not dissimilar, but nevertheless the level of the pavement was not equal with the gates. What then does it mean that the pavement was similarly long with the gates, but was not equal, except that the life of the people is far distant from the life of the teachers? Because even if those tending toward the heavenly kingdoms have the same longsuffering of hope, they do not have the same pursuits of living. Let the pavement therefore extend similarly in length, because the hearers retain in themselves the same faith, the same hope, which it is certain the preachers have. But let the pavement lie lower, so that all hearers may recognize that their preachers far excel their own merits. But if we ought to understand the length of the gates as their height, as we said above, since, as was written a little later, one ascended to the gates by steps, the pavement lies as much lower as each gate rises in height. Because the holier the life of the teacher is, the humbler the understanding of the hearer becomes. And he despises himself, while he perceives that the life of his preacher rises to a great height. For he can perhaps imitate some of his good qualities, others he cannot. In those where he prevails, he advances; in those where he least prevails, he grows in humility. And this very thing therefore is for his advancement, which is not imitable for his advancement.

For behold, if we weigh the words and deeds of our preachers that we read, we recognize to what great height the gates have risen. For to say nothing of the display of signs, let us speak of the virtues of their hearts. Certainly Paul, who says he died to the law through the law, because in order that he might believe in Christ, the law itself also proclaimed this to him, inflamed with great ardor of faith, refused to hold the precepts of the law carnally and forbade circumcision to be performed among the Gentiles. And when Peter the apostle wished the custom of the law to still be observed in circumcision, he resisted him to his face, and says that he was reprehensible in this matter. And speaking to disciples, he calls this zeal of his not only a fault, but what is greater, hypocrisy, that is, pretense, saying: "When Peter had come to Antioch, I resisted him to his face, because he was reprehensible." And a little later: "And the other Jews consented to his pretense." But the same first of the apostles, when he was admonishing his disciples about many things and recognized that some were disparaging Paul's writings, says: "Just as our most dear brother Paul wrote to you according to the wisdom given to him, speaking in them about these matters in which there are certain things difficult to understand, which the unlearned and unstable distort, as they do the other scriptures, to their own destruction." Behold, Paul wrote in his Epistles that Peter was reprehensible, and behold, Peter asserts in his Epistles that Paul was to be admired in what he had written. For certainly unless Peter had read Paul's Epistles, he would not have praised them. But if he read them, he found that he himself was called reprehensible there. Therefore the friend of truth praised even that by which he was reproved, and this very thing pleased him, because in those matters he had not pleased in which he had thought otherwise than he ought. And he gave his consent even to his lesser brother, and in that same matter became a follower of his inferior, so that he might also lead the way in this, inasmuch as he who was first in the summit of apostleship would also be first in humility. Consider therefore, most beloved brothers, on what peak of mind he stood who praised those Epistles in which he found himself written as blameworthy. What such great meekness could there have been, what tranquility of spirit, what solidity of mind, and what imperturbability of thought? Behold, he is reproved by his inferior, and he does not disdain to be reproved. He does not recall to memory that he was the first called to the apostolate, not that he received the keys of the heavenly kingdom, not that whatever sins he loosed on earth would be loosed also in heaven, not that he walked on the sea with his feet, not that he raised up paralytics by commanding in the name of Jesus, not that he healed the sick by the shadow of his body, not that he killed liars by a word, not that he raised the dead by prayer. Therefore, lest he should disdain to hear words of rebuke, he drove away from memory, as it were, all the gifts he had received, so that he might firmly hold the one gift of humility. Who of us, I ask, if he had performed even some least sign, would patiently hear words of rebuke when rebuked by a lesser brother? For we have performed no sign, and if anyone perhaps reproves us for our conduct, we immediately swell up, we silently think ourselves to be great, we bring to mind virtues, even those we do not have. But on the contrary, Peter remained humble with his virtues under reproof, but the gate rose up in height. However, we cannot imitate such great meekness; but because we are the pavement, we lie far below.

There are indeed some who understand that it was not Peter the prince of the apostles, but some other person of that name who was rebuked by Paul. If they had read Paul's words more carefully, they would not say this. For Paul, about to say: "When Peter came to Antioch, I withstood him to his face," in order to show which Peter he was speaking of, prefaced at the very beginning of his narrative, saying: "The gospel of the uncircumcision was entrusted to me, just as that of the circumcision was to Peter. For he who worked in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision also worked in me among the Gentiles." It is clear, therefore, which Peter Paul is speaking of, whom he both names an apostle and relates was set over the gospel of the circumcision.

And there were certain ones who said that the second Epistle of Peter, in which the Epistles of Paul are praised, was not his. But if they had been willing to weigh the words of that Epistle, they could have thought far otherwise. For in it is written: "A voice came down to him of this kind from the magnificent glory: This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." And it is added: "And we heard this voice when we were with him on the holy mountain." Let them therefore read the Gospel, and they will immediately recognize that when that voice came from heaven, the Apostle Peter stood on the mountain with the Lord. Therefore he himself wrote this Epistle who heard this voice concerning the Lord on the mountain.

But since we have said a few things about Peter, let us now, if you please, turn to the gentleness of Paul, and let us consider, if we can, how great was the gentleness in the pursuit of longsuffering of him who was of such ardor in the zeal of preaching that he did not spare even the first of the apostles. Let us pass over in silence that he was beaten with rods three times, that he was stoned once, that he was shipwrecked three times, that he was a night and a day in the deep of the sea, that from the Jews five times he received forty lashes minus one. For those evils which are inflicted upon us by open adversaries stir the mind to anger less: what we suffer from our own people usually causes more pain. Hence also through the Psalmist Truth itself speaks against its betrayer, saying: "For if my enemy had cursed me, I would surely have borne it. But you, my close companion and my acquaintance, who together with me took sweet food." Let us consider therefore, if we can, how patient the apostle Paul was among persecutors, how gentle among disciples. Certainly when he came to Corinth, he drew the Corinthians back from the service of idols, made known who the true God was, and preached to them the joys of eternal life. And when he had gathered a great multitude of people in the faith, he endured such poverty there that he labored under the grave necessity of his own sustenance. And he did not accept the bread of earth from the disciples to whom he preached the bread of heaven. He devoted himself to the word for the life of his hearers; he devoted himself to the labor of his hands for the life of his body. From other lands also stipends were sent to him by disciples, so that he might be sufficient to preach to the Corinthians. For he himself speaks afterward to those same Corinthians through his Epistle, saying: "When I was with you and was in need, I was burdensome to no one; for what I lacked, the brethren who came from Macedonia supplied." To which he also prefaced as a great reproach, saying: "I robbed other churches, receiving wages for my ministry to you." Let us consider therefore, if we can, what gentleness this was: to preach the bread of the spirit and not receive the bread of the flesh; to instruct the hearts of hearers concerning eternal riches, and among those same faithful and abundant disciples to labor with hunger; to suffer want among the satisfied, and yet not speak of what he suffered; not to speak of what he suffered, and yet not grieve; to see the hard hearts of his stingy hearers toward him, and not cease from preaching. For as the Acts of the Apostles testify, he preached continuously in that same city for a year and six months. And when he had departed from those same Corinthians, he afterward wrote to them what he had endured while among them. But why did he never say this to them while he lived among them? Evidently so that what had not been done toward him from good will would not be done from command; and when their mercy became known, their intention would remain unknown. But why does he write this afterward when positioned far away? So that the disciples would not remain entirely uncorrected, and so that they would not be the same toward other brethren as they had been toward their teacher in their stinginess. Truly in this Paul, truly the teacher of the Gentiles, neglecting his own concerns, caring for those of others, fulfilled what he had preached: "Let no one seek his own, but that which is another's." And "not each one considering their own things, but those of others." How great therefore is this virtue of gentleness? How great the tranquility of spirit? But who among us, if he had converted one rich man of this world to the service of almighty God, and saw himself in need while that man did not provide him the necessities of life, would not immediately have despaired of his life? Who would not say he had labored in vain? Who would not fall silent from exhorting him whom he did not see bearing the fruit of good work first toward himself?

But Paul, firmly established through meekness at the summit of the virtues, persisted, preached, loved, and completed the good work he had begun, and by bearing with them and persisting he led the hearts of his disciples to mercy. For indicating afterward that he knew of their progress, he writes in the same Epistle: "Concerning the ministry that is done for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you. For I know your ready spirit, on account of which I boast of you among the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since the year before, and your zeal has provoked very many." Concerning whom he says again: "You who began not only to do, but also to will, from the year before." For in those from whom he was seeking not so much works as pious intentions, in them without doubt he praises pious intentions more than works. Yet it should be noted that this very consolation contains a reproach, when it is said: "From the year before." They had done good indeed, but tardily, and therefore the master praised this not without reproof. For he is a physician; he applies medicine to the wound, which both soothes what has been cleansed and stings what is found to be rotten. But by tolerating and preaching, he completed what he had begun. And by the wondrous virtue of longsuffering he softened the hardness of his disciples to the bowels of mercy, because the length of the gate rose up into height. But we who are weak are not fit to imitate the longsuffering of such great meekness, because clearly we are the pavement, and we lie despised in our own conduct.

Behold, while I speak of the two leaders of the heavenly army, the martyr Stephen also comes to mind, who, when seized for the name of his Creator and brought into the midst of his persecutors, stood undaunted, taught with confidence, and from zeal for truth strongly rebuked his persecutors, saying: "You have always resisted the Holy Spirit." And when they ran to get stones and killed him with stones, kneeling down he prayed for those same persecutors, saying: "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." What virtue is this, then, to burn so with zeal that he would confidently speak reproaches of their faithlessness to those by whom he was held; and to love so much that even in death he would pray for those by whom he was being killed? Indeed, he so burned with zeal as if he had no meekness at all; and he so persisted in meekness in love for them as if he had no fervor against them at all. Let us consider amid these things where the guilt of our conscience lies. For who among us, if he has received even a verbal insult from a neighbor, does not immediately return the insult, is not thoroughly disturbed, does not burst forth into hatred, does not forget the commandment of love? But blessed Stephen was able to do this through the grace of almighty God, because rising to the height he was a gate. We wretched ones cannot imitate this by our own strength, because we lie far below like pavement.

But what do we say of our admiration in the life of the saints, when even the ancient fathers themselves, considering the life of the holy Church's preachers, greatly admired them? Did not the Psalmist admire their life when he said: "But to me Your friends are exceedingly honored, O God, their principality is exceedingly strengthened"? Ask the Gospel about which of His friends he speaks this, in which the Truth says to the preachers: "You are My friends." Isaiah also, looking upon their life, said: "Who are these who fly as clouds, and as doves to their windows?" Rightly indeed are the holy preachers called clouds, because they rain with words and flash with miracles. They are also said to fly like clouds, because even while living on earth they were beyond the earth through everything they did. Whence also it is said through a certain cloud: "For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh." For the earlier fathers used marriages, begot children, possessed property, and attended to the cares of family affairs. But foreseeing these men already through the spirit of prophecy—that they would abandon possessions, not desire marriages, not beget children, seek nothing on earth, possess nothing—they name them not as men walking upon the earth, but as clouds flying. For they fly because in their mind they contemplate the things that are heavenly. They almost do not touch the earth because they desire nothing in it. And they are like doves at their windows because through the spirit of their gentleness they covet nothing in this world through their eyes. Let us therefore consider how great is the height of these gates of the spiritual building, which even the spiritual fathers admire. How much therefore is it necessary for us to be humbled in admiration of them, we who are the pavement? But since under the designation of length we have heard of the height of the gates, now let us learn something of their width.
