Hence also miracles were added to the holy preachers, so that the power displayed might give faith to their words, and that those who preached new things might do new things. When the world was flourishing, when the human race was increasing, when the flesh was subsisting long in this life, when the abundance of things was overflowing, who upon hearing would believe that there was another life? Who would prefer invisible things to visible things? But when the sick were returning to health, when the dead were rising to life, when lepers were receiving cleanliness of flesh, when demoniacs were snatched from the power of unclean spirits, with so many visible miracles performed, who would not believe what he heard about invisible things? For visible miracles shine forth for this purpose: that they may draw the hearts of those who see them to faith in invisible things, so that through what is done wondrously on the outside, what is within may be perceived to be far more wondrous. Hence now also, when the number of the faithful has increased, there are many within the holy Church who hold to a life of virtues but do not have the signs of virtues, because a miracle is shown outwardly in vain if what it should work inwardly is lacking. For according to the voice of the Teacher of the Gentiles: "Tongues are for a sign not to believers, but to unbelievers."
