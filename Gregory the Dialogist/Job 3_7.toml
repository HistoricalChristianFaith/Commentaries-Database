The year of our illumination will be accomplished at the appearing of the eternal Judge of the holy church when the life of its pilgrimage is completed. [The church] then receives the recompense of its labors when, having finished this season of warfare, [it] returns to its native country. Hence, the prophet says, “You shall bless the crown of the year with your goodness.” For the “crown of the year” is, as it were, “blessed” as the reward of virtues is bestowed when the season of toil comes to an end. But the days of this year are the several virtues, and its months the many deeds of those virtues. Moreover, note that when the mind is erected in confidence, it has a good hope that when the Judge comes it will receive the reward of the mind’s virtues. All the evil things [the church] has done are also remembered. It greatly fears lest the strict Judge, who comes to reward virtues, should also examine and weigh exactly those things that have been unlawfully committed. Thus, when “the year” is completed, the “night” is also reckoned.… There are some people that not only have no remorse for what they do but unceasingly uphold and applaud their actions. Truly, a sin that is upheld is doubled. One writer correctly condemns this attitude by saying, “My son, have you sinned? Don’t add on to what you have done.” For a person “adds sin to sin” who, over and above what he has done, justifies his error. He does not “leave the night alone” who also adds vindication’s support to the darkness of his fault. Thus, the first man Adam, when questioned concerning the night of his error, would not allow his “night” to remain alone. God’s questioning called Adam to repentance, but Adam responded by justifying himself, saying, “The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me fruit from the tree, and I did eat.” Adam covertly blames his Maker for the fault of Adam’s transgression. It was as if Adam said, “You provided me with an occasion for sin, because you gave me the woman.” Therefore, the branch of this sin remains manifest in the human race up to the present time. We continue to justify our misdeeds. - "Morals on the Book of Job 4.37–39"

39.  There are some men that not only never bewail what they do, but who do not cease to uphold and applaud it, and verily a sin that is upheld, is doubled.  And against this it is rightly said by one, My son, hast thou sinned? add not again thereto. [Ecclus. 21, 1]  For he ‘adds sin to sin,’ who over and above maintains what he has done amiss; and he does not ‘leave the night alone,’ who adds the support of vindication also to the darkness of his fault.  It is hence that the first man, when called in question concerning the ‘night’ of his error, would not have the same ‘night’ to be ‘solitary,’ in that while by that questioning he was called to repentance, he added the props of self-exculpation, saying, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I did eat; i.e. covertly turning the fault of his transgression upon his Maker; as if he said, ‘Thou gavest me occasion of transgressing, Who gavest me the woman.’  It is hence that in the human race the branch of this sin is drawn out from that root so far as to this present time, that what is done amiss should be yet further maintained.  Let him say then, Let that light be solitary, and not worthy of any praise.  As though he besought in plain words, ‘Let the fault that we have done remain alone, lest while it is praised and upheld, it bind us a hundredfold more in the sight of our Judge.  We ought not indeed to have sinned, but would that, by not adding others, we would even leave those by themselves, which we have committed.'
40.  But here it is to be impressed upon our minds, that he in a true sense bears hard upon his sin, whose heart is no longer set to the love of the present state of being by any longing for prosperity, who sees how deceitful are the caresses of this world, and reckons its smiles as a kind of persecution.

13.  That night is made solitary, in that it is divided by an eternal separation from the company of the land above. Yet this may be also taken in another sense, viz. that he loses man, whom he had made his fellow in ruin, and that the enemy perishes alone together with his body [i.e. the wicked], while many that he had destroyed are restored by the Redeemer's grace.  The night then is made solitary, when they that are Elect being raised up, our old enemy is made over alone to the eternal flames of hell.  And it is well said, Let it be worthy of no praise.  For when mankind, encompassed with the darkness of error, took stones for gods, in this, that they worshipped idols, what else did they but praise the deeds of their seducer?  Hence Paul rightly remarks, We know that an idol is nothing.  But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to devils. [1 Cor. 8, 4; 10, 20]  How else then is it with those that have bowed themselves to the worship of idols, but that they have ‘praised the darkness of night?’  But, lo! we see now that that night is known to be unworthy ‘of any praise,’ since now the worship of idols is condemned by the human race redeemed; and that ‘night is left solitary',’ in that there is none that goeth with the damned apostate spirit to suffer torments.
