He was anointed above his fellows, because all we people first exist as sinners and afterwards are sanctified through the unction of the Holy Spirit. But he who, existing as God before the ages, was conceived as man through the Holy Spirit in the Virginâ€™s womb at the end of the ages was there anointed by the same Spirit, even where he was conceived. Nor was he first conceived and afterwards anointed; but to be conceived by the Holy Spirit of the flesh of the Virgin was itself to be anointed by the Holy Spirit.
