62.  But if it is counsel within the soul that he calls ‘the habitation of righteousness,’ the leaders of false opinions promise afflicted Catholics ‘the habitation of their righteousness at peace,’ in that if they draw them to their own views, then indeed they hold their peace from opposition.  For those who have let themselves be drawn into that which is wrong, are the more lulled to rest in temporal peace, in proportion as they are parted the wider from eternal peace.  Moreover they promise that the riches of understanding shall be increased to all that follow them.  And hence it is added, Insomuch that though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end shalt greatly increase.  Then because they do not easily obtain credit to their words, in that their life is often shown to be worthy of contempt, they put forward the opinions of the Fathers of old, and turn the right line they take into a proof of their own erring way.
