"And in the midst of it the likeness of four living creatures." What is said to be in the midst of it, whether of electrum or of fire, nothing prevents us from understanding, because these four living creatures, namely the holy evangelists, were both strengthened in the virtue of faith from the incarnation of the same Lord, and afflicted with many tribulations in the fire of persecution.

And because then all the saints who perfectly abandoned the world come as judges, it is fittingly soon added: "And in the midst of it was the likeness of four living creatures." For what is signified by the four living creatures except the four evangelists? And not without reason is the number of all the perfect expressed through the four evangelists, because all who are now perfect in the Church have learned the rectitude of their perfection through their Gospel. For in the midst of it was the likeness of four living creatures, because those who have now followed perfect works according to the Gospel precepts will then be seen united to his body, joined to his majesty, and made judges together with him. For this is why it is said to the holy apostles themselves: "You who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall sit on the throne of his majesty, you also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel." Hence Isaiah says: "The Lord will come to judgment with the elders of his people." Hence Solomon speaks of the Church, saying: "Her husband is noble in the gates, when he sits with the senators of the land."

"And this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them." Since a little later these holy living creatures are described as distinct in their individual forms, so that one is said to be like a man, another like a lion, another like a calf, and another like an eagle, what does it mean that in this place it is said of all of them together, "The likeness of a man was in them"? But who is described as a man in this place, if not he of whom it is written: "Who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men, and found in appearance as a man"? Therefore these living creatures, that they may be able to rise to the virtue of holiness, strive toward the likeness of this man. For they would not be holy if they did not have the likeness of this man, because whatever is in them of tender compassion, whatever of gentleness of spirit, whatever of zeal for righteousness, whatever of the keeping of humility, whatever of the fervor of charity—all this they drew from the very fountain of mercy, from the very root of gentleness, from the very power of justice, that is, from the Mediator between God and men, God the Lord. The outstanding preacher shows that he has the likeness of this man, saying: "Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ." He urges us to rise to his likeness when he says: "The first man was from the earth, earthly; the second man is from heaven, heavenly. As we have borne the image of the earthly, let us also bear the image of him who descended from heaven." For each holy person is led to the likeness of this man to the extent that he imitates the life of his Redeemer. For to be at variance with his commandments and works, what else is it but to depart far from his likeness?

Holy preachers weep over the life of sinners; but of our very Head it is written that he wept over Jerusalem. They rejoice over the good deeds of their subjects, and they love those who act rightly; but of our Redeemer it is written that when a certain young man said, "All these things I have kept from my youth," he loved him more. Holy preachers bear insults inflicted upon them and return no insult in turn; but when it was said to our Redeemer, "You have a demon," he did not return injury but responded gently, saying: "I do not have a demon." Holy preachers burn with zeal for righteousness; but the Redeemer of all, having made a whip of cords, drove out those selling and buying from the temple, overturned the seats of those selling doves, and poured out the money of the money-changers. In all that they do with strength, they guard humility with their whole intention; but through our Redeemer it is said: "Learn from me, for I am meek and humble of heart." Holy preachers also love their persecutors; but he himself, the author and redeemer of all, placed in his passion, interceded for his persecutors, saying: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do." They lay down their bodies in suffering for their brothers; but the author of life gave himself up even to death for the life of the elect. Let it therefore be said of the holy living creatures that the likeness of a man is in them, because that they are holy, that they are wonderful—this is in them from the appearance of likeness, that is, from the power of imitation. For our Redeemer is the head of us all. And through Solomon it is said: "The eyes of the wise man are in his head, but the fool walks in darkness." For we have our eyes in the head when we contemplate the life of our Redeemer in silent meditation, when our whole intention raises itself to the imitation of him, lest if the eye of the mind neglects to look upon the ways of light, it immediately falls closed into the darkness of error. The Prophet was hastening to rise to the likeness of this man when he said: "I will exercise myself in your commandments and consider your ways." For he who silently considers the ways of the Lord in his mind, and hastens to exercise himself in his commandments, what else does he reform in himself but the image of the new man? Because this is done unceasingly in the hearts of the saints, it is rightly now said of the living creatures: "The likeness of a man was in them."

After this likeness which is now maintained in moral conduct, we eventually arrive at the likeness of glory. For John says of this: "Now we are children of God, and it has not yet appeared what we shall be. But we know that when he appears, we shall be like him." He soon adds how this can come about, saying: "Because we shall see him as he is." For God's being is to remain eternal and unchangeable. For everything that changes ceases to be what it was and begins to be what it was not; but God's being is never to be in a dissimilar state. Hence it is said to Moses: "I am who I am. And you shall say to the children of Israel: He who is sent me to you." James also says: "With whom there is no change, nor shadow of alteration." And so it is said through John: "We shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is," because through the fact that we behold the essence of his nature, freed from our mutability, we are fixed in eternity. For we shall be transformed in him whom we shall see, because we shall lack death by seeing life; we shall transcend our mutability by seeing the immutable. We shall be held by no corruption by seeing the incorruptible.

Moreover, there will be a likeness of the man even in our bodies at that time. For it is said through Paul: "Our citizenship is in heaven; from whence also we look for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform the body of our lowliness, conformed to the body of his glory." Therefore the bodies of the elect will then be conformed to the glory of the Lord's body, which even if they do not have equality with his glory by nature, they will nevertheless have a likeness of his configuration by grace. Since therefore a likeness of his life is now drawn out in the conduct of the elect, and in the resurrection there follows a likeness of eternity in the mind, because we shall see him as he is; and since our bodies also will receive a likeness of him in configuration, let it rightly be said of the holy living creatures: "A likeness of a man was in them."
