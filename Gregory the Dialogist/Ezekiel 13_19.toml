Anyone who condemns a righteous person is putting to death one who is not dying; and one who tries to absolve a guilty person from his punishment is striving to bring back to life one who is not living. All cases must be carefully considered, and only then the power of binding and loosing used. The pastor must look at the sin and the repentance following after the sin, so that his sentence absolves those to whom almighty God grants the grace of sorrow. There is true absolution on the part of the one presiding only when it is in accord with the decision of the internal judge.
