5. Overshadowing is sometimes used in Holy Scripture for the Incarnation of the Lord, or the cooling of the mind from the heat of carnal thoughts; whence by the expression ‘shadow’ this cooling of the heart in consequence of heavenly protection is usually spoken of. But sometimes ‘shadow’ is taken to mean the numbness of the frozen minds when charity departs. For that the Incarnation of the Lord is signified by the term overshadowing, still preserving the truth of the history, the word of the Angel attests, who says to Mary, The Power of the Highest shall overshadow thee. [Luke 1, 35] For because a shadow is caused in no other way than by a light and a body, the Power of the Highest overshadowed her, because the incorporeal Light assumed a body in her womb. By which overshadowing in truth she received in herself every refreshment of mind. Again, by ‘shadow’ is expressed the refreshment of the heart by reason of heavenly protection, as the Psalmist says, Hide me under the shadow of Thy wings. [Ps. 17, 8] Or as the Bride in the Song of Songs, having waited for the coming of the Bridegroom, announces, saying, I sat down under the shadow of Him, Whom I had longed for. [Cant. 2, 3] As if she said, I rested under the protection of His coming from the heat of carnal desires. Again, by ‘shadow’ is expressed the numbness of the frozen mind, when charity departs, as is said of sinful man, that he sought the shadow. For man, flying from the warmth of charity, has forsaken the sun of truth, and hid himself under the shade of inward cold. Whence it is said by the voice of the same Truth, Iniquity shall abound, and the love of many shall wax cold. [Matt. 24, 12] Whence the first man, after his sin, is found hid amidst the trees of paradise at the cool after midday [‘ad auram’]. [Gen. 3, 8] For since he had lost the midday warmth of charity, he was already benumbed beneath the shadow of sin, as if under the cold of the air.
6. Because then this Behemoth finds a kind of rest in those, whom he chills by withdrawing from the light of the true Sun, he is said to sleep under the shadow. But sometimes by ‘shadow,’ if used with the addition of the word ‘death,’ is expressed either the death of the flesh, or any reprobates, who by their eagerness in evil doing imitate the darkness of the ancient enemy. Whence it is said by the Psalmist with the voice of the Martyrs; Thou hast humbled us in the place of affliction, and the shadow of death hath covered us. [Ps. 44, 19] For the shadow of death covers the Elect of God, when the death of the flesh, which is the image of eternal death, cuts them off from this life; because as that separates the soul from God, so does this separate the body from the soul. Or certainly the shadow of death covers them, because it is written of the ancient enemy, His name was death. [Rev. 6, 8] All reprobates are therefore the shadow of death, because they imitate the malice of his wickedness, and shadow forth his image, as it were, when they take in themselves a resemblance of his malice. And they cover the Elect of God, when they gain strength against them for a time, in the cruelty of persecution. But in this place ‘shadow’ is taken for the slumber of wickedness, and this Behemoth slumbers therein, because he watches anxiously against hearts glowing with charity, but lies securely in minds benumbed with cold. For he cannot slumber in the minds of Saints, because, even if he places himself therein for a short moment, the very warmth of heavenly desires wearies him, and he is pricked, as it were, to make him depart, as often as they sigh after eternal things with inmost love. And as many holy thoughts as cry aloud from their minds unto heaven, are as so many voices to rouse him. Whence it is, that, frightened by the arms of good deeds, and smitten with the darts of sighs, he takes his flight, and that, returning to the frozen hearts of the reprobate, he seeks for that shadow of wickedness to occupy in security. And where it is found by him, is shown by its being immediately subjoined, In the covert of the reeds.
7. In Holy Scripture, by the expression ‘cane’ [‘calamus’] or ‘reed’ [‘arundo’] is sometimes understood the Abiding Word, sometimes the skill of the learned, sometimes the changeableness of the mind, sometimes the brightness of temporal glory. For by ‘cane’ is designated the eternity of the Word, when it is said by the Psalmist with the voice of the Father, My tongue is the reed [‘calamus’] of a swift writer. [Ps. 45, 1] For since that which we speak passes away, but that which we write remains, the tongue of the Father is called the reed of a writer, because from Him is the Word Coeternal with Himself, and begotten without transition [‘transitu’]. Again, by ‘reed’ is expressed the learning of writers, as the Prophet promises concerning Holy Church, saying, In the lairs in which dragons used before to dwell, there will spring up the greenness of the reed, and rush. [Is. 35, 7] For in this sentence, as we said a long way above in this work, by ‘reed’ is expressed the doctrine of writers, by ‘rush’ the freshness of hearers [see Bk. 29, §. 51]. Again, by ‘cane,’ or certainly by ‘reed,’ is expressed changeableness of mind, as is said by the Lord to the crowds of the Jews in praise of John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a reed shaken with the wind? [Matt. 11, 7] in order, namely, that it should be understood, ‘No.’ For John was not in truth a reed shaken with the wind, because no breath of tongues inclined on different sides his mind, which was made firm by the Holy Spirit. Again, by ‘rush’ or ‘reed’ is expressed the brightness of temporal glory, as is said of the righteous by Wisdom, the righteous shall shine, and run to and fro like sparks in the reed-bed. [Wisd. 3, 7] For He terms a ‘reed-bed’ the life of the worldly, who like reeds, outwardly increase to a height by temporal glory, but are inwardly bereft of the solidity of truth. Whence also the kingdom of the Jews is compared to a reed, when it is said by the Prophet, on the Lord appearing in the truth of the flesh, A bruised reed shall He not break, and the smoking flax shall He not quench. [Is. 2, 43] For what does he set forth by the name ‘reed’ but the temporal kingdom of the Jewish people, brilliant indeed without, but empty within? And because in this people the royal race had already failed, and a stranger was possessing its kingdom, He fitly calls the same kingdom a broken reed. But what is expressed by ‘flax,’ except it be its priesthood, which doubtless wore linen vestments? And because at the coming of the Lord, it had lost the warmth of charity, it was not burning but smoking, having already lost, as it were, the fire of faith. But the Incarnate Lord broke not the bruised reed, and quenched not the smoking flax, because He smote not with the might of judgment the kingdom of Judæa, which had been already well nigh destroyed, and its priesthood which retained not the fire of faith, but endured them with the long-suffering of patience.
8. What else, therefore, is designated in this place by the term ‘reed’ but the minds of the worldly, which are devoted to temporal glory? For they are the more empty in themselves within, the more they appear tall and beautiful without; for while they melt away into external glory on the surface, they are not strengthened by any solidity within. For like reed they are, through their folly, hollow within, but are outwardly beautiful through show and appearance; but the more studiously outward glory is sought for by them, the more are their minds agitated with sharper pangs of thought. Whence this Behemoth is now rightly said to slumber in the covert of the reed, because he silently possesses the hearts of those, whose desires he excites to seek after temporal splendor and dignity; and he himself sleeps, as it were, quietly in that spot, where he does not allow those whom he possesses to remain at rest. For whilst they go about to surpass others by the loftiness of their goods, while through the brightness of outward cleanliness they surpass the righteous in appearance, as a reed surpasses the bark of solid trees; by remaining hollow within, they make a fitting place for this Behemoth to rest within them. Whence also the Lord says in the Gospel, that the spirit who went forth and found no rest in barren and dry places, because he found the house which he had left empty, and swept clean, entered it in more abundant measure. [Matt. 12, 43-45] For because the earth which is watered becomes moist, the barren and dry places are the hearts of the righteous, which by the power of discipline are drained dry of all the moisture of carnal concupiscence. Whence here also the place where this Behemoth slumbers is still further pointed out, where it is immediately added, In moist places.
9. For ‘moist places’ are the minds of earthly men, which the moisture of carnal concupiscence makes fluid, because it fills them. In which this Behemoth plants deeper the footsteps of his iniquity, the more as in passing he sinks [‘pertransitus ejus’] in their minds as in wet earth. For ‘moist places’ are voluptuous deeds. For the foot does not slip on dry ground, but when planted in slippery ground it is hardly supported. They therefore journey through this life in moist places, who cannot herein stand upright in righteousness. Behemoth, therefore, sleeps in these moist places, because he rests in the slippery doings of reprobate men. But some suppose that by ‘moist places’ are meant the genitals. But if this is so, what else is plainly designated by moist places but lust, so that by a ‘reed’ is expressed the glory of pride, and by ‘moist places’ the lust of the body? For these in truth are two sins, which hold cruel sway over the human race, one, namely, of the spirit, and the other of the flesh. For pride exalts the spirit, lust corrupts the flesh. The ancient enemy, therefore, specially oppressing mankind either by pride or by lust, sleeps in the covert of the reed, and in moist places, because he holds ruined man under the sway of his domination, either by pride of spirit, or by corruption of flesh. But some he possesses in both ways, because when the spirit of pride exalts them, not even shame for their corruption brings them down from pride at their high estate. But are not the teachers of virtues continually watchful against them within the bounds of Holy Church? Do they cease to reprove grovelling pleasures, and to recommend the joys of the heavenly country? But the minds of the wicked refuse the more obstinately to listen to the highest things, the more closely they have cleaved to those that are basest. Nor are they contented with merely perishing themselves, but, (which is worse,) when they see others convinced and improved, they also oppose the reproofs of the righteous, to keep others at least from being corrected.
