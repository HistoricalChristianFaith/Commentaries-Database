16.  For he imagines all men to be such toward himself, as he himself strives to be towards all.  And what effect these same terrors have in his conduct, is brought in, when it is said;
And shall entangle his feet.
For if ‘the feet be entangled,’ they cannot have free steps, and are not able to accomplish any journey; in that their own entanglements hold them fast.  Therefore bad desires force into vilest practice, and vilest practice holds fast in terror; which same terror entangles the feet, that they should have no power to step out into right practice.  And it often happens that a person for this reason fears to be good, that he may not himself suffer that at the hands of the wicked, which he remembers himself to have done to the good; and whereas he dreads to undergo that thing which he has himself done, on every side affrighted, on every side full of misgiving, he as it were has his feet entangled, who is ensnared by fear; he is able to do nothing freely; in that he has in a manner lost his going in good practice by the same act, whereby he stepped out of the 1ine into the evil which he set his heart on.
