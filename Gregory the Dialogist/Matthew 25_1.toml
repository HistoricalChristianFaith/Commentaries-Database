But we should know that often in sacred speech the kingdom of heaven refers to the Church of the present time. Concerning this the Lord says in another place: "The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all scandals." For in that kingdom of blessedness, where there is supreme peace, no scandals could be found to be gathered. And again it is said: "Whoever therefore breaks one of these least commandments and teaches men so, he shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven." But one who is unwilling to fulfill by work what he teaches cannot attain to the kingdom of eternal blessedness. How then shall he be called least in it who is in no way permitted to enter it? What therefore does this statement mean except that the present Church is called the kingdom of heaven? In which a teacher who breaks a commandment is called least, because when someone's life is despised, it follows that his preaching is also condemned.

Now each person exists in five bodily senses, and five doubled makes ten. And because the multitude of the faithful is gathered from both sexes, the holy Church is declared to be like ten virgins. In this Church, because the bad are mixed with the good and the reprobate with the elect, it is rightly said to be like both wise and foolish virgins.
