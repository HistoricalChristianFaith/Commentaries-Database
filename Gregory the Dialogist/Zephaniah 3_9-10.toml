“Then let my shoulder fall from its joining and my arm be broken in pieces ailing the bones.” Because bodily action is carried on by the shoulder and the arm, when the good things put forth with the lips are not fulfilled in deed, he wants “the shoulder to fall” and “the arm to be broken in pieces.” … But if this sentence of a curse is to be referred to a spiritual meaning, it is no doubt plain that the arm is linked to the body by the shoulders and, as by the arm is meant good practice, so by the shoulder, the knitting together of social life is denoted. So the prophet, regarding the holy peoples of the church universal and that they should serve God in concord, says, “And they shall serve him with one shoulder.”
