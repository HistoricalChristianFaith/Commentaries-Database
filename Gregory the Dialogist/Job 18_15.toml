22.  i.e. In his mind apostate angels shall have their haunt by vilest thoughts, they being ‘his fellows,’ who for this reason no longer ‘is,’ because he has departed from the Supreme Essence, and for this is, by a daily augmented declension, as it were tending ‘not to be,’ in that he has once fallen from Him Who truly is; who moreover is rightly said ‘not to be,’ in that he has lost well-being, though he has not lost natural being.  Still, yet further setting forth these thoughts of the bad man with more minuteness, he subjoins, saying,
Let brimstone be scattered upon his habitation.
23.  What is ‘brimstone’ but the fuel of fire, which, however, so cherishes the fire, that it sends out the very foulest stench.  What then do we understand by ‘brimstone,’ but carnal sin, which, while it fills the mind with wicked thoughts like a kind of ill savours, is kindling everlasting fires for it; and whilst it spreads the cloud of its stench in the lost soul, it is as it were providing against it fuel for the flames to come after.  For that the ill savour of the flesh is understood by brimstone, the mere history of Holy Writ by itself hears record, which relates that the Lord ‘rained down fire and brimstone upon Sodom.’  Who, when He had determined to punish her carnal wickednesses, by the very character of the punishment marked out the stain of her guilt: since ‘brimstone’ hath stench, and fire burning; and so, forasmuch as they had been kindled to bad desires in the ill savour of the flesh, it was meet that they should perish by fire and brimstone combined; that by their just punishment they might be taught what they had done in unjust desire.  And so this ‘sulphur is scattered upon the habitation’ of the wicked man, as often as the corrupt indulgence of the flesh exercises dominion within him; and whereas bad thoughts unceasingly occupy him, and forbid his bringing forth the fruit of good practice.
