39. It despises, as though they were not its own, those whom it discovers to be living otherwise than it has itself taught, and, as its cruelty becomes obdurate, it applies terrors, and exercises itself in torturing them, and, inflamed by the firebrands of envy, it labours that they should perish, for whom it laboured not that they should live. And, when it persecutes the members of the Lord, it suspects that by this it is pleasing God. Whence also the Truth says to the same eggs of the ostrich, The hour cometh, that whosoever killeth you, thinketh that he doeth God service. [John 16, 2] Because, therefore, when the synagogue is led by cruelty to persecution, it thinks that it is acting thus by the impulse of divine fear, it is rightly subjoined;
She hath laboured in vain, no fear compelling her.
40. For not fear, but cruelty, has compelled it to pant in the labour of persecution. But because vices, when tinged with the colour of virtues, are commonly the more abominable, the less they are known even to be vices; the synagogue was more harsh in persecution, as it believed that it was becoming more religious by the deaths of the faithful. And therefore it could not at all discern what it was doing, because it shut out from itself the light of understanding, by putting pride in the way.

17. For he whom the grace of charity bedews not, looks upon his neighbour as a stranger, even though he has himself begotten him to God. As doubtless are all hypocrites, whose minds in truth, while ever aiming at outward objects, become insensible within: and while they are ever seeking their own, in every thing they do, they are not softened by any compassion of charity, for the feelings of their neighbour. O what bowels of tenderness was Paul bearing, when he was panting for his children, with so great a warmth of love, saying, We live, if ye stand fast in the Lord. And, God is my witness, how I wish for you all in the bowels of Christ Jesus. [1 Thess. 3, 8] To the Romans also he says, God is my witness, Whom I serve in my spirit, in the Gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers, making request, if by any means, now at length, I may have a prosperous journey by the will of God to come to you; for I long to see you. [Rom. 1, 9-11] He says also to Timothy, I thank my God, Whom I serve from my forefathers in pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers, night and day desiring to see thee. [2 Tim. 1, 3. 4.] He says also, pointing out his love to the Thessalonians, But we, brethren, being taken away from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, hastened the more abundantly to see your face with great desire. [l Thess. 2, 17] Who when pressed by hard persecutions, and yet anxious for the safety of his children, added, We sent Timotheus our brother, and minister of God in the Gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to exhort you concerning your faith, that no man should be moved by these afflictions. For ye yourselves know that we were appointed thereunto. [1 Thess. 3, 2. 3.] He says also to the Ephesians, I desire that ye faint not in my tribulations for you, which is your glory. [Eph. 3, 13] Behold, when in the midst of tribulations, he exhorts others, and in that which he himself endures, he strengthens others. For he had not, like the ostrich, forgotten his children, but was greatly afraid, that his disciples, observing so many reproaches of persecutions in their preacher, would in him despise the faith, against which innumerable insults of sufferings were prevailing. And therefore he felt less pain at his torments, but was more afraid for his children, from the temptation of his torments. He was lightly regarding the wounds of his body in himself, whilst he was fearing for his children the wounds of the heart. He was himself patiently enduring the wounds of torments, but, by consoling his children, he was healing the wounds of their hearts. Let us consider, therefore, of what charity he was, to have feared for others, in the midst of his own sorrows. Let us consider of what charity he was, to seek for the welfare of his children, amidst his own losses, and to guard, even from his own abject condition, firmness of mind in those who were near him.
18. But hypocrites know not these bowels of charity. Because the more their mind is let loose on outward subjects by worldly concupiscence, the more is it hardened within, by its want of affection. And it is frozen by benumbing torpor within, because it is softened by fatal love without; and is unable to consider itself, because it strives not to think of itself. But a mind cannot think on itself, which is not entirely at home in itself. But it is unable to be entirely at home in itself, because by as many lusts as it is hurried away, by so many objects is it distracted from itself; and scattered, it lies below, though with collected strength it might rise, if it willed, to the greatest heights.
19. Whence the mind of the just, because it is restrained, by the guardianship of discipline, from the shifting desire of all visible objects, is compacted in itself and inwardly entire; and it fitly beholds how it should conduct itself towards God, or its neighbour, because it leaves nothing of its own without, and the more it is withdrawn and restrained from outward objects, the more is it increased and kindled within; and the more it burns, the more brightly does it shine for the detection of vices. For hence it is, that while holy men gather themselves within themselves, they detect even the secret faults of others, with a wonderful and penetrating keenness of sight. Whence it is well said by the prophet Ezekiel, The likeness of a hand was put forth, and took me by a lock of my head, and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me, in the vision of God, into Jerusalem, by the inner door, that looked towards the north, where was placed the idol of jealousy to provoke jealousy. [Ez. 8, 3] For what is a lock of the head, but the thoughts of the mind gathered together, so as not to be scattered and dispersed, but to remain bound by discipline? A hand is therefore put forth from above, and the Prophet is lifted up by the lock of his head; because when our mind collects itself by watchfulness, a heavenly power raises us upward from things below. He therefore well says, that he was lifted up between earth and heaven; because every holy man, when living in mortal flesh, does not as yet indeed fully arrive at heavenly objects, but yet at once abandons those that are below. But he is brought in the vision of God into Jerusalem, because in truth every one who is making progress through the zeal of charity, beholds what the Church ought to he. It is also well added, By the inner door, that looked towards the north: doubtless, because, while holy men look through the approach of inward contemplation, they detect more evil than good going on within the Church. And they turn their eyes in the quarter of the north, that is, to the left of the sun, because they warm themselves with the stimulants of charity against the frosts of sins. Where it is also rightly subjoined; Because there was there placed the idol of jealousy to provoke jealousy. For when they behold rapine and wickedness perpetrated within Holy Church, by some, who are faithful only in appearance, what else do they see, but an idol in Jerusalem? And it is called the idol of jealousy, because by this the jealousy of heaven is provoked against us: and it smites offenders the more severely, the more affectionately the Redeemer loves us.
20. Hypocrites, therefore, because they collect not the thoughts of their mind, are not held by a lock of their head. And when do they, who are ignorant of their own faults, detect the faults of those committed to them? These are therefore dead to heavenly things, for which they ought to burn; and burn anxiously for earthly objects, to which they would laudably have been dead. For thou mayest often behold them, having put aside the care of their children, prepare themselves for dangers of immense labour, cross seas, approach tribunals, assail princes, burst into palaces, frequent the wrangling assemblies of the people, and defend with laborious watchfulness their earthly patrimony. And if it is perchance said to them, Why do ye, who have left the world, act thus? they immediately reply, that they fear God, and that therefore they labour with such zeal in defending their patrimony.

21. For, There they trembled with fear, where no fear was. [Ps. 14, 5] For behold it is commanded by the voice of God; If any one hath taken thy coat, and wished to contend with thee in judgment, give up to him thy cloak also. [Matt. 5, 40] And again; If one hath taken away that which is thine own, ask it not again. [Luke 6, 30] The Apostle Paul also, when he was wishing his disciples to despise outward things, in order to be able to retain those that are within, admonishes them, saying; Now there is utterly a fault in you, because ye have trials among yourselves. Why do ye not rather take wrong, why do ye not rather suffer fraud? [1 Cor. 6, 7] And yet a hypocrite, having assumed the garb of holy conversation, abandons the charge of his children, and seeks to defend, even by wrangling, all his temporal goods. He is not afraid to ruin their hearts by his example, and is afraid of losing his earthly patrimony as if by negligence. His disciple falls into error, and yet the heart of the hypocrite is wounded with no sorrow. He beholds those committed to him plunging into the gulph of iniquity, and passes by these things, as though he had not heard them. But if he has felt any temporal loss slightly inflicted on him, how does he suddenly burst forth, from his inmost soul, into the anger of revenge. His patience is soon broken down; the grief of his heart is soon let loose in words. For while he hears with equanimity the loss of souls, but hastens, even with agitation of spirit, to repel the loss of temporal goods, he truly indicates to all, by this evidence of his emotion of mind, what he loves. For great earnestness of defence is there exercised, where the power of love is also mightier. For the more he loves earthly things, the more vehemently is he afraid of being deprived of them. For we learn not with what feeling we possess any thing in this world, except when we lose it. For, whatever is possessed without love, is lost without pain. But those things, which we ardently love, when possessed, we sigh for heavily when taken away. But who can know not that the Lord created earthly things for our use, but the souls of men for His own? A person is, therefore, convicted of loving himself more than God, who protects those things which are peculiarly his own, to the neglect of what are His. For hypocrites fear not to lose those things which belong to God, that is, the souls of men, and, as if about to render an account to a strict Judge, are afraid of losing those which are their own, things namely which are passing away together with the world. As if they would find Him favourably disposed, for Whom they preserve senseless and undesirable objects, having lost those which are desirable, that is, which are rational. We wish to possess something in this world, and behold the Truth exclaims, Unless a man hath renounced all that he hath, he cannot be My disciple. [Luke 14, 33]
22. How then ought a perfect Christian to defend by disputing those earthly goods, which he is not ordered to possess? When we lose therefore our own possessions, we are lightened of a great burden in this journey of life, if we perfectly follow God. But when the necessity of this same journey imposes on us the care of possessions, some persons are only to he submitted to, while they seize them from us, but others are to he prevented, without violation of charity, not however merely from anxiety lest they should take away from us our goods, but lest they should ruin themselves by seizing what are not their own. For we ought more to fear for the plunderers themselves, than to be eager in defending irrational possessions. For these we lose, at our death, even though not stolen from us; but we are one with the others, both now in the rank of creation, and, if they strive to amend, after their reception of the gift. But who can he ignorant that we ought to love the goods, which we use, less, and that, which we are ourselves, more. If therefore we speak to plunderers, even for their own benefit, we now no longer merely claim for ourselves those things which are temporal, but, for them also, those that are eternal.
23. But we must in this matter carefully watch, that covetousness steal not on us, through fear of necessity; and that a prohibition, kindled by zeal, when strained by immoderate force, may not break out into the disgracefulness of hateful contention. And whilst peace with our neighbour is torn from our hearts, for the sake of an earthly good, it appears plainly, that our property is loved better than our neighbour. For if we have no bowels of charity even towards our neighbour who plundered us, we persecute ourselves worse, than the spoiler does himself, and ravage ourselves more fatally, than the other could do; because by abandoning, of our own accord, the blessing of love, we lose for ourselves that which is within, though we lost, through him, those only which are without. But a hypocrite knows not this form of charity; for, preferring earthly to heavenly possessions, he inflames himself with furious hatred, in his inmost heart, against him who spoils his temporal possessions.
24. But it ought to be known, that there are some, whom mother Church tolerates, nursing them in the bosom of charity, and whom she would carry on even to the advanced growth of spiritual age, who sometimes both wear the garb of sanctity, and yet cannot attain to the merit of perfection. For they rise not to spiritual gifts, and therefore they assist those who are connected with them, in the preservation of earthly goods, and sometimes transgress in anger in this defence. But we must not believe that these persons fall into the numbers of hypocrites, for it is one thing to sin from infirmity, and another from wickedness. There is therefore this difference between these persons and hypocrites, that these, conscious of their own infirmity, prefer being reproved by all for their faults, to being praised for pretended sanctity. But those are both sure that they are doing wrong, and yet in the judgments of men are puffed up with the name of sanctity. These fear not to displease wicked men, even by a virtuous action, provided only they are approved by the judgments of heaven; but those never consider what they are doing, but how by every action they can please men. These, according to the measure of their understanding, contend for the causes of God, even in things of the world; but those subserve the design of the world, even in the causes of God; because in the very midst of the holy deeds they make a shew of doing, they seek not the conversion of men, but the breath of applause.
25. When therefore we behold any persons of no mean conversation defending worldly interests passionately or immoderately, we ought to reprove this fault of theirs charitably, and yet not to despair of them, while reproving them. Because there frequently exist in one and the same person certain censurable points which are apparent, and great qualities which lie concealed. But in ourselves our great qualities often come forth openly, and those which are reprehensible are sometimes concealed. Hence, therefore, our pride of mind must be brought low, because, both their weaknesses are public, and ours are secret: and again, their strong points are concealed, and ours are divulged and made public. Those therefore, whom we blame for their open weakness, it remains for us to venerate from our opinion of their hidden strength, and if our own mind is elated at their open weakness, let it keep itself down in humility, from considering its own secret infirmities. For some persons frequently obey many precepts, and pass over a few; and we pass over many, when we keep but a few. Whence it is frequently the case that, when we see others neglect a command, which we know we observe ourselves, our mind immediately exalts itself with pride, forgetting how many commands it passes over, when there are very few which it observes. It is therefore necessary for us in cases where we reprove others, to bring down the pride of our anxious thought. For if our mind sees that it is more exalted than others, being led, as it were, to headlong heights of singularity, it falls the more fatally. But why the hypocrite abandons heavenly lucre, and labours for that of earth, He still subjoins, under the description of the ostrich.
