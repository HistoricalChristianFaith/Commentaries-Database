28.  For he had said above; He shall drive him from fight into darkness, and translate him out of the world; and upon subjoining his miseries, he added; Surely, such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.  In that he who is now lifted up from not knowing God, is then brought to his own ‘dwellings,’ when his own wickedness plunges him into woes; and one day he finds ‘darkness his place,’ who, while he made himself glad here in the counterfeit light of righteousness, was occupying the place of another.  For bad men in all that they do in dissimulation, are striving to possess themselves of the righteous man’s name of credit, as of another’s place.  But they are then brought to their own place, when they are tormented with everlasting fire, as the desert of their iniquity.  For here in all that they do they are ministering to their desire of winning praise, and by the semblance of good works, they are opening wider the bosom of the mind to avarice.  So let the wicked man go now, and full blown with complete equipments, let him build his habitations here below, let him spread a name of glory, let him multiply estates, and delight himself in abundant stores, but when he shall be brought to everlasting punishments, then surely he shall know that ‘such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the place of him that knoweth not God.’  Now Bildad said this rightly, but he did not know who it was that he was saying it to.  But the heart of a good man is seriously afflicted, when sentences are pronounced against him upon an unfair estimate.
