Whoever gives practical assistance to those who have spiritual gifts becomes a coworker with those people in their spiritual work. There are relatively few people who are spiritually gifted but many who are rich in the things of this world, and when the latter comfort poor saints with their wealth they gain a share in their spiritual riches.
