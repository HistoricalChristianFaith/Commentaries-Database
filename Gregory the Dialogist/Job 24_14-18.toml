And so it is well said, “If the morning suddenly appears, it is to them even as the shadow of death.” For “the morning” is the mind of the righteous, which, leaving behind the darkness of sin, now breaks out into the light of eternity. As it is also said of the holy church, “Who is she that looks forth as the morning?” Therefore, in the same measure that every righteous person shining with the light of righteousness in this present life is reared to a height with honors, so the same measure of the darkness of death comes before the eyes of the wicked, in that they who remember that they have done bad things are in fear of being corrected. They always desire to be free in their iniquities, to live free from correction and to delight from sin. Its fatal mirth is itself appropriately described in the words that are directly introduced: “And they walk so in darkness, as in the light.” For with an evil mind they delight in deeds of wickedness. Through their sin they are day by day being dragged to punishment and are full of assurance. Hence it is said by Solomon that “there are wicked people who are as secure as if they had done the deeds of righteous.” Concerning them it is written that they “rejoice to do evil and delight in the most wicked doings.” Thus “they walk in darkness as in the light,” in that they delight in the night of sin as if the light of righteousness were spread around them.…“He is light on the face of the water.” From the plural number he returns to the singular, because most frequently one person begins what is bad, and numbers follow after by imitating him, but the fault is primarily his, whom the bad people follow after being furnished examples of wickedness; and hence the sentence frequently returns to him who was the leader in sin. Now the surface of water is carried here and there by the breath of air. Not being steadied with any stability it is put in motion everywhere. And so the mind of the wicked is “lighter than the surface of water,” in that every breath of temptation that touches it, draws it in without any retarding resistance. For if we imagine the unstable heart of any bad person, what do we discover but a surface of water set in the wind?
