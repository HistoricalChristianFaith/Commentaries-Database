28. What are the days of each teacher's life, if not the splendors of spiritual virtues? For he judges Israel all the days of his life who represents the light of justice—which he proclaims by speaking—through the perfection of good conduct, as an example to his faithful subjects. But he who does not have the light of spiritual virtues, because he takes up teaching from the good conduct of others, surely judges by the days of another's life. Concerning these the Lord says through the prophet: 'Behold, I am against the prophets who steal my words, each one from his neighbor' (Jer. 23:30). For they steal words who do not follow by their deeds the good that they proclaim by teaching, because they take, as it were, secretly from another's property what they by no means make their own by paying the price of their own labor. Therefore, after the future blessedness has been announced, it is shown what kind of man the pastor of the faithful ought to be in the meantime, since Samuel is reported to have judged Israel all the days of his life. For he poorly commends the way of perfection if one, wishing to open the path of light by his voice, grows dark in his actions. For he who had devoted all the days of his life to judging Israel says: 'I do not dare to speak of anything that Christ has not accomplished through me, for the obedience of the Gentiles, by word and deed' (Rom. 15:18). Let the teacher judge, then, but one who has illustrious days of his life—so that he may first nourish in himself the rays of spiritual virtues by living well, which he dispenses by speaking for the guidance of his subjects' paths. For a lamp is then usefully displayed to those who are in the house if it is first well filled with the light that it is about to spread.
