We need to note that the gate looking northward is said to have all the features that the gate to the east has, that is, windows of contemplation, a porch of humility and engravings of good deeds.

The gate is approached by seven steps because the entrance of the heavenly life is opened to us through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit.

It is also possible to understand the porch as faith. For it is before the steps and the gate, because we come first to faith and afterward, via the steps of spiritual gifts, we enter the door of the heavenly life.

The inner gate does not only face the gate of the east but also that of the north: the joys of the inner court are opened to those who remain in innocence, but they are also opened to condemned sinners by their repentance of their sins. They then recognize the unspeakable mystery of the heavenly kingdom, by recognizing them they thirst for them, by thirsting for them they hasten and by hastening they arrive.
