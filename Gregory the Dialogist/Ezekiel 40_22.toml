"And its windows, and its vestibule, and its carvings were according to the measure of the gate which looked toward the East; and its ascent was of seven steps, and the vestibule before it."

All these things have already been discussed more extensively above, and therefore the discourse should not be delayed with a lengthy exposition. However, this must be especially noted: that the gate toward the North is said to have all the same things that the gate toward the East has, namely the windows of contemplation, the vestibule of humility, and the carving of good works. For all who have persevered in innocence because they were born to God in their conversion have the gate toward the East, because the entrance to the heavenly kingdom lies open to them from the light they received. And all who, having later fallen into sins, were weighed down by the coldness of their torpor, but who, when they return through penance, grow warm again toward love of the heavenly homeland, have the gate toward the North, because for them also, after the coldness of their sin, the entrance to the heavenly kingdom lies open through mercy. Therefore the gate toward the North is said to have the same things that the gate toward the East has, because converted sinners are enriched with virtues just as those are rich who avoided falling into sin. Hence also by the voice of the Psalmist it is said through the Lord: "I ate ashes like bread," because He receives the penitent just as He does the righteous. For it is written concerning sinners: "They would have done penance long ago in sackcloth and ashes." Therefore ashes are eaten like bread when a sinner is recalled through penance to the grace of his Creator just like an innocent person. Therefore the gate toward the North has windows, has a vestibule, has carvings, because when a sinner is led back to life after his faults, he often receives the light of contemplation, and from the very memory of his iniquity he gains the grace of great humility and also the efficacy of good works, so that everything that is commanded to be done appears as if carved in his life. "Its ascent was of seven steps, and a vestibule was before it."

The gate is ascended by seven steps, because through the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit the entrance to heavenly life is opened to us. Isaiah, enumerating this sevenfold grace in our very Head, or in His body, which we are, says: "The spirit of wisdom and understanding shall rest upon Him, the spirit of counsel and fortitude, the spirit of knowledge and piety, and the spirit of the fear of the Lord shall fill Him." Speaking of heavenly things, he numbered these steps by descending rather than ascending, namely: wisdom, understanding, counsel, fortitude, knowledge, piety, fear. And since it is written, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom," it is without doubt established that one ascends from fear to wisdom, but does not return from wisdom to fear, because indeed wisdom possesses perfect charity. And it is written: "Perfect charity casts out fear." Therefore the prophet, because he was speaking from heavenly things down to the lowest, began rather from wisdom and descended to fear. But we who strive from earthly things toward heavenly things, let us enumerate those same steps by ascending, that we may be able to arrive from fear to wisdom. For in our mind the first step of ascent is the fear of the Lord; the second, piety; the third, knowledge; the fourth, fortitude; the fifth, counsel; the sixth, understanding; the seventh, wisdom. For the fear of the Lord exists in the mind. But what kind of fear is this, if piety is not with it? For he who knows not how to show mercy to his neighbor, who pretends not to share in his tribulations, his fear is nothing before the eyes of almighty God, because it is not raised up to piety. But often piety is accustomed to err through disordered mercy, if perchance it spares what ought not to be spared. For sins that can be struck by the fires of hell must be corrected by the rod of discipline. But disordered piety, when it spares temporally, drags one down to eternal punishment. Therefore, that piety may be true and ordered, it must be raised to another step, that is, to knowledge, so that it may know what to punish by judgment and what to forgive by mercy. But what if someone knows what he ought to do, yet lacks the strength to do it? Therefore let our knowledge grow to fortitude, so that when it sees what must be done, it can do this through strength of mind, lest it tremble with fear and, collapsed by dread, be unable to defend the good things it perceives. But often fortitude, if it is improvident and less circumspect against vices, falls into ruin by its very presumption. Therefore let it ascend to counsel, so that by foreseeing it may fortify everything it can do boldly. But there cannot be counsel if understanding is lacking, because he who does not understand the evil that burdens the doer, how can he strengthen the good that helps? And so let us ascend from counsel to understanding. But what if understanding watches with great sharpness, yet knows not how to moderate itself through maturity? Therefore let one ascend from understanding to wisdom, so that what understanding discovers keenly, wisdom may arrange with maturity. Because therefore through fear we rise to piety, through piety we are led to knowledge, through knowledge we are strengthened to fortitude, through fortitude we strive toward counsel, through counsel we advance into understanding, through understanding we arrive at the maturity of wisdom, we ascend to the gate by seven steps, through which the entrance to spiritual life is opened to us.

But it is well said that the vestibule was before it, because unless one first has humility, he does not ascend to these steps of spiritual gifts, as it is written: "Upon whom shall my spirit rest, if not upon the humble and quiet one, and the one trembling at my words." Concerning which it is said through the Psalmist: "He disposed ascents in his heart in the valley of tears." For a valley is a low place, and every sinner, while he humbly afflicts himself in tears in his heart, advances through the ascent of virtues. Who again says: "He sends forth springs in the valleys," because almighty God bestows the gifts of spiritual grace upon the humble.

The vestibule can also be understood as faith. For faith itself comes before the steps and the gate, because we first come to faith so that afterward we may enter the access to heavenly life through the steps of spiritual gifts. For one does not come to faith through virtues, but through faith one attains to virtues. For Cornelius the centurion, whose alms before baptism were praised by the testimony of an angel, did not come to faith through works, but came to works through faith. For to him also it is said through the angel: "Your prayers and alms have ascended in the sight of God." For if he had not believed in the true God even before baptism, whom was he praying to? Or how had almighty God heard him, if he was not asking to be perfected in good things by Him? Therefore he knew God the Creator of all things, but he did not know that His almighty Son had become incarnate. For he could not have done good things unless he had first believed. For it is written: "Without faith it is impossible to please God." Therefore he had faith, whose prayers and alms were able to please God. But through good action he merited to know God perfectly and to believe the mystery of His incarnation, so that he might arrive at the sacraments of baptism. Therefore through faith he came to works, but through works he was strengthened in faith. And so the vestibule is before the steps, because he who first believed, he himself afterward ascends by the steps of the virtues to the access of the gate.
