36.  For we then bewail our sins, when we begin to weigh them; but we then weigh them the more exactly, when more anxiously we bewail them, and by our lamentations it rises up [one Ms. ‘is known’] more perfectly in our hearts, what the severity of God threatens those with that commit sin, what will be those rebukings upon the children of perdition, what the terror, what the abhorrence of the unappeasable Majesty.  For so great things shall the Lord then being angry ‘say’ to the lost, as great as He permits them of justice to undergo.  Which same words of His visitation, the righteous, because now they anxiously fear them, escape free from.  But who in that inquisition might be found righteous, if God according to the Majesty of His Might, so sifted the life of man?
