75. Every one, who follows God, is, at his beginning, roused as a locust, because, though in some of his doings he clings to the earth, like the locusts, with bended knees, yet in some of them he raises himself up into the air with expanded wings. For the beginnings of conversions are a mixture of good and evil habits, whilst both the new life is carried on in intention, and the old life is still retained from habit. But we are so much the less injured by the evil being meanwhile mixed up with us, the more we daily contend against it without ceasing. Nor does the fault, whose evil habit our mind anxiously opposes, claim us any longer as its own. And therefore, worldly pursuits injure us less, when beginners; because they are forbidden to remain any longer within us. Accordingly, because the Lord mercifully tolerates some weaknesses in us in the very beginning of our conversion, that He may lead us at length to heavenly things, by perfection, He rouses us at first as locusts; because though He raises us aloft by the flight of virtue, He yet despairs not at our falling by worldly doing. It follows;
The glory of his nostrils is terror.
76. Because a thing, which is not seen, is detected by its smell, by the word ‘nostrils’ are expressed, not improperly, the thoughts of our hope; by which we already foresee in hope the coming judgment, though we as yet behold it not with our eyes. But every one, who begins to live righteously, on hearing that the righteous are, by the last judgment, summoned to the kingdom, is joyful; but because he considers that some evils are still remaining within him, he dreads the approach of this very judgment, about which he is beginning to rejoice. For he beholds his life to be a mixture of good and evil, and confuses his thoughts, in a measure, with hope and fear. For when he hears what are the joys of the kingdom, happiness immediately elevates his mind; and again when he considers what are the torments of hell, fear immediately disturbs his mind. The ‘glory of his nostrils’ is therefore well called ‘terror:’ because being placed between hope and fear, whilst he beholds in his mind the future judgment, he dreads the very thing, from which he glories. His own glory is itself his terror; because, having commenced good deeds, he rejoices in hope at the judgment, and, not having yet put an end to his evil doings, he is not entirely free from anxiety. But he meanwhile anxiously turns back to his own mind, casting away the storms of so great strength, and, composing himself in the calmness of peace alone, endeavours with all his powers to be found free by the strict Judge. For he counts it slavish to dread the presence of the Lord; and, that he may not fear the sight of his Father, he does those things, by which He may recognise him as His son. He learns therefore, to love his Judge with full expectation, and, so to speak, through fear he casts away fear. But he considers, that fear arises in the heart, by reason of carnal conduct, and therefore, before all things, he chastens his flesh with firm discipline.

45. By the name ‘locusts’ is sometimes signified the Jewish people, sometimes the converted Gentiles, sometimes the tongue of flatterers, but sometimes, by comparison, the Resurrection of the Lord, or the life of preachers.
For, that locusts express the people of the Jews, the life of John points out to us; of whom it is written; He did eat locusts and wild honey. [Mark 1, 6] For John proclaims, even in the kind of his food, Him, Whom he foretells with the authority of prophecy. For in himself he designated the Lord, Whom he preceded. And He, doubtless, coming for our redemption, ate wild honey, because He took of the sweetness of the unfruitful Gentiles. But, because He partly converted the people of the Jews, in His own body, He took locusts for food. For the locusts, which give sudden leaps, but fall immediately to the ground, signify them. For they were leaping, when they were promising to fulfil the precepts of the Lord; but they were falling speedily to the ground, when, by their wicked works, they were denying they had heard them. Let us behold in them a kind of leaping of locusts; All the words, which the Lord hath said, will we both do and hear. [Ex. 19, 8] But let us see how they speedily fall to the ground; Would we had died in Egypt, and not in this vast wilderness. Would we may perish, and that the Lord may not lead us into that land. [Numb. 14, 2] They were therefore locusts, because they used to leap in their words, but fall in their doings.
46. By the name of ‘locusts’ is the Gentile people also designated, as Solomon witnesses, who says; The almond tree shall flourish, the locust shall become fat, the caper tree shall he destroyed. [Eccles. 12, 5] For the almond shows its blossom before all other trees. And what are designated by the flower of the almond, except the beginnings of Holy Church? which expanded the primitive flowers of virtues in her preachers, and, in order to bring forth the fruits of good works, preceded the saints which were to come, as shrubs which were to follow. And in this was the locust soon made fat; because the dry barrenness of the Gentile world was watered by the fatness of heavenly grace. The caper tree is destroyed; because when the Gentile world attained, on its call, the grace of faith, Judaea, remaining in its barrenness, lost the course of good living. Hence it is said again by the same Solomon; The locust hath no king, and they go forth, all of them, by their bands. [Prov. 30, 27] Because, namely, the Gentile world was forsaken, while it continued estranged from the Divine government, but yet, afterwards marshalled in order, it proceeded to the battle of faith against opposing spirits.
47. By the word ‘locust’ is expressed the tongue of the flatterer; as the plagues of Egypt, displayed from heaven, attest; which were once inflicted in a bodily manner, as their deserts demanded; but signified spiritually, what evils smite day by day the minds of the wicked. For it is written; A burning wind was bringing up the locusts, which went up over all the land of Egypt, and covered the whole face of the earth, laying waste all things. The herb of the land, therefore, was devoured, and whatever fruit was on the trees. [Ex. 10, 13-15] For Egypt was affected by these plagues, in order that being roused, and smarting thereby from an outward blow, it might consider, what losses of devastation it was enduring by inward neglect, and that, while it beheld things most trifling, but more highly esteemed, perishing without, it might feel, through looking at them, the heavier losses it had sustained within. But what do locusts, which injure the fruits of men more than any other smaller animals, portend by their signification, but the tongues of flatterers, which corrupt the mind of earthly men, if they ever observe them producing any good fruits, by praising them too immoderately? For the fruit of the Egyptians is the doings of the vain-glorious, which locusts destroy, when flattering tongues incline the heart of him who does them to seek for transitory praises. But the locusts eat up the grass, whenever any flatterers extol with applauses the words of speakers. They devour also the fruits of the trees, when by empty praises they weaken even the doings of some who now seem to be strong.
48. By the name ‘locust’ is designated by comparison the Resurrection of our Redeemer. Whence it is said also by the Prophet in His voice; I am cast out as the locust. [Ps. 109, 23] For He submitted to be held by His persecutors, even unto death, but He was cast forth as a locust, because He flew away from their hands by the leap of a sudden resurrection.
49. Which can be referred also to the body of preachers. For He was cast out in them as a locust, because, while Judaea was raging in its persecution, as they fly into different directions, they leaped, as it were, into their retreat. But because that preacher is raised to the height of perfection, who is made firm, not only by the active, but also by the contemplative life; this very perfection of preachers is rightly expressed by ‘locusts,’ which, as often as they endeavour to raise themselves into the air, first impel and raise themselves with their legs, and afterwards fly with their wings. Thus doubtless are holy men, who, when they aim at heavenly things, rely in the first place on the good works of active life, and afterwards raise themselves in flight to sublime truths by the spring of contemplation. They plant their legs firmly, and spread their wings, because they strengthen themselves by good doings, and are exalted to lofty things by their way of life. But, while dwelling in this life, they cannot remain long in divine contemplation, but, as if like locusts, they catch themselves on their feet from the leap they have given, when, after the sublimities of contemplation, they return to the necessary doings of active life; but yet are not content to remain in the same active life. But when they eagerly spring forth to contemplation, they again, as it were, seek the air in flight: and they pass their life, like locusts, soaring up and sinking down, while they ever unceasingly endeavour to behold the highest objects, and are thrown back on themselves by the weight of their corruptible nature.
50. There is a still further resemblance which locusts bear to holy preachers. For, in the morning hours, that is, at the time of moderate heat, they hardly raise themselves from the earth. But, when the heat has blazed forth, they soar aloft, the higher the more cheerfully they fly. But every holy preacher, when he beholds quiet periods of the faith, appears lowly and contemptible, and, like a locust, hardly rises, as it were, from the earth. But if the heat of persecution should wax warm, clinging in his heart to heavenly things, he soon shows how great is his sublimity: and he who seemed before to have quietly sunk to rest below, now flaps his wings, and is hurried aloft. Of that horse, therefore, that is, His preacher, the Lord says to blessed Job, Wilt thou rouse him as the locusts? Thou understandest, As I, Who by exciting raise him up to higher objects, as I suffer him to be tortured by a fiercer fire of persecution; in order that his virtue may be more strong and wakeful, when the cruelty of unbelievers dashes itself against him more furiously.
But when a holy preacher suffers many things without, when he is tortured by the dire assault of persecutions; who can discern what it is that he beholds within, who feels not his many losses without? For were there not wonderful encouragements to supply him with health within, those torments, which are applied outwardly, would doubtless reach to his heart. But his mind raises itself aloft on the citadel of hope, and therefore it fears not the weapons of the siege which has been laid to it. Whence also in this place, the Lord, in order to show what sweet odours this horse inhales within, when suffering outwardly so many adversities, rightly adds,
The glory of his nostrils is terror.
51. In Holy Scripture by the word ‘nostrils,’ is understood sometimes folly, sometimes the instigation of the ancient enemy, but sometimes foreknowledge. For folly is sometimes designated by ‘nostrils,’ as we have already taught before, on the evidence of Solomon; who says; A ring of gold in a swine’s nostril is a beautiful and foolish woman. [Prov. 11, 22] By the name ‘nostrils’ are understood the exhaling snares and instigation of the ancient enemy; which the Lord witnesses concerning him in this very book, saying; From his nostrils proceedeth smoke. [Job 41, 20] As if He said, From his perverse instigation arises a mist of most wicked thought in the heart of men, by which the eyes of those who see are darkened. Foreknowledge is also designated by ‘nostrils,’ as is said by the Prophet; Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; because he himself is counted lofty. [Is. 2, 22] For we often detect by the smell that, which we see not, so that some things, even when lying far off, become known to us by the fragrance of their nature. And, when we draw our breath through our nostrils, we frequently foreknow some things, even when not seen. The breath of our Redeemer is, therefore, said to be in His nostrils; in order, namely, that His knowledge might be pointed out to exist in foreknowledge; because whatever things He declared that He knew in the nature of His Manhood, He doubtless foreknew before all ages by His Godhead. And, whence He possessed the breath in His nostrils, He immediately subjoined by the Prophet, saying; Because He Himself is counted lofty. As if He were saying; He foresaw from above, what would come to pass below; because He came from heaven to earth. Holy men likewise, because they have believed what they heard from Him, foresee themselves also what things are to come; and, while they faithfully obey His precepts, wait for His coming with certain hope. Whence also in this place, by the nostrils of this horse are designated the foreknowledge and expectation of a holy preacher. For while he seeks for the last judgment to arrive, for the heavenly country to be manifested, and for the rewards to be paid to the righteous, he draws, as it were, through his nostrils a breath from what is to come.
52. But the glory of his nostrils is terror; because the unrighteous dreads the coming of the vision of the strict Judge, which the righteous earnestly expects. For he, considering his labour, looks for the reward of retribution, and, knowing the merit of his cause, seeks for the presence of his Judge; and most ardently desires Him to come in flame of fire, inflicting vengeance on the ungodly, and granting the godly, in recompense, the sight of His contemplation. But he, who calls to mind his unrighteousness, shudders at coming to judgment, and dreads the examination of his actions: because he knows, that, if they are inquired into, he is convicted. The glory, therefore, of his nostrils is terror; because the righteous glories on the same ground as the sinner is convicted. Let us behold the horse, how he already draws through his nostrils a breath from those things which as yet he sees not; let us behold with what glory he is elated, when he is waiting for things that are yet to come. Behold the illustrious preacher, in looking at his labours, exclaims; I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my dissolution is at hand. I have fought a good fight; I have finished my course; I have kept the faith. Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me in that day. [2 Tim. 4, 6-8] Where also he fitly subjoins; But not to me only, but to those also who love His coming. As if he said; But to all also, who are conscious to themselves of good works. For none love the coming of the Judge, except those who know that they have in their cause the merit of righteousness. Because, therefore, the righteous boasts for the same reason, that the unrighteous is alarmed, let it be rightly said; The glory of his nostrils is terror. But let us hear, how this holy preacher meanwhile acts when placed in this life, whilst he is waiting for the coming glory, whilst striving to come before the face of his Judge, and whilst he is still put off from the reward of his labour.
