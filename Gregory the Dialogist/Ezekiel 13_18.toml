To put cushions under every elbow is to cherish with bland flatteries souls that are falling from their uprightness and reclining themselves in this worldâ€™s enjoyment. For it is as though the elbow of a recumbent person rested on a cushion and his head on pillows, when the hardness of reproof is withdrawn from one who sins, and when the softness of favor is offered to him, that he may lie softly in error, while no roughness of contradiction troubles him.
