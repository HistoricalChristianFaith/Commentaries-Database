But what does it mean that they then seek oil from the wise, except that at the coming of the judge, when they find themselves empty within, they seek testimony from without? As if, deceived by their own confidence, they say to their neighbors: Since you see us being rejected as if without works, tell us what you saw of our works. But the wise virgins answer, saying: "Lest perhaps there be not enough for us and for you." For on that day (though I speak of certain ones resting in the peace of the Church) the testimony of each one barely suffices for oneself; how much less for both oneself and one's neighbor?
