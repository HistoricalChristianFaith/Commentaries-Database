A mind sleeps with no care to worry it, and [it] is beaten and feels no pain when it does not foresee impending evils and so, too, is unaware of those it has committed. It is drawn â€¦ yet without feeling it. It is attracted by the allurements of vices, and yet [it] does not arouse itself to its selfdefense. But at the same time it wishes to be awake in order to find wine, that is, though it is so weighed down in its languid sleep as not to keep watch over itself, nevertheless, it still tries to be awake to the cares of the world, so as ever to inebriate itself with pleasures. And when it is asleep to that whereto it should be vigilantly awake, it wishes to be awake to something else, in regard to which it might have been laudably asleep. .

The soul that sleeps with no worries is beaten and feels no pain. Since it does not foresee impending evils, so neither is it aware of those which it has perpetrated. It is drawn without feeling because it is led by the allurements of vices, and yet it is not roused to keep guard over itself. But at the same time it wishes to awake in order to again find wine, because, although weighed down by the sleep of its inactivity in keeping guard over itself, it still strives to be awake to the cares of the world, that it may always be drunk with pleasures. And, while it is asleep to that which it ought to have been wisely awake, it desires to be awake to something else, to which it might laudably have been asleep.
