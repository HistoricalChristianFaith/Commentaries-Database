Hom. in Ev., i. 7. 2: “Crying in the desert,” because he shows to deserted and forlorn Judaea the approaching consolation of her Redeemer.
Hom. in Ev. i. 20. 3: Every one who preacheth right faith and good works, prepares the Lord’s way to the hearts of the hearers, and makes His paths straight, in cleansing the thoughts by the word of good preaching.
