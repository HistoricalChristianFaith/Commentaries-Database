14. Up to this point, because the divine word has spoken about Saul as chosen and good, as was said above, it seemed reasonable that what was said about him should be taken in a good sense, both historically and morally. But now, because we have come to the place of his transgression, it is certainly necessary that we also see in him the things that are to be avoided. But what ought ever to have seemed more carefully to be avoided by all the elect than the evil of pride and disobedience? For this cast down the sublimity of the first angel; this laid low the glory of the lost spirits. This took away happiness from the first man; this brought on the perpetual miseries of human captivity. And behold, to the first angel and the first man, the first king of the chosen people is joined through disobedience, so that while the great fall, the least may be raised up. For we are rightly raised up if we both observe their falls and avoid them. Therefore, where Saul fell must be carefully considered. For Samuel had said to him above: "You shall go down before me to Gilgal. I indeed will come down to you, so that you may offer a holocaust and an oblation, and sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you, and I will show you what you are to do" (1 Kings 10:20). He fell through disobedience, therefore, because he did not wait the full seven days, as he had been commanded. For in the same place it is immediately added: (Verse 10.) "And when he had finished offering the holocaust, behold, Samuel was arriving."
