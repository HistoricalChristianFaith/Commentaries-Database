24.  It is necessary to bear in mind, that the ‘strength’ of the righteous is of one sort, and the strength of the reprobate of another.  For the strength of the righteous is to subdue the flesh, to thwart our own wills, to annihilate the gratification of the present life, to be in love with the roughnesses of this world for the sake of eternal rewards, to set at nought the allurements of prosperity, to overcome the dread of adversity in our hearts.  But the strength of the reprobate is to have the affection unceasingly set on transitory things, to hold out with insensibility against the strokes of our Creator, not even by adversity to be brought to cease from the love of temporal things, to go on to the attainment of vain glory even with waste of life, to search out larger measures of wickedness, to attack the life of the good, not only with words and by behaviour, but even with weapons, to put their trust in themselves, to perpetrate iniquity daily without any diminution of desire, Hence it is that it is said by the Psalmist to the Elect, Be of good courage, and let your heart be strengthened, all ye that hope in the Lord. [Ps 31, 24]  Hence it is declared by the Prophet to the reprobate, Woe unto you that are mighty to drink urine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink. [Is. 5, 22]  Hence it is declared by Solomon, that all the holy without any weakening of desire contemplate the interior rest.  Behold his bed, which is Solomon's, threescore valiant men are about it, of the most valiant of Israel. [Cant. 3, 7]  Hence the Psalmist directing his meaning against the children of perdition in the voice of the Redeemer in His Passion, saith, Lo, they have surprised my soul: the mighty have rushed forth against me. [Ps. 59, 3]  How well did Isaiah comprehend both sorts of strength in the words, But they that wait upon the Lord shall change [mutabunt E.V. marg.] their strength. [Is. 40, 31]  For in that he said not they will ‘take,’ but they will ‘change,’ he clearly made known that that which is laid aside is of one sort, and that which is entered upon of another sort.
25.  Are not the reprobate also ‘strong,’ who take such pains in running after the concupiscence of this world, boldly expose themselves to perils, welcome insults for the sake of gain, never give back from the lust of their appetites conquered by any opposition, grow obdurate with scourges, and for the sake of the world undergo the ills of the world, and so to say in seeking the pleasures thereof are parting with them, nor yet in parting with them ever weary.  Whence it is well said by Jeremiah in the voice of mankind, He hath made me drunken with wormwood. [Lam. 3, 15]  For one that is drunk knows nothing what he is undergoing.  He then is ‘drunken with wormwood,’ who alienated from the faculty of reason through the love of the present life, whilst whatsoever he undergoes for the sake of the world he accounts but light, is blind to the bitterness of the toil which he is enduring, in that in enjoyment he is led on to the several things in which in chastisement he is wearied out.  But on the other hand the righteous man makes it his aim to be weak for undergoing the perils of the world for the world's sake, looks to his own end, marks how transitory the present life is, and refuses to undergo toils without for the sake of that, the enjoyment of which he has overcome within.  Let blessed Job then, pressed by the adversities of the present life, say in his own voice, yea, in the voice of all the righteous, What is my strength that I should hold up?  And what is mine end that I should deal patiently?  As if he made it known in plain words, saying, ‘I cannot submit to the ills of the world for the sake of the world, for now I am no longer strong in the desire thereof.  For while I look to the end of the present life, why do I bear the burthen of that, the longing for which I tread under my feet?’  And because the unrighteous severally, as we have said, bear the toils thereof with stronger resolution in proportion as they feed with greater avidity on its enjoyment, therefore he rightly subjoins without delay that same strength of the reprobate.
