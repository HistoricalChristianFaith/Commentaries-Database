The church says of its weak members, “They have put me as a guard in the vineyards; my own vineyard I have not guarded.” Our vineyards are our deeds, and we cultivate them by our daily labor. We are put as guards in the vineyards, but we do not cultivate our own. When we are involved with external affairs, we neglect to watch over our own activities.
