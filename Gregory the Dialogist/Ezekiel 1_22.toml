"And the likeness over the heads of the living creatures was of a firmament, like the appearance of terrible crystal, stretched above their heads."

With the Lord's generosity, we shall explain these things in two ways, so that we may leave it to the reader's judgment to decide what should be chosen. For by the name of firmament, the heavenly powers can be understood. This firmament is rightly said to be like the appearance of crystal, because crystal is indeed exceedingly strong, yet it is solidified from water. And the angelic nature, when it was created, received free will—whether it wished to persist in humility and remain in the sight of almighty God, or whether it would slip into pride and fall from blessedness—it was like water by comparison. But because, while others were falling, the holy angels persisted in their blessedness, and received this as a gift, that they could no longer fall at all, their nature in them, because it can no longer be led about changeably, was hardened as if into the solidity of crystal. This crystal is said to be terrible and stretched out over the heads of the living creatures, because those angelic powers which stand in the presence of almighty God are terrifying and fearful to us who are still placed in this corruption. Their joys, because they exceed the perception of our minds, are said to be above the heads of the living creatures. For who, placed in corruptible flesh, could comprehend what that ineffable and endless joy of the angels might be? What blessedness it is, to see the face of the Creator without failing, and to persist in delight in Him without change?

However, by the name of firmament, our Redeemer himself can be understood figuratively—true God above all things, and made perfect man among all things, in whom our nature has been confirmed with the Father. Of whom it is also said prophetically through the Psalmist: "Let your hand be upon the man of your right hand, and upon the son of man whom you have confirmed for yourself." For human nature, before it was taken up by the Creator of all things, was earth; for it was not firmament. Indeed, to sinful man it was said: "You are earth, and to earth you shall go." But after it was assumed by the Author of all things, and raised up into the heavens, and led above the angels, that which was earth became firmament. But what likeness the firmament that is seen has is added below, when it says: "As the appearance of terrible crystal." Crystal, as has been said, congeals from water and becomes solid. Indeed we know how great is the mobility of water. But the body of our Redeemer, because it was subject to sufferings even unto death, was in some way similar to water, because by being born, growing, becoming weary, hungering, thirsting, dying, it ran movably through moments of time up to his passion. The Prophet, beholding this course, says: "He rejoiced as a giant to run his way." But because through the glory of his resurrection he recovered from his very corruption into the power of incorruption, as if in the manner of crystal he hardened from water, so that in him there was this same nature, and yet in it the mutability of corruption that had formerly existed was no more. Therefore water was turned into crystal when the weakness of his corruption was changed through his resurrection into the firmness of incorruption.

But it should be noted that this crystal is called terrible, that is, fearsome. Yet who does not know how great is the beauty of crystal? And it is wondrous how in this crystal beauty comes together with fear. But to all who know the truth it is certain that when the Redeemer of the human race appears as judge, He will be both beautiful to the just and terrible to the unjust. For He whom the elect behold as gentle, this same one the reprobate see as fearsome and terrible. But the elect will not then see Him as terrible, because now they do not cease to consider His terror. For they carefully consider how terrible He comes to judgment, they weep over past sins, they avoid impending ones; they place His fear daily before the eyes of their mind, and without ceasing they are apprehensive of how tremendous He will appear, and by fearing daily they act so that when He comes they will not be terrified. Therefore the likeness above the heads of the living creatures of a firmament was like the appearance of terrible crystal. And because that very fear of Him, which they hold in their thoughts, protects their minds, it is rightly added: Stretched out over their heads above. This firmament which appears in the likeness of crystal above the heads of those living creatures is both terrible and stretched out, because it protects the minds of the good from the same source whence it terrifies them. For if He were not fearsome in their hearts, He would not be their protector now from sins and afterward from punishments. But because they always consider what fear threatens from the judgment, they keep the wings of their virtues in uprightness.
