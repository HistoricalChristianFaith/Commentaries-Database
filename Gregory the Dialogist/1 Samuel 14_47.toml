The kingdom is indeed weakened when pastors fall into certain faults. But the weakened kingdom is strengthened when through the satisfaction of penance they are raised up to the work of great virtue. And it is said to be strengthened over Israel, because as one advances to the height of life, he surpasses by his conduct those whom he exceeds in rank. He is set over those who see God, but he is raised above those who see God when he is taken up beyond all others in divine contemplation. Rightly therefore it is said: "He fought against all his enemies, and wherever he turned he prevailed," because he who contemplates eternal things more deeply easily crushes whatever comes against him from below to fight. For since no earthly things now please him who reigns through great charity over Israel, that is, in heavenly things, wherever he turns, he prevails. For what can the malignant spirit suggest to him who considers no earthly things, who no longer loves any joys of the world? The teacher fights when he preaches, but he prevails, because what he prohibits in preaching from touching worldly delight, he persuades by the virtue of his conduct. And because he is said to fight on every side against his enemies, his victory is shown to be one of great praise. He teaches that the teacher is perfect on every side who has the strongest enemies on every side. Therefore when he is said to turn and prevail everywhere, how great is the glory proclaimed of him? What then does it mean that he is said to have enemies on every side, except that malignant spirits lie in ambush against all our senses? For they deceive some through speech, others through sight. Some they mislead through hearing, others through taste or smell. Still others they strive to drag into impurities through the snares of enticing delight or thought. To some they outwardly present obscene things, which they may then pursue by deliberation of the mind. But to show this encirclement more accurately: when they drag one toward pleasant things, they set their ambush as if on the right. When they cast another down through adversity, they press in as if from the left. When they invite us to past pleasures, they thrust us down as if from behind. They meet others as if from the front, because they often show to the minds of the weak the length of a strict way of life, as though giving counsel. For they come from the front because they do not allow souls to advance toward heaven. Therefore we have enemies on every side, because before, behind, on the right and on the left we endure the battle of malignant spirits. Hence the blessed apostle Peter also exhorts us, saying: "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour; resist him, steadfast in the faith" (1 Peter 5:8).

But now we know the circuit of war; let us see how kings conquer by going around. They indeed conquer in the circuit who guard their tongue, and mouth, and eyes, and all the members of the body from unlawful action. For while they perfectly fortify the tongue through silence, they are, as it were, victors on one side; and while they see with their eyes things which they disdain to covet, they become victors on another side. Often too they hear evil things and repel them, and because they reject what is harmful, they triumph by rejecting it. Therefore they are victors in all their senses who refuse to be subjected to malign spirits through any one of them. But also when an unfit thought is presented to the heart, the enemy who is rejected is crushed. For he who casts away whatever is harmful powerfully presses down the enemy. And because he likewise despises pleasant things and does not fear adverse things, does not return to the perverse things he once left behind, and fervently runs toward heavenly things, he is shown to overcome the enemies whom he suffers round about. Among these adversaries indeed, because the ambushes set against the five bodily senses are signified, they are fittingly expressed by the number five. 'Against Moab', he says, 'and the sons of Ammon, and Edom, and the king of Zobah, and the Philistines.'

For he who named the five nations designated the deceits of demons opposed to the five senses of the body. But because a teacher fights not only by living but also by teaching, when he disputes against all vices, when he slays them with the sword of the word in the minds of his hearers, he is surely seen to fight on every side, and wherever he turns, to overcome. But certain ones are specially named which principally stand against him: Against Moab, he says, and the sons of Ammon, Edom, and the king of Zobah, and the Philistines. Moab is interpreted "from the father," Ammon "people of sorrow," Edom "red," Zobah "burning" or "converting," Philistine "falling by the cup." For what is expressed by these names but the stages of the worst life? In Moab indeed, who is called "from the father," concupiscence is designated. In the reprobate mind, because it is planted by the devil, it is as though begotten from a father. But what is shown by Ammon, who is interpreted "people of sorrow," except the frequency of evil works? For because they are many, they are called a people, and because they lead each reprobate to the bitterness of eternal mourning, they are rightly named the people of sorrow. But Edom, who is called "red," what does he suggest but the excessive fervor of sinning? For first one becomes accustomed to sin, then through the habit of sinning advances to an increase of fervor, so that he dares to sin more often, and what he redoubles by daring, he always desires to repeat more ardently. By this ardor of sinning it comes about that in the reprobate mind whatever of virtue or good work had flourished is burned up. Therefore "burning" is described after Edom in the spiritual war, because such is the fall of the lost mind that when it fervently strives to heap up evils, it is despoiled of all goods as though consumed by fire and reduced to nothing. Zobah is also called "converting," because fervent sin both removes the image of God from the reprobate mind and reshapes it into the likeness of the apostate angel. Of which it is already said by divine sentence: When the wicked comes into the depth of evils, he despises (Prov. 18:3). The proud mind now scorns the divine commandments and subjects itself to carnal desires. Who then is the king of Zobah, except he of whom it is said to blessed Job by the Lord: He is king over all the children of pride (Job 41:2)? But the Philistines, who fall by the cup, who are they except those who are drunk with all the above-mentioned evils? Who so forget heavenly things that they seem to awaken to them either scarcely or never. By Moab, therefore, the concupiscence of the flesh is expressed; by Ammon, the frequent practice of evil operation; by Edom, the burning desire of sinning; by Zobah, the devastation and burning of virtues; by the Philistines, the forgetfulness of heavenly things. When therefore the chosen teacher seeks to lead someone out from the midst of so many snares, what a great contest of virtue does he undertake! And because from every stage of this perdition they return to repentance through the labor of teachers, wherever he turns he is said to overcome. For by preaching he sometimes slays concupiscence in someone's heart, sometimes the habit of wicked operation. Now he draws those who had passed into the habit of sinning, now those who, with their virtues burned up and reduced to nothing, were serving their king the devil as though set ablaze. And because by preaching he recalls heavenly things to mind, he rouses those falling by the cup and forgetful of heavenly things to the pursuit of the spiritual life, and inflames them ardently through love. Rightly therefore it is said: Wherever he turned, he overcame.
