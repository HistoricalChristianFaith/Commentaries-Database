65.  We must mark what he had said before, And the inspiration [‘spiritus,’ as before] of the words of thy mouth is multiplied.  But now when the fathers are brought to mind, he says, They shall utter words out of their heart.  As though heretics abhorring the life of Holy Church said, ‘Thou hast abundance of inspiration in thy mouth, in thy heart thou hast none of it.  But they are to be heard in opposition, who, in uttering words from the heart, have taught the right thing by living like it.’  But oftentimes the wicked, whereas the evil of their own crookedness is unknown to them, boldly pull in pieces the uprightness of others, and while they usurp to themselves authority of pronouncing rebukes against good men, they either deliver those good sentiments, which they have imbibed not by seeing but by hearing them, or else with lying lips lay that evil to the charge of others, which they are themselves guilty of committing.  But when they give utterance to good thoughts, which they scorn to observe, it is to be remarked that very frequently Truth so speaks by the lips of her adversaries, that in putting their tongue in motion it smites their life.  So that in telling of the highest perfection of righteousness while they know nothing of it, they themselves are rendered at once both judges by their words and accusers by their deeds. 
Hence Bildad subjoins words of wondrous truth against hypocrites, but he is running himself through with the point of his discourse.  For unless he were himself in some slight degree a pretender of righteousness, he would never venture to teach a good man with so much temerity.  And indeed they are words of singular force that he speaks, but they ought to have been addressed to fools, not to a wise man; to the wicked, not to a good person; in that he proclaims himself no less than insane, who, when the gardens are parched, pours water into the river.  But in the mean time, laying aside the question to whom the thing is said, let us weigh well and minutely what it is that is said, that the sentiments delivered may edify ourselves, even though they assail the character of their Author.
