We are said to answer anyone, when we work in a way answerable to what another requires. Thus, in that change the Lord “calls,” and a person “answers.” Thus, before the brightness of the Incorrupt, humankind is shown forth as incorrupt even after being corrupted. For now so long as we are subject to corruption, we do not in any way “answer” our Creator, seeing that whereas corruption is far from incorruption, there is no similarity suitable to our answering. But of that change it is written, “When he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is.” Then, therefore, we shall truly “answer God,” who “calls,” when at the bidding of the supreme Incorruption we shall arise incorruptible.
