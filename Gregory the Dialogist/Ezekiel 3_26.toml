This is what is meant: The word of preaching is taken away from you. As the people provoke me by their deeds, they are not worthy to have the encouragement of the truth. We cannot easily recognize whose vice causes the word to be withdrawn from the preacher. We know indeed that the shepherd’s silence is sometimes harmful to him, but that it is always harmful to those subject to him.

"And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, and you shall be mute, not like a man who rebukes, because it is a rebellious house."

Therefore, the knowledge of the preachers is then compelled to be silent to the reprobate. Hence it is also added here: "And I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, and you shall be mute, and not as a man who rebukes, because it is a provoking house." But because, when Enoch and Elijah preach, many of those who then remain from the Jews in unbelief return to the knowledge of truth, just as it is said of the same Elijah: "Elijah will come, and he will restore all things," who are both called through Zechariah two olive trees, and through John two candlesticks, rightly here also it is added: "But when I shall have spoken to you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them: Thus says the Lord God."

Hence here also it is fittingly added: "And I will make your tongue cling to your palate, and you shall be mute, and not as a man who rebukes, because it is a provoking house."

Sometimes indeed the Lord also kindles the hearts of preachers with zeal for Himself against the tongues of those who resist, so that they may not be silent, but may press down the sayings of the deceitful with words of truth.

But the words which are immediately added require great consideration: "And I will make your tongue cleave to your palate, and you will be mute, nor like a man rebuking, because it is a provoking house." For we must discern whether the word of preaching is withdrawn only on account of evil hearers, or sometimes also on account of the fault of the one preaching.

For this matter, when considered, is distinguished by four qualities. For sometimes the word is taken away from good teachers on account of bad hearers. Sometimes, however, the word is given even to bad teachers on account of good hearers. Sometimes, moreover, for the justification of both those teaching and those hearing, the word is given to good teachers, so that they themselves may grow through merit, and their hearers may advance in understanding and life. Sometimes, however, because neither are those worthy to receive to whom the word of teaching is brought forth, nor are those worthy to bring forth the word of teaching who hold the position of teaching, the word of preaching is taken away, so that both parties may be strictly judged. For on account of bad hearers the word is taken away from good teachers, just as it is now said to Ezekiel: "I will make your tongue cling to the roof of your mouth, and you will be mute, not like a man who rebukes, because it is a rebellious house." And as it is said to Paul: "Make haste and go out quickly from Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me." And as when the apostles wished to preach in Asia, it is written that the Spirit of Jesus forbade them. On account of good hearers the word is given even to bad teachers, just as the Lord says of the Pharisees: "Whatever they tell you, observe and do, but do not act according to their works; for they speak and do not act." For the merit of those teaching and the justification of those hearing, the word of teaching is also granted, just as it is said to the holy apostles: "Go and teach all nations." But on account of bad hearers and the unworthy life of those who ought to have taught, the word of teaching is withdrawn, just as Eli did not have a word of strict rebuke for correcting his sons, because both his negligence and the life of his sons demanded that the people should fall along with them, and the ark of the Lord, captured, should pass over to the foreigners. For it is a great grace of almighty God when a harsh word of rebuke is brought forth by teachers against those acting wickedly. Against which it is now said: "And you will be mute, not like a man who rebukes." For he would have rebuked the transgressors if they had been worthy of that grace of rebuke itself.

But since there is such great diversity of merits in teaching and in silence that it cannot easily be known whether the word of teaching is withdrawn because of the fault of the hearer or of him who seems to hold the place of teaching, what else are we commanded but to always preserve humility in doubtful matters? So that when we are able to speak we are not exalted, lest perhaps this very grace of our speaking was bestowed not on us but on our hearers; and again when we are not able to speak, those who have been committed to us should by no means judge us, lest perhaps we are unable to speak not because of our own sin but because of the sin of the hearers. Therefore all things concerning our merits are uncertain to us for this purpose: that we may hold fast to one certain grace—humility—so that when we speak, we may consider this to be from the gift of almighty God and your merit. And when we fall silent from the word of teaching, although it may be our fault, yet you should believe this to be especially yours, so that when we mutually attribute evils to ourselves and goods to others, through this very grace of humility it may come about that the word of teaching which had been taken away may return.

And again, because of the fault of those subject to them, the voice of preachers is forbidden, as the Lord says to Ezekiel: "I will make your tongue cleave to your palate, and you shall be mute, and not as a man who rebukes, because it is a provoking house." As if he were to say openly: Therefore the word of preaching is taken from you, because while the people provoke me in their actions, they are not worthy to receive the exhortation of truth. From whose fault, therefore, the word is withdrawn from the preacher is not easily known. But it is known most certainly that the silence of the Pastor sometimes harms himself, but always harms those subject to him.
