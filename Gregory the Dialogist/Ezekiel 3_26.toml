This is what is meant: The word of preaching is taken away from you. As the people provoke me by their deeds, they are not worthy to have the encouragement of the truth. We cannot easily recognize whose vice causes the word to be withdrawn from the preacher. We know indeed that the shepherdâ€™s silence is sometimes harmful to him, but that it is always harmful to those subject to him.
