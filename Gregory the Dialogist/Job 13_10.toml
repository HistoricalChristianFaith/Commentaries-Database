40.  This part, wherein He declares that ‘the face of God is taken in secret,’ may be understood in two ways.  For there be some, who at one and the same time perceive truth in their hearts, and yet utter outwardly concerning God things that are false.  For lest they should appear to be subdued, they both know the truth within, and yet assail it without.  Hence it is well said in this place, He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly take His face.  As if it were expressed in plain words; ‘Ye are the more to be blamed in His sight for falsehood, as ye see in yourselves what is true.’  And there become, who when they turn back into the interior, contemplate the justice and righteousness of God, and in praying and weeping tremble with fear, but after the hour of contemplation has passed by, they return with as much boldness to their wickednesses, as if, being placed behind His back, they were not seen by the light of His righteousness.  And so these with themselves in secret ‘take God’s face’ as if it saw with a bodily sight, in that both, when they are present to Him, they flatter Him with their tears, and, when they are as it were gone from His sight, they make slight of Him by their practices.  And these deserve to be beaten more for their evil doings, even in proportion as in the secret of their hearts they know the righteous judgments of God.
