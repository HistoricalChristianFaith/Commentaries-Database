Fear had no power to raise us from the death of sin, but the infused grace of meekness erected us to the seat of life. This is well denoted by Elisha when he raised the child of the Shunammite. He, when he sent his servant with a staff, never restored life to the dead child at all. But, on coming in his own person, spreading himself on the dead body and contracting himself to its limbs, and walking to and fro and breathing seven times into the mouth of the dead body, he forthwith quickened it to the light of new life through the ministering of compassion. For God, the Creator of humankind, as it were grieved for his dead Son, when he beheld us with compassion, killed by the sting of iniquity. And having put forth the terror of the Law by Moses, he, as it were, sent the rod by the servant. But the servant could not raise the dead body with the staff, because, as Paul bears witness, “The law made nothing perfect.” But when he came in his own person and spread himself in humility on the body, he contracted himself to match the limbs of the dead body to himself. “Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God, but made himself of no reputation, and took on him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of humankind; and found in fashion as a man.” … He breathes on the dead body seven times, in that by the publishing of the divine gift, he bestows the Spirit of sevenfold grace on those who lie prostrate in the death of sin. And afterwards it is raised up alive, in that the child, whom the rod of terror could not raise up, has been brought back to life by the Spirit of love.
