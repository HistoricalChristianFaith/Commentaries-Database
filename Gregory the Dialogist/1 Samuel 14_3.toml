For Achias in our language means "shade" [umbraculum]. But what is designated by "shade" in this place, if not protection? Those therefore who in holy Church protect any of the lesser ones from hidden adversaries are rightly designated by the shade. But one who sits under a shade cannot feel the heat of the sun. Why indeed are shades spoken of in sacred eloquence, unless because they also point to a wicked sun, by which the freshness of the mind is scorched? Of this sun indeed the Truth speaks in the division of the seeds: 'When the sun rose, they withered' (Matt. 13:6). For the burning heat of desire is a sun, which gleams as if with light, but which scorches the mind upon which it shines. Therefore, when by the exhortations of our superiors we reject the enticements of all desires, where else are we sheltered but under a pleasant shade, where we may escape the fires of temptations? But diminutively the minister of the Church is called a shade, so that no one may be compared to the Redeemer. For of His protection the bride glories in the Canticles, saying: 'Under the shadow of him whom I had desired, I sat' (Song of Sol. 2:3). And the Psalmist entreating says: 'Under the shadow of your wings protect me' (Ps. 16:9). But whence this great Achias comes forth is explained, because he is recorded as the son of Achitob. Achitob means "my brother is good." Who then is understood as this good brother, if not our Redeemer? A brother indeed, because He is a partaker of our nature; but good, because He freed our nature, which He assumed, from eternal death. Or good, because we are all evil, as He Himself says: 'If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children' (Matt. 7:11). Achias therefore is called the son of Achitob, so that those who are powerful in the Church may be understood to possess their power solely from the imitation of the Redeemer. Moreover, the same Achitob is declared the brother of Ichabod, because he is named after the translation of glory. For our Redeemer according to the flesh was born of the Jewish people. Since from that people all the ornament of the temple, all the rites of sacrifices, all the mysteries of the Scriptures passed over to the Gentile people, the translation of glory is rightly recalled in the brother of Achitob. This same Achitob is also said to have been the son of Phinehas, because the Jewish people, in the perfidy of its error in which it plunged itself, had teachers of its own nation far more wicked than itself. Hence the same Phinehas is interpreted as "silent mouth" or "sparing the mouth." He is called a mouth, because through that people the Lord spoke. But his mouth is now known to be silent, because when it rejected the Redeemer, it likewise lost the Spirit who once spoke through it. He is also rightly called "sparing the mouth," because he fell once into the guilt of so great blood that he can in no way be converted to Him through penitence and confession. He is therefore called "sparing the mouth," because he disdains to blush in pious confession. Against which blessed Job, in the person of the converted, promises, saying: 'I will not spare my mouth; I will speak in the tribulation of my spirit' (Job 7:11). But because that people likewise had the dignity of religion in its patriarchs and prophets, the same Phinehas is declared to have been born of Eli, priest of the Lord. For Eli means "my God," and Shiloh means "sent." But sometimes in holy Scripture the elect preachers are understood as "gods." Whence also the Lord says to Moses: 'I have made you a god to Pharaoh' (Exod. 7:1). And in the law He commands, saying: 'You shall not speak ill of the gods' (Exod. 22:28). Therefore the father of Phinehas is called "my God," because indeed the Jewish people imitates according to the letter the Scriptures of those who merited both to perceive the word of God with a revealed mind and to conceal it, as it were, in the container of the letter. Indeed the Truth showed these through Himself, when He expounded the words of the Psalmist, saying: 'He called them gods, to whom the word of God was spoken' (John 10:35). Moreover, he is declared to have been born in Shiloh, because the Jewish people, though carnally, is still nevertheless instructed in the spiritual Scriptures. Since therefore every chosen and wise person in holy Church follows through teaching the Lord born of the Jewish people, Achias, who is called "shade," is said to be the son of Achitob, brother of Ichabod, son of Phinehas, son of Eli. He is also described as wearing the ephod, so that it may be openly shown that one who does not shine with the beauty of a good way of life and with light can in no way protect others. There follows: (Verse 3.) 'But the people did not know where Jonathan had gone.'

What does it mean that the people did not know where Jonathan went, except that the chosen teacher strives to conceal through humility the things he intends to do? Hence in the Gospel the Lord also says: "Let not your left hand know what your right hand does" (Matt. 6:3). For if eternal things are figured by the right hand, and the present life by the left, we have men on the left and angels on the right. When, however, through good works we strive toward the fellowship of the citizens above, our right hand is said to be at work. And our left hand does not know the works of the right, if we have our co-workers — namely, the faithful of holy Church — as helpers in the work, yet refuse to have them as praisers leading to pride. Rightly, therefore, it is said: "The people did not know where Jonathan had gone," because we strive to do great things well only when we avoid displaying what we do for the sake of show. But since we bring these things forward as an example of the elect, we ought to examine attentively not only where he goes, but also by what way he goes. There follows: (Verse 4.) "Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to the garrison of the Philistines, there were prominent rocks on either side, and steep crags jutting out on both sides like teeth: the name of one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh."
