8.  For he would ‘depart from his innocency,’ if he reckoned good things of bad persons; as Solomon bears witness, who saith, He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the just, even they both are abomination to the Lord. [Prov. 17, 15]  For there are persons, who, whilst they extol with commendation deeds of men ill done, heighten that which they ought to have rebuked.  For hence it is said by the Prophet, Woe to those that sew pillows under every elbow of the hand, and make cushions under the head of every age. [Ez. 13, 18]  For a ‘pillow’ is put for this, that we may rest the easier.  Therefore whoever flatters persons doing wrongly is putting a pillow under the head or the elbow of one lying, so that the man that should have been chidden on account of sin, being stayed up therein by commendations, should rest at his ease.  Hence again it is written, And one built up a wall, and, lo, others daubed it. [ib. 10.]  For by the term of ‘a wall,’ the hardness of sin is denoted.  And so ‘to build up a wall’ is for a man to rear against himself barriers of sin; but they’ daub the wall,’ who flatter those that commit sins, that what the first by doing wickedly build, those same persons by spreading their flatteries should as it were make of bright colour.  But the holy man, as he does not think what is bad of the good, so he refuses to judge what is good of the bad; saying, God forbid that I should Judge you just: till I die, I will not depart from mine innocency.
