21.  For he ‘pays’ in torment for those desires, which he retained here contrary to right, and being consigned to avenging flames, he is always dying, in that he is always kept alive in death.  For he is never consumed in death, in that if his life in dying were consumed, his punishment likewise would be brought to an end together with his life; but that he may be tormented without end, he is forced to live on without end in punishment, that he whose life here was dead in sin, may have his death there living in punishment.  Let him say then; He shall pay for all the things that he hath done, nor yet shall he be consumed, forasmuch as he is tormented, and not put out, he dies and lives, he is falling away and holding on, always finishing, without being finished.  These things are very terrible in the healing of the ear only, how infinitely more terrible in the enduring of them!  Now because the multiplicity of his wickedness demands that he should never be without punishment, it is fitly added;
According to the multitude of his inventions shall he also suffer.
22.  For whereas he found out many things in order to sin, he is tormented with new inventions in punishment.  Since what he could not have suspected here, he is made sensible of there, when he is given over to vengeance.  For as the Elect in exercising themselves in good works, sometimes set themselves to do more than the Lord thought fit to bid them, (for virginity of the flesh is no where commanded, but only commended; since if it were commanded, then it would follow that wedlock must henceforth be deemed sin, and yet there are many strong in the virtue of virginity, so as to render more in service than they received in command,) so very commonly the wicked are each practised in bad ways, so that they find out in evil doing more for them to do than by the practice of the lost they received examples of wickedness.  And hence they are stricken with the torments of an ampler retribution, in that they too of their own heads invented practices on an ampler scale, which they deserve to be stricken for.  And so it is well said, According to the multitude of his inventions shall he also suffer.  For he would not find out new wickedness, except he also sought it; and he would not seek it, except he was eager to do it of set purpose.  Therefore in his tormenting the excessiveness of evil devising is taken into account, and he receives the pain of a worthy recompense.  And although the woe of all the damned is infinite, yet they have worse torments inflicted upon them, who invented many things in wicked ways by their desires as well.  Now since Zophar has brought in the punishment of this hypocrite, he immediately adds his sin, nor does he describe anyone in particular, but that from which all sins have their origin.  For it is written, Covetousness is the root of all evil. [1 Tim. 6, 10]  He then, whom covetousness is described as having dominion over, surely is proved to be subject to all evil propensities.
