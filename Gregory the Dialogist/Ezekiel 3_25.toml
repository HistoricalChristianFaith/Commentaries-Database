"And you, son of man, behold, chains have been placed upon you, and they shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out into their midst."

If we follow these words through the order of typological exposition, the prophet receives bonds in his house and is bound, because in the last days, when Judea shall have believed, she will experience the most grievous persecutions in the time of Antichrist, so that the ministers of iniquity will not receive his preaching, but by resisting will press it down with the bonds of sorrows. And he does not go out into their midst, because preaching does not reach the hearts of the wicked, while the tongue of the good, bound by tribulations, is silent. For there will be at that time many of the unbelieving Jews who will persecute those very ones from among the Jews who shall have believed. Hence it should be noted that here too it is said that the prophet endures bonds in his own house: so that it may be signified that Judea, even from her own people, when she shall have become faithful, will bear the tribulation of persecution. For as long as it is not believed that the Only-Begotten of the Most High Father, having become incarnate and died, rose again and ascended to the heavens, as is preached through the pages of Sacred Scripture, prophecy will certainly be bound among the Jews. If it had flowed into their understanding just as it was spoken, it would have had, as it were, the free steps of its preaching.

Hence it is also added: "And you, son of man, behold, bonds are placed upon you, and they shall bind you in them, and you shall not go out into the midst of them."

For when any preacher is brought back to the conscience of his own house, bonds are placed upon him, and he is bound in them, because the more he examines himself in thought, the more the soul of the just man recognizes how many infirmities of his mortality it is bound by. For unless Paul had seen himself bound, he would never have said: "Having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ." Hence it is said through the Psalmist: "That he might hear the groaning of those in bonds, and loose the children of the slain." And again: "Let the groaning of the fettered come before your sight." Often, however, when the soul now desires to go forth to contemplate the appearance of its Redeemer, when it sighs to be present among heavenly joys, it beholds and groans at the very bonds of its mortality by which it is still held bound in the present world. Hence it is that Jeremiah, beholding the subtle judgment of almighty God, says: "He has built against me so that I cannot go out; he has made heavy my fetters." For we have fetters, the very weakness and corruption of our mortality; but when tribulation and groaning are added to us, our very fetters are made heavier. And indeed, as long as the just man endures delays in this life, by speaking good things he hastens to benefit others; but when he beholds hardened minds and considers them occupied with contentions, he withholds the word of preaching. And he does not go forth in the midst of them, because he falls silent from the good things he could have spoken, as it is said through Paul: "Nothing through contention." And again: "If anyone wishes to be contentious, we have no such custom."

For what more is commended to us through the very words of the history than the virtue of obedience? When the prophet is commanded now to proceed to the transmigration by the river Chobar, now to go out to the plain, now to return from the plain to his house? So that first going forth by command, and a little later going out, and again returning home, and shutting himself in, he might always break the judgment of his own will according to the precept of the divine word, so that, suspended in the heavenly command, he might fulfill not his own will, but that of his Creator? To whom it is said: "And you, son of man, behold, bonds have been placed upon you, and they will bind you in them, and you will not go out in their midst." In this matter it should be noted that the prophet foreknows adversities, so that he may be prepared against all things. For evils prevail less against the mind which do not come unexpectedly; and yet while contrary things are foreknown, how great is the virtue of obedience in him is shown, who both knows that he is about to suffer adversities, and yet is not disobedient to the Lord's voice.
