32.  Who is in this place called the ‘scorching wind’ but the evil spirit, who stirs up the flames of divers lusts in the heart, that he may drag it to an eternity of punishments?  And so ‘the scorching wind’ is said to ‘carry off’ any bad men, because the plotter, the evil spirit, who inflames a man whilst living to evil, ‘drags him when dying to torments.  For that ‘the scorching wind’ is wont to be meant for the unclean spirit, who by the breath of evil suggesting kindles the hearts of the wicked to earthly desires, the prophet Jeremiah testifies, saying, A pot kindled I see, and the face  thereof by the face of the North. [Jer. 1, 13]  For ‘the pot kindled’ is the heart of man boiling with the heatings of worldly concerns, and with the restlessness of desires.  Which is kindled by ‘the face of the North,’ i.e. set on fire by the suggestions of the devil.  For that very being is used to be called by the title of ‘the North,’ who said, I will sit also upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the North.  I will ascend above the heights of the clouds. [Is. 14, 13]  Thus by the burning effect of this scorching wind the mind of each one of the Elect is cooled down, when the heat of evil inclinations is extinguished therein, and the flame of carnal desires turned to ice.  And hence Holy Church in the praises of her spouse cries out with exultation, I sat down under the shadow of him, whom I had desired. [Cant. 2, 3]  Of the abatement of this heat it is said to her by Isaiah, by promise of the Lord, Instead of the ground willow shall come up the fir-tree, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle tree. [Is. 55, 13]  For ‘instead of the ground willow there comes up in her the fir-tree,’ when in the heart of the Saints, instead of the sunkenness of earthly thought, the elevation of heavenly contemplation rises up.  Now the nettle is altogether of a fiery nature.  But the myrtle is said to be of cooling virtue, and therefore’ instead of the nettle there comes up the myrtle tree,’ when the minds of the righteous are brought from the irritation and heat of bad habits to coolness and quietness of the thoughts, while they now no longer seek earthly things, while they extinguish the flames of the flesh by heavenly aspirations. 
33.  In reference too to this cooling of the soul, which is given from heaven, it is said to Mary, The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee [Luke 1, 35]; though on this point, by the term of’ the overshadowing,’ either Nature of God to be made Incarnate might have been denoted.  For a shadow is followed by light and body.  Now the Lord is Light in respect of the Divine Nature, Who, by means of a soul intervening, vouchsafed in her womb in respect of human nature to become a body.  And so because the Incorporeal Light was in her womb to be made corporeal, to her, who conceived the incorporeal for corporality, it is said, The power of the Highest shall overshadow thee; i.e. The Incorporeal Light of the Divine Nature shall in thee take the corporeal substance of Human Nature.  But now let us carry to an end what we began relating to any wicked man.  Accordingly’ the scorching wind takes him away,’ in this way, viz.  that him whom the evil spirit now kindles with the fire of evil concupiscence, he afterwards carries off to the flames of hell.

34.  ‘The place’ of the wicked is the gratification of the life of time, and the enjoyment of the flesh.  Therefore every single individual is in a manner’ carried out of his place by a whirlwind,’ when overwhelmed with affright on the Last Day he is severed from all his gratifications.
