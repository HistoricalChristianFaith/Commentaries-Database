Because the Jews were to be scattered for their crime of treachery, the Jewish kingdom was shut upinto parts under several governors According to that saying, Every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation.
Because John preached Him who was to be at the same time both King and Priest, Luke the Evangelist has marked the time of that preaching by the mention not only of Kings, but also of Priests. As it follows, Under the High Priests Annas and Caiaphas.

Luke recalls the rulers of the Roman republic and the rulers of Judea to indicate the time when our Redeemer’s forerunner received his mission to preach…. Since John was coming to preach one who was to redeem some from Judea and many from among the Gentiles, the period of his preaching is indicated by naming the Gentiles’ ruler and those of the Jews. But because the Gentiles were to be gathered together and Judea dispersed on account of the error of its faithlessness, this description of earthly rule also shows us that in the Roman republic one person presided.

It is apparent, then, that Judea, which lay divided among so many kings, had reached the end of its sovereignty. It was also appropriate to indicate not only under which kings but also under which high priests this occurred. Since John the Baptist preached one who was at once both king and priest, the evangelist Luke indicated the time of his preaching by referring to both the kingship and the high priesthood.
