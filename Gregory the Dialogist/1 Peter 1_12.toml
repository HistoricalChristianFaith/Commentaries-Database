The angels both desire to see God and see him at the same time. For if they desired to see him but in such a way that their desire remained unsatisfied, they would be anxious and in suffering, but they are not. On the contrary, they are blessed and far removed from any kind of suffering or anxiety, since suffering and blessing do not go together.
