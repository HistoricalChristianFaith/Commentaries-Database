72.  Eyes of flesh see not the deeds of the periods of time, save in time, in that both they themselves came out with time to see, and are closed with time, and man's sight follows any deed and does not prevent it, seeing that it but just glimpses at things existing, and sees nothing at all of things to come.  Moreover the days and years of men differ from the days and years of Eternity, in that our life, which is begun in time and ended in time, Eternity, whilst it frames it within the boundlessness of its bosom, doth swallow up.  And whereas the immensity of the same extends beyond us on this side and on that side, His ‘to be eternally’ spreads without beginning and without end: whereunto neither things gone by are past, nor things still to come, as though they did not appear, are absent; in that He, Who hath it always to be, seeth all things present to His eyes, and whereas He doth not stretch Himself by looking behind and before, He changes with no varieties of sight.  And so let him say; Hast thou eyes of flesh? or shalt Thou see as man seeth?  Are Thy days as the days of man?  Are Thy days as the days of man, that Thou inquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after my sin?  To know that I have done nothing ungodly.  As if, humbly inquiring, he said, ‘Wherefore dost Thou search me by scourges in time, when even before time was Thou didst know me perfectly in Thine own self?  Wherefore dost Thou make inquest concerning my sins by smiting, whom by the mightiness of Thine eternity Thou didst never but know before Thou fashionedst me?’  The weight of Whose power he immediately goes on to describe, where he adds; And there is none that can deliver out of Thine hand.
73.  As if he expressed it in plain words; ‘What is left to Thee, saving to spare, Whose power no man can resist?  For in proportion as there is none who might stay Thy visitation by the merits of his own excellence, let Thy pitifulness the more easily obtain from Thee [lit. ‘from Itself.’] to spare.’ But because being conceived in sin, and born in wickedness, we either do evil things of malice, or even in doing good things go wrong out of heedlessness, we have not wherewith the strict Judge may be rendered propitious towards us; but while we are unable to present our work as worthy of His regard, it remains that for the propitiation of His favour we offer to Him His own work.
