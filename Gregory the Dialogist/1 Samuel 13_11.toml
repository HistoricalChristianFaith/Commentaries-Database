16. The prophet indeed knew what he had done, but by asking, he was reproving the act of disobedience. Hence also to Adam sinning in paradise, the Lord says: "Adam, where are you?" (Gen. 3:9). The magnitude of the guilt can also be conveyed through this question — as if he were saying openly: Does it seem a small thing to you that you sinned by disobeying? Rather, by sinning you fell from the lofty summit of your glory. Now therefore, many within the holy Church bury themselves in shameful deeds, and are unconcerned, as though they were losing nothing or only trifles. Let it therefore be said to the one who has fallen, let it be said: "What have you done?" Does it seem a small thing to you that you have defiled yourself with the filth of sin, since you pay no attention to the glory of eternity you have lost or the punishment of hell you have deserved? The sinner is indeed asked what he has done, so that he may be led back to his heart through lamentation, so that he may know he has brought great things upon himself and may not grieve too little. But because the very fault of disobedience is born from the root of pride, the disobedient are accustomed to hear the magnitude of their guilt from rebuking teachers, but not to make satisfaction by humbly confessing. For since they desire to appear exalted, they disdain to reveal their falls; and therefore they bring forth excuses and put forward claims of righteousness, because they are ashamed to appear as sinners. Therefore what follows is fittingly added: (Verses 11–12.) Saul answered: "Because I saw that the people were slipping away from me, and you had not come within the appointed days, and moreover the Philistines had gathered at Michmash, I said: Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the face of the Lord. Compelled by necessity, I offered the burnt offering."
