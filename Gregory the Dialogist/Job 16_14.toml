19.  These particulars would seem to accord with blessed Job after the letter, in that it is said, He hath compassed me with His lances, He hath wounded my loins together, He hath not spared; if that were not added, which is not read as written about him, he hath poured out my bowels upon the ground.  From which circumstance it follows, that whereas we cannot find this after the letter, we should investigate after the spirit those points, which in his words sound as of the fact of history.  Holy Church is ‘beset with lances’ by her enemy, whensoever she is in her members assaulted by the cunning assailant with the darts of temptation; and it is well said that we are ‘encompassed with lances,’ in that our old enemy assails us on every side with the wounding of temptation.  Thus oftentimes whilst the appetite is restrained, that lust may be brought under, the dart of vainglory strikes the mind; but if the body is not worn down by the infliction of abstinence, the flame of lust kindles itself against the soul: often whilst we strive to observe economy, we fall into stinginess; and often whilst we give profusely the things we possess, we are led into avarice, in that we seek to make up again what we may have to give.  Whereas then the darts of the old enemy assail us in every direction, it is rightly said now, he hath compassed me about with his lances.  And because, in the case of every sin, the crafty enemy indeed recommends it, but we by consenting to his recommendations execute it, it is fitly subjoined, he hath wounded my loins together, for in the loins lust is seated.  Hence he who desired to eradicate the delight of lust from the heart, preached the words, Gird up the loins of your mind. [1 Pet. 1, 13]  And so when our old enemy draws the faithful people into lust, surely he smites that people ‘in the loins;’ in which place it is deserving of observation, that he does not say ‘he has wounded [‘vulneravit’ ‘convulneravit’],’ but, he hath wounded my loins together.  For as to talk is sometimes an act of one person, but to ‘talk together’ of two or perhaps of many, so our old enemy, in that he does not hurry us into sin without our own will, is never said ‘to wound our loins,’ but, ‘to wound our loins together:’ in that what he prompts us amiss we fulfil by following of our own will; and, as it were, ‘wound ourselves together’ in unity with him, because we are at the same time led to commit the evil deed of free will.  It goes on; he hath not spared; as if he said, ‘he hath not ceased;’ and he hath poured out my bowels upon the ground.  What else are we to understand by ‘the bowels’ of Holy Church, save the minds of those who contain in themselves certain of her mysteries, who are devoted to the interior Sacraments?  But our old adversary, when he draws over to secular concerns any of the faithful, who appeared to be devoted to the interior sacraments, does, surely, ‘pour out her bowels upon the ground;’ in that he treads those down in things below, who were before buried from sight in secret and spiritual practices.
