"If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe someone who has risen from the dead," because indeed those who despise the words of the law will fulfill the precepts of the Redeemer, who rose from the dead, with greater difficulty the more subtle they are. For whatever is said through the law is less than what is commanded through the Lord. For the law commands that tithes be given, but our Redeemer commands that everything be given up by those who follow perfection. The law cuts away sins of the flesh, but our Redeemer condemns even unlawful thoughts. If therefore they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe if someone rises from the dead, because when will those who neglect to fulfill the lesser precepts of the law grow strong enough to obey the higher commands of our Savior? And indeed it is certain that those who refuse to fulfill his words undoubtedly refuse to believe him.
