That these words are to be understood as speaking of the antichrist is shown when it is added, “In his days the last shall be astonished, and horror shall seize on the first.” He will then let himself loose against the righteous with such a measure of iniquity that even the hearts of the very elect shall be struck with no small consternation. Hence it is written, “Insomuch that if it were possible, they shall deceive the very elect,” which clearly isn’t said because the elect shall fall but because they shall tremble with terrible alarms. Now, at that time, both the latest elect and the first elect are described as maintaining the conflict for righteousness against him. They that shall be found among the elect at the end of the world are destined to be laid low in the death of the flesh. And they too who proceeded from the former times of the world, that is, Enoch and Elijah, shall be brought back among humankind and shall be exposed to the savageness of his cruelty while still in their mortal flesh. This one’s forces will be let loose with such terrible power that “the latest are astonished at, and the first do dread.” … Then he adds, “Surely such are the dwellings of the ungodly, such is the place of those who do not know God,” in that he who is now lifted up from ignorance of God is then brought to his own “dwellings” where his own wickedness plunges him into woes. One day he finds “darkness his place,” who while he made himself glad here in the counterfeit light of righteousness, was occupying the place of another. For bad people act deceitfully, striving to possess for themselves the righteous person’s good name, as of another place. But they are then brought to their own place, when they are tormented with everlasting fire, as the deserved punishment of their iniquity.
