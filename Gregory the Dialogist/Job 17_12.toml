It is to the elect that Job frames these words, whom he calls to the eternal world. They are exhorted in two ways, namely, that they should “turn” and that they should “come” (meaning “turn” by faith and “come” by practice), that is, “turn” by abandoning evil deeds and “come” by doing good. As it is written, “Depart from evil, and do good.” But Job amazingly adds, “I shall not find a sensible person among you.” What does it mean that Job bids them to wisdom and yet wishes that he may not find them wise? Concerning them it is written, “Woe to you that are wise in your own eyes and prudent in your own sight;” and to whom it is said again, “Be not wise with your own selves.” Hence that same great preacher desired that those whom he found carnally wise, in order that they might attain true wisdom, should first become foolish, saying, “If anyone among you seems to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.” And the living Truth said elsewhere, “I thank you, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and have revealed them to babes.” And so because they that are wise in themselves cannot come to true wisdom, blessed Job, being anxious for the conversion of his hearers, rightly desires that he may not “find any wise man among them.” It is as if Job said to them in plain speech, “Learn to be foolish in your own selves, that you may be truly wise in God.” … The holy church of the elect perceives that the spaces of its life pass in periods of day and night. This suggests that the church in adversity is experiencing a night to be followed by a day of prosperity. For there rises, as it were, light on it from the tranquility of peace and night from the grief of persecution. Now after each pause of rest [the church] returns to the labor of persecution, growing to a head against it. [The church] testifies that “its days have past.” In these days, however, it is accustomed to be weighed down proportionally with so many heavier cares. As [the church] things of the true tranquility of rest, a more exact reckoning is required of it by the Judge.… Hence blessed Job, whether in his own voice or the voice of the universal church, after testifying that “his days were past,” thereupon added, “My thoughts are scattered, racking my heart.” - "Morals on the Book of Job 13.44–46"

47.  For ‘the thoughts being scattered change night into day,’ in that it is sometimes more grateful to the righteous through adversity to undergo sufferings, rather than as the effect of prosperity to be harassed with the charge of earthly ministering.  But because they have learnt by paying attention that both adversity passes away, and prosperity dawns again, it is fitly added;
And again after darkness I look for light.
48.  For ‘the light is looked for after darkness,’ in that after the night of the present life, the light eternal is discerned, or adversity and prospersity do so alternate here, that they do not cease to succeed one another by turns.  Whence it comes to pass that even in the light night is suspected, and in the night light is presumed on; as when it is written, In the day of prosperity be not forgetful of affliction, and in the day of affliction be not forgetful of prosperity. [Ecclus. 11, 25]  But mark, forasmuch as we have been redeemed by the grace of our Maker, we henceforth have this boon of heavenly bestowal, that when we are removed from dwelling in our flesh, we are at once carried off to receive heavenly rewards; in that since our Creator and Redeemer, penetrating the bars of hell, brought out from thence the souls of the Elect, He does not permit us to go there, from whence He has already by descending set others free.  But they who were brought into this world before His Coming, whatsoever eminency of righteousness they may have had, could not on being divested of the body at once be admitted into the bosom of the heavenly country [a]; seeing that He had not as yet come, Who by His own descending should unloose the bars of hell, and place the souls of the righteous henceforth in their everlasting seat.  Hence blessed Job, both feeling the stroke of affliction, and knowing that the recompensing of the righteous was as yet delayed.
