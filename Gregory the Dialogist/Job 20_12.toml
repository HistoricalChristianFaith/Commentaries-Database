13.  ‘Wickedness is sweet in the mouth’ of the hypocrite, in that evil tastes sweet to him in the thought.  For ‘the mouth’ of the heart is the thought, whereof it is written; Deceitful lips spake evil in a double heart. [Ps. 12, 2]  Now the evil that is thus sweet in the mouth of the hypocrite is hidden under the tongue, in that the harshness of an evil disposition, which lies hidden in the mind, is concealed under the cloak of a mild address.  For the evil would be on the tongue and not under it, if the hypocrite in speaking disclosed the mischievousness of his froward heart.  But as is the case with most of the righteous, when they see any persons acting badly, who deserve to be visited with severe rebukes, they put harshness on the tongue, but under the tongue cover the kindness of their feelings; (whence too it is said to Holy Church by the voice of the Spouse; Honey and milk are under Thy tongue. [Cant. 4, 11]  For they that shrink from disclosing the sweetness of their inward feeling to the weak, and so in speaking strike them with a degree of harshness, and yet amongst their harsh words secretly as it were let drop a sprinkling of sweetness, these persons clearly have sweetness not on the tongue, but under the tongue, in that amidst the hard words which they utter, they give out some that are sweet and softened, whereby the wounded mind may be cheered and refreshed by kindness;) so with the wicked severally, because they have evil not upon the tongue, but under the tongue, in the words of their mouth they hold out sweet things, and in the thoughts of their heart are plotting mischiefs.  For it is hence that Joab held the beard of Amasa with his right hand, whilst secretly putting his left hand to his sword, he shed out his bowels. [2 Sam. 20, 9]  For to hold the chin with the right hand is to caress as if in kindness.  But he puts his left hand to his sword, who in secret strikes in malice.  Hence too it is written concerning their head himself; Under his tongue is mischief and pain. [Ps. 10, 7]  For he that doth not display openly the ill that he designs, does not put forth on the tongue the mischief and pain of those, whose destruction he aims at, but keeps them close under the tongue.
