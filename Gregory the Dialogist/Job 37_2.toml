33. It is the habit of Holy Scripture, that, when it informs us that any thing is heard with the hearing [‘read ‘audivi.’], it says that this hearing is heard. As Habakkuk says, O Lord, I have heard Thy hearing, and was afraid. [Hab. 3, 1] Whence it is said here also, It will hear a hearing in the terror of His voice. But we must observe that the voice of God is said to be heard, not in joy, but in terror. Because, doubtless, while every sinner thinks of earthly things alone, and bears a heart overwhelmed with degrading thoughts, if he is suddenly touched by the aspiration of Divine grace, he understands this, above all things, that all his doings are punished by the judgment of the eternal Judge. The hearing, therefore, of the voice of the Lord, first takes place in terror, that it may afterwards be changed into sweetness. Because it first chastises us with the dread of the strict judgment, in order that it may refresh us, when chastised, with the consolation of heavenly sweetness. For when the overpowering delight of temporal objects possesses our minds, and oppresses the eyes of our mind with the sleep of sloth, if we are roused suddenly by the hand of the Divine favour, we open at once those eyes, which have been long closed, to the light of truth: we call to mind the sins we have committed, we see how strictly the Judge is coming against them; it is considered within, how great is the coming of so mighty a Judge; how great is that assembly then of men and angels: how mightily even the burning elements contend against the reprobate; how terribly that eternal sentence comes forth from the mouth of the strict Judge, with which it is said to the reprobate, Depart from Me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels. [Matt. 25, 41] The punishment of these reprobates is presented to the eyes, and the thought occurs with a heavy gloom of bitterness, what is the darkness of hell? Because then the proud heart is first shaken with terror, in order that, when shaken, it may be established in love, it is now rightly said, It will hear a hearing in the terror of His voice. Where it is also well subjoined, And a sound going forth from His mouth.
34. The sound from the mouth of God, is the power of fear, rushing into us from heavenly inspiration. Because when God, by breathing on us, fills us with thoughts of the future, He doubtless alarms us, for our past misdeeds. But by the ‘mouth of God’ can be designated, the Only-Begotten Son, Who, as He is said to be His arm, because God works is all things by Him, (of whom the Prophet says, To Whom is the arm of the Lord is revealed? [Is. 53, 1] of whom John says, All things were made by Him; [John 1, 3]) so is He also called His mouth. For hence is that which the Prophet says, For the Mouth of the Lord hath spoken these things. [Is. 1, 20] By Whom He speaks all things to us. As if the Word was plainly spoken of under the name of “mouth;” as we also are accustomed to say “tongue” instead of “words,” as when we speak of the Greek or Latin “tongue” we indicate Latin or Greek words. We therefore rightly understand Him, by the ‘Mouth of the Lord.’ Whence the Bride says to Him in the Song of Songs, Let Him kiss me with the kiss of His Mouth. [Cant. 1, 1] As if She said; Let Him touch me with the presence of the Only Begotten Son my Redeemer. But, by the sound of His Mouth, can be designated the Holy Spirit of the same Lord. Whence it is written in another place also, as signifying the same Spirit, Suddenly there came a sound from heaven, as of a mighty wind approaching. [Acts 2, 2] A sound, therefore, proceeds from the Mouth of the Lord, when His Consubstantial Spirit, coming to us through His Son, breaks through the deafness of our insensibility. As the Mouth of the Lord speaks of this same uncircumscribed and incorporeal sound, and says, He shall receive of Mine, and shall show it unto you. [John 16, 14] By the terror of His voice, then, can be understood the power of fear, and by the sound of His mouth the sweetness of consolation; for those, whom the Holy Spirit fills, He first alarms at their earthly doings, and afterwards consoles with the hope of heavenly objects; in order that they may afterwards rejoice the more in confidence of their rewards, the more they were before afraid on beholding only the punishments. Hence is it that Paul speaks of this Spirit of the Only Begotten, as of this sound of His mouth. For ye have not received the Spirit of bondage again to fear, but ye have received the Spirit of the adoption of sons, whereby we cry Abba, Father. [Rom. 8, 15] Hence the Truth says by His own mouth, Receive ye the Holy Ghost: whose soever sins ye remit, they are remitted to them; and whose soever ye retain, they are retained. [John 20, 22. 23.] Lo! the terror of the converted is turned into power; because while they punish their sins by penance, they ascend up even to the exercise of judgment; so as to receive this power from God, which before they used themselves to fear at His hands. For they in truth become judges, who feared greatly the judgment of heaven; and they now begin to remit the sins of others, who had before been afraid that their own would be retained. But because this very judgment, which takes place spiritually, is not now seen by the carnal; there are some who consider that God is not concerned about human affairs, and think that they are carried on by accidental movements.
