And it should be noted what He says to the blind man as he approaches: "What do you want Me to do for you?" Did He who was able to restore light not know what the blind man wanted? But He wishes to be asked for that which He foreknows both that we will ask and that He will grant. For He urges us persistently to prayer, and yet says: "For your heavenly Father knows what you need before you ask Him." Therefore He requires to be asked for this reason: He requires it in order to arouse the heart to prayer. Hence the blind man immediately added: "Lord, that I may see." Behold, the blind man seeks from the Lord not gold, but light. He considers it worthless to seek anything apart from light, because even if a blind man can possess anything whatsoever, without light he cannot see what he has. Let us therefore imitate, dearly beloved brethren, him whom we have heard was saved both in body and in mind. Let us not seek from the Lord false riches, nor earthly gifts, nor fleeting honors, but light; and not that light which is confined to a place, which ends with time, which is interrupted by the variation of nights, which is perceived by us in common with beasts, but let us seek the light which we can see together with the angels alone, which no beginning commences nor any end confines. To this light, indeed, faith is the way.
