51.  For ‘by the waters the root is opened,’ when, for receiving the streams of truth, secretly the thought of the mind is spread out.  For as we have already said in a former book, in Holy Writ by the term of ‘the root’ the hidden thought is used to be denoted.  Therefore “our root we open by the waters,” when to the Interior watering we stretch the thought of the secret heart.  Which same words if we carry on to the voice of Holy Church, her ‘root’ must be taken for the very Incarnation our Redeemer itself.  Which ‘root is opened by the waters,’ in that God Invisible by the assumption of His Manhood was laid open to the regardings of our sight.  Since the Creator, Who was not able to be seen in the Godhead, took to Him from us that whereby He might by us be seen.  So ‘the root is opened by the waters,’ because the Author of the human race by means of His human nature is manifested to human beings.  Whence also it is rightly said by the Psalmist, And he shall be like a tree that is planted beside the runnings of waters. [Ps. 1, 3]  For ‘the runnings of waters’ are the daily passings by of peoples dying off.  And Truth saith concerning Itself, If they do these things in the green tree, what shall be done in the dry? [Luke 23, 31]  And so there ‘is a tree beside the runnings of waters,’ because, whilst putting forth fruit and the covering of His shade for us, the Creator appeared in the flesh, that by a rising again He might stay the human race, which by a falling off was day by day going on into death.  It goes on;
And the dew shall stay on my harvest.
52.  Understand, I said.  For the harvest of Holy Church is not inappropriately taken to be, when perfect souls withdrawn from their bodies, like ripe crops cut away from the ground, are transported into the heavenly granaries; which same because it takes place not by our own power, but by heavenly grace vouchsafing it, he saith well, And the dew shall stay on my harvest.  For the dew falls from above, but the harvest is gathered in from below.  And so ‘the dew stays on the harvest,’ because grace coming from above causes it, that we should be meet persons to be gathered in from the world below.  For by that same grace watering us from above, we bear the fruit of good practice.  Whence also it is rightly said by Paul, But by the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace, which was bestowed upon me, was not in vain. [1 Cor. 15, 10]  For if it be enquired what is the dew coming from above, he tells us, By the grace of God I am what I am.  If we look at the crop growing up beneath the dew, he says, And His grace was not in vain in me, but I laboured more abundantly than they all.
