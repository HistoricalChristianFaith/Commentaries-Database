6.  In Holy Scripture by the term of ‘a pledge’ sometimes the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and sometimes the confession of sin, are denoted.  Thus pledge is taken as the gift of the Holy Spirit, as where it is said by Paul, And given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts. [2 Cor. 1, 22]  For we receive a pledge for this, that we may hold an assurance touching the promise that is made to us.  And so the gift of the Holy Spirit is called a pledge, in that by this our soul is strengthened to assuredness of the inward hope.  Again by the name of a ‘pledge’ confession of sin is used to be intended, as it is written in the Law; If thy brother oweth thee aught, and thou takest away a pledge from him, restore the pledge before the setting of the sun. [Ex. 22, 25. 26.]  For our brother is made a debtor to us, when any fellow-creature is proved to have done any thing wrong against us.  For sins we call ‘debts.’  Whence it is said to the servant when he sinned, I forgave thee all that debt. [Matt. 18, 32]  And in the Lord’s Prayer we pray daily, Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. [Matt. 6, 12]  Now we ‘take a pledge’ from our debtor, when from the lips of him who is found to have sinned against us, we have now gotten a confession of his sin, whereby we are entreated to remit the sin, which was committed against us.  For he that confesses the sin that he has done, and begs pardon, has already as it were given a ‘pledge’ for his debt, which pledge we are bidden to ‘restore before the sun set,’ because before that in ourselves through pain of heart the Sun of righteousness shall set, we are bound to render back the acknowledgment of pardon to him, from whom we receive the acknowledgment of transgression, that he who remembers that he has done amiss towards us, may be made sensible that what he has done amiss is by us at once remitted.  Therefore whereas Holy Church, when it receives back any returning from heretics to the truth of the faith, first persuades them that they must confess the sin of their error, it is said by Eliphaz as under the likeness of heretics; For thou hast taken away a pledge from thy brother for nought, i.e. ‘From those, that come to thee from us, thou didst exact a confession of error to no purpose.’  But, as we said before, if we suppose a ‘pledge’ the gifts of the Holy Spirit, heretics say that Holy Church has ‘taken away the pledge of her brothers,’ because they imagine that those that come to her, lose the gifts of the Spirit.  Hence it follows, And stripped the naked of their clothing.
7.  Those whom they draw after them by their perverted preaching, heretics count to have the precepts of their teaching as a kind of garments, and they esteem them to be clothed so long as the things which they themselves preached they witness observed by them, and when any persons return to Holy Church from them, they immediately fancy that they have lost the garments of instruction.  But whereas one that is naked cannot he spoiled, we have to enquire how they are first mentioned as ‘naked,’ and afterwards as ‘stripped?’  Now it is necessary to know that every one that enjoys purity of mind, by the very circumstance that he has not the cloak of double-dealing, is ‘naked.’  And there are some among the Heretics, who have purity of heart indeed, but yet take up the corrupt tenets of their teaching.  These same are at once by their own purity ‘naked,’ and by the preaching of those persons they are as it were clothed.  And whereas all such are easily brought back to Holy Church, for this reason that they do not use the wickedness of doubledealing, those persons heretics acknowledge as naked, whom they call stripped by her of their clothing, because they look upon all the simple-minded as slow and dull, who, they see, have parted with their own corrupt tenets.
