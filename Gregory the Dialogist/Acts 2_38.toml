Do penance: 
For, being about to speak of baptism, he spoke first of the lamentations of penitence; that they should first bathe themselves in the water of their own affliction, and afterwards wash themselves in the Sacrament of Baptism. With what conscience, then, can those who neglect to weep for their past misdeeds live secure of pardon, when (Peter) himself believed that penitence must be added even to this Sacrament which chiefly extinguishes sins?
