It follows: When Jesus saw her, he called her to him and said to her: Woman, you are released from your infirmity. And he laid his hand upon her, and immediately she was made straight. He called and raised her up, because he illuminated and aided her. He calls but does not raise up when indeed we are illuminated by his grace, but, our merits requiring it, we cannot be aided. For often we see what things ought to be done, but we do not fulfill this in deed. We strive and grow weak. The judgment of the mind perceives righteousness, but the strength of action succumbs to it, because indeed it is already part of the punishment of sin that good can be perceived through a gift, yet it happens that one is repelled by merit from that which is seen. For habitual fault binds the mind so that it can by no means rise to righteousness. It strives and falls, because where it willingly persisted for a long time, there also, though unwilling, it falls compelled.
