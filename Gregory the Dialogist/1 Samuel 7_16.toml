29. Bethel is called the house of God; Gilgal, a wheel; Mizpah, as has already been repeated above, is interpreted as a watchtower. What then does Bethel signify, if not men appointed to the office of the sacred altar, who, while they devote themselves to spiritual pursuits, are as it were intimates and members of the household of almighty God? And what does Gilgal, which is called a wheel, designate, if not the order of married persons? For they go around as if on a wheel, since they cannot be entirely free from the cares of this changing world. And what is expressed by Mizpah, which is interpreted as a watchtower, if not those who, devoting themselves to divine contemplation, burn with desire for heavenly joys alone? What then does it mean that Samuel is said to travel around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and to judge Israel in those same places, if not that the chosen preacher follows the examples of all the orders of the elect, so that he may be a learned judge of the faithful who are subject to him? For he will not be able to render fair judgment if he disdains to take from the examples of the elect who came before him what he decides. But let him also travel through these places each year, so that as a prudent teacher he may examine one by one the perfection of each order: so that the more carefully he has observed the virtues of his predecessors, the more fittingly he may arrange present affairs. There, therefore, there let him judge Israel, so that the faithful subjects whom he instructs toward the vision of God, he may correct by the righteousness of those whom he undoubtedly believes to have been pleasing to God. Bethel, which is called the house of God, can also designate the entire Church of the elect; and Gilgal, which is interpreted as a wheel, can designate Sacred Scripture. Whatever indeed a teacher brings forth for the advancement of his subjects, he receives either from the example of the elect, or from the teaching of sacred eloquence, or from the revelation of inner and secret contemplation.

30. Samuel therefore goes around Bethel, since the preacher of the Church seeks the authority for arranging his works from the examples of the elders. He goes around Gilgal, that is, the wheel, when he derives the authority of his teaching from the instruction of Holy Scripture. He also goes around Mizpah, when through the meditation of secret contemplation he merits to receive the revelation of truth. For there he judges Israel: because whatever he sets before his subjects as a rule of righteousness, he receives either from the examples of the elect, or from the teaching of sacred eloquence, or from the revelation of interior contemplation. By these words indeed it is shown not only what the perfect teacher does, but also that he is not perfect if he cannot do these things. For if someone knows only the examples of good men, or if someone is even learned in Holy Scripture yet lacks the revelation of contemplation, he will not be a perfect man in the order of preaching. For contemplation is a virtue through which not only is Scripture itself, once composed, recognized, but through which what has not yet been composed would be composed: and through which what has been composed is daily ordered according to the will of God. Rightly therefore it is said: And he judged Israel in the above-mentioned places. For not only in Bethel and Gilgal, but also in Mizpah: so that he who strives toward the perfection of preaching, while through humility he follows the examples of the elders, while through the study of sacred eloquence he is supported by learning, must take care above all that through purity of mind he may know by contemplation the things that are to be ordered. For he who, having undertaken the office of preaching, desires to teach men, must be teachable by God. Yet let him so trust in that which is imparted through the instruction of secret contemplation, that he neither disdains the Scriptures produced through the Holy Spirit, nor scorns to follow the examples of the elect. For Samuel is described as going around Bethel, and Gilgal, and Mizpah; so that the one is never separated from the other through discord: so that, namely, he both receives the examples that Holy Scripture approves, and recognizes those Holy Scriptures that the elect wrote, and perceives those revelations of contemplation shown to him by God which are at variance neither with the works of the elect nor with the authority of Holy Scripture. But let him also bring back everything he does to the rectitude of heavenly intention.
