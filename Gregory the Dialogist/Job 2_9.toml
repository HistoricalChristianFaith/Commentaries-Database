62.  For the illadvising wife is the carnal thought goading the mind, since it often happens, as has been said above, that we are both harrassed with strokes without, and wearied with carnal promptings within.  For it is hence that Jeremiah bewails, saying, Abroad the sword bereaveth; at home there is as death. [Lam. 1, 20]  Since ‘the sword bereaveth,’ when vengeance outwardly smites and pierces us, and ‘at home there is as death,’ in that indeed he both undergoes the lash, and yet the conscience is not clear of the stains of temptation within.  Hence David says, Let them be as chaff before the wind, and let the angel of the Lord persecute them. [Ps. 35, 5]  For he that is caught by the blast of temptation in the heart, is lifted up like dust before the face of the wind; and when in the midst of these strokes the rigour of God smites them, what else is it, but the Angel of the Lord that persecutes them?
63.  But these trials are carried on in the case of the reprobate in one way, and of the Elect in another.  The hearts of the first sort are so tempted that they yield consent, and those of the last undergo temptations indeed, but offer resistance.  The mind of the one is taken captive with a feeling of delight, and if at the moment that which is prompted amiss is displeasing, yet afterwards by deliberation it gives pleasure.  But these so receive the darts of temptation, that they weary themselves in unceasing resistance, and if at any time the mind under temptation is hurried away to entertain a feeling of delight, yet they quickly blush at the very circumstance of their delight stealing upon them, and blame with unsparing censure all that they detect springing up in themselves of a carnal nature.

36.  For of what did that mispersuading woman bear the likeness, but of all the carnal that are settled in the bosom of Holy Church, who in proportion as by the words of the Faith they profess they are within the pale, press harder on all the good by their ill-regulated conduct.  For they would perchance have done less mischief, if Holy Church had not admitted in and welcomed to the bed of faith those, whom, by receiving in a profession of faith, she doubtless puts it almost out of her power to eschew.  It is hence that in the press of the crowd one woman touched our Redeemer, whereupon the same our Redeemer at once saith, Who touched Me?  And when the disciples answered Him, The multitude throng Thee and press Thee, and sayest Thou, Who touched Me?  He therefore subjoined, Somebody hath touched Me, for I perceive that virtue is gone out of Me.
37.  Thus many press the Lord, but one alone touches Him; in that all carnal men in the Church press Him, from Whom they are far removed, while they alone touch Him, who are really united to Him in humility.  Therefore the crowd presses Him, in that the multitude of the carnally minded, as it is within the pale, so is it the more hardly borne with.  It ‘presses,’ but it does not ‘touch,’ in that it is at once troublesome by its presence, and absent by its way of life.  For sometimes they pursue us with bad discourse, and sometimes with evil practices alone, for so at one time they persuade to what they practise, and at another, though they use no persuasions, yet they cease not to afford examples of wickedness.  They, then, that entice us to do evil either by word or by example, are surely our persecutors, to whom we owe the conflicts of temptation, which we have to conquer at least in the heart.
38.  But we should know that carnal men in the Church set themselves to prompt wickedness at one time from a principle of fear, and at another of audacity, and when they themselves go wrong either from littleness of mind or pride of heart, they study to infuse these qualities, as if out of love, into the hearts of the righteous.  So Peter, before the Death and Resurrection of our Lord, retained a carnal mind.  It was with a carnal mind that the son of Zeruiah held to his leader David, whom he was joined to.  Yet the one was led into sin by fear, the other by pride.  For the first, when he heard of his Master's Death, said, Be it far from Thee, Lord; this shall not be unto Thee. [Matt. 16, 22]  But the latter, not enduring the wrongs offered to his leader, says, Shall not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the Lord's anointed? [2 Sam. 19, 21]  But to the first it is immediately replied, Get thee behind Me, Satan. [Matt. 16, 23]  And the other with his brother immediately heard the words; What have I to do with you, ye sons of Zeruiah, that ye are this day turned into a Satan [So Vulg. E.V. Adversaries] unto me? [2 Sam. 19, 22]  So that evil prompters are taken for apostate angels in express designation, who, as if in love, draw men to unlawful deeds by their enticing words.  But they are much the worse, who give into this sin not from fear but from pride, of whom the wife of blessed Job bore the figure in a special manner, in that she sought to prompt high thoughts to her husband, saying, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  Curse God, and die.  She blames the simplicity in her husband, that in contempt of all things transitory, with a pure heart, he longs after the eternal only, As though she said, ‘Why dost thou in thy simplicity seek after the things of eternity, and in resignation groan under the weight of present ills?  Transgress [Excedens], and contemn eternity, and even by dying escape from present woes.’  But when any of the Elect encounter evil within coming from carnal men, what a model [formam] of uprightness they exhibit in themselves, let us learn from the words of him, wounded and yet whole, seated yet erect,

12.  The old adversary is wont to tempt mankind in two ways; viz. so as either to break the hearts of the stedfast by tribulation, or to melt them by persuasion.  Against blessed Job then he strenuously exerted himself in both; for first upon the householder he brought loss of substance; the father he bereaved by the death of his children; the man that was in health he smote with putrid sores.  But forasmuch as him, that was outwardly corrupt, he saw still to hold on sound within, and because he grudged him, whom he had stripped naked outwardly, to be inwardly enriched by the setting forth of his Maker's praise, in his cunning he reflects and considers, that the champion of God is only raised up against him by the very means whereby he is pressed down, and being defeated he betakes himself to subtle appliances of temptations.  For he has recourse again to his arts of ancient contrivance, and because he knows by what means Adam is prone to be deceived, he has recourse to Eve.  For he saw that blessed Job amidst the repeated loss of his goods, the countless wounds of his strokes, stood unconquered, as it were, in a kind of fortress of virtues.  For he had set his mind on high, and therefore the machinations of the enemy were unable to force an entrance on it.  The adversary then seeks by what steps he may mount up to this well-fenced fortress.  Now the woman is close to the man and joined to him.  Therefore he fixed his hold on the heart of the woman, and as it were found in it a ladder whereby he might be able to mount up to the heart of the man.  He seized the mind of the wife, which was the ladder to the husband.  But he could do nothing by this artifice.  For the holy man minded that the woman was set under and not over him, and by speaking aright, he instructed her, whom the serpent set on to speak wrongly.  For it was meet that manly reproof should hold in that looser mind; since indeed he knew even by the first fall of man, that the woman was unskilled to teach aright.  And hence it is well said by Paul, I permit not a woman to teach. [1 Tim. 2, 12]  Doubtless for that, when she once taught, she cast us off from an eternity of wisdom.  And so the old enemy was beaten by [perdidit ab] Adam on a dunghill, he that conquered Adam in Paradise; and whereas he inflamed the wife, whom he took to his aid, to utter words of mispersuasion, he sent her to the school of holy instruction; and she that had been set on that she might destroy, was instructed that she should not ruin herself.  Yes, the enemy is so stricken by those resolute men of our part, that his very own weapons are seized out of his hand.  For by the same means, whereby he reckons to increase the pain of the wound, he is helping them to arms of virtue to use against himself.
13.  Now from the words of his wife, thus persuading him amiss, we ought to mark with attention, that the old enemy goes about to bend the upright state of our mind, not only by means of himself, but by means of those that are attached to us.  For when he cannot undermine our heart by his own persuading, then indeed he creeps to the thing by the tongues of those that belong to us.  For hence it is written; Beware of thine own children, and take heed to thyself from thy servants. [Ecclus. 32, 22. Vulg.] Hence it is said by the Prophet; Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any brother. [Jer. 9, 4]  Hence it, is again written; And a man's foes shall be they of his own household. [Matt. 10, 36]  For when the crafty adversary sees himself driven back from the hearts of the good, he seeks out those that they very much love, and he speaks sweetly to them by the words of such as are beloved by them above others, that whilst the force of love penetrates the heart, the sword of his persuading may easily force a way in to the defences of inward uprightness.  Thus after the losses of his goods, after the death of his children, after the wounding and rending of his limbs, the old foe put in motion the tongue of his wife.
14.  And observe the time when he aimed to corrupt the mind of the man with poisoned talk.  For it was after the wounds that the words were brought in by him; doubtless that, as the force of the pain waxed greater, the froward dictates of his persuasions might easily prevail.  But if we minutely consider the order itself of his temptation, we see with what craft he worketh his cruelty.  For he first directed against him the losses of his goods, which should be at once, as they were, out of the province of nature, and without the body.  He withdrew from him his children, a thing now no longer indeed without the province of nature, but still in some degree beyond his own body.  Lastly, he smote even his body.  But because, by these wounds of the flesh, he could not attain to wound the soul, he sought out the tongue of the woman that was joined to him.  For because it sorely grieved him to be overcome in open fight, he flung a javelin from the mouth of the wife, as if from a place of ambush: as she said, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  Bless God and die.  Mark how in trying him, he took away every thing, and again in trying him, left him his wife, and shewed craftiness in stripping him of every thing, but infinitely greater cunning, in keeping the woman as his abettor, to say, Dost thou still retain thine integrity?  Eve repeats her own words.  For what is it to say, ‘give over thine integrity,’ but ‘disregard obedience by eating the forbidden thing?’  And what is it to say, Bless [see Book I, 31.] God and die, but ‘live by mounting above the commandment, above what thou wast created to be?’  But our Adam lay low upon a dunghill in strength, who once stood up in Paradise in weakness.
