"And he sent his servant at the hour of supper to tell those who were invited to come." What is the hour of supper, except the end of the world? In which we certainly are, as Paul long ago testifies, saying: "We are those upon whom the ends of the ages have come." If therefore it is already the hour of supper when we are called, the less should we excuse ourselves from the banquet of God, the more we perceive that the end of the age has drawn near. For the more we consider that nothing remains, the more we ought to fear lest the time of grace that is at hand be lost. Moreover, this banquet of God is called not a dinner but a supper, because after dinner a supper remains, but after supper no banquet remains. And because the eternal banquet of God will be prepared for us at the end, it was right that this should be called not a dinner but a supper.

But who is designated by this servant, who is sent by the householder to invite, except the order of preachers? Of which order, although we are still unworthy, although we are burdened by the weight of our sins, nevertheless we too are in these days, and when I speak something to you concerning your edification, this is what I do, for I am a servant of the supreme householder. When I admonish you to contempt of the world, I come to invite you to the supper of God. Let no one despise me in this place on my own account. And if I appear in no way worthy to invite, yet great are the delights which I promise. Often, my brothers, what I say tends to happen, that a powerful person has a despised servant; and when through him he sends some message to his own people or to strangers, the person of the speaking servant is not despised, because reverence for the sending master is preserved in the heart. Nor do those who hear consider through whom, but what or from whom they hear. So therefore, brothers, so conduct yourselves, and if perhaps you rightly despise us, yet preserve in your mind reverence for the Lord who calls. Willingly obey to become guests of the supreme householder. Examine your hearts, and drive out from them deadly disgust. For to repel your disgust, all things are now prepared. But if you are still carnal, perhaps you seek carnal feasts. Behold, those very carnal feasts have been converted into spiritual nourishment for you. For to wipe away the disgust of your mind, that singular lamb has been slain for you at the supper of the Lord.
