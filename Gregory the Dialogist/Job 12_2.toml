44.  Whosoever reckons himself to excel all men in the faculty of reason, what else does such a man but exult that he is the ‘only Man?’ And it often happens that when the mind is borne on high through pride, it is uplifted in contempt of all men, and in admiration of self.  For self-applause springs up in the imagination, and folly is itself its own flatterer for singularity of wisdom.  It ponders all that it has heard, and considers the words that it utters; and it admires its own, and scoffs at those of others.  He then, who thinks that he only is wise, what else is this but that he believes that that same ‘wisdom dies with him?’  For what he denies to be with others, ascribing to himself alone, he doth, in truth, confine within the period of his brief span.  But we are to consider what exact discretion the holy man employs, in order that the arrogance of his friends in the fulness of pride might be brought within bounds.
