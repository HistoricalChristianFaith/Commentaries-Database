“Bread” signifies perfection, as Paul attested while exhorting the weak to conversion: “I gave you milk to drink, not food, for you were then and still remain unable to eat.” If milk is for children, then bread is only for the perfect. Consequently, it was said about the strength of the perfect man: “He will live upon the heights, a fortress of rocks will be his dwelling, bread will be given to him.”
