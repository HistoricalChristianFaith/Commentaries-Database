For he urges that both himself and his house are hedged about by God; because he could not find an entrance to His conscience by tempting him. He declares his substance to be hedged about, in that he dares not to attack His elect servants. He complains that God had blessed the work of his hands, and that his substance was increased in the land, for this reason, that he pines at beholding that faith in Him enlarges its bounds, in man's coming to the knowledge of Him by the preaching of the Apostles. For His substance is said to be increasing, all the time that by the labours of the preachers the number of the faithful daily waxes larger.  Satan's saying this to God, is his seeing these things with an envious eye.  Satan's saying this to God, is his grieving at these things with a pining spirit.

67.  As though he plainly said; ‘Wherefore dost Thou extol him whom Thou stablishest with Thy protection?  for man would deserve Thy praises, while Thou despisest me, if he withstood me by his own proper strength.’  Hence also he immediately demands on man's head with evil intent, what man's Defender concedes though with a merciful design.
