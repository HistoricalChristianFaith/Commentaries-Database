64.  For he conceives ‘woe,’ when he devises wicked things; he ‘brings forth iniquity,’ when he has begun to fulfil what he has devised; by entertaining envy, he ‘conceives woe;’ by uttering slanders, he ‘brings forth iniquity.’  For it is grievous wickedness when he who is wicked strives to make others appear wicked, that he may himself thereby appear as holy, because he has shewn that others are not holy.  But we ought to bear in mind, that in Holy Writ by the title of the ‘belly’ or the ‘womb’ the mind is used to be understood.  Hence it is that it is said by Solomon, For the candle of the Lord is the breathway of man, searching all the inward parts of the belly. [Prov. 20, 27]  For the light of grace, which comes from above, affords a ‘breathway’ to man unto life, which same light is said to ‘search all the inward parts of the belly,’ in that it penetrates all the secrets of the heart, that the things which were hidden from the soul touching itself it may bring back before the eyes thereof with weeping.  Hence Jeremiah saith, My bowels! my bowels! I am pained. [Jer. 4, 19]  Who, that he might shew what he had called his belly, added, the senses of my heart are troubled.  So by the title of the womb the mind is rightly understood, in that like as the offspring is conceived in the womb, so is thought engendered in the mind.  And as meats are contained in the belly, so are thoughts in the mind; and so the ‘womb’ of the hypocrite ‘prepares deceits,’ in that he is ever conceiving in his mind the greater wickedness against his neighbours, in proportion as he aims to appear by himself above all men innocent.  Eliphaz therefore put forward these things, in that he looked upon blessed Job as stricken with that great scourge on account of his hypocrisy.  But his words, though they apply to many, are at odds with him alone, for whom alone they were said, in that the holy man had nought of double-dealing in his conduct, whom Truth being witness to him praised for the singleness of his heart.
