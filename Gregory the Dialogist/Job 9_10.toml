19.  For then we more thoroughly compass the deeds of Divine Might, when we acknowledge that we can never compass them; we then speak with greater eloquence, when we are silent on these, being struck dumb with astonishment.  Since for the describing of God's works our insufficiency finds in itself how it may put forth its tongue sufficiently, that what it cannot suitably understand, it may suitably extol by being dumb.  Whence it is well said by the Psalmist, Praise Him in His mighty acts; praise Him according to His excellent greatness. [Ps. 150, 2]  For He ‘praises God according to His excellent greatness,’ who sees that he breaks down in the fulfilling of His praise.  Therefore let him say, Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders without number: viz. ‘great,’ in power, ‘past finding out,’ in reason, ‘without number,’ in multitude.  Therefore the works of God which he could not compass by speaking, he more eloquently defined by proving deficient.  But in the review of things, why are we carried so far without ourselves, considering that we know nothing of the very thing that is done to our own selves?
