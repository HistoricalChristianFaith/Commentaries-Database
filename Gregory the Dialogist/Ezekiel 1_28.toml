He does not say, “the vision of the glory” but “the likeness of the glory,” in order that it be truly shown that however great the will with which the human has strived, even though it prunes away the fantasies of bodily images from its meditation, yet still clad in mortal flesh it cannot avail to see the glory of God as it is. But whatever of that glory shines in the mind is the likeness and not the glory itself. There that preacher who was snatched to the third heaven said, “Now we see through a glass darkly.”
