54.  He ‘holds his good things in his hand,’ who in despising temporal things, forces them under the dominion of the mind.  For whoever loves them over much, subjects himself more to them, than them to himself.  For many of the righteous were rich in this world; sustained by their substance, and by their honour, they seemed to possess many things; yet forasmuch as their mind was not possessed by the excessive enjoyment of these things, which were theirs, ‘their good things were in their hand,’ because they were held subordinate to the authority of the soul.  But on the other hand the wicked so discharge themselves with all their hearts in aims at outward things, that they do not themselves so much hold the things possessed, but are holden with minds in bondage by the things they possess.  Therefore because ‘their good things are not in their hand,’ it is rightly added, let their counsel be far from me.  For what is ‘the counsel of the wicked,’ saving to seek earthly and neglect eternal glory, to aim at temporal well-being at the cost of interior detriment, and to change away transitory sorrows for eternal woes?  Let the holy man, then, regarding these aims of the wicked, turn from them and say, Let their counsel be far from me.  Because he sees it to be good beyond comparison, as it is, he had rather for a brief space groan here beneath the rod, than undergo the woes of eternal vengeance.  But not even in this life do they, that are bent to make their way prosperous therein, enjoy an uninterrupted course of prosperity.  But many times their joys are broken off by groans arising.
