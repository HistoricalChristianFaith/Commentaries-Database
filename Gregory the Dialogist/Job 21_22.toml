61.  When in the things, which are done concerning us, we have doubts, we ought to look at others, which are well known to us, and to pacify that murmuring of the thought, which had arisen to us in consequence of our uncertainty.  For see, whereas scourges recover the Elect to life, and not even scourges keep the wicked from bad deeds, Almighty Godâ€™s judgments upon us are very secret and are not unjust.  But if we stretch the eye of our mind to the things above, we see by those that touching ourselves we have nought to complain of with justice.  For Almighty God discerning the merits of Angels, ordained some to abide in eternal light without falling, others, fallen of free will from the standing of their loftiness, He laid low in the vengeance of eternal damnation.  By us, then, He doth nothing unjustly, Who judged justly even a nature more refined than ours.  So let him say; Shall any teach God knowledge?  seeing that He judgeth those that are high.  For He that doeth wonderful things above our level, it is surely plain that touching ourselves He ordereth all things with knowledge.  This then being set first, he adds, where it is the mind of man is wearied in making research.
