18. All the proud, because through their swelling they consider themselves to be above other men, are fittingly rebuked when the divine will is set before them, which they offend. Saul therefore is rebuked in the manner of the proud, who is said to have despised the commandments of the Lord his God. This is as if one should frighten the proud and contemptuous man, saying: Even if you despise men, now it is not the counsel of men, but the commandments of the Lord your God that you have scattered. Rightly therefore do you weigh your guilt, if you consider with a trembling heart Him whom you despise. And it should be noted that he does not say: "You have not kept the commandments of your God," or "the commandments of your Lord," but: "You have not kept the commandments of the Lord your God." As if he were openly saying: It would be a daring of great transgression if He whose commandments you despise were only your Lord and not also your God. How great then is what is committed when the commandments of God and Lord are neglected? Because likewise he did not say "of the Lord my God" or "of the Lord our God," he convicts him of having offended the grace of divine intimacy. As if he were saying: You have despised the precepts of Him who, when He raised you up from the lowest place, when He set you over others, when He made you king, through the bestowal of such great gifts, was, as it were, specially yours. Still further it is added, from which his audacity of transgression is shown to be even greater: (Verse 13.) "Which," he says, "He commanded to you."

19. Finally, certain commandments of God are common to all, not special to some. Therefore, in order to convict the bold defendant of his recklessness by an open accusation, he demonstrates that he despised not the common commandments, but his own and particular ones. "Which," he says, "he commanded to you." As if to say: You despised those commandments of your God and Lord which you ought to have observed not as common to all, but as your own, and entrusted singularly to you alone. But he sets forth what he deserves, saying: (Verses 13, 14.) "For if you had not done this, the Lord would have already established your kingdom over Israel forever, but it shall by no means rise again."
