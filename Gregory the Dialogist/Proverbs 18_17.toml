Even those who do not believe that they have sinned, generally confess themselves sinners. For it is frequently the case that people openly confess themselves sinners, but on hearing a true account of their sins when other persons attack them, they boldly defend themselves and endeavor to appear innocent. Everyone of this character, then, if he says that he has sinned, speaks untruly, as he proclaims himself a sinner not from the inmost heart, but only in words. For since it is written, “The just man in the beginning accuses himself,” he wished to gain credit, not to be humbled, by confessing his sin. He desired, by accusing himself, to appear humble without being so.… The righteous, then, in passing sentence on his own conduct, knows from the bottom of his heart, by the examples of holier men, that he really is what he professes to be.
