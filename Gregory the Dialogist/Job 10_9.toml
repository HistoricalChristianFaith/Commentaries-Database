77.  As if he begged openly, saving, ‘Remember, I pray Thee, that by the flesh I came from earth, and by the death thereof, I tend to earth, Thus regard the substance of my origin, and the penalty of my end, and be the readier to spare the sin of a transient being;’ but as he has given out the sort and kind of man as created.

76.  The spirits of the Angels did for this reason sin without forgiveness, because they might have stood the stronger in proportion as no mixture with flesh held them in bonds.  But man for this reason obtained pardon after sin, that in a body of flesh he got that wherein he should be beneath himself.  And hence in the eye of the Judge this frailty of the flesh alone is a ground for showing pity; as where it is said by the Psalmist, But He is full of compassion, and will forgive their iniquity, and not destroy them; yea, many a time turned He His anger away from them, and did not stir up all His wrath, and remembered that they were but flesh. [Ps. 78, 38. 39.]  And so man was ‘made as the clay’ in that he was taken out of clay, for the making of him.  For clay is made, when water is sprinkled [se conspergit] in with earth.  Therefore man is made as clay, in that it is as if water moistened dust, while the soul waters the flesh.  Which name the holy man excellently represents to the pitifulness of the Judge, when he beseeches saying, Remember, I pray Thee, that Thou hast made me as the clay.  As if he said in plain words; ‘Consider the frailty of the flesh, and remit the guilt of my sin.’
