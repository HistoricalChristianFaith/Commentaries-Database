So as to gladden you in the promise of the joy to come, you know the songs of eternal praise that are written in this book, “Blessed are those who dwell in your house, O Lord; forever they will sing your praise!” And how through a certain wise man19 it is said of the heavenly Jerusalem, “All your squares will be paved with precious stones, and in all your streets they will sing alleluia.” This song of the eternal homeland was proclaimed to us by its citizens, who together cried out, “Glory to God in the highest heavens, and peace on earth to people of good will.”
