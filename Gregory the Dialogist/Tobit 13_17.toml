But that you may rejoice in the promise of following joy, learn the songs of eternal praise written in this volume: "Blessed are they who dwell in your house, O Lord, they shall praise you forever and ever." And as it is said by a certain wise man concerning the heavenly Jerusalem: "And all its streets shall be paved with precious and pure stone, and through all its lanes alleluia shall be sung." The citizens of the heavenly homeland had come to announce this song to us, who cried out in harmony: "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will."
