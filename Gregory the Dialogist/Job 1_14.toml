49.  What else do we take the oxen to mean in figure, but well-doers; what the asses, but certain men of simple ways?  These are properly described to be feeding beside the oxen, because simple souls, even when they are incapable of comprehending deep mysteries, are near to the great, inasmuch as they account the excellencies of their brethren to be their own also by force of charity; and while envy of the knowledges [sensibus] of others is a thing unknown, they are never divided at pasture.

So when the Sabeans made their assault, one servant alone escaped to give the tidings, because by means of malignant spirits leading captive weak minds, that declaration of Prophecy was confirmed, which, in foretelling the same captivity, saith, Therefore My people are gone into captivity, because they have no knowledge. [Is. 5, 13]  The prophecy therefore is in a manner preserved safe, when the captivity, which it foretold, is brought to light.  It proceeds,
