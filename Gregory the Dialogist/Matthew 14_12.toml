Mor., iii, 7: But not without most deep wonder do I consider, that he who in his mother’s womb was filled with the spirit of prophecy, than whom there arose not a greater among them that are born of women, is cast into prison by wicked men, and is beheaded because of the dancing of a girl, and that a man of such severe life dies for the sport of shameful men.
Mor., xxix, 7: And John is not sought out to suffer concerning the confession of Christ, but for the truth of righteousness. But because Christ is truth, hegoes to death for Christ in going for truth. It follows, “And his disciples came, and took up his body, and buried it.”
