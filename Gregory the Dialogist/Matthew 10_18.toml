Hom. in Ev., xvii. 4: For he who undertakes the office of preacher ought not todo evil, but to suffer it, and by his meekness to mollify the wrath of the angry, and by his wounds to heal the wounds of sinners in their affliction. And even should the zeal of right-doing ever require that He should be severe to those that are placed under Him, His very severity will be of love and not of cruelty, outwardly maintaining the rights of discipline, and inwardly loving those whom He corrects. Too many, when they are entrusted with the reins of government, burn to make the subjects feel them, display the terrors of authority, and forgetting that they are fathers, rather desire to be thought lords, changing a station of lowliness into that of lofty dominion, if they ever seem outwardly to fawn on any one, they inwardly hate him; of such He spoke above; “They come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.” For prevention whereof we ought to consider that we aresent as sheep among wolves, whose innocence we ought to preserve, not having the tooth of malice.
Hom. in Ev., xxxv, 2: Either that they had presented to the death, or that they had seen and were not changed. For the death of the saints is to the good anaid, to the bad a testimony; that thus the wicked may perish without excuse in that from which the elect take example and live.
