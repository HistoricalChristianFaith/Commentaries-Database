43. Now when Elkanah's ascent is described, his whole house is said to have ascended with him, because those whose minds he elevates he holds as members of his household and intimates in the height of his contemplation. But what is the solemn sacrifice of Elkanah, that is, of our Redeemer, if not the love of that ineffable inner instruction in the hearts of his saints? For each of them finds ineffable delight in himself through that which the revealed sublimity of the Redeemer teaches so sublimely. Therefore Anna refuses to ascend with her husband until she weans her son, because the holy Church avoided touching lofty matters in her preaching as long as she knew that her unlearned hearers, like little children, were utterly unable to grasp lofty things. For this reason it happened in the very beginnings of the holy Church that, as if to Anna's still infant son, milk was offered through the writings of three evangelists, namely Matthew, Luke, and Mark, who in writing the history of the Lord's humanity treated little of his divinity; but when the infant people of the Church grew, and advanced to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ (Eph. 4:13), for whom the drink of milk was no longer sufficient, they sought to be fed with solid food. And so mother Church was compelled to ascend, that she herself might also become a cherub, and might draw near to the Redeemer flying above her, might take up wings, might hold him walking upon them in the height of the sacraments, and might receive from his Majesty what she could give as nourishment to her demanding only child. Hence it came about that the evangelist John, when asked by the brethren, surpassing not only human but also angelic things, transcended all created things, and proclaimed the Only-begotten whom he was worthy to see in the bosom of the Father, saying: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God" (John 1:1). Therefore Anna ascended when the holy Church raised herself so sublimely to the height of divine preaching. Then also she offered the solemn sacrifice, because from the knowledge of divinity she kindled the flame of wondrous devotion in the hearts of her hearers. Indeed it was a solemn sacrifice, from incomparable eloquence, a singular offering of devotion. Then she brought her son into the presence of the Lord, when she instilled perfect knowledge of the supreme divinity into the hearts of her hearers. And because this knowledge of God must not only be held by faith but also by confession, and we are permitted neither to remain ignorant any longer nor to keep silent about what we believe and confess, the weaned child who is brought to the house of the Lord is declared to remain perpetually in the presence of the Lord. There follows: (Verse 23) "And Elkanah her husband said to her: Do what seems good to you; remain until you wean him."

44. What does it mean that Anna's plan is strengthened by her husband's authority, except that the purpose of holy Church is not presumed from human judgment, but from divine? For whatever holy Church wished to arrange among the nations subject to it, it only then held as ratified when it recognized from the judgment of internal truth what ought to be arranged. And because we have an advocate with the Father (1 John 2:1), who intercedes for us, he adds and says: (Verse 23.) And I pray that the Lord may fulfill His word.

45. What is the word that is asserted must be fulfilled, except the predestined conversion of the gentiles? And because we are reconciled to God through his blood, he himself prays for the fulfilling of the word, by whose intercession our salvation is accomplished. For him to pray is also to continually present himself in his assumed humanity to the eternal Father for our salvation; and while he does not cease to offer himself thus, he opens the way for our reception into life. But because he accomplished the plan of his disposition by seeking it out, it is fittingly added: So the woman remained and nursed her son until she weaned him from milk. Then it follows: (Verse 24.) And she brought him, after she had weaned him, with three bulls, and three measures of flour, and a vessel of wine; and she brought him to the house of the Lord in Shiloh.
