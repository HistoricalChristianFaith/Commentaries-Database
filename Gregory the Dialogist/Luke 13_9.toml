And there are many who hear rebukes and yet scorn to return to penitence, and, unfruitful to God, stand green in this world. But let us hear what the vinedresser adds: "If indeed it bears fruit; but if not, you shall cut it down in the future." Because indeed one who does not wish to grow fat here toward fruitfulness through rebuke will fall there from where he can no longer rise through penitence; and he will be cut down in the future, although here he may seem to stand green without fruit.
