20.  In this place by the title of ‘death’ we have denoted the enemy of the human race himself, who brought in death, who is set forth by a particular minister of his, of whom it is said to John, And his name was Death. [Rev. 6, 8]  And so this ‘death,’ in the day of departure hence, ‘tramples upon the wicked man as a king,’ in that him, whom he before deceived by soft persuasions, at the last he carries off to punishment in bonds of violence, and forces him down the more cruelly, in proportion as he ties him the stronger in bad deeds.  And here too while he possesses the heart of the lost sinner, he ‘tramples’ upon it, in that as often as he pressed it with feelings of delight, he as it were set upon it the feet of his tyrannical dominion.
21.  But if by the title of ‘death,’ we are to understand not the devil explicitly, but sin, in consequence of which the lost meet with the doom to be dragged to death, then indeed such ‘death tramples on the mind like a king,’ when it possesses the same making no resistance.  For temptation to sin cannot be away from man whilst set in this life.  But it is one thing to resist sin tempting us, and another to be enthralled by it tyrannizing over us.  And so the wicked man, because he is not taught to resist the persuasions of sin, and is not afraid to be subdued to its dominion, has it rightly said of him, Death as a king shall trample on him.  For it was the reign of this death that Paul was keeping off from the hearts of his disciples, when he said, Let not sin there reign in your mortal body. [Rom. 6, 12]  Since be does not say, ‘let it not be,’ but, let it not reign, in that it cannot help but be, but reign it may not, in the hearts of the good.  And so whereas, when a sin strikes the heart of the bad man, it does not find it resist, but bows it under its dominion, let it rightly be said, Let his confidence be rooted out of his tabernacle, and let death as a king trample on him.  And so ‘his confidence is rooted out of the earth,’ when the man, who in this life had provided for himself many goods after his mind, is brought to nought by death in an instant.  And ‘death as a king tramples on him,’ in that he is either pressed upon here by evil habits, or at the time of his death, hereby, viz. that he is carried off to punishment, he is brought under to the power of the devil.  Which is thus done in the minds of the wicked on this account; because, even when the opportunity of committing sin is lacking, the suggestions of the desire are not in the least lacking to their minds.  And whereas they do always follow the devil in practice, yet do they doubly bind themselves fast to him in thought.  And so there is first sin in thought, and afterwards in act.  Whence it is said to the daughter of Babylon, Come down and sit in the dust, O Virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the earth. [Is. 47, 1]  For whereas dust is always earth, earth is not always dust.  What then are we to understand by dust but thoughts, which, while they perseveringly and silently fly up in the mind, blind its eyes?  And what is denoted by ‘the earth,’ but an earthly way of acting?  And whereas the mind of the lost sinner is first cast down to imagine wicked things, and afterwards to do them, to the daughter of Babylon, who came down from the judgment of interior uprightness, it is rightly said in a wounding sentence, that first she should ‘sit in the dust,’ and afterwards ‘in the earth,’ in that except she had lowered herself in thought, she would never have settled fast in bad practice.
