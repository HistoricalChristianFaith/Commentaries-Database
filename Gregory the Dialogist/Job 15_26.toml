49.  To ‘run against God with erected neck’ is to commit with shamelessness such things as are displeasing to the Creator.  Of whom it is rightly said, He ran, i.e, in doing evil, he had no let or hindrance from adversity.  Concerning whom it is yet further added; And he is armed with a stout neck [pingui cervice].  ‘A stout neck’ is wealthy pride, as being buttressed up with overflowing stores, as it were with a quantity of flesh.  And so the bad man with power ‘is armed against God with a stout neck,’ in that swollen with temporal good things he is set up as by a great bulk of flesh against the precepts of truth.  For what is poverty but a sort of leanness, and what is the abundance of stores but the fatness of the present life?  And so he lifts himself up ‘with a stout neck against God,’ who takes temporal abundance to serve the end of pride.  For the powerful and wicked have this thing proper to them, that being engrossed with deceitful riches they neglect the true riches of God, and in proportion as they investigate the less what is true, they are the more lifted up by false acquisitions.  For the care and concern of earthly things, because it engrosses, utterly blinds the sight.
