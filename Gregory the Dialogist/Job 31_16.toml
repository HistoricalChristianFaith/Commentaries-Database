25. By these words the holy man is shown not only to have ministered to the need of the poor, but also to their desire of having. But what if the poor wished those very things, which perchance it might not be for their good to receive? Is it that, because in Sacred Scripture the lowly are used to be called ‘poor,’ those only are to be accounted the things the poor wish to receive, which the humble seek? And surely it is required, that every thing should be unhesitatingly given that is asked for with true humility; i.e. whatsoever is begged for not from desire but from necessity. For it is to be henceforth very full of pride, to desire any thing beyond the limits of want. And hence it is said to persons asking with pride, Ye ask, and ye receive not, because ye ask amiss. [James 4, 3] Because then they are genuinely poor, who are not blown out through the spirit of pride; which same ‘Truth’, plainly represents, when He says, Blessed are the poor in spirit; [Matt. 5, 5] it is well said in this place by the holy man, If I have denied what they wished for to the poor. Because they that wish those things, which same it is clear are not expedient for them, by this alone, that they are overflowing with a spirit of pride, are not henceforth poor. But blessed Job, seeing that he called the humble ‘poor,’ refused not whatsoever the poor man was minded to receive from him, because every truly humble person did not even wish to have what it could not be that he ought to have.
26. But whereas he points out the bountifulness of his spirit, because he shows that he had met the poor to the wish, it is necessary that we enquire whether he had obscured the light of mercifulness by backwardness in the giving. Hence he subjoins; Or caused the eyes of the widow to wait. He would not have the widow that besought him ‘to wait,’ that not only by the gift, but likewise by the speediness of the gift he might increase the merits of good deeds. Hence it is written elsewhere; Say not unto thy friend, Go and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee. [Prov. 8, 28] Now there are some that are used to bestow as much outwardly, but rejecting the favour of a life in common, they shrink from having the poor their fellows in domestic intercourse. Hence blessed Job, that he might teach not only that he had given much without, but also to his own presence had received all the needy in domestic intercourse.
