In Holy Writ flesh is named in one way according to nature, and in another way according to sin or corruption. For there is flesh according to nature, as where it is written, "This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." And, "The Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us." But there is flesh according to sin, as where it is written, "My Spirit shall not always abide in those men, for that they are flesh." And as the Psalmist saith; "For He remembered that they were but flesh, a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again." Whence too Paul said to the disciples; "But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit." For it was not that these persons were not in the flesh, to whom he was sending letters, but for that they had subdued the motions of carnal passions, henceforth, free through the efficacy of the Spirit, they 'were not in the flesh.' Therefore in respect to what Paul says, that "flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God," he would have flesh to be understood as applied to sin, not flesh as applied to nature. Hence directly afterwards that he was speaking of flesh after sin he makes plain, by adding; "Neither doth corruption inherit incorruption." Therefore in that glory of the heavenly kingdom there will be flesh according to nature, but not flesh according to the desire of the passions; in that the sting of death being overcome, it will reign in eternal incorruptibility.
