"And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof."

What is the meaning of this, that earlier a painting of palms was on the fronts, but now carved palms are mentioned as being on the front? In the carving of stones, indeed, the works appear to be external. But, as we have already said above, the painting of palms is a display of signs. Now, however, carving of palms is spoken of, so that a demonstration of good works may be designated. For to those highest preachers themselves it is said: "Let them see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven." Therefore those who demonstrate that holy works have been impressed upon their life have carved palms on the front, because they already now show in their holy works how great a victory follows them in the future. Or certainly because we have said that faith is designated through the Eastern gate, hope through the Northern gate, but charity through the Southern gate, we must note that in the Eastern gate a painting of palms is reported, but in the Northern and Southern gates, carving is said to be, because it often happens that those who are still beginners do not yet exercise themselves in solid and great works; but those who return from iniquities to virtues are frequently exercised in great works, so that they may be able to cover their faults before the eyes of almighty God. And those who have already grown in virtues by the fervor of the spirit burn as it were like the South in holy actions. In the Eastern gate, therefore, there is painting, but in the Northern and Southern gates there is carving, because the sign of victory which is shown in beginners is already held more solidly and more firmly in those who are returning and in those who are fervent.

It must also be noted with great importance what is said: "on this side and that." For all of us who strive toward the entrance of life must have the palm both on the right and on the left side. For what is said "on this side and that" signifies each side. Therefore, he has the palm on the right whom prosperity does not exalt; he has the palm on the left whom adversity does not cast down. Paul carried the palm as if from each side when he said: "Through the weapons of righteousness on the right and on the left, through glory and dishonor, through ill repute and good repute, as deceivers yet true." Adversity did not break him, prosperity did not lift him up into swelling of mind. Therefore he bore the palm on this side and that, because he remained both strong in adversity and humble in prosperity. For whoever is exalted by prosperity does not know how to have the palm on the right side. Whoever is broken in adversities does not know how to carry the palm on the left side. Therefore, in order that the palm may be borne on the forehead on this side and that, there must always be present in our minds both confidence in adversity and fear in prosperity, lest either adversity drag us into despair or prosperity lift up the soul into self-confidence. Hence it is that the same outstanding preacher said: "I know both how to be humbled, and I know how to abound; everywhere and in all things I have been instructed. Both to be satisfied and to hunger, and to abound and to suffer want—I can do all things in Him who strengthens me."

Is it then, brethren, some skill to be humbled and to abound, to be filled and to hunger, to abound and to suffer want, that so great a preacher would suggest he knows these things as something great? It is entirely a skill, and a wonderful knowledge of discipline, which must be learned by us with the whole effort of our heart. For he who is not broken by his want, who is not drawn back from the giving of thanks, who is not kindled into desire for temporal things, knows how to be humbled. For in this place the Apostle calls being humbled suffering want. For immediately he adds the contrary: "I know also how to abound." For he who is not puffed up by things received, who does not twist them to the use of vain glory, who does not possess alone what he has received, but mercifully divides it with the needy, knows how to abound. He who does not use food received for the gorging of the belly, but for the restoration of strength, nor gives more to the flesh than necessity demands, knows how to be filled. He who tolerates lack of food without murmuring, nor for the necessity of sustenance does anything by which the soul might incur the snare of sin, knows how to hunger. He therefore whom neither pride lifts up in abundance, nor desire provokes in necessity, knows how to abound, knows how to suffer want. When he immediately added, "I can do all things," lest we should believe these to be words of boasting, he added in what, "In him who strengthens me." Behold, a branch has gone forth on high, but because it held itself in the root, it remained in greenness. For rising on high it would have withered, if it had separated itself from the root. For he attributes nothing to himself, because he confesses that he can do all things not in himself, but in him who strengthens him. Therefore on this side and on that the outstanding preacher has the palm, whom neither abundance draws to pride, nor want drags to avarice.

Let us learn, therefore, brothers, to give thanks not only in prosperity but also in adversity. For out of his loving-kindness our Father has become our creator, and he nourishes us as adopted sons for the inheritance of the heavenly kingdom. And he not only refreshes us with gifts but also instructs us with chastisements. Let us learn, therefore, to abound, so that we may share with the needy all that we have received from him. And let not abundance lift up the mind, lest perhaps one rejoice because what is lacking to another is present to oneself, and no longer rejoice in the common good but in one's own private good. Truth calls the disciples back from private joy to common joy, when he admonishes those returning from preaching and rejoicing over the subjection of demons, saying: "Do not rejoice over this, but rather rejoice and exult because your names are written in heaven." For not all the elect cast out demons, yet nevertheless the names of all the elect are held inscribed in heaven. The disciples are therefore admonished to lay aside private joy and to rejoice in common and perpetual happiness. Whoever, therefore, rejoices in what another does not have, made worse by his very abundance, has private joy. Against this craving for abundance John admonishes us, saying: "Do not love the world, nor the things that are in the world." He immediately added the reason why: "If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him." For no one can serve two masters, because one cannot love both transitory and eternal things at the same time. For if we love eternity, we possess all temporal things in use, not in affection. He immediately added this same reason, saying: "Because all that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life."

For this reason people desire to have something even beyond what is necessary, so that they may be proud in having it, and because another does not have this, they exalt themselves in their thoughts. Whoever therefore is of this sort has not yet learned to bear abundance. Often, however, what avarice suggests from desire, one thinks to be necessity, and when lesser things would suffice, one grieves that greater things are lacking, and the incautious mind suffers a kind of quasi-necessity which it begets. And when the things it desires are excessive, it somehow excuses its own avarice to itself. Abundance therefore is close to pride. And if at some point desire has also seized it, this has invaded it, so to speak, like a foreign captivity. If therefore we wish to know the art of abounding, it is necessary that we flee not only those vices which are near, but also those which come from afar. Let us learn to suffer want, lest we seek even with fault to have those things which we do not have, nor let us think happy those whom we see burdened with possessions. The things which they prepare for themselves as if for the expenses of the present life are exceedingly excessive. They carry much, but on a short road; poverty is a great companion to us on this journey, which does not constrict the soul when earthly substance is lacking, for which we must render accounts to the eternal Judge. We proceed more freely toward our homeland, because we are, as it were, without burden on the way.

Let us learn to be satisfied, lest in taking nourishment for the body we serve gluttony rather than necessity. For desire seeks more than necessity requires. And often while we take care to satisfy the want of the flesh, pleasure creeps in and exceeds the measure of refreshment. Hence it happens that fault passes into fault, because frequently another temptation of the flesh arises from the very fact that the flesh is served immoderately in refreshment. For from the sin of the first man, with nature weakened, we are born into this world with our temptations. And the flesh is sometimes our helper in good work, but sometimes a seductress in evil. If therefore we give it more than we ought, we nourish an enemy. And if we do not render to its necessity what we owe, we kill a citizen. The flesh therefore must be satisfied, but only to the point that it may suffice to serve us in good work. For whoever gives it so much that it grows proud utterly knows not how to be satisfied. It is therefore a great art to be satisfied, lest anyone through the satiety of the flesh burst forth into the wickedness of shameful conduct. Let us learn to hunger, so that our want here may please us on account of the abundance to follow, lest the necessity of the belly drag us into fault, lest need suggest sin to the mind itself; and while the flesh is afflicted with hunger, the spirit be provoked to covetousness, and seek with fault to provide whence it might satisfy the flesh in necessity, lest the heart leap forth into indignation and kindle the tongue into the bitterness of murmuring. He therefore who in the want of his flesh looks around himself on every side and guards himself from the snare of sin, knows how to hunger.

Therefore, brothers most dear, fleeing wrath and avarice in adversity, and avoiding elation and immoderate joys in prosperity, because through faith, hope, and charity we desire to enter the court of the interior life by three gates, let us hold palms on this side and on that. It is fitting still to bring to mind another citizen of the heavenly fatherland, and to demonstrate how he holds a palm on this side and on that. For blessed Job, when he was richer than all the men of the East, and all prosperous things abounded for him, his sons flourished, his household grew, his flocks overflowed, he persisted in such great fear of almighty God that amid the keeping of discipline, amid acts of justice, amid many services of humility, intent upon works of mercy, devoted to offering sacrifices, he immolated burnt offerings to the Lord for each of his sons, lest any of them had sinned even in his heart. Let us consider therefore how great was the keeping of good work in him who expiated in his sons the sins of the heart through sacrifices. But how just he was had become known in prosperity; yet it was very much unknown whether he could persevere as just also amid afflictions. Therefore he had to be touched by the rod, so that holy man might be tested in prosperity through adversity, so that he who was known to the almighty Lord might become known through afflictions to us and to himself. Thus with the Lord disposing, the flocks were consumed, the keepers slain, the house overthrown, the sons destroyed, his flesh struck from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. His wife remained unharmed, who might increase his wounds with the javelins of words. But the holy man wisely teaches her in temptation, sound amid his wounds, and responds to her, saying: "If we have received good things from the hand of the Lord, why should we not accept evil things?" Friends also come to console him, but break forth into insults, and to the pain of his wounds they add still more wounds of words. They call him merciless, they name him a plunderer, they denounce him as violent, they declare him an oppressor of the poor. What therefore would the soldier of God do, caught between painful wounds and bitter words? Behold, the scourges of God and the words of men together press his afflicted soul toward despair; but, filled with the power of the spirit, lying down with wounds of the flesh, standing with strength of mind, against the impulse of despair he brought back to memory the good things he had done. Because he had been merciful, he says: "I was an eye to the blind, and a foot to the lame." And again: "I was a father to the poor." Because he was both a guardian of discipline and kind, he says: "And when I sat as a king, with the army standing around me, I was nevertheless a consoler of those who mourned." Because he had been humble, he says: "If I refused to undergo judgment with my servant and my maidservant, when they disputed against me." Because he had been hospitable, he confesses: "If I despised one passing by, because he had no garment." Because he was generous in gifts, he says: "If his sides have not blessed me, and he was warmed from the fleeces of my sheep." Because he was not violent, he testifies, saying: "If I raised my hand against the orphan, when I saw myself superior at the gate." Because he never exulted at the peril of an enemy, he says: "If I rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me." Because he was patient, and also bore the malice of his own people with equanimity, he says: "If the men of my tent have not said, Who will give us of his flesh that we may be satisfied?" What is it therefore that the holy man enumerates so many of his virtues amid afflictions? What is it that he praises with his own mouth the works he had done, except that amid wounds and words which could drag him to despair, they reform his soul to hope? And he who was humble in prosperity, having recalled his good deeds to memory, remained unbroken in adversity. For whose soul would those words not drive to despair amid so many afflictions, unless he had recalled to memory the good things he had done? The holy man therefore saw his mind being shaken toward despair upon hearing so many evils, and he wonderfully strove to be strengthened in certain hope from his good actions. Thus is fulfilled what is written: "In the day of good things be not unmindful of evil things, and in the day of evil things be not unmindful of good things." For if when we have good things we remember the evil things which we have either already suffered or can still suffer, the good things received do not elevate the mind, because the fear from the memory of evil things suppresses their joy. And if when we have evil things we remember the good things which we have either already received or hope we can still receive, the weight of evil things does not press the soul down into despair, because the memory of good things lifts it to hope. If therefore, brothers most dear, we so walk through the Lord's precepts and through the examples of the saints, that neither prosperity elevates us nor adversity breaks us, we show that we hold palms on this side and on that before the eyes of almighty God. To whom is honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
