9. O Lord, the sentence of Thy judgment declares how much our blindness is at variance with the light of Thine uprightness. Behold, we know that in Thy judgment blessed Job is victorious, whom we believed to have sinned against Thee by his words. In Thy judgment those are condemned, who believed that they surpassed the merits of blessed Job by speaking in Thy behalf. Since then we have learned by the Divine sentence what to think of the parties, let us now examine a little more minutely the words of this sentence. For how is it that blessed Job is blamed above, if, in comparison with his uprightness, his friends are said not to have spoken that which is right before the Lord? Is not this decision concerning him still further confirmed, in which it is said to the ancient enemy, Hast thou seen My servant Job, that there is none like him upon the earth? [Job 1, 8] But what is this, that he is praised to the enemy, and reproved in his own person; reproved in his own person, and yet preferred to the friends who spake to him? Unless it be that the holy man surpassed all men by the virtue of his merits, and yet, inasmuch as he was man, could not possibly be without blame before the eyes of God. For in a holy man sojourning in this temporary state, the rule of the Divine judgment has still something to judge, though in comparison with the rest of men it has even now something to praise. Blessed Job therefore believed that he was scourged for his fault, and not as a favour; he considered that his sins were lopped off, not that his merits were increased. And he is blamed for imagining that the intention of the scourging was different, and yet is preferred, in the decision of the inward judgment, to his friends who opposed him. Whence it is plainly gathered how great was his justice, in establishing the innocence of his doings against the arguments of his friends, since he is preferred in the Divine judgment even to those very persons who defended the Divine judgment. But we learned in the beginning of this Book [Bk. 3. ยง 15] that Satan had said of him to the Lord; Put forth Thy hand and touch him, and see if he do not bless Thee to Thy face. [Job 2, 5] At which request blessed Job is permitted to be touched with losses, with bereavement, with wounds, and with offensive words, because, in truth, He Who had praised him was certain, that the holy man would never, according to the assertion of the devil, fall into the sin of cursing. As we have then said also above, [Preface chap. 3] whoever considers that blessed Job sinned in his words after he had been scourged, plainly decides that the Lord had been the loser in His pledging. And though the Lord in speaking to the devil, brought forward his present good qualities, but did not promise his perseverance, it should yet be known that He would not have put forward his righteousness by permitting it to he tempted, if He foresaw that he would not he able to continue righteous under temptation. Since the devil then had been permitted by God to tempt him, if any one considers that he sank under temptation, he blames the ignorance of Him who permitted it.
10. Let us then truthfully approve of blessed Job in his sayings, lest we should sinfully blame God in His providence. And although, as far as concerns human judgments, his friends might be believed to have said in their words many things better than himself, yet Truth bringing forth another rule from the secret place, says; Ye have not spoken before Me the thing that is right, as My servant Job. Before Me, He says, that is, within, where the conduct of many often displeases, even if outwardly it is pleasing to men. Whence it is said with great judgment, in praise of the righteous married people; They were both righteous before God. [Luke 1, 6] For it is no safe praise to appear just before men. For the opinion of man often approves of a person as if mighty before God, but Almighty God knows not him, who is approved of as if by Him. For hence is it that the Psalmist watchfully prays, saying; Direct my way in Thy sight. [Ps. 5, 8] Doubtless, because even that way is frequently believed to be right in the sight of men, which is turned aside from the way of truth. And it is observable, that it is not said, Ye have not spoken before Me the thing that is right as Job, but, as My servant Job. In order, namely, that by speaking of him as if in some sort in a peculiar character, by introducing the mention of his being a servant, He might point out that all that had been urged in his defence, he had said not with haughty pride, but with humble truth. But because God is just and merciful, He both reproves his friends strictly with His justice, and graciously converts them by His mercy.
