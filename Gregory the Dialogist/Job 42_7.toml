For in a holy person sojourning in this temporary state, the rule of the divine judgment has still something to judge, though in comparison with the rest of people it has, even now, something to praise. Blessed Job therefore believed that he was scourged for his fault and not as a favor. He considered that his sins were lopped off, not that his merits were increased. He is blamed for imagining that the intention of the scourging was different. Yet this intent is preferred, as seen in the decision of the inward judgment of his friends who opposed him. Hence it is plainly evident how great was his justice in establishing the innocence of his doings against the arguments of his friends, since he is preferred in the divine judgment even to those very persons who defended the divine judgment.
