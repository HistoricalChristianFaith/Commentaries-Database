56.  For what is denoted by the name of the grave, saving a life of contemplation?  which as it were buries us, dead to this world, in that it hides us in the interior world away from all earthly desires.  For they being dead to the exterior life, were also buried by contemplation, to whom Paul said, For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Christ in God.  An active life also is a grave, in that it covers us, as dead, from evil works; but the contemplative life more perfectly buries us, in that it wholly severs us from all worldly courses.  Whoever then has already subdued the insolencies of the flesh in himself, has this task left him, to discipline his mind by the exercises of holy practice.  And whosoever opens his mind in holy works, has over and above to extend it to the secret pursuits of inward contemplation.  For he is no perfect preacher, who either, from devotion to contemplation, neglects works that ought to be done, or, from urgency in business, puts aside the duties of contemplation.  For it is hence that Abraham buries his wife after death in a double [in spelunca agri duplici Vulg.] sepulchre, in that every perfect preacher buries his soul, dead to the desires of the present life, under the covering of good practice and of contemplation, that the soul which aforetime, sensible of the desires of the world, was living in death, may as it were, without being obnoxious to sense, lie buried from carnal concupiscence under an active and contemplative life.  It is hence that the Redeemer of mankind in the day time exhibits His miracles in cities, and spends the night in devotion to prayer upon the mountain, namely, that He may teach all perfect preachers, that they should neither entirely leave the active life, from love of the speculative, nor wholly slight the joys of contemplation from excess in working, but in quiet imbibe by contemplation, what in employment they may pour back to their neighbours by word of mouth.  For by contemplation they rise into the love of God, but by preaching they return back to the service of their neighbour.  Hence with Moses, whilst a heifer is slaughtered in sacrifice, scarlet wool twice dyed is enjoined to be offered together with hyssop and cedar wood.  For we slay a heifer, when we kill our flesh to its lust of gratification; and this we offer with hyssop and cedar and scarlet wool, in that together with the mortifying of the flesh, we burn the incense of faith, hope, and charity.  The hyssop is of use to purify our inward parts; and Peter says, purifying their hearts by faith. [1 Pet. 1, 3]  Cedar wood never decays by rotting, in that no end finishes the hope of heavenly things.  Whence too Peter saith, He hath begotten us again by a lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead; to an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away.  Scarlet wool flames with the redness of its hue, in that charity sets on fire the heart she fills.  Whence also ‘Truth’ saith in the Gospel, I am come to send fire on the earth.  But scarlet wool twice dyed is ordered to be offered, that in the sight of the internal Judge our charity may be coloured with the love both of God and of our neighbour, that the converted soul may neither so delight in repose for the sake of the love of God, as to put aside the care and service of our neighbour, nor busying itself for the love of our neighbour, be so wedded, thereto, that entirely forsaking quiet, it extinguish in itself the fire of love of the Most High.  Whosoever then has already offered himself as a sacrifice to God, if he desires perfection, must needs take care that he not only stretch himself out to breadth of practice, but likewise up to the heights of contemplation.
57.  But herein it is above all things necessary to know, that the compositions [‘conspersio,’  dough, paste.] of souls are infinitely varied one with another, for there are some of such inactivity of mind, that, if the labours of business fall upon them, they give way at the very beginning of their work, and there be some so restless, that if they have cessation from labour, they have only the worse labour, in that they are subject to worse tumults of mind, in proportion as they have more time and liberty for their thoughts.  Whence it behoves that neither the tranquil mind should open itself wide in the immoderate exercising of works, nor the restless mind stint itself in devotion to contemplation.  For often they, who might have contemplated God in quiet, have fallen, being overcharged with business; and often they, who might live advantageously occupied with the service of their fellow-creatures, are killed by the sword of their quiescence.  It is hence that some restless spirits, whilst by contemplation they hunt out more than their wits compass, launch out even to the length of wrong doctrines, and, whilst they have no mind to be the disciples of Truth in a spirit of humility, they become the masters of falsities.  It is hence that ‘Truth’ saith by His own lips, And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; for it is profitable for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes be cast into hell fire.  For the two lives, the active and the contemplative, when they be preserved in the soul, are accounted as two eyes in the face.  Thus the right eye is the contemplative life, and the left the active life.  But, as we have said, there be some, who are quite unable to behold the world above, and spiritual things, with the eye of discernment, yet enter upon the, heights of contemplation, and therefore, by the mistake of a perverted understanding, they fall away into the pit of misbelieve.  These then the contemplative life, adopted to an extent beyond their powers, obliges to fall from the truth, which same persons the active life by itself might have kept safe in lowliness of mind in the firm seat of their uprightness.  To these ‘Truth’ rightly addresses the warning which we said before, And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from thee; for it is good for thee to enter into life with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.  As if He said in plain words; ‘When thou art not qualified for the contemplative life by a fitting degree of discretion, keep more safely the active life alone, and when thou failest in that which thou choosest as great, be content with that which thou heedest as very little, that if by the contemplative life thou art forced to fall from the knowledge of the truth, thou mayest by the active life alone be able to enter into the kingdom of heaven at least with one eye.’  Hence He says again, But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe in Me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea. [Matt. 18, 6]  What is denoted by ‘the sea,’ but this present state of being? what by ‘the millstone,’ but earthly practice, which while it binds down the neck of the soul by foolish desires, sends it out into the round of labour.  Thus there are some, who, while they quit earthly courses and rise beyond the powers of their understanding in pursuance of the exercises of contemplation, having laid aside humility, not only cast themselves into error, but separate any that be weak from the bosom of unity; and thus ‘it would be better for him, that offends one of the least, with a millstone fastened to his neck, to be cast into the sea,’ in that indeed it would have been more expedient for the froward mind, if, busied with the world, it were employed in earthly matters, than, in the exercises of contemplation, to be free to work the destruction of numbers.  On the other hand, if it were not that the contemplative life suited some minds more than the active life, the Lord would never say by the voice of the Psalmist, Be still, and know that I am God. [Ps. 46, 10]
58.  But herein it is necessary to know, that often at one and the same time love stimulates inactive souls to work, and fear keeps back restless souls in the exercise of contemplation.  For a weight of fear is an anchor of the heart, and very often it is tossed by the stormy sea of thoughts, but is held fast by the moorings of its self-control; nor does the tempest of its disquietude make shipwreck of it, in that perfect charity holds it fast on the shore of the love of God [d].  Whence it is necessary that whoever eagerly prosecutes the exercises of contemplation, first question himself with particularity, how much he loves.  For the force of love is an engine of the soul, which, while it draws it out of the world, lifts it on high.  Let him then first examine whether in searching after the highest things he loves, whether in loving he fears, whether he knows either how to apprehend unknown truths, while he loves them, or not being apprehended to reverence them in cherishing fear.  For in contemplation, if love does not stimulate the mind, the dulness of its tepidity stupefies it.  If fear does not weigh on it, sense lifts it by vain objects to the mist of error, and when the door of secret things, being closed against it, is slow in being opened, merely by its own presumption alone it is forced the farther off there-from, for it strives to force a way to that which it seeks after without finding, and when the proud mind takes falsehood for truth, in proportion as it is advancing the step as if inwards, it is directing it without.  Thus it is for this reason that the Lord, when about to give the Law, came down in fire and in smoke; in that He both enlightens the lowly by the clearness of His manifestation of Himself, and darkens the eyes of the highminded by the dimness of error.  First then the soul must be cleansed from all affection for earthly glory, and from the gratification of carnal concupiscence, and next it is to be lifted up in the ken of contemplation.  Hence too, when the Law is given to them, the people are forbidden the Mount, namely, that they who, by the frailty of their minds, still have their affections set upon earthly objects, may not venture to take cognizance of things above.  And hence it is rightly said, And if a beast touch the mountain, it shall he stoned.  For ‘a beast touches the mountain,’ when the mind, which is bowed down to irrational desires, lifts itself to the heights of contemplation.  But it is ‘smitten with stones,’ in that being unable to bear the highest things, it is killed by the mere blows of the weight on high.
 
59.  Let all then that strive to lay hold of the summit of perfection, when they desire to occupy the citadel of contemplation, first try themselves, by exercising, in the field of practice, that they may heedfully acquaint themselves, if they now no longer bring mischiefs upon their neighbours, if when brought upon them by their neighbours, they bear them with composure of mind, if when temporal advantages are put in their way, the mind is never dissipated by joy, if, when they are withdrawn, it is not stung by overmuch regret, and then let them reflect, if, when they return inwardly to themselves, in this work of theirs of exploring spiritual things, they never draw along with them the shadows of corporeal objects, or when drawn along, as they may be, if they drive them off with the hand of discretion [al. districtionis, severity]; if, when they long to behold the unencompassed light, they put down all images of their own compass, or in that which they seek to reach unto above themselves, conquer that which they are.  Hence it is rightly said here, Thou shalt come to thy grave in abundance.  For the perfect man does ‘come to the grave in abundance,’ in that he first gathers together the works of an active life, and then by contemplation wholly hides from this world his fleshly sense, which is now dead.  Hence too it is fitly subjoined,
Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.
60.  For the season for action comes first, for contemplation last.  Whence it is needful that every perfect man first discipline his mind in virtuous habits, and afterwards lay it up in the granary of rest.  For it is hence that he, who was left of the legion of devils at the bidding of our Lord, seats himself at His Saviour's feet, receives the words of instruction, and eagerly desires to leave his country in company with the Author of his recovery, but That very ‘Truth’ Himself, Who vouchsafed to him recovery, tells him, Return first unto thine own house, and show what great things God hath done unto thee. [Luke 8, 39. &c.]  For when we have the least particle imparted to us of the knowledge of God, we are no longer inclined to return to our human affairs, and we shrink from burthening ourselves with the wants of our neighbours.  We seek the rest of contemplation, and love only that which refreshes without toil.  But after we are cured, the Lord sends us home.  He bids us relate the things that have been done with us, so as that in fact the soul should first spend itself in labour, and that afterwards it may be refreshed by contemplation.
61.  It is hence that Jacob serves for Rachel, and gets Leah, and that it is said to him, It is not the custom in our country to give the youngest before the first-born.  For Rachel is rendered ‘the beginning seen [c],’ but ‘Leah,’ ‘laborious.’ And what is denoted by Rachel but the contemplative life?  What by Leah, but the active life?  For in contemplation ‘the Beginning,’ which is God, is the object we seek, but in action we labour under a weighty bundle of wants.  Whence on the one hand Rachel is beautiful but barren, Leah weak eyed, but fruitful, truly in that when the mind seeks the ease of contemplation, it sees more, but it is less productive in children to God.  But when it betakes itself to the laborious work of preaching, it sees less, but it bears more largely.  Accordingly after the embrace of Leah, Jacob attains to Rachel, in that every one that is perfect is first joined to an active life in productiveness, and afterwards united to a contemplative life in rest.  For that the life of contemplation is less indeed in time [i.e. age], but greater in value [merito] than the active, we are shown by the words of the Holy Gospel, wherein two women are described to have acted in different ways.  For Mary sat at our Redeemer's feet, hearing His words, but Martha eagerly prosecuted bodily services; and when Martha made complaint against Mary's inactivity, she heard the words, Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things; but one thing is needful: and Mary hath chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her. [Luke 10, 41. 42.]  For what is set forth by Mary, who sitting down gave ear to the words of our Lord, saving the life of contemplation? and what by Martha, so busied with outward services, saving the life of action?  Now Martha's concern is not reproved, but that of Mary is even commended.  For the merits of the active life are great, but of the contemplative, far better.  Whence Mary's part is said to be ‘never taken away from her,’ in that the works of the active life pass away together with the body, while the joys of the contemplative life are made more lively at the end.  Which is well and briefly set forth by the Prophet Ezekiel, when, beholding the flying creatures, he says, And the likeness of the hands of a man were under their wings. [Ezek. 10, 21]  For what can we suppose meant by the wings of the creatures, saving the contemplations of the Saints, by which they soar aloft, and quitting earthly scenes, poise themselves in the regions of heaven?  What do we understand by the ‘hands,’ saving deeds?  For whereas they open themselves in the love of their neighbour, the good things, which abound to them, they administer even by bodily ministration; but ‘the hands are under the wings,’ in that they surpass the deeds of their action, by the excellence of contemplation.
62.  Moreover by ‘the grave’ it may be that not only our contemplation in this life is understood, but the rest of our eternal and interior reward, wherein we more thoroughly rest, the more perfectly is killed in us the life of corrupt existence.  He then ‘goes down to the grave in abundance,’ who, after he has stored up the works of the present life, being perfectly dead to his mutable condition of existence, is buried in the depth of the true light.  Whence also it is said by the Psalmist, Thou shalt hide them in the secret of Thy presence, from the provoking of men. [Ps. 31, 20]  And the comparison that is added brings this home to us with effect, where it is subjoined, Like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season.  For corn in the field is touched by the sun, in that in this life the soul of man is illumined by the regard of the light above.  It receives the showers, in that it is enriched by the word of Truth; it is shaken by the winds, in that it is tried with temptations; and it bears the chaff ‘growing’ along with it, in that it bears the life of daily increasing wickedness in sinners, directed against itself; and after it has been carried away to the barn, it is squeezed by the threshing weight, that it may be parted from the bold of the chaff, in that our mind, being subjected to heavenly discipline, whilst it receives the stripes of correction, is parted from the society of the carnal sort in a cleaner state; and it is carried to the granary with the chaff left behind, in that while the lost remain without, the Elect soul is transported to the eternal joys of the mansion above.  Well then is it said, Thou shalt come to thy grave in abundance, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season; in that, whereas the righteous after sufferings meet with the rewards of the heavenly land, it is like as if the grains after pressing and squeezing were carried away to the granary.  And it is in another's season indeed that they feel the strokes, but in their own that they rest from being struck.  For to the Elect the present life is another's season, whence to some that were yet unbelievers ‘Truth’ saith, My time is not yet come, but your time is alway ready. [John 7, 6.]  And again, But this is your hour, and the power of darkness. [Luke 22, 53.]  Thus ‘he cometh to his grave in abundance, like as a shock of corn cometh in in his season,’ in that he receives the rest eternal, who, that he may be set free of the chaff, which is destined to be burnt, first feels here below the pressure of discipline.  But whereas Eliphaz in the course of his address mentioned ‘the tabernacle,’ ‘the stones,’ ‘the beasts,’ ‘the seed,’ ‘the herbs,’ and ‘the grave,’ he himself intimates that he did not speak of these according to the letter.
