I will teach you by the hand of God, that which is with the Almighty; I will not conceal. Behold, all ye yourselves know: why then do ye utter vain things without cause? This is the portion of an ungodly man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

In such a way does blessed Job speak in his own words as to denote something connected with what relates to us. For Holy Church in teaching, in so far as it is expedient to know it, hides not a particle of truth. Thus because 'the Hand of God' is a name for the Son; for, by Him were all things made; she tells that by the Hand of God she teaches those, whom she sees continuing foolish in their own wisdom. As if she said in plain words; 'I know not any thing of myself; but whatever I perceive of the Truth, this I comprehend by the bountifulness of that same Truth. Ye for this reason are not embued with right wisdom, because this same wisdom that you have you ascribe not to the Hand of God, but to your own selves.' For the adversaries of Holy Church, if they do at times perceive any thing true, this they attribute to their own powers, and they deprive themselves so much the more of the Wisdom from Above, in the same proportion as they wish to have it appropriated to themselves as being derived from their own wits. Unto whom it is sometimes vouchsafed for their judgment, that they should indeed know some things aright, but by this very same knowledge be rendered the more obnoxious to punishment.

It is written; And that servant, which knew his lord's will, and prepared not himself; neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. But he that knew not, and did not worthily, shall be beaten with few stripes. And again it is written; Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. And so for the heightening of greater guilt Holy Church tells it that her enemies at once know what they ought to follow, and will not follow what they may know. Of which same persons it is elsewhere said; Let them go down quick into hell. Those are 'quick' that are sensible of the things that are done towards them. For the dead neither know nor are sensible at all, and so 'the dead' who do not feel are used to be put for persons that know not, but 'the quick,' who are sensible, for those that know. Therefore to 'go down quick into hell' is for persons to sin knowing and being sensible of it.
