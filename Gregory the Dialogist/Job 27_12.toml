9.  It is written; And that servant, ‘Which knew his lord’s will, and prepared not himself; neither did according to his will, shall be beaten with many stripes. [Luke 12, 47. 48.]  But he that knew not, and did not worthily, shall be beaten with few stripes.  And again it is written; Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to him it is sin. [Jam. 4, 17]  And so for the heightening of greater guilt Holy Church tells it that her enemies at once know what they ought to follow, and will not follow what they may know.  Of which same persons it is elsewhere said; Let them go down quick into hell. [Ps. 55, 15]  Those are’ quick’ that are sensible of the things that are done towards them.  For the dead neither know nor are sensible at all, and so ‘the dead’ who do not feel are used to be put for persons that know not, but’ the quick,’ who are sensible, for those that know.  Therefore to ‘go down quick into hell’ is for persons to sin knowing and being sensible of it.  It goes on; This is the portion of an ungodly man with God, and the heritage of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.  Which same’ portion’ and’ inheritance’ he thereupon gives.
