23. What does it mean that Anna requests a male child from the Lord, except that those whom holy Church desires to bring forth by preaching, she longs for them to be strong in Evangelical perfection? For in comparison with Evangelical perfection, those works of the Law which seemed strong were not strong, but weak. For there it was commanded: "You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy" (Lev. 19:18). But in the Gospel the Lord commands, saying: "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you" (Matt. 5:44). There the uncleanness of fornication is cut away from the body, so that the strength of conduct might excel as if by the male sex; here impure thought is also cut away from the heart: "Whoever looks at a woman to lust after her," he says, "has already committed adultery with her in his heart" (Matt. 5:28). Therefore the Synagogue, which brought forth the Jewish people through the weakness of its precepts, did not bear the male sex, but rather the female. And so when Anna requests that a male child be given to her by the Lord, what else is she seen to desire, except to bring forth through the Gospel such ones as would appear strong, both in outward purity of body and in inward charity?

24. And because the order of preachers does not seek human glory from the conversion of the Gentiles, it is added: "I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life." For he gives a son to the Lord who does not claim anything for his own praises from the one whom he begets through preaching. He also gives him to the Lord all the days of his life who ascribes nothing to his own favor from the virtues in which his subject advances by improving. For the days of life of the chosen subject are the holy virtues, which illuminate his soul by their radiance lest it be darkened by the night of vices on the way to the heavenly homeland.

25. But the perfect order of the preacher, while he despises having favors from the profit of preaching, does not take away the temporal goods of his subjects by coveting them. Hence it is well added there: "And no razor shall come upon his head." When a razor comes upon the head, it shaves the hair. For what is designated by hairs, which are superfluous to the body, except the abundant supply of earthly substance? And what is expressed by the razor except the greed of evil pastors? By which razor the head of a born son is shaved, when the goods of subjects are seized through the greed of preachers. Hence also it is said to sinning Judea through the prophet: "Your shepherds are wolves of the evening, not leaving anything in the morning" (Zeph. 3:3). For in the evening the shepherds become wolves, because as this world grows dark and declines toward its end, they do not fear to seize the goods of their subjects. They do not leave anything in the morning, because while they gape after temporal things, as the coming of the future judgment grows bright, they do not reserve for themselves the rewards to be given. These indeed Micah denounces, saying: "The prophets who seduce my people, who bite with their teeth and preach peace; and if anyone does not give something into their mouth, they sanctify war against him" (Mic. 3:5). For the prophets seduce the people of the Lord when reprobate preachers confuse the judgments of their hearers. And biting with their teeth they announce peace, because in the appetite of their rapacity, while they look up to the earthly gifts of the wicked, they promise them the security of divine indulgence. But they sanctify war against those who do not give something into their mouth, because they terrify even the just with harsh sentences, who do not offer them earthly things according to their desire. These indeed place a razor upon the head of the son, because under the pretext of charity they preach heavenly things, so that they may take earthly things from them through greed. That holy Church does not have this razor for the plundering of subjects, the excellent teacher shows in himself, saying: "I do not seek the gift, but I seek the fruit" (Phil. 4:17). Hence he also says: "Let him who preaches the Gospel live by the Gospel. But I have not used this power" (1 Cor. 9:14, 15). For he who does not care to receive necessary sustenance from his subjects clearly shows with what sublimity of worldly contempt he would reject shameful gains and illicit gifts. Therefore when Hannah vows that a razor shall not come upon the head of her son, she openly suggests the customs of holy Church, which brings forth the elect to eternal life by speaking, but never takes away their temporal goods through avarice. But because this is said of Hannah still vowing and not yet giving birth, it is fittingly added: (Verse 12.) "And it came to pass, as she multiplied prayers before the Lord, that Eli observed her mouth."

(Moral Exposition) She vows her son to Almighty God who seeks the joy of contemplation for the fruit of the mind, not for the favor of vanity. But carnal superiors are accustomed to resist vehemently those who rightly seek the desire of contemplation; for they think that those desiring a more secluded life act all the more foolishly, because they themselves are ignorant of the power of interior sweetness. If they sometimes rage against spiritual subjects with the voice of harsh rebuke, they must be calmed by the most humble reasoning. For if they unreasonably rise up against those acting rightly, the reverence due to the higher order requires that they be honored even when they exceed the measure of reason.
