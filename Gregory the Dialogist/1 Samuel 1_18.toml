36. The woman went on her way, because the holy Church preached the word of faith to the Gentiles. Which the apostles also say, threatening the Jews: "Because you judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles" (Acts 13:46). She is rightly called a woman when she departs, because through the preaching of the Redeemer she was about to produce among the Gentiles the fruit of great fruitfulness. Moreover, she ate and drank, and yet her countenance was no longer changed to various expressions, because she gained great profits from the conversion of the Gentiles, but the persecution which she had suffered in Judea, she also found among the Gentiles. But explaining the order in which she departed, it says: (Verse 19) "And they rose early in the morning, and worshipped before the Lord; and they returned, and came to their house, in Ramah."
