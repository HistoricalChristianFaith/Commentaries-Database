39. Samuel is interpreted as "his name is God." Who then does Samuel more fittingly suggest to us than the order of preachers, which was called to faith from among the Gentiles? For because he is strong in conduct, exalted in power, and while the special sign of divine grace is observed in him, devoted crowds of hearers are led to veneration of his preaching, rightly his name is declared by its appellation. Hence it is said by the Lord to Moses: "I have made you a god to Pharaoh" (Exodus 7:1). Hence also in the law, forbidding, he says: "You shall not speak evil of gods" (Exodus 22:28). And it should be noted that he whose name is called god was a son, not a daughter, because certainly pastoral dignity, when it is weighed down by weak conduct, is not adorned with the splendor of so lofty a name. Since therefore the order of teachers, promoted from among the Gentiles to the ministry of preaching the gospel, was not unequal by the grace of merits to the excellence of their dignity, rightly it is now said: "She called his name Samuel, because she had asked him from the Lord." And it should be noted that in this place "to ask" means what she obtained by asking. Therefore in plain words it is shown why Anna's firstborn is distinguished by so great a name. This is as if to say: She gave him so great a name for this reason, because he who is born by heavenly gift was great by the grace of merits. But to show with what care the provident mother nourishes him, it follows: (Verses 21 and 22.) "And her husband Elkanah went up, and all his house, to offer the solemn sacrifice, and his vow; and Anna did not go up. For she said to her husband: I will not go until the child is weaned."

(Moral Exposition) But what does it mean that Anna conceives and gives birth after the cycle of days, except that contemplation, once elevated to the beauty of the Creator, does not receive the joy of perfect devotion? Therefore she is said to have conceived and given birth after the cycle of days, because when contemplation is habitually seized up to heavenly things, it receives the gift of desired fruitfulness in the vision of heavenly light. For the cycle of days is the infusion of divine light. This is indeed encompassed by many days in its circuit, while it illuminates the mind with its single brightness, yet it gradually introduces the rays of its splendor to the mind through alternating manifestations of its dispensation, until it comprehends a more perfect joy from a fuller manifestation. Or certainly Anna conceives after the cycle of days, because indeed as long as the rawness of contemplation shakes the mind's sharp gaze in the whirl of mutability, the mind itself does not rise to perceive the full joy of inner majesty. For days pass as if in a certain circle, when the mind of the beginner elevates itself to the height of contemplation, but the ray of light, though glimpsed, scarcely keeps the mind, still wavering and wandering, fixed in its light. Therefore she conceives after the cycle of days, because first the soul is led from the dizziness of its change into the strength of standing firm, and when it has learned from practice to stand fixed in contemplation, it grasps the joy of perfect devotion in the fruit of its fruitfulness. This conception it also brings forth when it makes known to neighbors the glory of heavenly majesty.
