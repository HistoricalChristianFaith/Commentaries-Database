11. This indeed is because those who are already secure from nearby help grant a certain hope to the enemies whom they deceive by promising. In voice indeed they simulate weakness, but inwardly they preserve the strength of the promised help. Therefore they promise one thing, but believe another. For those who said: "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you shall do to us all that pleases you," were giving the enemies to believe that they would so deliver themselves into their hands that they could do to them whatever they wished. But those who knew that the king was coming the following day to their aid were thinking of going out with him not to the enemies' hands, but to their slaughter. According to the spiritual sense, however, to the serpent Nahash, that is, to the concupiscence of gluttony, we promise our going out on his day, but on our day we defeat his battle lines. His day indeed is the delight of bodily satiety. For he who proposes to fill his belly according to his desire, as it were, dedicates the first day to concupiscence, and yet is still inside, because he has set before himself a certain light of delight which he has not yet seen by carrying it out. Tomorrow, therefore, he went out, who both by carrying out and by delighting exhibited that pleasant thing which he promised to the flesh. But holy men, as I said above, mock gluttony; because since they cannot despair of its appetite in perpetuity, what they promise and do not take, they as it were defer to a future light of delight. They are indeed compelled outwardly by the excessive frailty of the flesh, and inwardly clothed with the strength of great charity. By the former indeed, since they cannot renounce their appetites, they as it were promise with an outward voice what they do not hold in their intention. By the latter, because they are secure concerning divine aid, they propose to do something other than what they speak with the voice of weakness. On his day, therefore, they go out to Nahash, because they advance to combat the concupiscence of gluttony through the light of heavenly help, and visited by heavenly grace, they are now strong against every assault of the flesh, who, abandoned for a little while, had feared its attacks. And because this splendor of divine grace is sometimes poured into the lesser members of holy Church through the mouths of preachers, there follows: (Verse 11.) And it came to pass, when the next day had come, Saul arranged the people in three companies, and entered the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and struck Ammon until the sun grew hot.
