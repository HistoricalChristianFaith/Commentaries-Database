Now righteous people conceive a dread of God before his indignation is stirred up against them; they fear him at rest, lest they should feel him as moved. But, on the other hand, the wicked then for the first time fear to be smitten when they are under the rod, and terror then rouses them from the sleep of their insensibility when vengeance is troubling them. And hence it is said by the prophet, “And only the vexing alone shall supply understanding to the hearing.” For when they have begun to be stricken in vengeance for the contempt and neglect of God’s precepts, then they understand the thing that they heard.
