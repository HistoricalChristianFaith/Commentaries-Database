57. By ‘good,’ is designated right conduct, but by ‘glory,’ heavenly recompense. They, then, who study to obey the Divine commands, fulfil their days in good, and their years in glory. Because they pass the course of this life in right deeds, and perfect their consummation by a blessed retribution. But if they shall not hear, they shall pass away by the sword, and shall be consumed in their folly. For vengeance smites them in tribulation, and the end shuts them up in folly. For there are some, whom not even torments keep back from their abandoned habits. Of whom it is said by the Prophet, Thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; Thou hast scourged them, and they have refused to receive correction. [Jer. 5, 3] And of whom it is said under the figure of Babylon, We have cured Babylon, and she is not healed. [Jer. 51, 9] Of whom it is said again, I have slain and destroyed My people, and yet they have not returned from their ways? [Jer. 15, 7] These sometimes become worse by the scourge, because, when attacked by pain, they are either more hardened in their contumacious obstinacy, or, what is worse, launch out into even the exasperation of blasphemy. It is well said, then, that they pass away by the sword, and are consumed with folly; for through their scourges, they increase those sins, which they ought, in consequence of them, to correct. And they both feel even here the punishments of the blow, and do not escape there the sufferings of righteous retribution. For it is the infatuation of folly that iniquity so fetters them, that not even punishment keeps them from offending.
