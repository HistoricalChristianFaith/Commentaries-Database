By the name 'horse' is understood temporal dignity, as Solomon witnesses, who says, "I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as servants upon the earth." For every one who sins is the servant of sin, and servants are upon horses, when sinners are elated with the dignities of the present life. But princes walk as servants, when no honour exalts many who are full of the dignity of virtues, but when the greatest misfortune here presses them down, as though unworthy. Hence it is said again; "They have slumbered who mounted horses." That is, in the death of the soul, they, who trusted in the honour of the present life, have closed the eyes of their mind to the light of truth.
