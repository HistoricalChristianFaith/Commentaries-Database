25. Those ruined multitudes of angels are the cities that were taken away. But then they are restored, when from the elect human nature is assumed that which may supply what was lost from among the angels. This can also fittingly be understood of the conversion of wicked men. For the cities of the Philistines are taken away when the unity of the faithful is deceived by temptation, and they are subjected to themselves by being plunged into sins. But the cities that were taken away are restored to Israel: because penitents in this life make such satisfaction that in everlasting glory they are presented resplendent for the joy of the elect. And because not only those who neglect to do good, but even those who abundantly commit iniquity, are saved through repentance, it is added: "From Ekron even unto Gath."

26. Accaron means "barren," Geth means "winepress." Barren indeed are those who do not perform good works. In the winepress, moreover, the grape is pressed, and wine is brought forth. But what is worldly desire, if not the grape of a reprobate mind? And what is the fervor of sinning, if not the liquor of wine, which makes the sinner's mind forgetful of eternal goods? For when sin is generated from the desire of the heart, it is as though wine is produced from the grape in a winepress. From Accaron therefore all the way to Geth, the cities that had been taken away are restored to Israel: because the minds of those who neglect to do good and who boldly perpetrate evil, which now return to the Lord through repentance, are then shown to be resplendent in the common glory of the elect. For their evils by no means come into God's memory, since they themselves have not forgotten to blot them out through the affliction of repentance.

27. What is this peace, except that which the prophet Micah declares, saying: 'And he shall be peace in the land, when he shall come' (Mic. 5:5)? Hence Paul says: 'He himself is our peace, who makes both one' (Eph. 2:14). But what does it mean that peace is shown between Israel and the Amorite? What is designated by the Amorite, except the reprobate portion of mankind? And who are figured by Israel, except the elect? And because the elect will be at the right hand of God, but the reprobate at the left (Matt. 25:33), while peace is declared to exist between both, the glorious blessedness of the saints is demonstrated—who agree with the justice of the Creator with such great equanimity that they are moved by no compassion at the sight of the punishment of the reprobate. Therefore, when peace is shown to exist between Israel and the Amorite, what is demonstrated is not a good that the reprobate have in common with the saints, but one by which the elect are fortified. Whence also, under the figure of Israel, it is promised to the holy Church through the prophet: 'He who has made your borders peace, and fills you with the fat of wheat' (Ps. 147:14). He makes peace the borders of the Church: because while the power of the Redeemer raises her to the height of inmost equity, the misery of the lost does not afflict her through the pain of compassion.
