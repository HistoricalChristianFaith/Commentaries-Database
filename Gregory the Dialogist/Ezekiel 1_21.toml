Concerning these wheels the same prophet repeats and adds: "When they went, they went, and when they stood, they stood; and when they were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were likewise lifted up following them, because the spirit of life was in the wheels."

As you know, dearest brothers, these things have already been said for the most part, but they are narrated through repeated description. Therefore let it not weary us to repeat briefly in exposition what the Spirit deigned to narrate repeatedly through the prophet. For this alone is added as new in these words, namely what was said: "When they stood still, they stood still." Now there are certain people who advance to the point that they know how to dispense well the earthly goods they have received, who devote themselves to works of mercy, who come to the aid of the oppressed. These indeed go forward, in that they extend themselves for the benefit of their neighbor. With these, therefore, the wheels move, because the sacred words arrange the steps of their sayings in their journey. And there are others who are so strong in holding to the faith they have received that they are able to resist any adversities, and not only are they not in the least drawn toward the perversity of faithlessness, but they even fight against those who speak perversely and draw them back to rectitude. With these who stand still, the wheels also stand still, because the words of sacred Scripture confirm their rectitude, when they hear in them: "Stand firm and hold to the traditions you have learned." And again: "Your adversary the devil, like a roaring lion, goes about seeking whom he may devour; resist him, strong in faith." And there are others who despise all earthly things, who deign to possess nothing that passes away, and suspend themselves in the contemplation of God, as was said before. With these who are lifted up, therefore, the wheels are likewise raised, because to the extent that anyone has advanced to higher things, to that extent the sacred words speak to him of loftier matters. The living creatures go, therefore, for the benefit of their neighbor; they stand still for the guarding of themselves; they are lifted up for the contemplation of God.

But the wheels likewise go, stand, and are lifted up, because sacred Scripture is found to be such as he himself becomes who seeks it. For you have advanced to the active life—it walks with you. You have advanced to immobility and constancy of spirit—it stands with you. You have arrived at the contemplative life through God's grace—it flies with you. And again it is added: "Because the spirit of life was in the wheels." The reason it is said a second time that the spirit of life was in the wheels is because there are two Testaments of sacred Scripture, both of which the Spirit of God willed to be written, so that He might free us from death of the soul. Or certainly because there are two precepts of charity, namely love of God and love of neighbor, through both of which the words of sacred Scripture give us life. Therefore it is said a second time that the spirit of life was in the wheels, because we receive love of God and neighbor in the divine utterances. For through the precepts of sacred Scripture we come back to life, we who lay dead in sin. Whence it is said to the almighty Lord through the Psalmist: "I will never forget your justifications, because in them you have given me life." For the Lord's precepts are called justifications, in which He justifies us by correcting us. Of which the Psalmist says more openly: "I will meditate on your justifications; I will not forget your words." In them, therefore, He gives us life, because through these He shows us spiritual life, and pours it into our minds through the breath of the Spirit. Because this is done daily through the gift of grace in the minds of the elect, it is rightly said: "The spirit of life was in the wheels."

This Scripture has become for us a light for the journey in the darkness of the present life. For hence Peter says: "To which you do well to attend, as to a lamp shining in a dark place." Hence the Psalmist says: "Your word is a lamp to my feet, O Lord, and a light to my paths." Yet we know that even this lamp of ours is dark to us, unless the truth illuminates it for our minds. Whence again the Psalmist says: "For you light my lamp, O Lord my God, illumine my darkness." For what is a burning lamp, if not a light? But created light does not shine for us unless it is illuminated by uncreated light. Therefore, because almighty God both created and opened the words of the holy Testaments for our salvation, the spirit of life was in the wheels.
