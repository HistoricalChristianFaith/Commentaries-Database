There are those who advance as far as the point where they know to distribute well the earthly goods that they receive, to exert themselves in works of pity, to relieve the oppressed. These manifestly go insofar as they strive for the benefit of their neighbor. Therefore the wheels progress with them because they arrange holy Scripture as the steps of their words on their journey. And there are others who in the faith that they have received are so strong to preserve it that they can resist all adversaries and are not only in no way drawn to the perversity of treachery but even rebuke those who speak perverse words and drag them to rectitude. When these stand the wheels too stand still, because the words of holy Scripture confirm their rectitude to them whenever they hear within themselves, “stand firm and hold to the traditions which you were taught by us.”
