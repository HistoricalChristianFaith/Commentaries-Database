85.  Yea, the wicked man has ‘woe,’ and the righteous man ‘affliction,’ in that both everlasting damnation follows the lost sinner, and each one of the Elect is purified by the pains of temporary affliction.  The wicked man lifts up his head, yet when so lifted up he cannot escape the woe that pursues him.  The righteous man, faring ill with the toils of his conflict, is not suffered to lift up his head, but while hard pressed, he is freed from everlasting affliction.  The one sets himself up in pleasure, but is plunging himself into the punishment that succeeds.  The others sinks himself to the earth in sorrow, yet hides himself from the weight of eternal visitation.  Thus let the holy man consider how man either in striving against evil, is afflicted with present trouble, or giving up the contest, he is delivered over to eternal anguish, and let him say, If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I not lift up my head: I am full of affliction and misery; as if he lamented openly, saying, ‘Either bowed down under the desires of the flesh, I am exposed to eternal punishment, or if I fight against unlawful impulses, I am tormented with present woe, seeing that I am not quit of the toils of the fight.’  But the Providence of the Most High does for this reason suffer us who serve Him with all the bent of the mind, to be buffeted by the assaults of our flesh, lest our mind, by presuming on its own security, dare to lift itself up in pride, that whereas, when a shock comes it is filled with fears, it may set the foot of hope the stronger, in the aid of its Maker alone.

Therefore let the holy person take note of the wretchedness of the human mind, how often it defiles itself with unhallowed thoughts. After the Judge’s remission of the guilt of our actions, even while Job bewails his own case, let him show to us our sin, for us to bewail, “If I have sinned, and you spare me at the hour, why do you not allow me to be clean from my iniquity?” It is as if Job said in plain words, “If your forgiveness has taken away my sin, why does it not sweep it from my memory also?” Often the mind is so shaken from its center at the recollection of sin that it is prompted to the commission of far worse things than it had been before being subjected to the memory of prior sins. And when entangled the mind is filled with fears, and being driven with different impulses, throws itself into disorder. It dreads lest it should be overcome by temptations, and in resisting, it shudders at this very fact that it is harassed with the long toils of conflict. Hence it is fitly added, “If I am wicked, woe to me! If I am righteous, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look upon my affliction.” Certainly the wicked person has “woe” and the righteous person “affliction,” in that everlasting damnation follows the lost sinner and the pains of temporary affliction purify each of the elect. The wicked person lifts up his head, yet when so lifted up he cannot escape the woe that pursues him. The righteous person, faring ill with the toils of his conflict, is not allowed to lift up his head, but while hard pressed, he is freed from everlasting affliction. The one who sets himself up in pleasure is plunging himself to the earth in sorrow and hides himself from the weight of eternal visitation. - "Morals on the Book of Job 9.55.84–85"
