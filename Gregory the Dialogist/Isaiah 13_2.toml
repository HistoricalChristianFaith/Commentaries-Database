And this covenant is well said to be a shady and thick mountain, because it is darkened by the thick obscurities of allegories. Again, by a mountain is designated the apostate angel, as is said to preachers concerning the ancient enemy under the character of the king of Babylon, “Lift you up a banner upon the gloomy mountain.” Holy preachers lift up a banner above the gloomy mountain when they exalt the virtue of the cross.
