49.  What is denoted in this place by the title of the ‘rich,’ but the highmindedness of the proud, who have no respect for the judge that shall come, while they are swollen with proud thoughts within themselves? For there are some that by a fortune are not lifted up in pride, but elevated thereby through works of mercy.  And there are some who, while they see that they overflow with earthly resources, do not look for the true riches of God, and have no affection to the eternal land, for they think that this is enough for them, that they are set up with temporal goods.  The fortune then is not in fault, but the feeling.  For all things that God created are good, but he who uses good things amiss, assuredly brings it about that as it were through gluttonness of greedy appetite, he perishes by the bread whereby he ought to live.  The beggar Lazarus attained to rest, but torments racked the proud rich one.  And yet Abraham was rich, who held Lazarus in his bosom.  Yet holding commune with his Maker, he says, I have taken upon me to speak unto the Lord, which am but dust and ashes! [Gen.  18, 27]  How then did he know to set a value on riches, who accounted himself to be dust and ashes? or how could his possessions even exalt him, who entertained such poor notions about himself who was the owner of them?
50. Yet again there are some, to whom earthly property is not vouchsafed, and yet they are set up in their own eyes, in height of swollen pride.  At the same time that there is no fortune at all to uplift these to the display of power, yet the frowardness of their ways assigns them a place among the lost children of riches.  All, then, that love of the life to come does not fill with abasement, the sacred word here calls rich.  For in the avenging of Judgment, there is no difference to them whether they be swollen with goods, or only in disposition.  These, when they see the life of the simple sort in this world to be lowly and abased, forthwith scoff at them with proud scornings; for they mark that that is wholly wanting to them without, which they pant after themselves with their best endeavours.  Therefore they look down upon them as fools, who are without those things, by the having or merely loving of which they themselves in truth are perishing; and they take those for dead, whom they observe in no sort to live with themselves after the flesh.  For he that dies from the desires of this world, is of course held by earthly minds to be utterly dead.  Which is well represented by the miracle of our Redeemer when He frees a man from an unclean spirit, concerning which same it is written: And the spirit cried and rent him sore, and came out of him, and he was as one dead; insomuch that many said, he is dead.   But Jesus took him by the hand, and lifted him up, and he arose: [Mark 9, 26. 27.] for he looks like one dead that is set free from the power of an evil spirit.  For whosoever has already got the better of earthly desires, makes the life of carnal conversation extinct in himself; and he seems dead to the world, in that he lacks the wicked one that possessed him, who urged him by impure desires; and many call him dead, in that they who know not how to live spiritually, look upon him who does not follow carnal good to be wholly lifeless.
51.  But because the very scoffers at the simple ones are themselves too enrolled under the name of Christians, being overruled by reverence for religion, they are ashamed to make a display of the sin of open scoffing.  Whence it happens that full of pride in themselves, and in silence, they scoff at those whom they take to be utterly mean and abject from their simplicity.  Therefore it is well expressed, A lamp is despised in the thought of the rich; for all the proud, whereas they are unskilled to estimate the blessings to come, as we have said above, account him almost as nothing whom they do not see to be possessed of that which they are devoted to.  For it often happens that each one of the Elect, who is being conducted to eternal bliss, is overwhelmed here with unintermitted calamity, there is no plentifulness of stores that buoys him up, no lustre from titles that makes him conspicuous, no crowd of followers falls to his lot, no pomp of raiment makes him a figure in the eyes of men, but he is regarded as an object of contempt by all men, and accounted unworthy of the regard of this world.  Yet in the eyes of the hidden Judge he is bright with virtues, and full of lustre from the merits of his life; he dreads to be honoured, he never shrinks from being despised, he disciplines the body by continence, he is fattened by love alone in the soul, he ever sets his mind to bear with patience, and standing erect on the ground of righteousness, he exults in the insults he receives, he compassionates the distressed from his heart, he rejoices in the successes of the good as in his own, he carefully ruminates the provender of the sacred word in his heart, and when examined he is unskilled to give a double answer; ‘a lamp’ because he is bright within, ‘despised’ because he is not luminous without.  Inwardly he glows with the flame of charity, without he shines with no gloriousness of luster.  Therefore he shines and is despised, who, while he glows with virtue, is accounted vile.  Hence it is that his own father looked down upon holy David, when he refused to present him to the eyes of the Prophet Samuel, He, when he had brought cut seven sons to receive the grace of anointing, being questioned by the Prophet whether he had gone through the whole number of his children, answered with despair enough, There remaineth yet a little boy that keepeth the sheep; and when he was brought forward and chosen, he heard the words, Man looketh in the face, but the Lord searcheth the heart. [1 Sam. 16, 10. &c.]  Thus David was a lamp by his innocency, but yet a lamp greatly despised, in that he gave no light to those that regard the outside appearance.  But be it known that every righteous man is either without temporal glory, or if he has it, he breaks it beneath himself, that he may freely rise on high above his own honour, lest overcome by enjoyment he be brought down beneath it.  It is hence that that illustrious Preacher lowered the glory of his Apostleship before the eyes of men, saying, We have not used this power, when we might have been burthensome as the Apostles of Christ, but we made ourselves little children among you. [1 Thess. 2, 6. 7.]  But the swelling of the neck still remained in the heart of the hearers of that same person, when they said, For his letters say they are weighty and powerful, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech contemptible. [2 Cor. 10, 10]  For him who they knew could say such things they determined could not live in common with themselves, and when they both saw him lowly in his mode of life and high in his tone of speech, their pride drove them on, that him whose writings had made him to be feared, his words in presence should make an object of little account.  What then was Paul, saving ‘a lamp despised in the thought of the rich,’ who by the same act whereby he set forth a lesson of humility, got the affronts of highmindedness from ill-instructed disciples.  For in a dreadful way, the sickness of those so filled with pride was increased by the same means, whereby it ought to have subsided; while the proud mind of carnal persons rejected, as if it were worthy of scorn that which their master set forth as deserving of imitation.  Was not he ‘a lamp despised,’ who when he shone forth with so many virtues, underwent such adverse treatment at the hands of his persecutors?  He discharges his mission in chains, and his bonds are made known in all the palace, he is beaten with rods, he is beset with numberless dangers from his own race and from the Gentiles; at Lystra he is battered with stones, he is dragged by the feet without the city, in that he is taken for dead.  But to what point is this ‘lamp despised?’ Up to what point is it held contemptible?  Does it never at any point unveil its lustre?  Does it never show, with what excess of brightness it glows?  It does show clearly.  For when it is said that the ‘lamp is despised in the thought of the rich,’ it is therefore added,
Prepared for an appointed time.
52.  For the ‘appointed time’ for ‘the despised lamp’ is the predestined Day of final Judgment, wherein it is shown how each one of the righteous, who is now contemned, shines bright in greatness of power.  For then they come as judges with God, who now are judged unjustly for God's sake.  Then their Light shines over so much the wider space, the more cruelly the persecutor's hand confines and fetters them now.  Then it will be made clear to the eyes of the wicked, that they were supported by heavenly power, who forsook all earthly things of their free will.  Whence Truth saith to His own Elect; Ye which have followed Me, in the Regeneration when the Son of Man shall sit in the throne of His glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. [Mat. 19, 28]  Not that the court of the interior Assize will have no more than twelve judges, but, surely, that by the number twelve the amount of the whole is described; for whosoever being urged by the incitement of divine love, has forsaken all that he possessed here, shall doubtless attain there to the height of judicial power; that he may then come as judge in company with the Judge, who now by consideration of the Judgment chastens himself with voluntary poverty.  For hence it is that it is said by Solomon concerning the spouse of Holy Church, Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. [Prov. 31, 23]  Hence Isaiah says, The Lord will come to judgment, with the elders of His people. [Is. 3, 14]  Hence Truth proclaims these same Elders now no longer servants but friends.  Henceforth I call you not servants, but I have called you friends. [John 15, 15]  And the Psalmist regarding these same saith, Honourable also are thy friends unto me, O God. [Ps. 139, 17]  And whilst he beheld their loftiness of mind, and how they trod down with the heel of the foot the glory of the world, he thereupon added, How stablished is their rule!  And that we might not think that they be few, who we learn thus advance even to the summit of such high perfection, he thereupon added, If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand.  For as many persons, then, as now wittingly abase themselves for the love of the Truth, so many lamps shall then blaze forth in the Judgment. Therefore let it be justly said, A lamp despised in the thought of the rich, prepared for the appointed time; for the soul of every righteous man is despised as abject, when in passing through life he is without glory; but he is beheld as an object to admire, when he shines from on high.
53.  Amid these things it is good to lift the eye of the mind to the paths of our Redeemer, and to proceed step by step from the members to the head.  For He did Himself prove truly ‘a lamp’ to us, Who by dying upon the Cross for our redemption, poured light through the wood into our benighted minds.  John had attained to see that we are lightened by this Lamp, when he said, That was the true Light, which lighteth every man that cometh into the world. [John 1, 9]  Yet he saw it ‘despised in the thought of the rich,’ when he soon after brought in, He came unto His own, and His own received Him not. [ver. 11]  Herod desired to examine into the flames of this Lamp, when he longed to see the miracles of that One, as it is written, For he was desirous to see Him of a long season, because he had heard many things of Him, and he hoped to have seen some miracles done by Him. [Luke 23, 8]  But this Lamp did not shine forth before his eyes with a single ray of light, in that to him, who sought Him not from piety but from curiosity, He exhibited nothing wonderful concerning Himself.  For our Redeemer when He was questioned held His peace, when He was looked for, He scorned to show forth His miracles, and keeping Himself to Himself in secret, those whom He found looking for outward things He left in their ingratitude without, rather choosing to be openly despised by those who were led by pride, than to be commended with empty voice by those that did not believe.  And hence this ‘Lamp’ is straightway ‘despised,’ according to what is there added, And Herod with his men of war set Him at nought, and mocked Him, and arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe. [Luke 23, 11]
54.  Yet the ‘despised lamp,’ which is subject to scoffings on earth, flashes judgment from heaven.  Hence it is justly added here, prepared for an appointed season. Concerning which same season He saith by the Psalmist, When I shall receive the time, I will judge uprightly. [Ps. 75, 2]  Hence in the Gospel ‘Truth’ declareth, saying, My time is not yet come. [John 7, 6]  Hence Peter saith, Whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things. [Acts 3, 21]  Therefore the ‘Lamp’ which is now ‘despised’ is ‘prepared’ for its coming ‘at the appointed season.’  For He by Himself judgeth sin on the last Day, Who now bears with the scoffs of sinners, and then He brings out severity the more rigorously, the more mildly He now spreads low His patience in calling sinners.  For he that awaits long while for some to be converted, if they be not converted, torments them without revoke.  Which same truth he conveys by the Prophet in few words, saying, I have long time holden my peace, I have been still and refrained myself; now will I cry like a travailing woman. [Is. 42, 14]  For as we have already before said, a woman in travail with pain gives forth that which she bore for long in her inner parts, He then that for long time held his peace, ‘crieth like a travailing woman,’ in that the Judge that shall come, who for long bore with the deeds of men without taking vengeance, sooner or later brings to light with hotness of examination, as if with pain of mind, the sentence of direful visiting which He kept within.  Therefore let none despise this Lamp, when it is out of sight, lest He burn up His despisers when He shineth from heaven.  For to whomsoever He does not now burn to give pardon, He shall then assuredly burn to award punishment.  Therefore because by grace from above we are vouchsafed the season of our calling, whilst there is still the room left, let us by altering our ways for the better flee from the wrath of Him, Who is every where present.  For him alone that visitation fails to find, whom correction keeps in hiding.
