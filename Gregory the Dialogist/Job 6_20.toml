46.  When the wicked inflict evils upon the good, if they see them to be shaken from the interior hope, they are overjoyed at their deceiving taking effect, for they account the spread of their error to be the greatest gain, in that they rejoice have fellows in perdition, but whilst the good man's hope is rooted within, and never bent to the ground by outward evils, confusion seizes the soul of the wicked, in that whilst they are unable to get at the innermost parts of the distressed, they are ashamed to prove themselves cruel for no end.  Therefore let the holy man say in his own voice, let him say in the endurance of the Church universal in affliction and groaning, Who, amidst the contrarieties of the wicked, without any default of mind, longs for the joy of the heavenly recompense, and by dying holds on to life; They are confounded, because I have hoped.  As though it were in plain words, ‘because the wicked by hard persecutions fail to soften the force of my rigid mind, surely being covered with shame they lose the labours of their cruel ways.’  And hence at once he looks on the blessings of the Retribution to come as henceforth here, and marks what an arraignment awaits the wicked at the Judgment, adding,
They came even unto me, and were ashamed.
47.  For lost sinners ‘come even to Holy Church’ on the Day of Judgment, in that they are then brought even to the beholding of her glory, that for the greater punishment of their guilt they may see in their rejection what they have lost.  Then shame covers the wicked, when conscience bearing witness convicts them in the sight of the Judge.  Then the Judge is beheld without, and the accuser is felt within.  Then every sin is called up before the eyes, and the soul, over and above the burnings of hell, is worse tortured by its own fire.  Concerning these it is rightly said by the Prophet, Lord, let Thy hand be exalted, that they see not [g], let them see and be confounded. [Is. 26, 11]  For now their merits darken the understanding of lost sinners, but then the knowledge of their guilt enlightens it, so that both now they in no wise see what is to be followed, and then they perceive it, after they have lost it.  For now they do not care to understand the things of eternity, or they refuse to make them their object, when understood; but then assuredly, both understanding and longing after them, they have them disclosed to their sight, when they can no longer obtain them thus longed for.
48.  Which same words of blessed Job, moreover, are in an especial manner suited to his friends, who set themselves to shake the mind of the holy man by bitter upbraidings.  For he says, They were confounded because I have hoped.  As if it were in plain words, ‘Whilst they fail by foolish revilings to turn me to despair, they are themselves confounded by the madness of their fool-hardiness.’  They came even up unto me, and were ashamed.  As though he expressed it, ‘Seeing the sores of my body, but ignorant of the constancy of my mind, whilst they took upon them to reproach me for unrighteousness, they did not yet ‘come up unto me,’ but striking with cruel reproaches, whereas they find that my soul stands firm amidst adversity, ‘coming to me,’ as it were, ‘they are ashamed.’  For herein they ‘come to me,’ in that they know me in the interior of my heart, and there they are ‘covered with shame,’ where outward loss moves me not, standing with firm mien.’  Now there are some, who do not know how to fear God, saving when they are either affrighted by adversity experienced in their own person, or known in others; whom prosperity uplifts from presumptuousness, and crosses dismay from weakness.  Of the number of which same, blessed Job charged his friends with being.
