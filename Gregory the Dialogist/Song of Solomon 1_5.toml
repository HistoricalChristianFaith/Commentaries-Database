For we know that in the first days of the church, when the grace of our Redeemer had been preached, some of the Jews believed and others did not. Those who believed were despised by the unbelievers and suffered persecution as though they had been found guilty of taking the way of the Gentiles. Hence the church in their name cries out against those who had not converted: “I am black but beautiful, daughters of Jerusalem.”
