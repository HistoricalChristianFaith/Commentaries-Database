For by oil the splendor of glory is signified; and our vessels are our hearts, in which we carry all that we think. The wise therefore have oil in their vessels, because they retain the splendor of glory within their conscience, as Paul attests when he says: "Our glory is this, the testimony of our conscience." Hence through the Psalmist also it is said of the holy Church of the elect: "All the glory of the king's daughter is from within."
