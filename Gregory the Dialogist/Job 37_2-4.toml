“Behind him the thunder will roar.” Certainly God transforms into tears the life of him whom he filled with his illumination, and the more he reminds the illuminated soul of eternal punishments, the harder he submits it to the groans for its past wickedness; and so a person feels the pain for what he has been, because he begins by now to see the good he did not do, he hates himself for what he has been, and he loves himself for what he should have been.… “He will thunder with the voice of his greatness.” God thunders with the voice of his greatness when he suggests to us, who are now well disposed through our tears, how great he is there on high.… “And after hearing his voice, nobody will be able to investigate.” The voice of God is heard when the soul perceives the inspiration of his grace.… But not even the soul illuminated by it can investigate this voice of the Spirit, which reaches and penetrates the ear of the heart.
