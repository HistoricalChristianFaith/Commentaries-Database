As often as we do alms after sin, we, as it were, pay a price for bad actions. Wherefore, the prophet says concerning him who does not do these things, “He will not give God his propitiation or the price of the redemption of the soul.” But sometimes the rich, being elated, oppress those below them and seize the things of another. Yet, in a certain way they give some things to others. And while they oppress multitudes, they sometimes render defensive support to particular persons; for the iniquities that they never abandon they seem to offer a price. But the price of alms then frees us from sins, when we lament and renounce things of which we are guilty. For he who is both always sinning, and, as it were, always bestowing alms, pays a price in vain, in that he does not redeem his soul, which he does not keep from evil habits. Hence it is now said, “Let him not believe, being vainly deceived, that he is to be redeemed with any price.” For the alms of the rich and proud person has no efficacy to redeem him, seeing that his robbery of the poor person committed simultaneously will not allow his alms to rise up before the eyes of God.… Very commonly we see persons that both lead wicked lives and attain to the very extreme of old age. How then is it said, “Before his days are fulfilled, he shall perish,” when, in the case of particular persons we often see that their limbs already fail from age, and yet their passions do not cease to carry out their wickedness? For there are some, who after losing their way in life, come to their senses, and with their conscience accusing them, they forsake their evil ways, alter their actions, resist their old wickedness, flee earthly courses and pursue heavenly aims. However, before they become firmly rooted in those holy aims, from deadness of mind they return to the things from which they began to pass sentence, and they fall back to the evil habits that they had determined to shun. For it often happens that for the profit of many, even holy people bow their necks to external actions and are busied with the governance of a people. The weak observing this, and from their former pride still within them, seeking to follow their example, they set themselves in outward ways of action. But in proportion, for they do not come to their actions well imbued with the things of the Spirit, and they execute them in a carnal manner. For until the heart is first confirmed in heavenly desires by long application and a habitual manner of living, when the heart is poured back again for the executing of things exterior, it is rooted out from all its standing in good practice.
