But, when the ruler prepares himself for speaking, let him bear in mind with what studious caution he ought to speak, lest, if he be hurried inordinately into speaking, the hearts of hearers be smitten with the wound of error and, while he perchance desires to seem wise he unwisely sever the bond of unity. For on this account the Truth says, "Have salt in yourselves, and have peace one with another." Now by salt is denoted the word of wisdom. Let him, therefore, who strives to speak wisely fear greatly, lest by his eloquence the unity of his hearers be disturbed. Hence Paul says, "Not to be more wise than behaveth to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety."

For we must continually weigh what is said to the holy apostles, and through the apostles to us: You are the salt of the earth. If therefore we are salt, we ought to season the minds of the faithful. You then, who are shepherds, consider that you are feeding God's animals. Concerning these animals indeed it is said to God through the Psalmist: Your animals shall dwell in it. And we often see that a block of salt is set before brute animals, so that they may lick that same block of salt and be improved. Therefore, like a block of salt among brute animals, so should the priest be among the people. For the priest must take care what he says to each person, how he admonishes each one, so that whoever is joined to the priest may be seasoned with the taste of eternal life, as if from the touch of salt. For we are not the salt of the earth if we do not season the hearts of our hearers. Indeed, he truly bestows this seasoning upon his neighbor who does not withhold the word of preaching.

If therefore the people are the food of God, the priests ought to have been the seasoning of the food. But because while we cease from the practice of prayer and holy instruction, the salt has become tasteless; it cannot season the food of God, and therefore it is not taken up by the Creator, because through our prevailing foolishness it is not seasoned at all.
