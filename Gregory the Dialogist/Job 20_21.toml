25.  ‘His meat’ is all that he coveted with wrong desire; but when the hypocrite is struck, ‘there is none of his meat left,’ in that when he is himself carried to eternal punishments, he is parted from all the good things that he had gotten here.  And hence it is yet further added;
Therefore shall nought remain from his goods.
For if ‘aught did remain of his goods,’ he would take along with him the things that he had possession of.  But because while going after every thing, he would not fear the Judge, upon being removed out of this life, he goes naked to the Judge.  To which same wicked man, it is but little for his recompensing that he is tormented in after punishment, if only in this life he is let to go free.  But there is no liberty in sin, seeing that it is written; where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty; [2 Cor. 3, 17] and to the wicked soul usually its very own sin becomes its own punishment.  And hence it is rightly added;
In the fulness of his sufficiency, he shall be in straits.
26.  For first from avarice he pants to heap together things he covets, and when he has gathered together a great multitude as it were in a kind of belly of avarice, ‘in the fulness of his sufficiency, he is in straits,’ in that whilst he is full of anxiety how he may keep the things he has gotten, his own fulness itself straitens him.  For the field of a certain rich man had brought abundant fruits, but because he had not where to lay up such stores, he said, What shall I do, because I have no room where to bestow my fruits.  And he said, This will I do; I will pull down my barns, and build greater. [Luke 12, 17. 18.]  He then who from being straitened by his abundance said, What shall I do?  was in a fever as if oppressed with a quantity of food.  Let us consider with what longings he desired his land might produce abundant crops.  Behold now his wishes are completed, seeing that the land did bring him abundant fruits.  But forasmuch as there are not places enough to stow it away, the rich man being greatly aggrandized knows not what he should do.  O straitness caused by ‘fulness of sufficiency!’  By the abundance of his land the mind of the covetous man is straitened.  For when he says, What shall I do? he clearly shows that, surcharged with the engrossments of his desires, he went heavily under a kind of bundle of stores; and so it is well said, In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits.  Since the mind of the covetous man, which had before looked for rest from plenty, was afterwards put to worse trouble for the keeping thereof.
