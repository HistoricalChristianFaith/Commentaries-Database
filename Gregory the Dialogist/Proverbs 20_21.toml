When they burn to be filled at once with all manner of wealth, let them hear what is written, "He that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent." For certainly he who goes about to increase wealth is negligent in avoiding sin; and, being caught after the manner of birds, while looking greedily at the bait of earthly things, he is not aware in what a noose of sin he is being strangled. When they desire any gains of the present world and are ignorant of the losses they will suffer in the world to come, let them hear what is written, "An inheritance to which haste is made in the beginning in the last end shall lack blessing." For indeed we derive our beginning from this life, that we may come in the end to the lot of blessing. They, therefore, that make haste to an inheritance in the beginning cut off from themselves the lot of blessing in the end; since, while they crave to be increased in goods here through the iniquity of avarice, they become disinherited there of their eternal patrimony. When they either solicit very much, or succeed in obtaining all that they have solicited, let them hear what is written, "What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, but lose his own soul?"
