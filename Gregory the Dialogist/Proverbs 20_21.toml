When these people burn with the desire of being replete with all manner of wealth at once, let them hear what Scripture says: “He that makes haste to be rich, shall not be innocent.” Obviously, a person who strives to increase his resources is not interested in avoiding sin; and being caught after the way of birds, while looking greedily at the bait of earthly things, he does not perceive that he is being strangled in the noose of sin. When these long for the gains of this world and ignore the losses they will suffer in the future life, let them hear what Scripture says: “The inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning, in the end shall be without a blessing.” Indeed, it is this our life from which we take our beginning, that we may come at the end to the lot of the blessed. They, therefore, who hasten to an inheritance in the beginning cut themselves off from the lot of the blessed in the end, because, while desiring increase here through evil cupidity, they become hereafter disinherited of their everlasting patrimony. When they either aim at getting much, or are able to compass all they desired, let them hear what Scripture says: “What does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and suffer the loss of his own soul?” Pastoral Care.

When people burn to be filled at once with all manner of wealth, let them hear what Scripture says, “He that makes haste to be rich will not be innocent.” For certainly those who are determined to increase their wealth do not seek to avoid sin; and, being caught like birds, while looking greedily at the bait of earthly things, they are not aware they are being strangled in the noose of sin. When they long for the gains of the present world and are ignorant of the losses they will suffer in the world to come, let them hear what Scripture says, “An inheritance gotten hastily in the beginning will in the end not be blessed.” For indeed we derive our beginning from this life, that we may come to the destiny of blessing. They, therefore, that make haste to an inheritance in the beginning cut off from themselves the destiny of blessing in the end. Since, while they crave to be increased in goods here through the iniquity of avarice, they become disinherited there of their eternal patrimony. When they either solicit very much, or succeed in obtaining all that they have solicited, let them hear what Scripture says: “What does it profit a man if he gains the whole world, but loses his own soul?”
