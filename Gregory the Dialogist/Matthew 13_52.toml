And in the conclusion it is added: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder bringing forth from his treasure things new and old. If by the new and old that is spoken of we understand both Testaments, we deny that Abraham was instructed, who although he knew the deeds of the New and Old Testament, by no means proclaimed their words. Nor can we compare Moses to the instructed householder, who although he taught the Old Testament, nevertheless did not bring forth the sayings of the New. Since therefore we are excluded from this interpretation, we are called to another. But in what the Truth says: Every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder, it can be understood that He was speaking not of those who had existed, but of those who could exist in the Church. They bring forth new and old things when they speak the proclamations of both Testaments by their words and their conduct. Yet this can also be understood in another way. For it was ancient for the human race to descend to the prison of hell, to endure eternal punishments for their sins. To this, through the coming of the Mediator, something new was added, so that if one rightly strives to live here, he may be able to enter the kingdom of heaven: and man, born on earth, may die from a corruptible life, to be placed in heaven. And so it is old that the human race should perish in eternal punishment for its guilt; and it is new that, being converted, it should live in the kingdom. What therefore the Lord added in the conclusion of His discourse is certainly what He had stated beforehand. For first He brought forth the treasure found and the good pearl concerning the likeness of the kingdom, but afterward He narrated the punishments of hell concerning the burning of the wicked, and in conclusion He adds: Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder bringing forth from his treasure things new and old. As if it were openly said: That preacher is instructed in the holy Church who knows both how to bring forth new things concerning the sweetness of the kingdom, and to speak old things concerning the terror of punishment, so that at least punishments may terrify those whom rewards do not attract. Let each one hear of the kingdom that he may love, let him hear of punishment that he may fear, so that if love does not draw the sluggish soul clinging vehemently to the earth toward the kingdom, at least fear may drive it.
