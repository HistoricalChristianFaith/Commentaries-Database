A legion of demons has been, as I believed, cast out of me. I would prefer merely to forget all of this that I have known and simply to rest at the feet of the Savior. But lo it is said to me, so strongly as to compel me against my will, “Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you.”
