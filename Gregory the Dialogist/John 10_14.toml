As if He said, I love My sheep, and they love and follow Me.For he who loves not the truth, is as yet very far from knowing it.
And I lay down My life for My sheep. As if to say, This is why I know My Father, and am known by the Father, because I lay down My life for My sheep; i.e. by My love for My sheep, to show how much I love My Father.
But as He came to redeem not only the Jews, but the Gentiles, Headds, And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold.
Of two flocks He makes one fold, uniting the Jews and Gentiles in His faith.
