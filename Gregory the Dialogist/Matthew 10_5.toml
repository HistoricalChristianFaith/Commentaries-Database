Since it is evident to all, dearest brothers, that our Redeemer came into the world for the redemption of the nations, and since we see Samaritans being called to faith daily, what does it mean that when sending the disciples to preach, He says: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles, and do not enter into the cities of the Samaritans, but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel"? Unless we understand from the outcome of the event that He wished the preaching to be first to Judea alone, and afterward to all nations, so that when she, though called, refused to be converted, the holy preachers might come in due order to the calling of the nations, and thus our Redeemer's preaching, rejected by His own people, might seek the Gentile peoples as though they were strangers; and what was done as a testimony to the Jews might become an increase of grace for the Gentiles. For there were then some who were to be called from Judea, and some from the Gentiles who were not yet to be called. For in the Acts of the Apostles we read that when Peter preached, first three thousand Hebrews believed, and afterward five thousand. And when the apostles wished to preach to the Gentiles in Asia, they are recorded to have been forbidden by the Spirit; and yet the same Spirit who first forbade the preaching afterward poured it into the hearts of the Asians. For it has been a long time since all of Asia believed. Therefore He first forbade what He afterward brought about, because there were then in that land those who were not to be saved. There were then in that land those who did not yet deserve to be restored to life, nor yet to be judged more severely for having despised the preaching. By a subtle and hidden judgment, therefore, holy preaching is withdrawn from the ears of certain people, because they do not deserve to be raised up by grace. Hence it is necessary, dearest brothers, that in everything we do, we fear the hidden counsels of almighty God over us, lest while our mind, scattered outwardly, does not recall itself from its pleasure, the Judge within terribly arranges adversities against it. Perceiving this well, the Psalmist says: "Come and see the works of the Lord, how terrible He is in His counsels over the sons of men." For he saw that one is mercifully called, while another is rejected as justice demands. And because the Lord arranges some things by sparing, and other things by showing wrath, he trembled at what he could not penetrate. And because he saw Him to be not only unsearchable, but also inflexible in certain of His judgments, he declared Him to be terrible in His counsels.

By the name of every creature, every nation of the Gentiles can also be designated. For before it had been said: "Do not go into the way of the Gentiles." But now it is said, "Preach to every creature," so that the preaching of the apostles, first rejected by Judea, might then become a help to us, when that proud people had rejected it as a testimony to their own condemnation.
