And whom does Lazarus full of sores figuratively represent, if not the Gentile people? For when he turned to God and was not ashamed to confess his sins, he had a wound on his skin. For in a wound of the skin, poison is drawn from the inner parts and bursts forth outward. What then is the confession of sins, if not a kind of breaking open of wounds? For the poison of sin is healthfully opened in confession, which was festering within the mind. For wounds of the skin draw the fluid of corruption to the surface. And in confessing sins, what else do we do but open the evil that lay hidden within us?

But we must note especially how great is the order of narration in the mouth of Truth concerning the proud rich man and the humble poor man. For behold it is said: "There was a certain rich man"; and immediately it is added: "And there was a certain beggar, named Lazarus." Certainly among the people the names of the rich are usually known more than those of the poor. What is it, therefore, that the Lord, speaking of a poor man and a rich man, tells the name of the poor man and does not tell the name of the rich man, except that God knows and approves the humble, and does not know the proud? Hence also to some who are proud of the power of their miracles He will say at the end: "I know you not whence you are: depart from me, all you workers of iniquity." But on the contrary, to Moses it is said: "I know you by name." Therefore He says of the rich man: "A certain man." He says of the poor man: "A beggar, named Lazarus." As if He openly said: I know the humble poor man, I do not know the proud rich man. The one I hold as known through approval, the other I do not know through the judgment of reprobation.

We must also consider with what great consideration our Creator dispenses all things. For one thing is not done for one purpose alone. For behold, Lazarus the beggar, full of sores, lies before the gate of the rich man. From this one circumstance the Lord fulfilled two judgments. For the rich man would perhaps have had some excuse if Lazarus, poor and ulcerous, had not lain before his gate, if he had been far away, if his poverty had not been troublesome to his eyes. Again, if the rich man had been far from the eyes of the ulcerous poor man, the poor man would have endured less temptation in his soul. But when He placed the needy and ulcerated man before the gate of the rich man abounding in delights, in one and the same circumstance He both heaped up condemnation upon the rich man who showed no mercy at the sight of the poor man, and again by the sight of the rich man daily tested and proved the tempted poor man.

For how many temptations do you think this needy man, beset with wounds, endured in his thoughts, when he himself lacked bread and did not even have health, and saw before him a rich man having both health and delights with pleasure; when he saw himself afflicted with pain and cold, while the other rejoiced, clothed in fine linen and purple; himself brought low by wounds, the other overflowing with the things he had received; himself in need, the other unwilling to give? How great, my brothers, do we think was the tumult of temptation then in the heart of the poor man, for whom certainly poverty could have sufficed as punishment, even if he had been healthy; and again, sickness would have sufficed, even if he had had some support? But that the poor man might be more fully proved, both poverty and sickness together wasted him away. And moreover he saw the rich man going forth, surrounded by throngs of attendants, while he himself in his weakness and want was visited by no one. For that no one was there to visit him, the dogs testify, who freely licked his wounds. From this one circumstance, therefore, almighty God rendered two judgments, when He permitted Lazarus the poor man to lie before the gate of the rich man, so that both the wicked rich man might increase for himself the vengeance of condemnation, and the tempted poor man might grow unto reward. The one daily beheld him on whom he showed no mercy; the other saw him by whom he was being proved. Two hearts below, but one observer above, who both by tempting exercised the one unto glory, and by tolerating awaited the other unto punishment.
