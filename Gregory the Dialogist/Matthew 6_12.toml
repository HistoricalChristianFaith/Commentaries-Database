(Mor. x. 15.) That good which in our penitence we ask of God, we should first turn and bestow on our neighbour.

But behold, our enemy has grievously sinned against us, inflicted losses, harmed those who helped, persecuted those who loved. These things would need to be retained if our own sins were not to be forgiven. For our Advocate has composed a prayer for us in our case; and he who is the Advocate is himself the Judge of that same case. Moreover, he inserted a condition into the prayer he composed, saying: Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors. Therefore, since he who stood forth as Advocate comes as Judge, he who made the prayer hears it. Either, then, we say without doing it, Forgive us our debts, as we also forgive our debtors, and by saying this we bind ourselves all the more; or perhaps we omit this condition in our prayer, and our Advocate does not recognize the prayer he composed, and immediately says to himself: I know what I instructed; this is not the prayer I made. What then must we do, brothers, except extend the affection of true charity to our brothers? Let no malice remain in our heart. Let almighty God consider our charity toward our neighbor, so that he may extend his mercy to our iniquities. Remember what we are admonished: Forgive, and you will be forgiven. Behold, something is owed to us, and we owe. Let us therefore forgive what is owed to us, so that what is owed by us may be forgiven. But the mind resists these things, and wants to fulfill what it hears, yet still struggles against it. We stand at the martyr's tomb, knowing by what death he reached the heavenly kingdom. If we do not lay down our body for Christ, let us at least conquer our spirit. God is appeased by this sacrifice; he approves in the judgment of his mercy the victory of our peace. For he beholds the struggle of our heart; and he who rewards the victorious afterward now helps those who are fighting, through our Lord Jesus Christ his Son, who lives and reigns with him in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all ages of ages.
