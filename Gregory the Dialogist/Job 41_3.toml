27. Thou understandest, As to Me. For if these words are referred to the person of the Son, he spake soft words to Him Incarnate, when he said, I know Thee, Who Thou art, the Holy One of God. [Luke 4, 34] And this Leviathan multiplied prayers to Him, when he said by the legion which was subject to him; If Thou cast us out, send us into the herd of swine. [Matt. 8, 31] Although it can be understood in a still more plain manner, because he multiplies prayers to the Lord, when the wicked, who are his body, pray, on the day of the last judgment, that they may be spared; when his members, that is, the reprobate, cry out too late, and say, Lord, Lord, open unto us. To whom it is said immediately, I know you not, whence ye are. [Luke 13, 25] Then also he will say by his members soft words to the Lord, when many of his body are about to say, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in Thy Name, and in Thy Name have cast out devils, and in Thy Name have done many wonderful works? [Matt. 7, 22] They say soft words in deprecation, when they say in reply what they have done in His Name, but when they did these very deeds with hard heart, they claimed them for their own credit. Whence they shortly hear, I know you not, who ye are. It follows;
Ver. 23. Will he make a covenant with thee? Thou understandest, As with Me.
