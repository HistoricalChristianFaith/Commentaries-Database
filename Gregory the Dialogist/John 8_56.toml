(Hom. xv. in Evang.) Abraham saw the day of the Lord even then, when he entertained the three Angels, a figure of the Trinity.

And it should be noted that the Lord saw them resisting Him with open hostility, and yet He did not cease to preach to them with repeated words, saying: "Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it, and was glad." For Abraham saw the day of the Lord when, as a figure of the supreme Trinity, he received three angels as guests; and having received them, he spoke to the three as if to one, because although there is a number of Trinity in the persons, there is a unity of divinity in nature.
