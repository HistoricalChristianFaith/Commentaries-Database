Abraham saw the day of the Lord when he hospitably received three angels as a prefiguration of the most holy Trinity. After he had received them, he spoke to the three as to one, since although there are three persons in the Trinity, the nature of the divinity is one. But the unspiritual minds of [Jesus’] hearers did not raise their eyes from his body. Although he was God, they took account only of his age in the flesh.
