“Then they will call upon me, and I will not listen; they will arise early in the morning and will not find me.” You see how they cry out that it be opened for them; driven by sorrow at their rejection, they call twice upon him who has dominion over them, saying, “Lord, Lord, open to us.” They offer entreaties, but they are unknown to him. God abandons them as unknown persons. He does not recognize them now because of their sins.
