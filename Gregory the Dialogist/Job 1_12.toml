19.  We should mark in the Lord's words the dispensations of heavenly pity, how He lets go our enemy, and keeps him in; how He looses, and yet bridles him.  He allows him some things for temptation, but withholds him from others.  All that he hath is in thy hand, only upon himself put not forth thine hand.  His substance He delivers over, but still He protects his person, which notwithstanding after a while He designs to give over to the tempter; yet He does not loose the enemy to every thing at once, lest he should crush His own subject [civem] by striking him on every side.  For whenever many evils betide the elect, by the wonderful graciousness of the Creator they are dealt out by seasons, that what by coming all together would destroy, may when divided be borne up against.  Hence Paul says, God is faithful, Who will not suffer you to be tempted above that ye are able, but will with the temptation also make a way to escape, that ye may be able to bear it. [1 Cor. 10, 13]  Hence David says, Examine me, O Lord, and prove me. [Ps. 26, 2]  As if he said in plain words, ‘first examine my powers, and then, as I am able to bear, let me undergo temptation.’  But this that is said, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power, only upon himself put not forth thine hand, is also capable of another sense, viz. that the Lord knew well, indeed, that His soldier was brave, yet chose to divide for him his contests with the enemy, that, though victory should in every case be sure to that staunch warrior, yet that from one conflict first the enemy might return to the Lord defeated, and that then he might grant him another encounter to be again worsted, so that his faithful follower might come forth the more incomparable conqueror, in proportion as the vanquished foe had repaired his forces again for fresh wars with him.  It follows,
So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord.
20.  What is this, that Satan is said to go forth from the presence of the Lord?  For how is it possible to go forth from Him, Who is every where present?  Whence it is that He says, Do not I fill heaven and earth? [Jer. 23, 24]  Hence it is written concerning His Spirit, For the Spirit of the Lord filleth the world. [Wisd. 1, 7] Hence it is that His Wisdom saith, I alone compassed the circuit of heaven. [Ecclus. 24, 5]  Hence it is that the Lord says again, The heaven is My throne, and the earth is My footstool. [Isa. 66, 1]  And again it is written of Him, He meteth out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of the earth in a measure, [Is. 40, 12. Vulg.] for He abides both within and without the seat, whereon He rules.  By His ‘meting out heaven with a span, and comprehending the earth in a measure,’ He is shown to be Himself on every side beyond the circuit of all things which He has created.  For that which is enclosed within is from without held in by that which encloseth it.  "By the throne, therefore, whereon He is seated, it is meant that He is within and above; by the ‘measure,’ wherewith , ‘He comprehends,’ He is represented to be beyond and beneath; for whereas the same Being abides within all things, without all things, above all things, beneath all things, He is both above by virtue of His Dominion, and beneath by virtue of His Upholding; without, by His Immensity, and within, by His Subtlety; ruling from on high, holding together from below; encompassing without, penetrating within; not abiding by one part above, by another beneath, or by one part without, and by another part within, but One and the Same, and wholly every where, upholding in ruling, ruling in upholding; penetrating in encompassing, encompassing in penetrating; whence He ruleth from above, thence upholding from beneath, and whence He enfoldeth from without, thence filling up within; ruling on high without disquietude, upholding below without effort; within, penetrating without attenuation, without, encompassing without expansion.  So that He is both lower and higher, without place; He is wider without breadth; He is more subtle without rarity.
21.  Whither then is there any ‘going forth’ from Him, Who being through the bulk of a body no where present, is through a Substance unlimited no where absent?  Still, so long as Satan, kept down by the power of His Majesty, was unable to execute the longing of his wickedness, he, as it were, stood in the presence of the Lord, but he ‘went forth’ from the presence of the Lord, because, being freed from above from the pressure of an inward withholding, he went to the execution of his desire.  He went forth from the presence of the Lord, forasmuch as his evil will, long bound by the fetters of a severe control, did at length proceed to fulfilment.  For, as has been said, whilst that which he desired he had no power to fulfil, in a manner, he ;stood in the presence of the Lord,’ because the Supreme Providence restrained him from the execution of his wickedness, but ‘he went forth from His presence,’ because in receiving the power to tempt, he arrived at the goal, at which his wickedness aimed

Whereas we are examining Holy Scripture under its figurative import, by the hand of Satan is to be understood not his power, but the extent of his tempting.  All, then, that he hath is given into the hand of the Tempter, and he is only forbidden to put forth his hand upon him, which nevertheless, when his substance is gone, is permitted him; for that first Judaea, which was His possession, was taken from Him in unbelief, and that afterwards His flesh was nailed to the stock of the Cross, He then Who first underwent the opposition of Judaea, and afterwards came even to the Cross, in a manner first lost that He had, and then in His own Person endured the wickedness of the adversary. So Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord. Just as it was said above, Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord, in that he attained the objects of his desire; for he was in a certain sense in His presence, all the time that on account of Him, he failed to accomplish all that he mischievously thirsted after.

69.  As if He said in plain words; ‘I give thee so to try the good that is in each one of Mine Elect by temptation from without, that thou mayest acquaint thine own self that I keep him holding on to Me by the inward root of the mind; and hence it is rightly added, "So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord."
70.  For in that he is not suffered to prevail so far as to withdraw the heart, being thus shut out from the interior, he roams without.  Who, even if he very often work confusion in the virtues of the soul, herein does it without, in that, through God's withholding him, he never wounds the hearts of the good to their utter ruin.  For he is permitted so far to rage against them as may be necessary, in order that they, thus instructed by temptation, may be stablished, that they may never attribute to their own strength the good which they do, nor neglect themselves in the sloth of security, loosing themselves from the bracings of fear, but that in keeping guard over their attainments they may watch with so much the greater prudence, as they see themselves to be ever confronting the enemy in the fight of temptations.
