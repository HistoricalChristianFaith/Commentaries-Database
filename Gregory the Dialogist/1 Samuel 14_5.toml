The first rock juts out to the North, the other to the South, because through concupiscence the fervor of charity is extinguished, and through sin the ardor of concupiscence is increased. For the reprobate mind, while it is subjected to concupiscence, is stripped of charity, and while it does not fear to sin, it kindles in itself ever more fierce desires for sinning. For as if placed at the highest altitude and heat of its day, in the flood of sin it both rejoices immoderately and is dissolved ardently. Therefore he badly strives to cure the disease of concupiscence who thinks to fulfill his desires more greedily by sinning so that he might find rest. Indeed, concupiscence after sin will be all the greater, the more the delight of sin begins to be pleasing to itself. But the first rock is said to be situated opposite Magmas, the other to jut out facing Gabaa. Magmas, as we have already sufficiently explained, means humility; Gabaa is interpreted as hill. Concupiscence stands directly opposite to humility, while the enticement of sin stands against heavenly conduct. For everyone who desires what is forbidden, while he despises the one who commands, is proud. Therefore he stands opposite to humility, which he does not retain in the devotion of obedience. But he who is also dissolved in the fervor of sin, as if by the noonday brightness, juts out against Gabaa, that is, the hill, because while he opposes heavenly things, he is prepared for the punishments of hell. But since such people are also led to eternal life by the preaching of the Saints, let us consider the zeal of those preachers in the deed of Jonathan. For there follows: (Verse 6.) Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; perhaps the Lord will act on our behalf, for it is not difficult for the Lord to save, whether by many or by few.
