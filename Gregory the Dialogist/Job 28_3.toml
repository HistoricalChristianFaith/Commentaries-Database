46.  He hath Himself ‘set a time to the darkness,’ i.e. bounds to the wicked, where they should cease to be wicked.  Whence it is said to them by the Apostle; Ye-were sometimes darkness, but 1l0W are ye light in the Lord.  Like as to the other disciples as well the same great teacher saith, The night is far spent, the day is at hand; let us therefore put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armour of light.  Let us walk honestly as in the day.  Hence also in the Song of Songs on the coming of the Church it is said, Who is she that cometh forth as the morning in rising? 
For fitly is the Church described by being compared with ‘the morning,’ in that, by the knowledge of the faith she is changed from the darkness of sins to be in the bright light of righteousness.  By the term of ‘all and every one,’ he would have both the Elect and the damned to be comprehended.  For God both in doing and ordering what is good, yet not doing what is bad, but what by the wicked is done Himself so regulating that the things should not come forth irregularly, ‘vieweth the end of all and every one,’ and bears all things patiently, and beholds the goal of the Elect, how that from evil they are changed to good.  He sees, too, the end of the damned, how that for bad practice they are dragged to a punishment worthy of them.  He saw the end of Saul when persecuting, wherein prostrated on the earth he should say, Lora, what wilt Thou have me to do?  He saw the end of the seeming-obedient disciple, that for the guilty deed he had committed he should tie his throat with a noose, and both punish himself when guilty of sin, and by thus punishing, betray himself the worse.  He saw the Ninevites transgressing, but beheld the end of the transgressing in the repentance of the reformed.  He saw likewise Sodom transgressing, but He beheld the end of the burning of lust in the fire of hell.  He saw the end of the Gentile world, how that whilst occupied by the darkness of iniquities, it should be one day brightened with the light of faith.  He also saw the end of Judaea, how that from that light of faith, which it held, it should blind itself with the darkness of hardened unbelief.
