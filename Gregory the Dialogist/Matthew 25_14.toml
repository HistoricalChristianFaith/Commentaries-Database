Who then is this man who goes on a journey, if not our Redeemer, who departed into heaven in the flesh which he had assumed? For the proper place of flesh is earth, which is led as if to foreign lands when it is placed in heaven through our Redeemer. But this man going abroad handed over his goods to his servants, because he granted spiritual gifts to his faithful ones.
