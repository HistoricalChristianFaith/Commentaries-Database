Old Testament law forbids anyone to lust after another man’s wife, but it does not decree punishment for the king who commands his soldiers to perform dangerous feats or who desires a drink of water. We all know that David was pricked by lust and desired another man’s wife and took her. The blows his sin deserved followed, and he made amends for the evil he had done by tears of repentance.
