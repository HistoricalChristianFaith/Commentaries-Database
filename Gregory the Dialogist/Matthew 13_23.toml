But the good earth brings forth fruit through patience, because clearly our good works are nothing if we do not also bear with equanimity the evils of our neighbors. For the higher anyone has advanced, the more he finds in this world what he must bear more harshly, because when our mind's love for the present age diminishes, the adversity of that same age increases. Hence it is that we see many both doing good and yet laboring under the heavy burden of tribulations. For they now flee earthly desires, and yet are wearied by harsher afflictions. But according to the word of the Lord they bring forth fruit through patience, because when they humbly accept afflictions, after the afflictions they are sublimely received into rest. Thus the grape is crushed by treading and is liquefied into the flavor of wine. Thus the olive, pressed by crushing, leaves behind its bitter residue and grows rich into the liquid of oil. Thus by the threshing of the floor the grains are separated from the chaff and arrive purified at the granary. Therefore whoever desires to fully conquer vices, let him strive to humbly endure the afflictions of his purification, so that he may come before the Judge all the more pure afterward, the more the fire of tribulation now purges away his rust.

In that portico which serves as a passageway for those going to the church of blessed Clement, there was a certain man named Servulus, whom many of you knew along with me—poor in possessions, rich in merits—whom a long illness had weakened. For from his earliest age until the end of his life he lay paralyzed. What shall I say, that he could not stand? He was never able to rise in his bed even to sit, never able to bring his hand to his mouth, never able to turn himself to his other side. His mother with his brother was present to serve him, and whatever he was able to receive from alms, he distributed to the poor through their hands. He knew no letters at all, but he had purchased for himself books of Sacred Scripture, and receiving any religious persons in hospitality, he had them read before him without ceasing. And so it came about that, according to his own measure, he learned Sacred Scripture fully, though, as I said, he was entirely ignorant of letters. He strove always to give thanks in his pain, to devote himself to hymns and praises to God day and night. But when the time had come that his great patience ought to be rewarded, the pain of his limbs returned to his vital organs. And when he recognized that he was now near death, he urged the traveling men received in hospitality to rise and sing psalms with him in expectation of his departure. And while he himself, dying, was singing psalms with them, he suddenly silenced the voices of those singing, with the terror of a great cry, saying: "Be silent! Do you not hear how great are the praises resounding in heaven?" And while he was directing the ear of his heart toward those same praises which he heard within, that holy soul was released from the flesh. But as it departed, such a fragrance of scent was spread there that all who were present were filled with inestimable sweetness, so that through this they clearly recognized that praises in heaven had received it. A monk of ours was present at this event, who still lives, and with great weeping he is accustomed to attest that until his body was handed over for burial, the fragrance of that scent did not depart from their nostrils. Behold with what end he departed from this life who in this life calmly endured afflictions. According to the Lord's word, therefore, the good earth brought forth fruit through patience, which, having been plowed by the plowshare of discipline, arrived at the harvest of reward. But I ask you, dearest brothers, consider what argument of excuse we shall have in that strict judgment—we who, sluggish from good work, have received both resources and hands—if a beggar without hands fulfilled the Lord's commands. May the Lord not then display against us the apostles who by preaching drew crowds of the faithful with him to the kingdom, may he not bring forth against us the martyrs who by shedding their blood arrived at the heavenly homeland. What shall we say then, when we see this Servulus of whom we have spoken, whose arms a long illness held bound, yet did not bind them from good work? Do these things with yourselves, brothers, so urge yourselves to zeal for good work, that when you now set good men before you for imitation, you may then be able to be their companions.
