It should be noted that He whom the Lord sends to preach, He declares to be a watchman. For he to whom the care of others is committed is called a watchman, so that he may sit in the height of the mind and draw the meaning of his name from the power of his action. For he is not a watchman who is in the lowest place. Indeed, a watchman always stands in a high place, so that he may see from afar whatever is to come. And whoever is appointed as a watchman of the people ought to stand on high through his life, so that he may be able to benefit them through his foresight. Hence another prophet admonishes the watchman, saying: "Get up onto a high mountain, you who bring good tidings to Zion." So that evidently he who has undertaken the office of preaching may ascend to the height of good action; may pass over to lofty things and transcend the works of those who have been committed to him; so that he may see the life of his subjects all the more keenly, inasmuch as he does not subject his mind to the earthly things which he looks down upon.

Oh how harsh to me are these words that I speak, because in speaking I strike myself, whose tongue neither maintains preaching as is worthy, nor does my life follow my tongue to the extent that it is able to maintain it. I am often entangled in idle words, and I cease from exhortation and the edification of my neighbors, being sluggish and negligent. I have become mute and verbose in the sight of God—mute in necessary things, verbose in idle ones. But behold, the word of God concerning the life of a watchman compels me to speak. I cannot be silent, and yet I fear to strike myself by speaking. I will speak, I will speak, so that the sword of God's word may pass even through me to pierce the heart of my neighbor. I will speak, I will speak, so that the word of God may sound against me even through me. I do not deny that I am guilty; I see my sluggishness and negligence. Perhaps before the merciful Judge the very recognition of fault will be an obtaining of pardon.

And indeed while I was stationed in a monastery, I was able both to restrain my tongue from idle words and to keep my mind almost continuously fixed on the intention of prayer. But after I placed the shoulder of my heart beneath the pastoral burden, my mind cannot collect itself upon itself regularly, because it is divided among many things. For I am compelled now to examine the affairs of churches, now of monasteries, often to weigh the lives and deeds of individuals; now to bear certain business matters of citizens, now to groan over the attacking swords of barbarians, and to fear wolves lying in wait for the flock entrusted to me; now to take care of material concerns, lest resources fail those very ones who are held by the rule of discipline, now to endure certain plunderers with equanimity, now to oppose them while striving to preserve charity. Therefore, when my mind is led torn and mangled to think upon so many and such great matters, when does it return to itself, so that it might gather itself wholly for preaching and not withdraw from the ministry of speaking the word? Moreover, because by the necessity of my position I am often joined with secular men, sometimes I relax the discipline of my tongue. For if I keep myself in the constant rigor of my strictness, I know that I am avoided by the weaker ones, and I never draw them to what I desire. Hence it happens that often I patiently hear even their idle talk. But because I myself am also weak, being drawn along a little in idle conversations, I now begin to speak willingly those things which I had begun to hear unwillingly; and where it was wearisome to fall, it becomes pleasant to lie there. Who then or what manner of watchman am I, who do not stand on the mountain of action, but still lie in the valley of weakness? Yet the creator and redeemer of the human race is powerful to grant to unworthy me both the height of life and the efficacy of speech, for whose love I do not spare even myself in speaking his word.

The life of a watchman, therefore, must always be both lofty and circumspect. Lest he succumb to the love of earthly things, let it be lofty; lest he be struck by the darts of the hidden enemy, let it be circumspect on every side. Nor is it sufficient for a watchman to live loftily, unless he also continually draws his hearers to lofty things by speaking, and kindles their minds by speaking to the love of the heavenly homeland. But he does these things rightly when his tongue blazes forth from his life. For a lamp that does not burn in itself does not ignite the thing beneath which it is placed. Hence Truth says of John: He was a burning and shining lamp. Burning, that is, through heavenly desire, shining through the word. Therefore, that the truth of preaching may be preserved, the loftiness of living must necessarily be maintained. Hence it is also rightly said in the voice of the Bridegroom of holy Church in the Song of Songs: Your nose is like a tower of Lebanon. What kind of praise is it, my brothers, that the bride's nose should be compared to a tower? But since we always distinguish pleasant and foul odors through the nose, what is designated by the nose except the discernment of watchmen? This nose is said to be both like a tower and of Lebanon, because indeed the discernment of overseers must always be fortified with circumspection and established in loftiness of life—that is, not lie prostrate in the valley of feeble work. For just as a tower is placed on a mountain for watching so that enemies who approach may be seen from afar, so the life of a preacher must always remain fixed on high, so that in the manner of nostrils he may distinguish the stench of vices and the fragrance of virtues. Let him look far ahead at the assaults of malignant spirits, and render the souls committed to him cautious through his foresight.

Behold, again the prophet is warned not to presume to speak what he has not heard, but first to open the ear of his heart to the voice of the Creator, and afterward to open the mouth of his body to the ears of the people. Hence another prophet says: I will incline my ear to a parable, I will open my proposition on the psaltery. For he who preaches rightly first, as has been said, inclines the ear of his heart to the inward speaking, so that afterward he may open the mouth of his body in the proposition of admonition.
