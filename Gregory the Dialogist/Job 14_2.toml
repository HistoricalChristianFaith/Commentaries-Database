67.  For, ‘as a flower, he cometh forth,’ in that he shows fair in the flesh; but he is ‘crushed,’ in that he is reduced to corruption.  For what are men, as born in the world, but a kind of flowers in a field?  Let us stretch our interior eyes over the breadth of the present world, and, lo, it is filled as it were with as many flowers as there are human beings.  So life in this flesh is the flower in grass.  Hence it is well said by the Psalmist, As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. [Ps. 103, 15]  Isaiah too saith, All flesh is grass, and all the glory thereof is as the flower of the field. [Is. 40, 6]  For man cometh forth like a flower from concealment, and of a sudden shows himself in open day, and in a moment is by death withdrawn from open view into concealment again.  The greenness of the flesh exhibits us to view, but the dryness of dust withdraws us from men’s eyes.  Like a flower we appeared, who were not; like a ‘flower’ we wither, who appeared only in time.
68.  And whereas man is daily being driven into death moment by moment, it is rightly added, He fleeth also as a shadow, and never continueth in the same state.  But as the sun is unceasingly going through his course, and never stays himself in a state of stedfastness, why is the course of man’s life likened to ‘a shadow’ rather than to the ‘sun,’ excepting that, when he parted with the love of the Creator, he lost the heat of the heart, and remained in the coldness of his iniquity alone?  Since according to the voice of Truth, Because iniquity shall abound, the love of many shall wax cold. [Matt. 24, 2]  He, then, who hath not warmth of the heart in the love of God, and yet keepeth not the life, which he loves, assuredly he ‘fleeth like a shadow.’  Hence it is well written concerning him, that he hath followed a shadow. [Ecclus. 34, 2]  Now it is well said, and never continueth in the same state.  For whereas infancy is going on to childhood, childhood to youth, youth to manhood, and manhood to old age, and old age to death, in the course of the present life he is forced by the very steps of his increase upon those of decrease, and is ever wasting from the very cause whence he thinks himself to be gaining ground in the space of his life.  For we cannot have a fixed stay here, whither we are come only to pass on; and this very circumstance of our living is to be daily passing out of life.  Which same flight the first man could not have known before the transgression, seeing that times passed, himself standing.  But after he transgressed, he placed himself on a kind of slide of a temporal condition, and because he ate the forbidden fruit, he found at once the failure of his stay.  Which liability to change man suffers, not only without, but also within him, when he strives to arise to better works.  For by the weight of its changeableness the mind is always being driven forwards to some other thing than it is, and, except it be kept in its stay by stringent discipline in self-keeping, it is always sliding back into worse.  For that mind which deserted Him, Who ever standeth, lost the stay in which she might have continued.
Henceforth now when he strives after better things, he has as it were to strain against the force of the stream.  But when he relaxes in his bent to ascend, without effort he is carried back to the lowest point.  Thus whereas in ascent there is effort, in descent rest from effort, the Lord warns us that we have to enter by a narrow gate, saying, Strive to enter in at the strait gate [Luke 13, 24]; for when about to mention ‘the entering in of the narrow gate,’ He premised, Strive, since unless there be an ardent striving [k] of the heart,’ the water of the world is not surmounted, whereby the soul is ever being borne down to the lowest place.  And so whereas man ‘springeth up like a flower and is cut down, and fleeth also as a shadow, and never continueth in his place,’ let us hear what he further subjoins in this train of reflection.
