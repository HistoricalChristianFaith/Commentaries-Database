32. Indeed, he carefully showed them both the good things which the Lord had bestowed upon them and the evil things which they themselves had done against the Lord, so that they might recognize that they had sinned all the more gravely, inasmuch as they had dared by sinning to offend him from whom they had received such great blessings. But what it means to reject the Lord, and how it ought to be understood according to the literal and the spiritual sense, has been explained at length above, where the Lord says to Samuel: "They have not rejected you, but me, according to all their works which they have done from the day when I brought them out of the land of Egypt." But because holy preachers instruct by teaching those whom they pierce by rebuking, he added, saying: "Now therefore, stand before the Lord by your tribes and by your families."

33. We are indeed commanded to stand before the Lord when we prepare our hearts to know His commandments at the instruction of our elders. Or the elect stand before the Lord when they are considered by great men with respect to their spiritual virtues, so that whoever is seen to be better among them may be preferred over the rest through pastoral care. And because there are many orders of the faithful, they are commanded to stand before the Lord by tribes and families.
