Therefore, dearest brothers, love hospitality, love the works of charity. For hence it is said through Paul: "Let brotherly love continue in you, and do not forget hospitality. For through this some have pleased, having received angels as guests." Hence Peter says: "Be hospitable to one another without murmuring." Hence Truth itself says: "I was a stranger, and you took me in."

There is a story well regarded and handed down to us by the account of our elders. A certain father of a household served with great zeal for hospitality along with his whole house; and while he received strangers at his table daily, one day a certain stranger came among others and was led to the table. And while the father of the household, from his custom of humility, wished to pour water on his hands, he turned and took the pitcher, but suddenly did not find the one on whose hands he had wished to pour water. And while he marveled at this occurrence to himself, that same night the Lord said to him through a vision: "On other days you received me in my members, but yesterday you received me in myself." Behold, coming to judgment, He will say: "What you did for one of my least ones, you did for me." Behold, before the judgment, when He is received through His members, He also visits His hosts through Himself; and yet we are sluggish toward the grace of hospitality. Consider, brothers, how great is the virtue of hospitality. Receive Christ at your tables, that you may be worthy to be received by Him at the eternal banquet. Offer now hospitality to Christ the stranger, that He may not disregard you as strangers at the judgment, but may receive you as His own into the kingdom.
