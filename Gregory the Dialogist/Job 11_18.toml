36.  For hope lifts itself the more firmly rooted in God, in proportion as a man has suffered harder things for His sake, since the joy of the recompensing is never gathered in eternity, which is not first sown here below in religious sorrowing, Hence the Psalmist saith, They went forth and wept as they went, bearing precious seed, but they shall doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing their sheaves with them. [Ps. 126, 6] Hence Paul saith, If we be dead with Him, we shall also live with Him; if we suffer, we shall also reign with Him. [2 Tim. 2, 11. 12.]  Hence he warns his disciples, saying, And that we must through much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God. [Acts 14, 22]  Hence the Angel, shewing the glory of the Saints to John, saith, These are they that came out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb. [Rev. 7, 14]  Therefore because we now sow in tribulation that we may afterwards reap the fruit of joy, the heart is strengthened with the larger measure of confidence in proportion as it is pressed with the heavier weight of affliction for the Truth's sake.  Whence it is therefore fitly added,
Yea, being dug to the bottom [V. defossus], thou shalt rest secure.
37.  For just as present security begets toil to the wicked, so present toil begets perpetual security to the good.  Hence he already knew that it was his ‘to rest secure after he had been dug to the bottom,’ who said, For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure is at hand.  I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course: I have kept the faith Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, shall give me at that day. [2 Tim. 4, 6. 8.]  For as he had striven without giving over against transitory ills, doubtless he reckoned without misgiving on enduring joys.
38.  Not but that the expression, ‘been dug to the bottom,’ may be understood in another sense also: for oftentimes being busied with transitory matters, we neglect to consider in what great things we go wrong; but if the eye of reflection being brought in, the pile of earthly thoughts be discharged from the recesses of the heart, what lay hid from sight within is disclosed to view; whence holy men never cease to explore the secret hiding places of their souls; minutely searching themselves, they throw off the cares of earthly things, and their thoughts being thoroughly dug up from the bottom [effossis], when they find that they are not cankered in any wise by the guilt of sin, they rest secure in themselves as upon the bed of the heart.  For they desire to be hid apart from the courses of this world.  They are always thinking on their own concerns, and when they are not at all tied by the harness of government, they decline to pass judgment on what concerns others.  Therefore ‘having been dug to the bottom they rest secure,’ in that whilst with wakeful eye they dive into their inmost recesses, they withdraw themselves from the toilsome burthens of this world under the disengagement of repose.

34.  For it often comes to pass that so many temptations beset our path, that the very multitude of them almost inclines us to the downfall of desperation.  Hence for the most part, when the mind is turned to weariness, it scarce takes account even of the hurts that its virtue sustains, and notwithstanding that it is wholly filled with pain, it is as if it were now dislocated from the sense of pain, and were unable to reckon up with what a tumult of thoughts it is overrun.  It sees itself momentarily on the point of falling headlong, and grief itself withstands it worse, that it should not lay hold of the arms of resistance.  Mists encompass the eyes, wherever turned about, and whereas darkness ever obstructs the sight, the sad soul sees nought else than darkness; but with the merciful Judge it often happens that this very sadness, which even weighs down the effect of prayer, intercedes for us the more piercingly.  For then our Creator sees the blackness of our sorrow, and pours back again the rays of the light withdrawn, so that the mind being immediately braced up by His gifts becomes full of vigour, which same a little before contending evil propensities kept down under the heel of pride.  At once it shakes off the load of torpor, and bursts with the light of contemplation after the darkness of its troubled state.  At once that is raised to the joy of advancement, which amidst temptations was well nigh driven by despair to a sorer fall.  Without a conflict of the heart it looks down upon present things, without let of misgiving it trusts in the retribution to come.  Therefore when the righteous man ‘thinks himself consumed, he arises like the morning star,’ in that so soon as he has begun to be benighted with the blackness of temptations, he is restored anew to the light of grace, and he in himself manifests the day of righteousness, who the moment before, on the point to fall, dreaded the night of guiltiness.  Now the life of the righteous is rightly compared to the ‘morning star.’  For the morning star, being precursor of the sun, proclaims the day.  And what does the innocency of the Saints proclaim to us, saving the brightness of the Judge, That cometh after?  For in our admiration of them we see what we are to account of the Majesty of the true Light.  We do not yet behold the power of our Redeemer, but we admire His goodness in the characters of His Elect.  Therefore in that the life of the good presents to our eyes on the consideration of it the force of Truth, the ‘morning star’ arises bright to us heralding the sun.
35.  But be it known that all that we have made out, proceeding upon the opposition of spiritual temptations, may without hindrance be interpreted by external ills, for holy men, because they love the things above from the bottom of their heart, encounter hardships in things below; but at the end they find the light of joy, which in the span of this passing life they care not to have.  Whence it is said on this occasion by Zophar, And the noonday splendour shall arise to thee at eventide.  For the sinner’s light in the daytime is dimness at eventide, in that he is buoyed up with good fortune in the present life, but is swallowed up by the darkness of calamity at the end; but to the righteous man the noonday splendour ariseth at eventide, in that he knows what exceeding brightness is in store for him when he has already begun to set.  Hence it is written; Whoso feareth the Lord, it shall go well with him at the last. [Ecclus. 1, 13]  Hence it is declared by the Psalmist; When He giveth His beloved sleep, this is [hoec est, V. ecce] the heritage of the Lord. [Ps. 127, 2. 3.]  He, while he is still set in the strife of this present life as well, ‘when he thinketh himself consumed, ariseth like the morning star;’ because whilst falling outwardly he is renewed inwardly.  And the more that he encounters crosses without, the more richly he gleams with the light of his virtues within, as Paul testifies, who saith, Though our outward man perish, yet the inward man is renewed day by day.  For our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. [2 Cor. 4, 16]  And it ought to be observed, that he never says, ‘when thou art consumed,’ but, ‘when thou thinkest thyself consumed,’ in that both that which we see is doubtful, and that which we hope for certain.  Whence too the same Paul did not know, but thought, that he was consumed, who even when falling headlong into sufferings and tribulations, shone bright like the morning star, saying, As dying, and, behold, we live; as sorrowful, yet alway rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich. [3 Cor. 6, 9. 10.]  And we should know that the worse plight the mind of the good is reduced to for the love of the truth, the more sure and certain its hope of the rewards of eternity.
