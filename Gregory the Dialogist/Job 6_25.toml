56.  He must himself be pure from evil, who makes it his concern to correct the evil practices of other men, so as not to be taken up with earthly imaginations, not to give way to grovelling desires, in order that he may the more clearly see what things others ought to avoid, in proportion as he himself the more thoroughly eschews them by knowledge and by practice.  For the eye which dust weighs upon, never clearly sees the spot upon the limb, and the hands that hold mud can never cleanse away the overcast dirt.  And this according to the older of the old Translation [h], the voice of God rightly conveyed in sense to David, busied about external wars, when It says, Thou shalt not build a temple, for thou art a man of blood. [1 Chron. 22, 8; 28, 3.]  Now he builds God's Temple, who is devoted to correcting and forming the minds of his neighbours.  For we are God's Temple, who are framed to life by His indwelling, as Paul bears witness, saying, For the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. [1 Cor. 3, 17]  But a man of blood is forbidden to build a temple to God, in that he who is still devoted to carnal practices, must needs blush to instruct the minds of his neighbours spiritually.  Therefore it is well said, Wherefore have ye detracted from the words of truth, when there is none of you that is able to convict them?  As if it were in plain words; ‘With what rashness do ye blame all ye hear, who knowing nothing of the causes of my stroke, still utter words that deserve blame.’
