I have said before that the prophet called him a voice because he preceded the Word. What he was crying is disclosed to us, “Prepare the way of the Lord, make straight his paths.” What else is anyone doing who is preaching the true faith and good works but preparing the way for the Lord to come to his hearers’ hearts so that the power of grace may enter them and the light of truth pervade them? He makes the Lord’s paths straight when he predisposes the mind for good thoughts by his good preaching.
