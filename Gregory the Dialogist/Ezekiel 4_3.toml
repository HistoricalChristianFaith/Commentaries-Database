Why is it that the prophet places this pan between himself and the city as a wall of iron? The meaning is that this strong zeal now at work in the mind of the teacher will be a witness on the day of the last judgment between him and the soul for which he is zealous against vices. Even if he who is taught is unwilling to hear, yet the teacher, by reason of the zeal that he exhibits, will not be answerable for the negligence of his hearers.

The teacher lays siege against the soul of the hearer when he proclaims that traps of temptations may be laid in everything that happens in this life, so that when the mind is everywhere fearful, everywhere circumspect, the more timidly it lives, the more vigilant it will be.

Just as the house of Israel physically underwent a siege, so each soul that now begins to serve almighty God perceives the traps the evil spirits are laying siege to it.
