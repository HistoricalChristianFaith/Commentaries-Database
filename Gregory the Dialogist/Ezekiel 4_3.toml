"And take to yourself an iron frying pan, and you shall place it as an iron wall between yourself and the city, and you shall set your face firmly against it, and it shall be under siege, and you shall surround it. It is a sign for the house of Israel."

Because iron is a strong metal, and food is fried in a frying pan, what is signified by the iron frying pan except the strong frying of spiritual zeal? For all spiritual zeal fries the soul of a teacher, because he is greatly tormented when he sees any weak persons abandoning eternal things and taking delight in temporal things. How well Paul had taken up the iron frying pan, when, tormented by zeal for souls, he said: "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is scandalized, and I am not burned?" His own heart, which he had set on fire with zeal for souls—what else had he made it but a frying pan, in which he burned with love of virtues against vices? For the fact that he was burned was the frying pan. For he was inflamed and he cooked, because he was set on fire with bitterness, yet from his afflicted thought he prepared the nourishment of virtues.

But what does it mean that the prophet places the same frying pan as an iron wall between himself and the city, except that the same strong zeal which is now exercised in the mind of the teacher will be a witness between him and the soul for which he is zealous against vices on the day of the final judgment? So that even if the one being taught refuses to listen, the teacher nevertheless, because of the zeal he displays, will not be held guilty for the negligence of his hearer. Therefore he places an iron wall between himself and the city, because at the time of vengeance the teacher is fortified from the danger of damnation by that very thing through which he now suffers the frying of his heart through zealous watchfulness. For there is no sacrifice to almighty God such as zeal for souls. Hence the Psalmist says: "Zeal for your house has consumed me." How much the frying of the heart that is driven by spiritual zeal pleases the almighty Lord God is clearly shown when fine flour is commanded to be offered in sacrifice through the law. Concerning which it is written: "It shall be fried in a pan with oil sprinkled on it, and the priest who has succeeded his father by right shall offer it hot as a most sweet odor to the Lord, and it shall be wholly burned upon the altar." For then fine flour is fried in a pan when the pure mind of the righteous person is burned through the ardor of holy zeal. It is commanded to be sprinkled with oil, that is, to be mixed with the brightness of mercy, which burns and shines in the sight of the almighty Lord. Therefore let the mind that is fried in a pan be sprinkled with oil, because the strictness of holy zeal must both burn and shine forth from the virtue of mercy. For it loves the very one whom it seems to pursue. Hence it is also commanded to be offered hot as a most sweet odor to the Lord, because if zeal does not have love, the fine flour that is offered from the frying pan has lost its heat. And it should be noted who is commanded to offer it, namely the priest who has succeeded his father by right. For that priest succeeds his father by right who demonstrates by his conduct that he is a son of the almighty Lord, and does not depart from his inner nobility by the ignobility of his works. It is commanded to be wholly burned upon the altar, so that it may become a holocaust. For we call a holocaust that which is entirely burned. Hence also in another translation in this place this same fine flour which is fried in the pan is commanded to become a holocaust. Moreover, this is the difference between a holocaust and a sacrifice: every holocaust is indeed a sacrifice, but not every sacrifice is a holocaust. For there are many good works that are done as sacrifices, but they are not holocausts, because they do not completely set the mind ablaze in spiritual love. For those who do the things that are of God in such a way that they nevertheless do not abandon certain things that are of the world, assuredly offer a sacrifice and not a holocaust. But those who abandon all things that are of the world and set their entire mind ablaze with the fire of divine love, these assuredly become both sacrifice and holocaust to the almighty Lord. Therefore the fine flour in the frying pan is the pure mind of the righteous person in the affliction of spiritual zeal; it is fried through concern for souls, and is reckoned to be not only a sacrifice but also a holocaust to the Lord. Let us therefore take up the iron frying pan, and let us place it as an iron wall between us and the city, that is, let us assume strong zeal, so that we may afterward find this strong fortification between us and the soul of our hearer. For we will find this iron wall then, if we now hold it firmly, namely by teaching, guarding, persuading, rebuking, soothing, terrifying, sometimes acting gently, but sometimes also more severely.

"And you shall set your face firmly against it, and it shall be under siege."

What does it mean to set one's face firmly against Jerusalem depicted on the brick, except that the teacher who announces to a soul the vision of heavenly peace should by no means show himself more lenient and merciful if he still sees that soul weakened in its actions? Hence it is written: "Do you have daughters? Guard their bodies, and do not show a cheerful face to them." For weak souls given over to worldly desire are sometimes better preserved through severity, so that a hardened face—that is, one guarded through severity and withdrawn from all hope of frivolous leniency—may terrify the inconstant soul and restrain it from the delight of vices through the force of strictness. When this is done by a teacher, it is always necessary that sweetness and humility be held in the heart, so that he may both love greatly and never rise up against the one whom he nevertheless refuses to reveal his love and humility to, for that person's own benefit.

"And you shall surround it."

The teacher surrounds the soul of his hearer when he proclaims that snares of temptations can be set against everything that is done in this life, so that while the mind becomes fearful everywhere, watchful everywhere, the more timid it is, the more vigilantly it may live.

"It is a sign for the house of Israel."

If we look to the history of the siege that took place according to the letter, what the prophet did is a sign for the house of Israel; if we look to the mystery that is daily enacted by a teacher concerning each individual soul, both what he did and what he announced by doing it is a sign for the house of Israel, because just as the house of Israel endured a siege bodily, so every soul that now begins to serve almighty God feels the besieging snares of malign spirits attacking it. If it truly desires to be rescued from them, it ought to know that it cannot be rescued by its own strength; but it must hope for the help of him who, even while we live in corruptible flesh, is able through the mystery of his redemption to strengthen us even over spirits that are without flesh—Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, God, through all ages of ages. Amen.
