55.  It often happens that the wicked man reckons the life of his children as a ‘candle,’ but when the son, that is loved overmuch, is taken away, what seemed the ‘light’ of the wicked is ‘put out.’  Often the wicked man reckons the credit of present honour his ‘candle,’ but, whilst, his dignity gone, he is cast down from his height, his candle is extinguished, which shone for him according to his desire.  Often the wicked man thinks that the resources of earthly substance are his, like a great candle for light, but when upon ruin falling on him, he loses the riches which he loved more than himself, what else with this man but that he has lost the candle, in the light of which he was rejoicing?  And so he that has no wish to rest his joy on the things of Eternity, neither here, where he is minded to establish himself, can he rejoice uninterruptedly.  For as often as the ‘candle of the wicked is put out,’ at once there ‘cometh a flood upon them, and God divideth sorrows in His fury.’  ‘A flood cometh’ upon the wicked when they undergo the waves of sorrow from adversity of some kind.  For Almighty God, when He sees Himself contemned, and that delight is taken in earthly concupiscence, smites that with woes which He sees is preferred before Himself in the thoughts of the wicked man.  Now it is well said, And divideth sorrows in His fury.  For He that reserves eternal woes for the wicked man in retribution, and sometimes smites through his soul even here with temporal woe, because both here and there too He smites, ‘divideth sorrows in His fury’ upon the head of the ungodly.  For neither does present punishment, which does not turn the mind of the wicked man from his bad desires, set him free from eternal chastisements.  And hence it is said by the Psalmist, Upon the wicked He shall rain snares, fire, and brimstone, and blasts of storms; this shall be a portion of their cup. [Ps. 11, 6]  In mentioning ‘snares, fire, and brimstone, and blasts of storms,’ he introduced indeed a multitude of woes; but because the sinner that is not amended by them is called to eternal punishments, he consequently called these woes no more his whole cup, but ‘a portion of his cup,’ seeing that their suffering is begun indeed here in woes, but is consummated in everlasting vengeance.
