79.  From the plural number he returns to the singular because most frequently one person begins what is bad, and numbers by imitating him follow after, but the fault is primarily his, who to the bad men following after furnished examples of wickedness; and hence the sentence frequently returns to him who was the leader in sin.  Now the surface of water is carried hither and thither by the breath of the air, and not being steadied with any fixedness is put in motion every where.  And so the mind of the wicked man is ‘lighter than the surface of water,’ in that every breath of temptation that touches it, draws it on without any retarding of resistance.  For if we imagine the unstable heart of any bad man, what do we discover but a surface of water set in the wind?  For that man one while the breath of anger drives on, now the breath of pride, now the breath of lust, now the breath of envy, now the breath of falsehood forces along.  And so he is ‘light above the surface of the water,’ whom every wind of error when it comes drives before it.  Whence too it is well said by the Psalmist, O my God, make them like a wheel, as the stubble before the wind.  For the wicked are ‘made like a wheel,’ in that being sent into the round of labour, whilst the things that are before they neglect, and those which ought to be given up they follow, in the hind parts they are lifted up, and in the fore parts they fall.  And they are likewise rightly compared to ‘stubble before the face of the wind,’ in that, when the breath of temptation comes upon them, having no principle of gravity to rest upon, they are only lifted up to be dashed to the ground, and they often account themselves of some merit in proportion as the blast of error bears them on high.  It goes on;
Let their portion be cursed in the earth; and let him not walk by the way of the vineyards.
80.  Whoever in the present life does what is right and meets with misfortunes, is seen indeed to travail in adversity, but for the blessing of the everlasting inheritance he is finished complete; but whoever does what is bad and yet meets with good fortune, and does not even by the bountifulness of blessings withhold himself from wicked deeds, is seen indeed to prosper, but is tied fast by the bond of everlasting cursing.  Hence it is rightly said now, Let their portion be cursed in the earth, in that though he is blessed for a time, yet he is held fast in the bond of cursing.  Concerning whom too it is fitly added, He walketh not by the way of the vineyards.  For ‘the way of the vineyards,’ is the rightness of the Churches.  Wherein nothing hinders but that we understand either the heretic or every carnal man, because ‘the way of the vineyards,’ i.e. the rightness of the Churches, is parted with, when either the right faith or the right rule of just living is not held.  For he ‘walks by the way of the Vineyards,’ who taking to heart the preaching of the Holy Catholic Church, deviates neither from the right line of faith nor of good deeds.  Since to ‘walk in the way of the vineyards’ is to behold the Fathers of Holy Church as hanging clusters of the vine, whose words whilst he heeds in the toils of the journey, he is intoxicated with the love of Eternity.
