"And the spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet."

When we humble ourselves before God, when we recognize that we are dust and ashes, when, weighing the weakness of our own condition, we do not maintain a state of rigidity and pride, almighty God lifts us up through His Spirit and sets us upon our feet, so that we who have lain and lie humbly within ourselves from the thought of our weakness may stand upright, as it were upon our feet, in good works afterward. Why is this done to the prophet in a plain, unless to specially designate that the Holy Spirit was also to be given to the elect of the Gentiles, who would first cast down from their state of pride those whom He would take up, and afterward establish them upon their feet, that is, upon good works? As it is said through Paul: "Lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble knees, and make straight paths for your feet."

"And He spoke to me and said to me: Enter and shut yourself in the midst of your house."

What does it mean that the prophet is led out from the midst of the Israelite people to the plain, and afterward called back from the plain to the house, except that the grace of preaching was taken away from the Jewish people and spread abroad in the breadth of the Gentiles? Yet at the end of the world, when the Jews return to faith, the prophet is, as it were, led back to the house, so that preaching may again dwell among his people—preaching which now shines forth among diverse nations as if in a plain. For it is written: "Until the fullness of the Gentiles should enter in, and so all Israel should be saved." And through another prophet it is said: "If the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant shall be saved." Therefore let the prophet go out from the midst of the people to the plain, and let him return from the plain to the house, so that the preaching which was done in Judea may go forth to the Gentiles, and when the Gentiles have been filled with faith, let Judea receive back the gifts of spiritual teaching which she lost. Moreover, the prophet is commanded to be shut in the midst of his house, because in the time of Antichrist the converted people of the Jews will be constrained by harsh persecutions from those Gentiles who remain in unbelief. Hence it is written: "But the court which is outside the temple, cast out and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles, and they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months."

But because a preacher must always return to his mind, guarding humility and purity within, after the plain it is necessary that he return to his house, so that in those things which he says he may also recognize what kind of person he himself is within his conscience. For if he either fails to keep what he says, or seeks temporal glory from those things which he speaks, he indeed goes out to the plain by speaking, but by not thinking he scorns to return to his house. For having received the Spirit, we are enclosed in the midst of the house, when through his grace we are called back to examine the secrets of our mind, so that the soul may rest in God within itself, and may no longer run about through exterior desires in pursuit of praise and glory through the restlessness of thought.

Concerning this house of the heart, Truth Himself says to a certain man who was healed: "Take up your bed and go to your house." For by the bed in which the flesh finds rest, the flesh itself is signified; by the house, however, the conscience is represented. And because when we are dead in mind we lie in vices, we rest in the delight of the flesh, and when sick we are carried on a bed; but when we have been healed in mind, so that we may now resist the vices of the flesh that assail us, it is necessary that we also endure the insults of temptations from our flesh. Therefore it is commanded to the sick man restored to health: "Take up your bed," that is, carry the bed in which you were carried, because it is necessary that everyone who has been healed carry the insult of the flesh in which he previously lay sick. What then does it mean to say: "Take up your bed and go to your house," except: carry the temptations of the flesh in which you have lain until now, and return to your conscience, so that you may see what you have done? Therefore the prophet, after the plain, is commanded to be enclosed in a house, so that the preacher may always, after the grace of teaching which he ministers to his neighbors, return to his conscience and examine himself with careful scrutiny, lest concerning those things which he preaches outwardly he himself inwardly seek any passing praise.

Hence it is also said through Solomon: "Drink water from your own cistern, and the streams of your own well. Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and divide your waters in the streets; have them for yourself alone, and let not strangers be partakers with you." But what he says seems very contradictory: "Let your fountains be dispersed abroad, and divide your waters in the streets," when he immediately adds: "Have them for yourself alone, and let not strangers be partakers with you." For how will he be able to have the water of knowledge alone, if he divides it in the streets? How are strangers not partakers of his water, if his fountains are dispersed abroad? But when we preach to the people, we certainly divide the waters in the streets, because we spread the words of knowledge to the multitude of hearers. But when, with divine grace assisting, we guard ourselves inwardly, and with watchful care look around lest the evil spirits—who are rightly strangers to us because they have lost the lot of blessedness—steal upon us through pride, we alone have the waters that we divide in the streets, so that strangers may not be partakers with us in them. These indeed are they of whom it is written: "Strangers have risen up against me, and the mighty have sought my soul." Therefore he both divides the waters in the streets and has them alone, who through the fact that he preaches to many does not exalt himself in the thought of temporal glory. For then a man possesses what he teaches, when he rejoices not in being known, but in being of benefit. Therefore the prophet is led back from the field to the house, so that he who speaks from God, after he has gone forth by speaking for the benefit of his neighbors, may always be called back through humility to examine the secrets of his own heart.
