All who are servants of hedonism, pride, avarice, envy and falsehood are still under Pharaoh’s chariot, being like horses under [the control of] Pharaoh’s chariot, that is, under the devil’s rule. But all who strive for humility, chastity, doctrine and charity have been made horses of our Creator, having been placed in the chariot of God, with God as their driver.
