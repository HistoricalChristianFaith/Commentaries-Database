Now it happened that both died. The rich man, who was clothed in purple and fine linen, was buried in hell; but Lazarus was led by angels into Abraham's bosom. What does Abraham's bosom signify but the secret rest of the fathers? Of which the Truth says: "Many will come from the East and the West, and will recline with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven; but the children of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness."
