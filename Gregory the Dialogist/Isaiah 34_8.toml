Sacred Scripture has stature, because it directs conduct toward standing, so that the minds of hearers may not be bent toward earthly desire. It has height, because it promises the joys of eternal life in the heavenly homeland. It also has a horrible appearance, because it threatens all the reprobate with the punishments of hell. Therefore it shows its stature in the building of conduct, it shows its height in the promise of rewards, it shows its horrible appearance in the terrors of punishments. For it is upright in precepts, lofty in promises, horrible in threats. ... It has a horrible appearance when, describing hell, it says: "The day of vengeance of the Lord, the year of retribution for the judgment of Zion; and its torrents shall be turned into pitch, and its soil into sulphur; and the land shall be burning pitch, day and night it shall not be extinguished forever."
