It [sacred Scripture] has a dreadful appearance when, describing hell, it says, “The day of the vengeance of the Lord, the year of recompense of the judgment of Zion. And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the ground thereof into brimstone: and the land thereof shall become burning pitch. Night and day it shall not be quenched … forever.” - "Homilies on Ezekiel 1.6.18"
