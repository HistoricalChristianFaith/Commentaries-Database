Whoever is put over others for an example of life is admonished not only to keep watch himself, but also to arouse his friend. For it is not enough for him to keep watch by living well, if he do not also remove from the indolence of sin the person he is set over. For it is well said, “Give not sleep to your eyes, nor let your eyelids slumber.” To give sleep to the eyes is to cease from earnestness and thus to neglect altogether the care of our charges. The eyelids slumber when our thoughts, weighed down by sloth, connive at what they know should be reproved. To be fast asleep is neither to know nor to correct the deeds of those committed to us. To slumber, rather than to sleep, is to know what things are to be blamed and still through laziness of mind not to amend them by appropriate rebukes. Yet the eye through slumbering passes into the deepest sleep; since for the most part, when one who is over others does not cut off the evil that he recognizes, he eventually, as his negligence deserves, will not even recognize what is done wrong by his charges. Therefore, those who are over others must be warned to watch earnestly within and round about and to strive to become living creatures of heaven.
