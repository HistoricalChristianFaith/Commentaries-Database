And before the face of the gate which extended to the face of the vestibule of the inner gate, fifty cubits.

That which is said in this place, "Before the face of the gate," describes not the exterior, but the interior place before the gate, since it is reported to extend up to the face of the vestibule of the inner gate. Hence that same place is said to have been measured at fifty cubits. For by the number fifty, eternal rest is signified. For the number seven has its own perfection, because on that day the number of days was completed. And through the law the Sabbath was given for rest. Moreover, that same number seven multiplied by itself yields forty-nine, and if a monad is added to it, one arrives at fifty, because all our perfection will be in the contemplation of that One, in whose vision there will no longer be anything lacking of salvation and joy for us. Hence also the jubilee, that is, the fiftieth year, was given for rest, because whoever has arrived at the eternal joys of almighty God will no longer have labor and groaning.

It should be noted that the place which is described as extending for fifty cubits is said to reach to the face of the vestibule of the inner gate. Therefore in this place the prophet is not describing the vestibule of the inner gate itself, but the place within which extends to the vestibule of the inner gate. By which place, of course, as we have said, our hope is signified, which while it seeks eternal rest, leads the mind to the vestibule of the inner gate. For in this very fact that we desire heavenly things, that we sigh for the promised joys, that we seek the rest of eternal life, we are already approaching the face of the inner vestibule. Therefore let faith be signified by the gate, charity by the court, and by the place which approaches the face of the vestibule of the inner gate let hope be figured, without which three virtues whoever can now use reason cannot enter into the heavenly building. Therefore let faith be held in the gate, which introduces to understanding; charity in the court, which expands the mind in love; hope in the place which is described as fifty cubits, because through desires and sighs it introduces the soul to the secret joys of rest. Concerning which rest, even if we do not yet perceive the light of truth as it is, nevertheless we already see something through the cracks of understanding.
