What do we understand by “the heavens,” but the righteous, and what by “the earth,” but sinners? Hence, in the Lord’s Prayer we pray, “Your will be done on earth as it is in heaven.” This means that the will of our Creator, in the same way as it is accomplished in all the righteous, may be fulfilled in all sinners as well. Moreover, of the righteous it is said, “The heavens declare the glory of God.” To man, when he sinned, the sentence is pronounced, “You are earth, and to earth you shall return.” And so of this ungodly man, when dragged to that awful judgment, “the heavens reveal his iniquity, and the earth rises up against him,” that that man, who never spared either the good or the bad, should in that tremendous inquest have the life of the righteous and of sinners alike accusing him.
