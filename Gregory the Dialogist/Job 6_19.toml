39.  For Tema is rendered ‘the south wind,’ and Sheba ‘a net.’  What is here set forth by ‘the south wind,’ which dissolves the limbs it blows on with its warm breath, saving dissolute laxity of life? and what by ‘the net,’ save the fettering of practice?  For they that aim at the things that are eternal with a dissolute mind, of their own free will fetter themselves by the irregularity of their efforts, that they should never advance towards God with a free step, and while they entangle themselves with the loose practices of their behaviour, they as it were set their feet to be held in the meshes [maculis] of a net.  For as we said a little way above, that there are persons who are drawn back into bad habits, already got the better of, by means of other open evil habits not yet overcome, so there are some that fall back into those which they had abandoned by means of others, which are cloked with the title of respectability, or the honourableness of praise.  Thus there are very many, who now no longer aim at the things of another, and who with the love of tranquillity begun are parted from the jarrings of this world, thirst to be instructed in Holy Writ, long to give themselves to heavenly contemplations, yet they do not abandon with a perfect freedom of soul all concern about their domestic affairs, and often while they are employed in the service of the same in a lawful way, they are involved in the unlawful jarrings of this world at the same time; and while they are eager to protect their earthly interests with anxious care, they quit that repose of the heart, which they sought for; and whilst their substance, that is escaping from them, is guarded with continual caution, the word of divine knowledge which has been conceived in the heart is let loose; in that, according to the declaration of ‘Truth,’ the thorns choke the seed that has sprung up, when the importunate cares of earthly things put out the word of God from the recollection [Matt. 13, 22].  Therefore they are walking in a net with their steps all abroad, who, while they do not perfectly forsake the world, fetter themselves in their steppings, that they cannot step. 
40.  And there are very many, who not only do not covet what belongs to another, but even abandon all that they possessed in the world, who despise themselves, do not aim at any glory of the present life, sever themselves from this world's courses of action, and whatever prosperity may smile upon them, they well nigh tread it under their feet; yet being tied with the chain of earthly relationship, while they imprudently obey the dictates of the love of kindred, it often happens that by the instrumentality of relations they turn back to those habits which they had even together with self-contempt already subdued; and whereas they love their fleshly kin beyond what needs, being drawn back without, they are separated from the Parent of the heart.  For we often see men, who, as far as concerns their own interest, henceforth no longer entertain any desires of the present life, who have quitted the world both in practice and in profession, yet for their inordinate affection for relations, burst into the courts of justice, busy themselves with the discord of earthly things, part with the freedom of interior repose, and restore in their hearts the interests of the world that were long undone.  Whither then are those walking but into a net, whom perfection of life commenced had already set free from the present world, but whom the excessive love of earthly kin still binds?
41.  For they that fol1ow after the reward of the eternal espousals with close pursuits, and not with loose steps, as they disregard themselves for the love of God, so they lay aside every thing whereby they see they are hindered; and since it is necessary for God's sake that they should render service to all that they are able, for God's sake they refuse their private services even to their relations.  Hence it is that when one said, Suffer me first to go and bury my father, he thereupon heard from the lips of ‘Truth,’ Follow Me, and let the dead bury their dead, but go thou and preach the kingdom of God. [Luke 9, 59. 60.]  Wherein it is to be observed, that whereas the chosen disciple is withheld from the burial of his father, for the sake of God it is not permitted a devout person to do for a dead father, from carnal affection, that which, for God's sake, he ought to do for strangers likewise.  Hence again ‘Truth’ saith, If any man come to Me, and hate not his father, and mother, and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters, yea, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple. [Luke 14, 26]   In which same place, forasmuch, as after the hatred of our kindred we have the hatred of our own life brought in, it is plainly shown that we are bidden to hold our relations in hatred in such sort as ourselves, that urging them [A.B.E. ourselves] away to the interests of eternity, and putting aside carnal favour towards them, when it is a hindrance in the way, we might learn by a proportioned skill of discrimination, at once to love them suitably, and to hate them savingly, so that in love hatred might be so taught to arise, that we might be able to love more really in hatred.  Hence again it is said by Moses, Who said unto his father and to his mother, I know you not, and to his brethren, I recognize you not, nor knew they their own children; these have observed Thy word and Thy covenant, and kept Thy judgments. [Deut. 33, 9]  For he longs to know God more familiarly who, from love of religion, desires to know no longer those whom he has known after the flesh.  For the knowledge of God is lessened by a grievous curtailment, if it be shared with acquaintance with the flesh.  Everyone then must be put without the pale of kindred and acquaintance, if he would be more genuinely united to the Parent of all, that those same ones, whom for the sake of God he makes light of for a good end, he may the more substantially love, in proportion as he renounces in them the destructible affection of carnal attachment.
42.  We ought indeed, even in a temporal way, to benefit more than the rest those to whom we are more nearly united; for a flame too extends its burning to things put by it, but that particular thing, wherein it originates, it first sets burning.  We ought to acknowledge the tie of earthly relationship, and yet to disown it, when it obstructs the progress of the mind, that the faithful soul, being inflamed in devotion to divine things, may at once not look with contempt on the things which are joined to it below, and that by regulating these aright in itself, it may mount above them in the love of things on high.  Therefore with wise caution we must be on our guard, that no favouring of the flesh steal upon us, and divert the step of the heart from the right path, lest it hinder the efficacy of heavenly love, and sink the soaring mind; downwards under a superincumbent weight.  For everyone ought so to sympathize in the wants of his kindred, that yet by such sympathy he never let the force of his purpose be impeded, so that affection indeed should fill the bowels of the heart, yet not divert it from its spiritual resolve.  For it is not that holy men do not love their fleshly kin, to give them all things necessary, but they subdue this very fondness within themselves from love of spiritual things, in order so to temper it by the control of discretion, that they may be never led by it, yea in a small measure, and in the very least degree, to deviate from the straight path.  And these are well conveyed to us by the representation of the kine, which going along towards the hilly lands under the Ark of the Lord, proceed at one and the same time with fondness and with hardened feeling; as it is written, And the men did so: and took two milch kine, and tied them to the cart, and shut up their calves at home: and they laid the Ark of the Lord upon the cart. [1 Sam. 6, 10]  And soon after; And the kine took the straight way to the way of Beth-shemesh, and they went along by one way, lowing as they went, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left. [ver. 12]  For observe, when the calves were shut up at home, the kine which are fastened to the waggon bearing the Ark of the Lord, moan and go their way, they give forth lowings from deep within, and yet never alter their steps from following the path.  They feel love indeed shown by compassion, but never bend their necks behind.  Thus, thus must they needs go on their way, who being placed under the yoke of the sacred Law, henceforth carry the Lord's Ark in inward knowledge, so as never for this, that they take compassion on the necessities of relations, to deviate from the course of righteousness which they have entered upon.  For ‘Beth-shemesh’ is rendered ‘the house of the sun.’  Thus to go to Beth-shemesh with the Ark of the Lord placed on them, is in company with heavenly knowledge to draw near to the seat of light eternal.  But we are then really going on towards Beth-shemesh, when in going the path of righteousness, we never turn aside into the adjoining side-paths of error, not even for the sake of the affection we bear to our offspring; kindness to whom ought indeed to have a place in our mind, but never to turn it back, lest that mind, if it be not touched by a feeling of affection, be hard, or being too much touched, if it is turned aside, be slack.
43.  It is well to look at blessed Job, in whom the yoke of God's fear had worn the neck of the heart, and see under what controlling influence of discretion he bears the Ark of the Lord's sentence.  For when the calves are gone he lows, in that, when tidings of his children's death were brought 'him, ‘he fell upon the ground with his head shaven,’ yet he goes by the right way whilst lowing, in that his lips in groaning are opened to utter the praises of God, whereas, he exclaims without delay, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord. [Job 1, 21]  But minds that are not gifted with discretion know nothing of this rule of life, and in the degree that they seek the ways of the Lord negligently, they are turned back foolishly to the paths of the world.
44.  Rightly then does the holy man after ‘the paths of Theman’ make mention of ‘the ways of Saba.’  For they whom the south wind of a mischievous warmth has relaxed, are verily held bound in the net of entanglement.  But in describing the deeds of the wicked, he rightly admonishes them to ‘consider’ these things; for we delight in froward practices in doing them, but when seen in others we pass sentence upon them, and the actions, which in our own case we think to be little deserving of sentence, we learn to be as base as they really are by the conduct of others; and so it comes to pass that the mind is brought back to itself, and takes shame to do the thing that it censures.  For it is as though an ugly face in a mirror caused disgust, as often as the mind sees in a similar life, what to feel abhorrence for in itself.  Therefore he says, Consider the paths of Teman, the ways of Sheba, and wait a little.  As if it were in plain words; ‘Look to the harms of another's luke-warmness, and then you will the more surely take hope in relation to eternal things, if with the eye of the heart rightly directed you look at that which may disgust you in others.’
45.  And it is well said, wait a little; for it often happens, that whereas the short period of the present life is loved as if it were to last for long, the soul is dashed from its eternal hope, and being beguiled with present objects, is thrown back by the blackness of self-despair.  And when it imagines that the period is long which remains for it to live, at once upon quitting life it meets that eternity, which it may not avoid.  Hence it is that it was spoken by one that was wise, Woe unto you that have lost patience.  For truly they ‘lose patience,’ who, whilst they reckon to tarry long amongst visible things, part with the hope of the invisible.  And while the mind is rivetted to present objects, life is ended, and they are suddenly brought to unlooked-for punishments, which, being deceived by their presumptuous expectations, they flattered themselves they would either never meet with, or not till late.  Hence ‘Truth’ says, Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour. [Matt. 25, 13]  Hence again it is written, The Day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night [1 Thess. 5, 2]; for because it is never seen drawing near to seize upon the soul, it is likened to a thief in the night.  Therefore it ought to be the more apprehended as always coming, in proportion as it cannot be foreknown by us when it is about to come.  Whence holy men too, in that they have their eyes incessantly fixed on the shortness of life, do as it were pass through life daily undergoing death; and prepare themselves on a more solid basis for the things that shall last, in proportion as they are ever reflecting by the end that transitory things are nought.  For hence the Psalmist, seeing that the life of the sinner fleeth at a quick pace, exclaims, For yet a little while and the sinner shall not be. [Ps. 37, 10]  Hence again he saith, As for man, his days are as grass. [Ps. 103, 15]  Hence Isaiah saith, All flesh is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of the field. [Is. 40, 6]  Hence James rebukes the spirit of the presumptuous, saying, For what is your life? it is even a vapour that appeareth for a little time. [James 4, 14]  Therefore it is rightly said, wait a little, in that both that is unmeasurable which follows after without limit, and all but little that is closed by an end.  For that ought not to seem long to us, which by the course of its allotted period is tending not to be; which while it is carried on by moments, its very own moments, whilst they delay, are themselves urging forwards; and from the very same cause, from which it is seen to be in our possession, it results that it ceases to be in our possession.  But blessed Job, after he had brought in the shortness of the present life in terms of contempt, therefore in the voice of all the Elect rises up justly against the wicked.
