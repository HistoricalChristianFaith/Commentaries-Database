14.  As though it were spoken in plain speech; ‘Man, turn back to thine own self; sift thoroughly the secrets of thine own heart.  If thou findest out that thou dost fear God, surely it is plain that of this Wisdom thou art full.  Which same if thou art not able to learn what in herself She is, meanwhile thou henceforth findest what She is in thyself. For She that is feared in herself by the Angels, in thee is called ‘the fear of the Lord.’  Because it is certain that thou possessest Her, if it is not uncertain that thou dost fear God.’  Hence also it is said by the Psalmist; The beginning of Wisdom is the fear of the Lord, [Ps. 111, 10] because She then begins to penetrate the heart, when She disturbs it by the dread of the final Judgment.  Therefore the Word of God draws Itself in to our littleness; just as a father, when he speaks to his little child, in order that he may be able to be understood by him, talks stammeringly of his own accord.  For because we are unable to penetrate the nature of Wisdom, what She is in herself, by the condescension of God, we have heard what She is in us, when it is said, Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is Wisdom.  But because he really understands the force of Divine fear, who keeps himself from all bad practices, it is rightly subjoined; And, to depart from evil is understanding. So then the things that come after, that they are full of the spirit of prophecy, the words of the sacred history themselves bear testimony.
