The public works of the supreme wisdom are when almighty God rules those whom he creates, brings to an end the good things which he begins and aids by his inspiration those whom he illuminates with the light of his visitation. For it is plain to the eyes of all people that those whom God created of his free bounty, he provides for with lovingkindness. And when he grants spiritual gifts, he himself brings to perfection what he has himself begun in the bounty of his lovingkindness. But the secret works of supreme wisdom are when God forsakes those whom he has created … when he enlightens us with the brightness of his illumination and yet by permitting temptation of the flesh, strikes us with the mists of blindness. Or when he does not care to preserve the good gifts he has bestowed to us, when he at the same time prompts the desires of our soul toward himself and yet by a secret judgment presses us with the powerlessness of our weak nature.… “For her law is manifold.” What should the “law” of God be understood to mean here except for “charity,” whereby we ever read in the inward parts in what way the precepts of life should be maintained in outward action? For concerning this law the voice of “Truth” says, “This is my commandment, that you love one another.” Concerning it, Paul says, “Love is the fulfilling of the law.” In relation to it Paul says again, “Bear one another’s burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.” For how can the law of Christ be more aptly understood than to mean the charity that we then truly fulfill when we bear the burdens of our brothers from the principle of love?
