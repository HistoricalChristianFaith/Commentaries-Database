66.  For vices make an appointment together under the cloak of virtues; in that there are certain ones, which are banded together against us by a kind of agreement, such as pride and anger, remissness and fear.  For anger is neighbour to pride, and remissness to cowardice.  Those then come together by agreement, which are allied to one another in opposition to us, by a kind of kinship in iniquity; but if we acknowledge the toilsomeness of our captivity, if we grieve in our inmost soul from love of our eternal home, the sins that steal upon the inopportunely joyful, will not be able to prevail against the opportunely sad.

42.  In the Preface to this work we said that the friends of blessed Job, though they come together to him with a good purpose, yet do for this reason bear the likeness of heretics, in that they fall away into sin by speaking without discretion; and hence it is said to them by blessed Job, Surely I would speak to the Almighty, I desire to reason with God; but ye are forgers of lies, and followers of corrupt doctrines. [Job 13, 3. 4.]  Thus Holy Church, which is set in the midst of tribulation all this time of her pilgrimage, whilst she suffers wounds, and mourns over the downfall of her members, has other enemies of Christ besides to bear with, under Christ's name.  For to the increasing of her grief, heretics also meet together in dispute and strife, and they pierce her with unreasonable words like as with a kind of dart.
43.  And it is well said, they came every one from his own place.  For ‘the place’ of heretics is very pride itself.  For except they first swelled with pride in their hearts, they would never enter the lists of false assertion.  For the place of the wicked is pride, just as reversely humility is ‘the place’ of the good.  Whereof Solomon saith, If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy place. [Eccles. 10, 4]  As though he said in plain words, ‘If thou perceivest the spirit of the Tempter to prevail against thee in aught, quit not the lowliness of penitence;’ and that it was the abasement of penitence that he called ‘our place,’ he shows by the words that follow, saying, for healing [ib. Vulg.] pacifieth great offences.  For what else is the humility of mourning, save the remedy of sin.  Heretics therefore come each from ‘his place,’ in that it is from pride that they are urged to attack Holy Church.
44.  And their froward conduct, moreover, is collected from an interpretation of their names.  For they are named ‘Eliphaz,’ ‘Baldad,’ ‘Sophar;’ and as we have said above Eliphaz is, by interpretation, rendered, ‘contempt of God.’  For if they did not condemn God, they would never entertain wrong notions concerning Him.  And Baldad is rendered ‘oldness alone.’  For while they shrink from being fairly defeated, and seek to be victorious with froward purpose, they pay no regard to the conversation of the new life, and all that they give heed to is ‘of oldness alone.’  And Sophar, ‘dissipating prospect;’ for they that are set in Holy Church humbly contemplate with true faith the mysteries of their Redeemer, but when heretics come to them with false statements, they ‘dissipate the prospect,’ in that they turn aside from the aim of right contemplation the minds of those, whom they draw over to themselves.
45.  Now the places from whence they come are described in fitting accordance with the practices of heretics.  For there is a Themanite, and a Suhite, and a Naamathite named.  Now Thema is by interpretation ‘the south;’ Suhi, ‘speaking;’ Naama, ‘come1iness.’  But who does not know that the south is a hot wind; so heretics, as they are over ardent to be wise, study to have heated wits beyond what needs.  For sloth goes with the torpor of cold, whilst reversely the restlessness of unrestrained curiosity accords with unabated teeming heat, and so because they long to feel the heat of wisdom beyond what they ought, they are said to come from ‘the south.’  Paul busied himself to cool the minds of the faithful to this heat of unrestrained wiseness, when he said, Not to be overwise beyond what he ought to be wise, but to be wise unto sobriety. [Rom. 12, 3. Vulg.]  It is hence that David smites at the valleys of salt, [2 Sam. 8, 13] viz. in that our Redeemer, by the piercing of His severity, extinguishes the foolishness of unrestrained wit in all that entertain wrong notions regarding Him.  And Suhi is rendered ‘talking,’ for they desire to be warm-witted, not that they may live well, but that they may talk high; thus they are said to come from Thema and Suhi, i.e. from ‘heat,’ and ‘talkativeness,’ for herein, viz. that they show themselves as studious of Scripture, they teem with words of talkativeness, but not with bowels of love.  And Naama is interpreted ‘comeliness,’ for because they aim not to be, but to appear learned, by words of deep learning they put on the guise of well living, and by their teeming wit in talk, exhibit in themselves a form of  ‘comeliness,’ that by the comeliness of the lips they may more easily recommend evil counsels, in proportion as they commonly hide from our senses the foulness of their lives.  But neither are the very names of the places set down in undistinguished order in the relation.  For Thema is set first, then Suhi, and next Naama in that first an excessive warmth of wit sets them on fire, next smartness of speech lifts them up, and then, finally, dissimulation presents them comely to the eyes of men. 
For they had made an appointment together to come and mourn with him and to comfort him.
46.  Heretics ‘make an appointment together,’ when they hold in common certain false opinions contrary to the Church, and in the points wherein they are at variance with the truth agree together in falsehood.  But all they that give us instruction concerning eternity, what else are they doing, save amid the tribulations of our pilgrimage administering consolation to us?  And forasmuch as heretics desire to impart to Holy Church their own opinions, they come to her as though to comfort her.  Nor is it strange if they who set forth a figure of enemies, are called friends, when it is said to the very traitor, Friend, wherefore art thou come? [Mat. 26, 50] and the rich man that is consumed in the fire of hell, is called son by Abraham. [Luke 16, 25]  For though the wicked refuse to be amended by us, yet it is meet that we style them friends, not of their wickedness, but by virtue of our own lovingkindness.

19.  We have it proved to us how great a love they entertained both for each other, and for the smitten man, in that they came by agreement to administer consolation to him when afflicted.  Though even by this circumstance, viz. that Scripture bears witness they were the friends of so great a man, it is made appear that they were men of a good spirit and right intention; though this very intention of mind, when they break forth into words, upon indiscretion arising, becomes clouded in the sight of the strict Judge.
