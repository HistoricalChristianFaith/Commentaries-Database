And to one indeed he entrusted five talents, to another two, and to another one. For there are five senses of the body, namely sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch. By five talents, therefore, is expressed the gift of the five senses, that is, knowledge of external things. By two is designated understanding and action. By the term of one talent is designated understanding alone.
