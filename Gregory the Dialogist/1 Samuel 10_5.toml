12. A hill is the height of a mountain. What is more rightly understood by this hill than the holy intent of the Scriptures? It is indeed the height of a mountain, because it does not lie on the plain of the letter, but is exceedingly elevated in the sublimity of spiritual meanings. The untrained preacher therefore sets out on the right path of virtues if, after he has seen the public preachers and the secluded anchorites, he sees and recognizes the height of Scripture. In this matter it should be noted that we said Saul, in that he stood out above all the people from his shoulders and upward, signified a learned man of great conduct. Why then does he ascend to the hill of the Lord, so that he may come to the height of the Scriptures, which he already knows? But in a similar way it could have been asked about him why he went to see the men leaping over great ditches, when he was said to be a man of great conduct. To which it must be said: because he was shown to represent great men in conduct, but untrained in the ministry of preaching. He who can advance through the examples of better men both in the purity of contemplation and in the office of preaching ought to return to the height of the Scriptures, because the higher the life by which he advances, the more keenly he attends to the sublimity of sacred speech. Let the prophet therefore say: "After these things you will come to the hill of the Lord." As if to say: When you grasp the perfection of holy men through perfect imitation, you will advance into so great an understanding of Sacred Scripture that what you once thought you perceived in it sublimely will now seem plain.

13. There is the garrison of the Philistines: because those who fell from heaven through the drink of pride mock the Jews and heretics through the Scriptures. They stand therefore on the hill: because the hearts they possess they deceive in the Scriptures by the falseness of understanding. Therefore, as often as the Jews presume to ascend to the hill of the Lord, they are captured by the Philistines standing there. For while they think they understand the meaning of Scripture in a lofty way, demons meet them in their ascent and, deceiving them, slay them. Rightly, therefore, Saul is commanded to go to the hill of the Lord not immediately, but first, after seeing those leaping over pits and carrying bread and wine: because faithful men are fortified by the great protection of the teaching and examples of their betters. Hence it is also said to the same Saul: "You will meet a company of prophets coming from the high place." As if to say: You will be able to fear the garrison of the Philistines so much less, the more you will have prophets meeting you for your security. And because a company of prophets is mentioned, a great multitude of our defenders is signified. Let the Jew therefore be afraid: because when he ascends alone, he perishes. For what do those same prophets coming to meet us say? "Woe to him who is alone, for if he falls, there is no one to lift him up" (Eccl. 4:10). For he is alone who is abandoned by God. Certainly no one lifts up this one when he falls, because no saint takes up one abandoned by God. Therefore every elect person ascends securely: because he is not alone. For He who speaks through us is with us. For He also promises, saying: "Behold, I am with you all days, even to the consummation of the world" (Matt. 28:20). Indeed he was not alone who said: "I am not alone, but He who sent me is with me" (John 8:16). Likewise he was not alone who demanded, saying: "Do you seek proof of Christ who speaks in me?" (2 Cor. 13:3). This can fittingly be understood not only of the Lord's spiritual presence, but also of the material teaching of the elect. Holy preachers indeed ascend to the hill of the Lord, where the garrison of the Philistines is: but because they have the company of prophets meeting them, they in no way fear the Philistines themselves. But who are these prophets, if not the great preachers of holy Church? For the ministry of prophets is to reveal hidden things and to predict the future. Moreover, the teachers of holy Church, when they draw the hidden meanings of the Scriptures to common knowledge, open secrets that are unknown: and when they preach eternal joys, they reveal things to come. Prophets therefore come to meet us: because the teachers of holy Church show us the truth of holy Scripture. For when they tell us what we wish to know from sacred eloquence, they meet those going along the way that leads to the hill of the Lord. There, therefore, through the meeting of the prophets, we are secure where the Philistines are: because through the authority of holy preachers we recognize the understanding of Scripture, in which the Jews and heretics are slain by demons with the sword of their own errors. Behold, for if we have recourse to the Law of Moses, we certainly find the hill of the Lord. There surely we read of the tabernacle, there of the high priest, there of the blood of goats and calves together, and of the Paschal Lamb. The Jews understand these things according to the letter by their own spirit, and because they have no prophet with them in this, they die. If I wish to ascend to this mountain, I first see the prophets descending, and I ascend securely. And to leave aside the new ones for the moment, Isaiah first meets me as I ascend, saying: "Like a sheep he will be led to slaughter, and like a lamb before his shearer, he will not open his mouth" (Isa. 53:7). Hence Paul says: "Christ, appearing as high priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation, nor through the blood of goats or calves, but through his own blood, entered once into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption" (Heb. 9:11-12). But if we wish to have more on this hill, we find all the prophets by seeking them: because what the old teachers had promised, the new preachers demonstrate to have been fulfilled in our Redeemer.

14. Wherefore the Redeemer of the human race can also fittingly be designated by the name of a hill. Whence Isaiah, prophesying, says: 'In the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of the mountains' (Isa. 2:2). He is called a hill on account of the sublimity of His holiness, and of the Lord, because He is the Son of the most high Father. On this hill indeed the garrison of the Philistines is said to be, because He was born as a sign to be contradicted. The garrison of the Philistines is the opposition of heretics. For as though standing on the hill, they lie in ambush against those ascending to the hill; and while they pervert the Holy Scriptures by expounding them wrongly, they destroy those who are carelessly ascending to know the Redeemer. Therefore let the elect not be alarmed; ascending, he meets a company of prophets, because all the preachers of the Old and New Testament announce to him the Redeemer Himself. They come indeed from on high, because what they preach on earth, they see in heaven. Whence also to John, as though truly from the chosen company of prophets, it is said from heaven: 'Come up hither, and I will show you what must take place after this' (Rev. 4:1). Who, when he had ascended, beheld and recognized the Lamb—whom Moses had prefigured as to be slain, and whom he himself had seen offered on the cross—now reigning; and he learned how great were the thanksgivings rendered to Him by those for whom He had been slain. Therefore the preachers come from on high, because what they preach to those beneath them, they have learned in heavenly contemplation.

15. Well also is the company of prophets said to have met Saul at the entrance of the city; because we can see the great preachers of Holy Church where they descend, not where they are exalted. For the things which they say to us little ones, we hear; but the things which they see in heavenly places, how they see them, or how sweetly they love them, we do not see. For the apostle Paul was caught up into paradise and was taken up to the third heaven, and he heard secret words which it is not lawful for a man to speak (2 Cor. 12:4). Who then could find so great a preacher caught up into paradise, or taken up to the third heaven? But blessed Paul said these things about himself under compulsion. Whence also at the end of the sublimity he had set forth, humbling himself, he says: "I have become a fool; you compelled me" (2 Cor. 12:11). How great then were those things which he was unwilling to tell, if he came to reveal even these under compulsion? For he who heard things which it is not lawful for a man to speak also saw things which it is not lawful for a man to know. You might perhaps say: Even if he wished, how could he express in human speech the beauty of that third heaven, the light of that innermost brightness, the indescribable splendor of the angels, and the inaccessible glory — how sweetly all those elect and blessed eternal citizens receive from the fullness of that One, how eagerly they partake, how completely they are filled, how pleasantly they taste the sweetness of divine goodness, with what delightful fullness they are satisfied: what the splendors are for each one from that one ineffable light of the Creator, what the beauty of all together is from that one glory: by what excellence of dignity some surpass others, and by what means the good are subject to the better in the ineffable delight of justice?

16. We cannot, therefore, follow the lofty Paul to that height, but we enter the city, in which, as if descending from on high, he comes to meet us. For we who cannot perceive the lofty things that the preachers see must reverently hear the plain things that they teach. But when they descend, they carry before them the psaltery, the timbrel, the flute, and the harp. They have the psaltery because they announce the kingdom of heaven; they have the timbrel because they preach the mortification of the flesh; they have the flute because they command their subjects to weep for the acquisition of eternal joy; and they also have the harp because they teach the devout to rejoice in the certainty of eternal goods. The psaltery indeed, which resonates from the upper part, also signifies the proclamation of eternal joys, because when it urges us to love heavenly things, it sends forth the sound of its sweetness, as it were, from the upper part. The timbrel, because it is stretched over the hide of a dead animal, fittingly represents the mortification of our flesh. That the flute is customarily present at the funeral rites of the dead, we have learned from the Gospel, for when the Lord wished to raise the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue, He cast the flute players out of the house and drove away the tumultuous crowd (Matt. 9:25). What then is expressed by the flute, if not the mourning of the saints? For when they see themselves cast out from that eternal life which they desire, they lament over themselves as though they were dead. The harp, however, is a very joyful musical instrument. By this instrument the word of consolation for the elect is fittingly represented, because just as we are gladdened by the sound of the harp, so the elect preachers console us amid the hardships of our present exile. The psaltery, therefore, is placed first in the procession of the preachers, because above all else the glory of the heavenly kingdom must be proclaimed, so that when we recognize the good that we should love, we may desire to labor for the attainment of that same good. Hence it is that when Matthew in the Gospel was setting forth the beginnings of the Lord's Incarnation, he said: John began to preach and to say: Do penance, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand (Matt. 4:17). But because when we know heavenly things, if we wish to reach them, it is necessary that we mortify the passions of the flesh, the preachers of holy Church produce, as it were after the psaltery, the sound of the timbrel. And what is this mortification of the body other than a preparation for eternal blessedness? We learn to love the preparation of heavenly things, and we are commanded to seek them with the most ardent weeping. For we mourn the dead, as it were with a flute, when we grieve vehemently that we do not yet live in that eternal life. After the timbrel, therefore, our preachers have the flute, because they teach us both to mortify our members and to groan for love of eternal life. They also bring the harp after the flute, because they command us so to bewail the hardships of our present exile that we may rejoice in the promise of our eternal inheritance. For the great prophet sounded the psaltery when he said: My sheep hear my voice, and I give them eternal life (John 10:27). Again striking the psaltery, he says: The Son of Man must be lifted up, that everyone who believes in him may not perish but may have eternal life (John 3:14). He sounded the timbrel who said: Mortify your members which are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil desire (Col. 3:5). He sounded the flute who said: Be afflicted, mourn; let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to sorrow (James 4:9). He sounded the timbrel who said: For your sake we are put to death all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter (Ps. 43:22). He holds the flute before him who likewise speaks to God, saying: You will feed us with the bread of tears, and give us drink in full measure (Ps. 79:6). The Lord held the flute before Him when He said: Amen I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be sorrowful (John 16:20). But as if adding the sound of the harp, He says: Your sorrow shall be turned into joy (ibid.). He sounded the harp for us, as it were, who said: Rejoice in the Lord always; again I say, rejoice. Let your modesty be known to all men; the Lord is near (Phil. 4:4). He sounds the harp for us who, announcing the good things of our city, says: Joy and gladness shall be found in it, thanksgiving and the voice of praise (Isa. 51:3). Because, therefore, the preachers of holy Church announce the heavenly kingdom, and for the attainment of that same kingdom command us to mortify the flesh, to bewail our captivity, and to exult in hope of future blessedness, the prophets descending from the height are said to carry before them the psaltery, the timbrel, the flute, and the harp. And they are called a company of prophets, because the pastors of holy Church are many, yet they have one pastor, the Lord Jesus Christ.

17. And it should be noted that the prophets are said to have the psaltery, drum, flute, and harp before them, so that the pattern of the elect preachers might be seen. For the reprobate have what they preach behind them, because they say and do not do; they neglect to do the good things that they know. Whence also to King Saul, already despising the Lord's commands, it is said: "Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, the Lord has rejected you from being king" (1 Samuel 15:23). Hence the Lord complains through the prophet concerning the Jews, saying: "They have cast me behind their back" (1 Kings 14:9). Therefore the holy teachers, because they maintain the path of heavenly conduct that they preach by the continual course of good works, in their figure it is said that the prophets had the psaltery, drum, flute, and harp before them as they descended. For these instruments can be referred to the preaching of the Redeemer. And because not far above we said that the hill of the Lord is the Redeemer himself, let us consider the fittingness of the instruments. He who names him king of the eternal kingdom surely sounds the psaltery for us. And he who affirms the discipline of our mortification in him strikes, as it were, the drum. He sounds the flute who proclaims the Redeemer dead for the salvation of the world. He strikes the harp who declares that he rose from the dead and ascended to heaven. But we are made glad at the delight of such great instruments if we hear the very flock of prophets sounding forth. For David says: "His going forth is from the highest heaven, and his circuit reaches to the highest" (Psalm 18:7). Hence he likewise says: "All kings of the earth shall worship him, all nations shall serve him" (Psalm 71:11). For he held, as it were, the psaltery in praise of the Redeemer, who obtained the higher part of praise and preached the coming of the Redeemer from the highest heaven. Isaiah touched the drum of his mortification, saying: "And we saw him, and there was no beauty, and we desired him, despised and the lowest of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity; and his face was as it were hidden and despised, whence we did not esteem him" (Isaiah 53:3). Likewise sounding the flute of his death, he says: "He shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb he was silent" (Isaiah 53:7). David, striking the harp of the resurrection, says: "Let the whole earth be moved before his face; say among the nations that the Lord has reigned from the wood; for he has established the world, which shall not be moved" (Psalm 95:10). Also touching the harp of the ascension, he said: "O kingdoms of the earth, sing to God, who ascends above the heaven of heavens to the east" (Psalm 67:33–34). Therefore the prophets descend from on high when the holy preachers announce to us those mysteries which they have learned by lofty contemplation. And they sound the psaltery, flute, and harp, because they declare our Redeemer to be Lord of the eternal kingdom, both humbled through the human condition, and that by his death he redeems the world, and by rising again he restores heavenly things. Which instruments of praise they surely have before them, because they understand what they say. On the contrary, Caiaphas is said to prophesy (John 11) and yet to be ignorant of what he said, since the flute of the Lord's death that he touched he did not have before him as an elect prophet would, but behind him. Well then is it added concerning the elect prophets: "And them prophesying." Because while they see what they say, they have, as it were, the instruments that they play before them; and while they preach, they bring forth what they have known by foreseeing. Therefore Saul comes to the hill of the Lord when the chosen yet unformed preacher advances in spiritual knowledge and recognizes the Redeemer of the human race not on the level plain of his humanity, but in the lofty majesty of his divinity. Then indeed he hears the choirs of the prophets singing together, because he perfectly understands all the Scriptures that concern him. He therefore who saw the men leaping over great pits, who beheld those carrying kids, and loaves of bread, and a flask of wine, arrives at the hill of the Lord—when he who is known to have advanced through the examples of the elect is raised to the summit of knowledge, and knowing the Redeemer sublimely, loves him ineffably, from whom, as a familiar friend, he may obtain what he further desires to know about him.
