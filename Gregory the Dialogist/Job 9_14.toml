How great am I that I should answer Him, and talk with Him in my words?

As though he said in plain words, 'If that created being is unable to take thought of Him, which is not burthened by the flesh, in what spirit do I dispute about His judgments, who am straitened by the burthen of corruption?' But as God's words to us are oftentimes His judgments, declaring the sentence of our actions, so our words to God are the deeds which we set forth; but man 'cannot reason with God in his words,' in that, in the eye of His exact judgment, he maintains no assurance in his actions.
