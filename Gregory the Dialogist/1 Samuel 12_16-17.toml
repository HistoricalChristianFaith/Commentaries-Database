Therefore it is well added: "But now also stand and see this great thing which the Lord will do before your eyes. Is it not the wheat harvest today? I will call upon the Lord, and He will send thunder and rain; and you shall know and see that you have done a great evil for yourselves in the sight of the Lord, in asking for a king over you."

9. Because the petition of the king is reproved so attentively and so many times, this suggests to the elect that those who advance carnal men to the height of the holy Church are held by a most grave obligation of sin. For other sins obtain the merit of a single punishment, but he who appoints a carnal leader incurs as many merits of punishment as that man provides examples of depravity to the faithful subjects. But the heavy weight of crime cannot be set down except by the severity of great compunction. Yet the grace of compunction is not poured into the mind unless the magnitude of the sin is first shown to it. Therefore the prophet of the Lord, in order to provoke the sinning people to the fruit of fitting penance, suggests to them the great sin of transgression through a wondrous disturbance of the air. Now in that region, rains and thunders do not occur during the wheat harvest.
