But because this Leviathan is called in another place not merely a serpent but also a flying serpent, because he rules over unclean spirits or reprobate people, as Isaiah says, “Out of the serpent’s root shall come forth a flying serpent,” we must attentively observe how a basilisk destroys, that by the doings of the basilisk, his malice may be more plainly made known to us. For a basilisk does not destroy with its bite but consumes with its breath. It often also infects the air with its breath and withers with the mere blast of its nostrils whatever it has touched, even when placed at a distance.
