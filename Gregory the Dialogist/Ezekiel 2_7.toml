Every one who sins, what does he do but provoke the anger of his Creator against himself? We know that every time we sin in deed, in word, in thought, we make God angry with us. And yet he delays, he waits in mercy and first of all demands patience of himself, only then giving the word of exhortation to his preachers for us. Everyone who preaches rightly, if he is heard, appeases the anger of our Creator, who has been provoked by his sinful people.
