22.  The great glory of the priest is the righteousness of those that are subject to him.  Whence the excellent preacher saith well to his disciples; For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing?  Are not even ye in the presence of our Lord? [1 Thess. 2, 19]  But when the priests neglect the lives of their charge, and bring no fruit from their advancement before the presence of the Lord, what else is this but that they are called [b] ‘inglorious?’  Since before the strict Judge they do not then find glory, who do not now seek it out in the lives of those subject to their charge by urgency in preaching.  And it is well said, And overthroweth the mighty.  In that, when, by a righteous judgment, He forsakes the heart of those that rule, it does not look for the inward recompensing of the reward, and it is overthrown in that whereby it is deceived, so as to rejoice in temporal superiority instead of eternal glory.  Therefore ‘the mighty are overthrown,’ in that while they lose sight of the real rewards of the heavenly country, they are brought to the ground here in their own pleasures.
