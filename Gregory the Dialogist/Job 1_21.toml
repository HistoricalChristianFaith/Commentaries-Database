85.  As if the mind when tempted and taken in the powerlessness of its weak condition were to say, ‘Naked I was by grace first begotten in the faith, and naked I shall be saved by the same grace in being taken up into heaven [in assumptione].’  For it is a great consolation to a troubled mind, when, smitten with the assaults of sin, it sees itself as it were stripped of all virtue, to fly to the hope of Mercy alone, and prevent itself being stripped naked in proportion as it humbly thinks itself to be naked and bare of virtue, and though it be perchance bereaved of some virtue in the hour of temptation, yet acknowledging its own weakness, it is the better clad with humility itself, and is stronger as it is laid low than as it was standing, in that it ceases to ascribe to itself without the aid of God whatever it has.  And hence it also at once owns with humility the hand of Him Who is both Giver and Judge, saying,
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away.
86.  Observe how he grew great by the discipline of temptations, who both in the possession of the virtue acknowledges the bounty of the Giver, and in the disorderment of his fortitude, the power of the Withdrawer; which fortitude nevertheless is not withdrawn, but is confounded and loses heart, that the assaulted mind, while it dreads every instant to lose the quality as it seems, being alway made humble, may never lose it.
As it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done; Blessed be the Name of the Lord.
87.  In this circumstance, viz. that we are assaulted with inward trouble, it is meet that we refer the thing to the judgment of our Creator, that our heart may resound the louder the praises of its Maker, from the very cause that makes it, on being smitten, the more thoroughly to consider the impotency of its frail condition.

59.  The mother of our Redeemer, after the flesh, was the Synagogue, from whom He came forth to us, made manifest by a Body.  But she kept Him to herself veiled under the covering of the letter, seeing that she neglected to open the eyes of the understanding to the spiritual import thereof.  Because in Him, thus veiling Himself with the flesh of an human Body, she would not see God, she as it were refused to behold Him naked in His Divinity.  But He ‘came naked out of His mother's womb,’ because when He issued from the flesh of the Synagogue, He came openly manifest to the Gentiles; which is excellently represented by Joseph's leaving His cloak and fleeing.  For when the adulterous woman would have used him to no good end, he, leaving his cloak, fled out of the house; because when the Synagogue, believing Him to be simply man, would have bound Him as it were in an adulterous embrace, He too left the covering of the letter to its eyes, and manifested Himself to the Gentiles without disguise for the acknowledgment of the Power of His Divinity.  And hence Paul said, But even to this day, when Moses is read, the vail is upon their hearts [2 Cor. 3, 15]; for this reason, that the adulteress kept the cloak in her own hands, but Him, Whom she wickedly laid hold of, she let go naked.  He then Who coming from the Synagogue plainly disclosed Himself to the faith of the Gentiles, ‘came naked out of His mother's womb,’ But does He wholly give her up?  Where then is that which the Prophet declares, For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall return? [Is. 10, 22] where that which is written, Until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in; and so all Israel shall be saved? [Rom. 11, 25. 26.]   The time will be, then, when He will show Himself clearly to the Synagogue also.  Yes, the time will doubtless come in the end of the world, when He will make Himself known, even as He is God, to the remnant of His People.  Whence it is likewise justly said in this place, and naked shall I return thither.  For he ‘returns naked to His mother's womb,’ when, at the end of the world, He, Who being made Man in time is the object of scorn, is revealed to the eyes of His Synagogue as God before all worlds.  It proceeds: "The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it come to pass; blessed be the Name of the Lord"
60.  Our Redeemer, in that He is God, gives all things with the Father; but in that He is Man, He receives at the hands of the Father, as one among all.  Therefore let Him say of Judaea, so long as she believed in the mystery of His Incarnation to come, the Lord hath given.  Let Him say of her, when she slighted the looked for coming of His Incarnation, the Lord hath taken away.  For she was ‘given,’ when in the persons of a certain number she believed what was to be; but she was ‘taken away,’ as the just desert of her blindness, when she scorned to hold in veneration the truths believed by those.
61.  But let Him instruct all that believe in Him, that when under scourges they may know how to bless God, in the words that are added, As it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done [not in E.V.]; blessed be the Name of the Lord.  Whence likewise, as the Gospel is witness, when He is described to be drawing near to His Passion, He is said to have taken bread and given thanks.  And so He gives thanks Who is bearing the stripes of the sins of others.  And He, Who did nothing worthy of strokes, blesses humbly under the infliction of them, doubtless that He might show from hence what each man ought to do in the chastisement of his own transgressions, if He thus bears with patience the chastisement of the transgressions of others, that He might show hence what the servant should do under correction, if He being equal gives thanks to the Father under the rod.

30.  Oh!  upon how elevated a seat of the counsels of the heart does he sit enthroned, who now lies prostrate on the earth with his clothes rent!  For because by the judgment of the Lord he had lost all that he had, for the preserving his patience he brought to mind that time, when he had not as yet those things which he had lost, that, whilst he considers that at one time he had them not, he may moderate his concern for having lost them; for it is a high consolation in the loss of what we have, to recall to mind those times, when it was not our fortune to possess the things which we have lost.  But as the earth has produced all of us, we not unjustly call her our mother.  As it is written, An heavy yoke is upon the sons of Adam, from the day that they go out of their mother's womb, till the day that they return to the mother of all things. [Ecclus. 40, 1]
Blessed Job then, that he might mourn with patience for what he had lost here, marks attentively in what condition he had come hither.  But for the furtherance of preserving patience, with still more discretion he considers, how he will go hence, and exclaims, Naked came lout of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return thither.  As though he said, ‘Naked did the earth bear me, when I came upon this scene, naked it will receive me back, when I depart hence.  I then who have lost what I had indeed given me, but what must yet have been abandoned, what have I parted with that was my own?’  But because comfort is not only to be derived from the consideration of our creation [conditionis ‘conditoris.’], but also from the justice of the Creator, he rightly adds,
The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done. [so V. and lxx.]
31.  The holy man, under trial from the adversary, had lost every thing, yet knowing that Satan had no power against him to tempt him, saving by the Lord's permission, he does not say, ‘the Lord hath given, the devil hath taken away,’ but the Lord gave, the Lord hath taken away.  For perchance it would have been a thing to grieve for, if what his Creator had given him, his enemy had taken from him: but when no other hath taken it away, saving He Who Himself gave it, He hath only recalled what was His own, and hath not taken away what was ours.  For if we have from Him all that we make use of in our present life, what cause for grief that by His own decree we are made to surrender, of Whose bounty we have a loan?  Nor is he at any time an unfair creditor, who while he is not bound to any set time of restitution, exacts, whenever he will, what he lends out.  Whereupon it is well added, As it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done; for since in this life we undergo things which we would not, it is needful for us to turn the bias of our will to Him, Who can will nought that is unjust.  For there is great comfort in what is disagreeable to us, in that it comes to us by His disposal, to Whom nought but justice is pleasing.  If then we be assured that what is just is the Lord's pleasure, and if we can suffer nothing but what is the Lord's pleasure, then all is just that we undergo, and it is great injustice, if we murmur at a just suffering. 
32.  But since we have heard how the intrepid speaker put forward the vindication of his cause against the adversary, now let us hear how in the end of his speech he extols the Judge with benedictions.  It follows, Blessed be the Name of the Lord.  See how he concluded all that he felt alight with a blessing on the Lord, that the adversary might both perceive hence, and for his punishment under defeat take shame to himself, that he himself even though created in bliss had proved a rebel to that Lord, to Whom a mortal even under His scourge utters the hymn of glory.
But be it observed, that our enemy strikes us with as many darts as he afflicts us with temptations; for it is in a field of battle that we stand every day, every day we receive the weapons of his temptations.  But we ourselves too send our javelins against him, if, when pierced with woes, we answer humbly.  Thus blessed Job, when stricken with the loss of his substance and with the death of his children, forasmuch as he turned the force of his anguish into praise of his Creator, exclaiming, The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away; as it hath pleased the Lord, so is it done; blessed be the Name of the Lord:  by his humility, struck down the enemy in his pride, and by his patience, laid low the cruel one.  Let us never imagine that our combatant received wounds, and yet inflicted none.  For whatever words of patience he gave forth to the praise of God, when he was stricken, he as it were hurled so many darts into the breast of his adversary, and inflicted much sorer wounds than he underwent; for by his affliction he lost the things of earth, but by bearing his affliction with humility, he multiplied his heavenly blessings.
