11.  We not unfitly interpret these words of the Only begotten Son of the Supreme Father, so as to understand Him to be Himself ‘the Wisdom and Strength of God.’  For Paul also bears testimony to our interpretation, in the words, Christ the Power of God and the Wisdom of God. [1 Cor. 1, 24]  Who is ever ‘with Him,’ in that, In the Beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. [John 1, 1]  But God ‘hath counsel and understanding;’ ‘counsel,’ in that He orders His own matters, ‘understanding,’ in that He knows ours.  By the naming of ‘counsel’ may also be denoted the mere delay of secret judgment alone, as that He is sometimes slow in striking offenders, not because the sin of bad men is not seen, but that their sentence of condemnation, which is delayed for the practising of penance, may seem as if out of counsel slow to issue forth.  And so what the public declaration one day reveals without, that lay hid with the Almighty Lord in counsel before the world began.
