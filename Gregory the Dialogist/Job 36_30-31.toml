“And he will also cover the hinges of the sea.” From Elihu’s voice we hear that this will happen, but we see that through the agency of God, it has happened already. The almighty Lord, in fact, has covered the limits of the sea with glowing clouds, because, through the fulminating miracles performed by his preachers, he has led to faith even the most extreme lands of the world.… “For by these he governs peoples; he gives food in abundance.” By these words of his preachers, that is, by these drops of the clouds and by the lightning of miracles, God judges people. He calls to repentance their frightened hearts. Indeed, as soon as they hear the heavenly words, as soon as they see the wondrous works, they come back to their heart and, repenting of their past iniquities, fear the eternal chastisements.
