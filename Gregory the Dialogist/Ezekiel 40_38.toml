"And for each treasury chamber there was a door in the fronts of the gates." We said above that the treasuries are the hearts of teachers, which preserve the riches of knowledge. The fronts of the gates are the words and works of preachers, by which we recognize outwardly what kind of persons they are who live within themselves. There is a door through each treasury in the fronts of the gates, because each teacher opens understanding in the heart of the hearer through the sayings and works of the fathers. For when we examine the preaching of the apostle Peter, when we search out the words of Paul, when we investigate the Gospel of John, and from their words draw our hearers to interior understanding, what else do we do but open a door in the fronts of the gates? Let it therefore be said: Through each treasury a door in the fronts of the gates, because if a teacher does not confirm what he says by the sayings of the apostles, he does not have a door in the fronts of the gates. And if he does not have a door, it can no longer be called a treasury of the spiritual building, because if he does not open understanding, he is not a teacher.

"There they washed the burnt offering." For those who have devoted themselves to the Lord through faith in holy conduct have become a holocaust to the Lord. But because they still suffer many things in themselves from their corruptible flesh, because purity of heart is still defiled in them by sordid thoughts, they return daily to tears, they are afflicted by constant weeping. For they consider the words and deeds of the holy fathers, and when they judge themselves unworthy, they wash the holocaust at the entrance of the gates. Behold, for example, someone has vowed out of fear of the almighty Lord to be patient, to render no insult for insult, to tolerate all things with equanimity, and yet when an insult hurled from a neighbor's mouth suddenly strikes him, disturbed he perhaps says something he should not have said. Certainly this man is already a holocaust, but still unclean. Perhaps he showed patience against the insults hurled at him, he remained silent; but nevertheless he is touched by grief at those same insults which he bears, and his soul is wounded in its charity. For true patience is that which loves even the one whom it bears. For to tolerate but to hate is not the virtue of gentleness, but a covering for rage. And so this man often judges himself in his thought, reproaches himself because he grieves, yet cannot prevail upon himself not to grieve. Therefore through good devotion he is already a holocaust, but still unclean through the grief by which he is touched. Another has resolved within himself to give all that he possesses to the needy, to reserve nothing for himself, to commit his life to heavenly governance alone; but while he gives to the poor what he has, perhaps a thought creeps into his mind which says: How will you live if you give everything away? Yet he does not cease to give, but what he had begun to give joyfully he afterward gives sadly. What is this man's mind but a holocaust of mercy? Yet still unclean through the sadness of thought. For either he should not have resolved upon the highest things, or after resolving he should in no way have doubted. Another, having despised worldly pride, has resolved to avoid the honors and dignities of this age, he seeks to hold the lowest place among men, so that he may be found more exalted in lasting glory the more humble he appears in passing life. When this man suddenly recognizes that he is despised by his neighbor, perhaps he is indignant at being despised. He wishes indeed to be in a humble place, but yet he does not wish to be seen as contemptible. Devotion now lifts him up, but weakness still weighs him down. Therefore through devotion he is already a holocaust, but still unclean from weakness. And so those who in the things they have excellently vowed are touched by some fault of their weakness, when through the words of teachers they understand the sayings of the fathers, and recognize how great a fault they lie in, and afflict themselves with the laments of penance, they wash the holocaust at the entrance of the gates.

It must be known that this is the difference between a sacrifice and a holocaust: every holocaust is a sacrifice, but not every sacrifice is a holocaust. For in a sacrifice a part of the animal was customarily offered, but in a holocaust the whole animal. Hence holocaust is called in the Latin language "totally burned." Let us consider, therefore, what a sacrifice is and what a holocaust is. For when someone vows something of his own to God, and does not vow something else, it is a sacrifice. But when he has vowed to almighty God everything that he has, everything that he lives, everything that he understands, it is a holocaust. For there are some who are still held in mind to this world, and yet from their possessions they minister aid to the needy and hasten to defend the oppressed. These, in the good things they do, offer a sacrifice, because they both immolate something of their activity to God and reserve something for themselves. And there are some who reserve nothing for themselves, but immolate to the almighty Lord their sense, tongue, life, and substance which they have received. What do these offer except a holocaust; indeed, do they not rather become a holocaust? For the Israelite people first offered sacrifice in Egypt, but the second in the wilderness. Therefore, whoever still has his mind in the world, but already does some good, has offered sacrifice to God in Egypt. But whoever abandons the present world and does what good he can, as if having already left Egypt behind, offers sacrifice in the wilderness, because, having repelled the noise of carnal desires, he immolates to God in the quiet and solitude of his mind whatever he does. Therefore, although, as has been said, a holocaust is also a sacrifice, nevertheless a holocaust is greater than a sacrifice, because the mind that is not weighed down by the delight of this world burns totally in sacrifice to almighty God whatever it has.

But we must know that there are some who, even while leaving the world, offer indeed all that they have, yet are in no way moved to compunction in the good deeds they do; and while the good they do is indeed a holocaust, yet because they do not know how to weep and judge themselves, and do not kindle themselves from love to tears, their holocaust is not perfect. Hence it is said through the Psalmist: "May the Lord remember all your sacrifice, and may your holocaust be made fat." For a holocaust is dry when the good work is not suffused with the tears of prayer. But a holocaust is fat when what is done well is also watered with tears from a humble heart. Hence again it is said: "I will offer you fat holocausts with marrow." For whoever does a good work but does not know how to weep from love and desire of almighty God has a holocaust, but does not have marrow in his holocaust. But whoever does good works and now longs for the vision of his Creator, and hastens to arrive at the joys of eternal contemplation, and slays himself in weeping from the love by which he is kindled, has given the Lord holocausts with marrow. Therefore we must strive both to abandon evils completely and to do the good works we are able to do, and in those very good deeds we do to be moved to compunction by love of the eternal light. For love of the light itself dispels the darkness of the heart, so that we may be able to see more subtly lest anything perverse be mixed with the good deeds we do. For we must consider what our work is like, what thought is in the work, what intention is in the thought. And when we recognize that something of malice or perverse delight is mixed with our good work, let us return to tears, let us wash the holocaust.

There are, however, certain people who have devoted themselves to the Lord in great undertakings and have attained such perfection that they are never bent by any difficulty, so that in their resolve for chastity the flesh never prostrates the mind with delight in wicked thought. For even if it sometimes knocks through suggestion, it is not permitted to rise, because it is trampled down by the vigor of judgment. Likewise in their resolve for patience, no disorderly word proceeds from their mouth, nor does silent grief press upon the mind; in their generosity of almsgiving, no suspicion of want generates sadness; in their resolve for humility, no contempt gnaws at the mind. But although they now show themselves strong in those things which they have rightly vowed, nevertheless they bring back to memory the former sins that were committed by them before their good resolve, and they lament whatever they remember having done unlawfully. These therefore are a holocaust through the life they hold, but defiled through the life they held before. Therefore they wash the holocaust at the entrance of the gates, because in the understanding they have received from the sayings of the fathers, they afflict themselves with daily lamentations, and cleanse with tears the life they once defiled with wicked deeds. Let us therefore among these things bring back the eyes of our mind to our past life, let us remember what we were when we were following the desires of this world. And if we now serve the Lord with our whole heart, because we remember that we have sinned, let us weep, let us wash the holocaust in weeping.

Behold, we have vowed our chastity to almighty God; but if impure thought still defiles the mind, let us return to tears, let us wash the burnt offering. Behold, we have resolved to preserve patience. But if anger still disturbs us, if silent grief torments the mind, let us return to tears, let us wash the burnt offering. Behold, we have now learned to give away our possessions and to hold a humble place in this world; if any suspicion of poverty still weighs down the soul, if contempt from our neighbor confounds us with some indignation, let us return to tears, let us wash the burnt offering. For great is the bosom of mercy of our Creator for receiving the tears of the humble. For where the tears of innumerable people have been received, there our tears too will find their place. Let us consider what is said through another prophet: And whoever among them stumbles on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the Lord in his sight. This is the day of mercy which was promised to us from the coming of our Redeemer. Therefore whoever stumbles shall be like David, because the sinner returns to repentance; but the house of David shall be like God, because everyone who returns to righteousness becomes a dwelling place of his Creator, so that he may be like an angel in his sight, because he offers to others by proclaiming the bowels of mercy which he himself has experienced. Hence also a little later it is said there: On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and for those dwelling in Jerusalem, for the washing of the sinner and of her who is menstruating.

For the hidden fountain is the only-begotten of the Father, the invisible God. But the open fountain is the same God incarnate. This open fountain is rightly called the house of David, because our Redeemer came forth to us from the lineage of David. Jerusalem is interpreted as the vision of peace. Those who dwell in Jerusalem are they who fix their minds on the vision of inner peace. The sinner and the menstruous woman is either one who transgresses in deed, or the mind that slips into wicked thought. For this pollution is that of the menstruous woman, because she is not touched by another's flesh, yet is defiled by her own flesh. So it is, so it is with every soul that, even if it does not commit an evil deed, nevertheless becomes filthy through polluted thought. Hence also through another prophet, under the figure of Judea, it is said of the soul occupied with unclean desires: All who seek her will not fail; they will find her in her menstrual periods. For malign spirits seeking do not fail when they desire to bring destruction, and are repelled by no rectitude of good thought. And they find the soul in her menstrual periods when, finding her placed in polluted thoughts, they easily drag her to perverse action. Let it therefore be said: In that day there shall be an open fountain for the house of David and for the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for the washing of the sinner and the menstruous woman, because the fountain of mercy, our Redeemer, is now opened to us, who deigned to become incarnate in the house of David, so that he might wash the sinner from perverse deed, and cleanse the menstruous mind from unclean thought. The fountain therefore lies open; let us run with tears, let us be washed in this fountain of loving-kindness.

In this fountain David himself also was washed when he returned to the lamentations of repentance after the stains of grievous sin. For he was seeking to find this very fountain when he said: "Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and strengthen me with your principal spirit." For "Jesus" in Hebrew is called "Savior" in Latin. And what was it that he was asking—that the joy of Jesus be restored to him—except that before his sin he had been accustomed to contemplate him, and in his sin had lost the joys of that contemplation? Hence rightly after his repentance he was seeking that the joy of that vision be restored to him. In this fountain of mercy Mary Magdalene was washed, who was first a notorious sinner, but afterwards washed away her stains with tears and wiped away her stains by correcting her ways. In this fountain of mercy Peter washed before all what he had denied, because he wept bitterly. In this fountain of mercy the thief was washed at his end, who, reproaching himself in death, was cleansed from his sin by confession of the truth.

Why then are we sluggish? Why do we remain torpid and cold, we who have known that so many have already washed themselves in this fountain of mercy? Shall we then despair of our own cleansing, we who hold so many examples of mercy as a pledge? And do we cease to seek pardon and to have confidence with tears, we who have received the cleansing of so many as a pledge of our hope? For we ought to seek the fountain of mercy even if it were closed. Now it lies open, and we neglect it. Let us cast the eyes of faith upon the whole world, let us consider how many sinners day and night are washed through lamentations in this fountain of mercy, how many return from darkness to light, how many from stains to purity. Let us therefore run with such people after the darkness of death to the water of life; let us consider how much we have sinned, how much we sin daily, and, that we may appear clean after our faults, let us wash the burnt offering. For accomplishing these things the grace of our Redeemer is present, who lives and reigns forever and ever. Amen.
