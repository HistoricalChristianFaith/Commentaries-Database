37.  For the soul of one however righteous, if he be judged with strictness by Almighty God, is borne down by the weight of His mightiness.  In which same words this is likewise to be understood, that whereas the holy man shows the might of God, what else of Him does he desire, but His weakness?  And it is written, the weakness of God is stronger than men. [1 Cor. 1, 25]
