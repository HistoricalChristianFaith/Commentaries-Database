Those who precede Jesus as he comes—what do they signify but the crowds of carnal desires and the tumults of vices, which, before Jesus comes to our heart, scatter our thoughts with their temptations and disturb the voice of the heart in prayer? For often when we wish to turn to the Lord after committing sins, when we strive to pray against those very vices we have committed, the phantoms of the sins we have done rush upon the heart, strike back against the vision of our mind, confuse the soul, and suppress the voice of our entreaty. Those who went before, therefore, were rebuking him to be silent, because before Jesus comes to the heart, the evils we have done, thrust upon our thoughts through their images, disturb us in the very midst of our prayer.

But let us hear what this blind man who was to be illuminated did in response to these things. It follows: "But he cried out all the more: Son of David, have mercy on me." Behold, the one whom the crowd rebukes to be silent cries out more and more, because the more heavily we are pressed by the tumult of carnal thoughts, the more ardently we ought to persist in prayer. The crowd opposes us lest we cry out, because we often suffer the phantoms of our sins even in prayer. But indeed it is necessary that the voice of our heart insist all the more strongly the more harshly it is repelled, so that it may overcome the tumult of unlawful thought and burst forth to the merciful ears of the Lord by the excess of its importunity. Each one, as I suspect, recognizes in himself what we are saying, because when we turn our mind from this world to God, when we turn to the work of prayer, the very things we previously did with delight we afterward endure as troublesome and burdensome in our prayer. Scarcely is the thought of them driven away from the eyes of the heart by the hand of holy desire; scarcely are their phantoms overcome through the laments of penance.
