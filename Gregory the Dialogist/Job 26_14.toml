What is meant in this place by the designation of “the ways” but the Lord’s modes of acting? Hence the Lord also says by the prophet, “For my ways are not as your ways.” Accordingly, in telling of the advent of the Lord, he described the ways of God in part. His method of acting by which he created us was one thing; that by which he redeemed us another. Thus of those things that touch upon the Lord’s way of acting and make light of by comparison with the final judgment, he says, “Lo, these things are spoken for part of his ways.” He also calls this “a little drop of his words.” For whatever is high, whatever is terrible within this life, these things we are brought to know by the contemplation of God, as from the vast ocean of the secrets of heaven, its refreshment wells out to us like a slight drop of the liquid element above. “And who will be able to look on the thunder of his majesty?” It is as though he expressed himself in these plain words: “If we endure the wonders of his humility and the thundering and dreadful advent of his majesty, with what courage do we meet life?” - "Morals on the Book of Job 17.54"

54.  What is meant in this place by the designation of the ‘ways,’ but the Lord’s modes of acting?  Hence too the Lord saith by the Prophet; For My ways are not as your ways. [Is. 55, 8]  Accordingly in telling of the Advent of the Lord, he had described the ways of God in part; because His method of acting by which He created us was one thing, and that by which He redeemed us another.  Thus those things, which he told touching the Lord’s way of acting, making light of by comparison with the final Judgment, he says, Lo, these things are spoken for part of His ways.  Which he also calls ‘a little drop of His words,’ for whatsoever thing that is high, whatsoever thing that is terrible, we whilst set in this life are brought to know by the contemplation of Him, from the vast ocean of the secrets of Heaven wells out to us like a slight drop of the liquid element Above.  And who shall be able to look on the thunder of His Majesty?  As though he expressed himself in plain words; ‘If we scarce endure the wonders of His humility, the loud and dreadful Advent of His Majesty with what nerve do we encounter?’  This thundering of His Advent the Psalmist also sounds out, saying, Our God shall come in state, our God, and shall not keep silence, a fire shall devour before Him, and a mighty tempest round about Him. [Ps. 50, 3]  Hence Zephaniah the Prophet tells it out, saying, The Great Day of the Lord is near; it is near and hasteth greatly.  The voice of the Day of the Lord is bitter: the mighty man shall be troubled there.  That Day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and gloominess, a day of cloud and whirlwind, a day of the trumpet, and of a dreadful sound. [Zeph. 14–16]  The terror then of the Strict Inquest, which Zephaniah calls ‘the Trumpet,’ blessed Job designates ‘thundering.’  Which Joel also viewing saith, Let all the inhabitants of the land be troubled; for the Day of the Lord cometh; for it is nigh at hand, a day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of cloud and whirlwind.  For the Day of the Lord is great, and very terrible, and who shall sustain it? [Joel 2, 1–3]  But how incomprehensible and unimaginable that Greatness wherewith He shall come in His Second Manifesting, in some degree we estimate aright, if we consider with heedful reflection the weighty particulars of His first Advent.  Surely that He might redeem us from death, the Lord came to die, and the impoverishment and punishments of our flesh He underwent in His own Body; Who before He came to the stock of the Cross, suffered Himself to be bound, to be spit on, to be mocked and to be beaten with blows on His cheek.  Observe to what disgraceful treatment He for our sakes consented to come, and yet, before He permitted Himself to be laid hold of, He questioned His persecutors, saying, Whom seek ye?  To Whom they thereupon gave answer, Jesus of Nazareth.  And when He said to them directly, I am He, He only uttered a voice of the mildest answer, and at once prostrated His armed persecutors to the earth.  What then shall He do when He cometh to judge the world, who by one utterance of His voice smote His enemies, even when He came to be judged?  What is that Judgment which He exercises as immortal, Who in a single utterance could not be endured when He was about to die?  Who may sustain His wrath, Whose very mildness even could not be sustained?  So then let the holy man consider it and say, And whilst we scarcely hear a little drop of His words, who shall be able to look on the thundering of His Majesty?
