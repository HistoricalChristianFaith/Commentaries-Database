What is meant in this place by the designation of “the ways” but the Lord’s modes of acting? Hence the Lord also says by the prophet, “For my ways are not as your ways.” Accordingly, in telling of the advent of the Lord, he described the ways of God in part. His method of acting by which he created us was one thing; that by which he redeemed us another. Thus of those things that touch upon the Lord’s way of acting and make light of by comparison with the final judgment, he says, “Lo, these things are spoken for part of his ways.” He also calls this “a little drop of his words.” For whatever is high, whatever is terrible within this life, these things we are brought to know by the contemplation of God, as from the vast ocean of the secrets of heaven, its refreshment wells out to us like a slight drop of the liquid element above. “And who will be able to look on the thunder of his majesty?” It is as though he expressed himself in these plain words: “If we endure the wonders of his humility and the thundering and dreadful advent of his majesty, with what courage do we meet life?”
