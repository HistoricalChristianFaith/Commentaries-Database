"And above the firmament that was over their head, as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne; and upon the likeness of the throne, a likeness as it were of the appearance of a man above."

What is designated by the throne except those angelic virtues which surpass even the angels themselves in the dignity of a higher place? For while angels are called messengers, and angels often come to announce certain things to men, thrones are nowhere read to have been sent for the ministry of a message, because the Creator of all things presides over them in a far more sublime manner. Hence the Apostle Paul, describing the orders of the heavenly hosts which he had seen when caught up to the third heaven, says: Whether thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers, all things were created through him and in him. Therefore he named thrones before those orders of angels which he recognized as being placed above them. The throne is fittingly compared to a sapphire stone, since the sapphire stone has an azure color. Therefore the heavenly virtues are designated by the sapphire stone, because these spirits, over whom almighty God presides more loftily, hold the dignity of a higher place in the heavens. Above the throne is the likeness of a man, because above those virtues which surpass even the angels themselves is the glory of our Redeemer. Therefore we must note what order is preserved. For above the living creatures is the firmament, above the firmament is the throne, above the throne a man is described to be, because above holy men still living in this corruption of the body are the angels, and above the angels are the higher angelic powers nearest to God, but above the powers nearest to God is elevated the Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus.

But if, as we have said before, by the name of the firmament the Mediator of God and men must be understood on account of the humanity He assumed, because many things are usually signified under the appellation of one name through the spirit of prophecy, a voice was made above the firmament, which sounded from heaven over the baptized Lord, saying: "You are my beloved Son, in you I am well pleased." Or as it is said through another evangelist: "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." Let us therefore inquire how the living creatures hear this voice and lower their wings. Let the prophet Habakkuk, when asked, say: "O Lord, I have heard your report, and I was afraid; I considered your works, and I trembled." But what does it mean that the Father speaks of the Son, saying: "In whom I am well pleased"? For everyone who by repenting corrects something he has done, by the very fact that he repents, indicates that he was displeased with himself, because he amends what he did. And because the almighty Father, as He could be understood by men, spoke in human fashion about sinners, saying: "It repents me that I have made man upon the earth," He was, as it were, displeased with Himself in the sinners whom He created. But in His only-begotten Son alone, our Lord Jesus Christ, He was well pleased, because it did not repent Him to have created this man among men, in whom He found no sin whatsoever, as it is said of Him through the Psalmist: "The Lord has sworn and will not repent: you are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek." Therefore in our Redeemer alone was the Father well pleased, because in Him alone He found no fault for which He might reproach Himself as if through repentance.

Therefore let the holy living creatures hear the voice above the firmament and tremble, because if He alone is without sin, in His innocence they perceive how greatly they themselves transgress daily, which they must ceaselessly bewail. Let them also consider that the very Author of life Himself did not depart from this life without the pain of suffering. And so this voice was made above the firmament, because the sentence of the almighty Father proceeded also concerning the death and resurrection of the Only-begotten. But when the voice sounds above the firmament, the living creatures stand still and lower their wings, because all the saints, when they behold the Only-begotten Himself scourged in this world, lay aside whatever presumption they have concerning their own merits. For if He who came without sin did not depart from here without scourging, how will they not be worthy of scourges who came here with sin? Therefore that firmament which is above the head of the living creatures, that is, which transcends the minds of the saints, has above it a voice, because our Redeemer bore in the flesh the sentence which He disposed with the Father from His divinity; hearing which, the righteous are terrified and lay aside all presumption concerning their own powers. For with whatever virtues life may abound, what is the life of sinners worth, if even His life, which was subject to no sin, lay under the scourge for us?

But behold, a serious question arises for us when it is said that above the firmament which was over their heads, there was as it were the appearance of a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. For if by the firmament the Lord is signified, and by the sapphire stone and the likeness of a throne those highest angelic powers are figured, how are they to be believed to be above the firmament, that is, above the Lord, when it is also immediately added: And above the likeness of the throne, a likeness as it were of the appearance of a man above? For if, as has been said, the Lord is expressed by the firmament, and again the Lord is understood as the man, by what reasoning can it be understood that He Himself is both above the throne and beneath the throne? But He of whom we speak, who by the breath of the Holy Spirit opens what is closed, Himself loosens the tight knots of this question. For the incarnate Only-begotten of the Father, through the fact that He was made man, was below the angels, as it is written of Him: You have made Him a little lower than the angels. But rising again and ascending into heaven, He presides over all the angelic powers, as it is again written of Him there: You have subjected all things under His feet. And as He Himself says: All power has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Therefore the firmament is beneath the throne, and the man is above the throne, because through the assumption of human nature He Himself was both born below the angels and exalted above the angels. And before He was exalted through the glory of the resurrection, He was above the angels by His divinity; but nevertheless, as has been said, He was made lower than the angels by His humanity, through which He was subject to death. But after He trampled death by rising again, He placed His humanity even above the majesties of the archangels. Therefore, first the throne is described as having been seen above the firmament, and afterwards the man above the throne, because the Redeemer of the human race exalted by ascending above the angels the humanity which He assumed below the angels by descending. Indeed, we say that He was made under the angels in the same way as we have heard the Apostle proclaiming that He was made under the law. Therefore, we understand the assumed humanity to be under the angels on account of that diminishment in which He deigned to appear.

For as soon as the Word was made flesh, God as man immediately possessed power over the angels. For it is written of Him before His passion: "Behold, angels came and ministered to Him." But nevertheless, so that the weakness of His humanity might be shown, it is again written of Him: "An angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him." Therefore, as evidence of both natures, angels are described as ministering to Him, and an angel as strengthening Him. For He is one in both natures, because He who existed as God before the ages was made man at the end of the ages. Yet before His passion, angels both minister to Him and an angel strengthens Him. But after His passion and resurrection, angels can minister to Him, but they can no longer strengthen Him, because, as was said before, even if the firmament first appeared beneath the throne, yet now the man is above the throne.
