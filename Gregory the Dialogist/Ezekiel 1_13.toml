It follows: "And the likeness of the living creatures, and their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps."

Fire of burning coals and of lamps is compared to the appearance of the living creatures. For whoever touches a coal is set on fire, because he who clings to a holy man receives from the constancy of seeing him, from the practice of speaking with him, and from the example of his work, so that he is kindled in the love of truth, flees the darkness of his sins, burns with desire for the light, and now burns with true love, he who before lay as dead in iniquity as he was cold. But lamps spread their light farther, and while they are in one place, they shine in another. For he who is powerful in the spirit of prophecy, in the word of teaching, and in the grace of miracles, his reputation shines far and wide like a lamp; and all who hear of his good deeds, because through these things they rise to the love of heavenly things, shine as if from the light of a lamp in that they display themselves through good works. Therefore, because holy men kindle certain ones placed near them, as if by touching them, to love of the heavenly fatherland, they are coals. But because they shine for certain ones placed far away, they become lamps for their journey, lest they fall into the darkness of sin. But between coals and lamps there is this difference: coals indeed burn, but do not expel the darkness of the place in which they lie; lamps, however, because they shine with a great light of flames, drive away the darkness spread all around.

From this matter it should be noted that there are many of the saints who are so simple and hidden, concealing themselves in lesser places under great silence, that their life can scarcely be recognized by others. What therefore are these if not coals? For although they have heat through the fervor of the spirit, nevertheless they do not have the flame of example. Nor do they overcome the darkness of sins in the hearts of others, because they entirely flee from having their life known. They are indeed kindled for themselves, but they are not a light of example for others. But those who both offer forth examples of virtues and demonstrate the light of good work through their life and word to those journeying, are rightly called lamps, because both through the heat of desire and through the flame of the word, they drive out the darkness of error from the hearts of sinners. Therefore he who lives well in secret, but profits the advancement of others not at all, is a coal. But he who, placed as an imitation of holiness, demonstrates the light of righteousness from himself to many, is a lamp, because he both burns for himself and shines for others. There follows: And this was the vision running in the midst of the living creatures, the splendor of fire, and lightning going forth from the fire.

The fire is seen running in the midst of the living creatures, because unless those winged creatures received heat from the fire of truth, they themselves would not burn in the likeness of coals and torches. For the Holy Spirit is usually signified by the name of fire. Concerning which the Lord says in the Gospel: I have come to cast fire upon the earth, and what do I desire except that it be kindled? For when a carnal mind receives the Holy Spirit, inflamed with spiritual love it laments the evil it has done. And the earth burns, when the heart of the sinner is scorched by an accusing conscience, and is consumed in the pain of repentance. Hence again it is written: Your God is a consuming fire. For since He renders the mind that He has filled clean from the rust of sins, our Creator is called both fire and consuming. Therefore the Holy Spirit is said to run in the midst of the living creatures as the splendor of fire, and lightning going forth from the fire, because filling the whole Church, He casts forth flames of love from Himself into the hearts of the elect, so that He may strike with terror in the manner of lightning, and kindle sluggish hearts to His love.

Spirit indeed is God eternal before all ages, coeternal with the Father and the Son, we must ask why He is said to run about. For everyone who runs about approaches a place where he was not, and leaves the place where he was. By what reasoning, then, shall we say that the Spirit runs about, since all things are within Him, and there is nowhere a place where He is not? As it is written: "The Spirit of the Lord has filled the whole world." And yet, when the praise of wisdom was being described, it was added: "For in her there is a spirit of understanding, a spirit unique, manifold, subtle, mobile." And shortly after: "Steadfast yet humane."

In these words again a great question arises for us: why is this spirit who fills all things said to be both mobile and stable at the same time? But if we return to the custom of human usage, we more quickly find the meaning of the speaker. For a man who runs about everywhere in the region where he is, without doubt comes upon everyone everywhere, and is suddenly found where he was not expected. Therefore the Almighty Spirit, to signify his presence everywhere, is said to be both mobile and stable at the same time. Stable, because by nature he contains all things; but he is called mobile because he meets even those who are unaware of him everywhere. Therefore holding all things he is called stable; showing himself present to all he is called mobile. Therefore the brightness of fire, and the lightning going forth from the fire, runs among the winged creatures, because the Holy Spirit is present to individuals and to all at the same time, and sets on fire those whom he touches, and illuminates those whom he sets on fire, so that after their former coldness those who have been kindled may burn, and through the fire of love which they have received may give back flames of examples. For the lightning going forth from this fire strikes torpid minds, and by striking rouses and inflames them, so that after the love of that One they may run both burning and shining together. Hence it is written elsewhere: His throne is a flame of fire, his wheels are burning fire. For those who are guardians of souls and have undertaken the burdens of feeding the flock are by no means permitted to change places. But because, placed in one location, they carry within themselves the presence of divinity and burn, the throne of God is called a flame of fire. But those who run about in preaching for love of the Lord are his wheels of burning fire, because when they run through various places out of desire for him, from which they themselves burn, they also set others on fire.

However, the running to and fro and mobility of the Spirit can be understood by the consideration of another inquiry. Indeed, in the hearts of the Saints, according to certain virtues He always remains, but according to certain others He comes as one about to depart, and withdraws as one about to return. For in faith, hope, and charity, and in other good things without which one cannot reach the heavenly homeland, such as humility, chastity, justice, and mercy, He does not abandon the hearts of the perfect. But in the virtue of prophecy, in eloquence of teaching, and in the working of miracles, He is sometimes present to His elect, and sometimes withdraws Himself. He is present so that they may be lifted up, and He withdraws Himself so that they may be humbled. He is present so that He may glorify them by the virtue shown, and He withdraws so that they may know themselves when His virtue is withdrawn. He is present so that He may show what they are through Him, and He withdraws so that He may make clear who and of what sort they remain without Him. Therefore, in those virtues without which one can by no means attain to life, the Holy Spirit remains in the hearts of His elect; hence He is rightly said to be stable. But in those things through which the virtue of holiness is shown, He is sometimes mercifully present and sometimes mercifully withdraws; hence He is rightly called mobile. Therefore the Spirit is said to run to and fro and to be mobile, because He is not continuously possessed in signs and virtues according to each one's wish. And it is well said that He runs to and fro among the holy living creatures. For running to and fro pertains to swiftness. And the Spirit runs to and fro among the perfect, because even if He has withdrawn from their heart for a moment, He returns more quickly.
