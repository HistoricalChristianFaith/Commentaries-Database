45.  Are there not angels and men, the heavens and the earth, the air and the waters of the ocean, all the winged creatures, quadrupeds, and creeping things?  And surely it is written, Which God created that they should be. [Gen.2, 3]  Whereas then there is such a multitude of things in the circle of nature, wherefore is it now said by the voice of the blessed man, He is Himself alone?  Why, it is one thing to be, and another thing to BE primarily, one thing to be subjectly to change, and another thing to BE independently of change.  For these are all of them in being, but they are not maintained in being in themselves, and except they be maintained by the hand of a governing agent, they cannot ever be.  For all things subsist in Him by Whom they were created, nor do the things that live owe their life to themselves, nor are those that are moved, but do not live, by their own caprice brought to motion.  But He moveth all things, Who quickens some with life, whilst some that are not so quickened He preserves, disposing them in a wonderful way for last and lowest being.  For all things were made out of nothing, and their being would again go on into nothing, except the Author of all things held it by the hand of governance.  All the things then that have been created, by themselves can neither subsist nor be moved, but they only so far subsist, as they have obtained that they should be, are only so far moved, as they are influenced by a secret impulse.  For see the sinner is ordained to be scourged by human accidents; the earth is parched in his toilings, the sea tossed in the shipwreck of him, the air on fire in his sweating, the heavens are darkened in floods upon him, his fellow creatures burn with fire in oppressions of him, and the angelical powers are made active in his troubling.  Are all these things which we have named being inanimate, or which we have named endued with life, put into activity by their own instincts, or rather by impulses from God?  Whatever therefore it be that is arrayed against us outwardly, in that thing That Being is to be regarded Who ordains it inwardly.  In every case then He is to be regarded as alone, Who IS primarily, Who also saith to Moses, I AM THAT I AM, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, He that IS hath sent me unto you. [Ex. 3, 14]  And so, when we are scourged by the things that we see, we ought anxiously to fear Him Whom we do not see.  And so let the holy man look down upon all that alarms him without, all that in respect of its being would go on to nothing except it were ruled, and with the eye of the mind, all else being kept back, let him see Him only in comparison with Whose Being for ourselves to be is not to be, and let him say, He only is Himself alone.
46.  Concerning Whose unchangeableness it is directly after added with propriety, No man can turn away His thought, for as He is unchangeable in Nature, so He is unchangeable in Will.  For ‘none turneth away His thought,’ in that no man has power to resist His secret judgments.  Since though there have been persons who might seem to ‘have turned away His thought,’ yet His interior thought was this, that they should by praying have power to avert His sentence, and that they should obtain from Him what to effect with Him.  So let him say, and no man turneth away His thought, in that His judgments once fixed can never be altered.  Whence it is written, He hath made a decree which shall not pass. [Ps. 148, 6]  And again, Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not pass away. [Mark 13, 31]  And again, For My thoughts are not as your thoughts, neither are your ways as My ways. [Is. 55, 8]  And so whenever outwardly the sentence appears to be altered, inwardly the counsel is not altered, in that in relation to each particular thing that is unalterably established within, whatever is done alterably without.  It goes on;
And what His soul desireth, even that He doeth.
47.  Whereas God is exterior to all bodies, interior to all minds, that identical power of His, whereby He penetrates all things, and regulates all things, is called His ‘soul.’  Whose will not even those things oppose, which appear to be done contrary to His will, seeing that even what He does not order, to this end He sometimes suffers to be done, that so through this thing that which He does order may be the more surely done.  For the will of the Apostate Angel is bad, yet by God it is wonderfully ordered, so that even his very artifices as well should promote the welfare of the good, whom they purify whilst they try.  So then ‘whatever His soul desireth, that He doeth,’ that from the same source as well He might fulfil His will, whence there seemed to be a resisting of His will.  Therefore let the holy man be filled with alarm, and contemplating the weight of that great Majesty, let him find himself out to be weak.
48.  But it is well to put the question amidst these words, and to say, ‘O blessed Job, wherefore in the midst of such scourges dost thou dread still further afflictions?’  Thou art already encompassed with sorrows, by innumerable calamities thou art already straitly beset.  Misfortune is to be apprehended, which is not yet entered upon.  Thou being in the midst of such great sorrow, what dost thou apprehend?  But mark how the holy man satisfying our questioning.
