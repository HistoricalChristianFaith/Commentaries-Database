Another said: I have married a wife, and therefore I cannot come. What is understood by a wife except the pleasure of the flesh? For although marriage is good, and established by divine providence for the propagation of offspring, nevertheless some seek through it not the fruitfulness of children, but the desires of pleasure, and therefore through a just thing an unjust thing can not inappropriately be signified. Therefore the supreme father of the household invites you to the supper of the eternal banquet; but while one is given to avarice, another to curiosity, another to the pleasure of the flesh, indeed all the reprobate together make excuses. While earthly care occupies this one, shrewd thinking about another's affairs devastates that one, carnal pleasure also defiles the mind of yet another, and each fastidious person does not hasten to the feast of eternal life.
