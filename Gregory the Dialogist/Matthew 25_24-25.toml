The servant, however, who refused to work with his talent, returns to his master with words of excuse, saying: "Lord, I know that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and being afraid, I went away and hid your talent in the ground; behold, you have what is yours." It should be noted that the useless servant calls his master hard, yet pretends not to serve him for gain, and says he was afraid to spend the talent for profit, when he should have feared only this: that he might return it to his master without profit. For there are many within the holy Church, whose image this servant represents, who fear to undertake the ways of a better life, and yet do not fear to lie in the sloth of their torpor; and when they consider themselves sinners, they tremble to seize upon the ways of holiness, yet do not dread remaining in their iniquities. Peter, while still placed in weakness, well represents the likeness of these when, upon seeing the miracle of the fish, he said: "Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man." On the contrary, if you consider yourself a sinner, you ought not to repel the Lord from yourself. But those who refuse to grasp the ways of a better habit and the citadel of a more upright life because they perceive themselves to be weak, as it were both confess themselves sinners and repel the Lord, and flee from Him whom they ought to have sanctified in themselves; and as if having no counsel in their confusion, they die while fearing life.
