16.  As though he expressed himself in plain words; ‘He only truly terrifies the hearts of mortals, who by the power of His Divine nature truly possesses these.’  For what terror does the power of man infuse, which knows not when it may lack the light of that power?  Now it is rightly said, He maketh peace in His high places.  Because there are many things at variance with themselves below, but they run answerably to the harmonious fulness of things above, and by the causing of the interior peace it is brought to pass, that oftentimes the things that are without are ordered without peace.  Thus the good, Almighty God is advancing to merit, when He permits the bad to rage against their life; and things above are made to fit together in harmony, whilst those below are thrown into confusion; because in the heavenly world He joins His Elect to the choirs of the Angels by the same means, whereby in the earthly and lowest scene of things, He bears the practices of lost sinners opposing His behests.
17.  But herein it is of interest to us to enquire, if the highest peace is maintained ‘in the high places,’ what that is which is said to Daniel by the Angel, I am come for thy words; but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me. [Dan. 10, 13]  And a little afterward; And now will I return to fight with the prince of the Persians.  For when I was going forth there appeared the prince of the Greeks coming. [v. 20]  Whom else then but Angels does he call the ‘Princes’ of the nations, that could have had the power to resist him as he went forth?  Accordingly what peace can there be ‘in the high places,’ if even among the Angelical spirits themselves also there is a conflict of warring carried on, who are always standing present to the view of Truth?  But because there are fixed charges of the Angels set to superintend the regulating of the several particular nations, when the practices of the subject peoples deserve the assistance of the presiding spirits against one another, the spirits themselves that are set in charge are said to come against one another.  Thus the Angel that spake to Daniel is known to have been appointed over the captives of the Israelitish People established in Persia, but Michael is ascertained to be the ruler of those who remained in the land of Judaea from among the same people.  And hence it is said a little afterwards to Daniel by this same Angel; And there is none that holdeth with me in these things, but Michael, your prince. [v. 21]  Concerning whom he says this too which we have before said, but, to, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me.  Who whereas he is never said ‘to be with,’ but to ‘come to help’ is plainly seen to be set over that people which was held captive in another part.  What then is it for the Angel to say, I am come for thy words, but the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me, but to tell his doings to those under him?  As if he said in plain words; ‘The claims [merita] of thy prayers indeed demand that the Israelitish People should be loosed from the yoke of their captivity, but there is still in that same people that which must be purged by the dominion of the Persians; so that touching the liberation of that people the prince of Persia should by rights withstand me, though to thy prayers the tears of those too who were left in Judaea come in aid.’  Whence he subjoins that too which we said; But, lo, Michael, your prince, came to help me.  And when he goes forth in order to fight against the prince of the Persians, there appeareth to him the prince of the Greeks coming towards him.  By which circumstance it is implied that against the Greeks too Judaea had been guilty of somewhat, on account of whom without a doubt it was that he withstood the rescuing of her.  So the Angel hears effectually the prayers of the Prophet, but the prince of Persia withstands, because though the life of the righteous one making supplication already claims the rescue of the People, yet the life of that same People still withstands, that whereas those that had been brought into captivity were not yet completely purified, Persia should rightfully have the dominion over them still.  Michael gives aid, but the prince of Greece comes to battle, because that lengthened captivity of the People suffering oppression might indeed have merited pardon, but to the benefit of their liberation that also stood opposed, which they had done wrong against the Greeks.  Therefore it is rightly said that the Angels come against each other, because the claims of the nations under them are reciprocally at odds with one another.  For the lofty Spirits that are princes to those nations never fight in behalf of those that act unjustly, but justly judge and try their deeds.  And when either the guilt or guiltlessness of each separate nation is brought into the debate of the Court Above, the ruling Spirit of that nation is said to have won in the conflict or not to have won; the one identical victory of all of whom, however, is the Supreme Will of their Maker above them, which Will whilst they ever have before their eyes, what they have not the power they have not the mind to obtain.  Therefore it is well said, Who maketh peace in His high places.
