(28. Moral. sup. Job 38:7.) At the same time they also give praises because their voices of gladness accord well with our redemption, and while they behold our acceptance, they rejoice also that their number is completed.

Consider therefore, brothers, what is cheaper when purchased, what is more precious when possessed. But perhaps not even a cup of cold water is available to be offered to one in need; even then the divine word promises us security. For when the Redeemer was born, the citizens of heaven were revealed, who cried out: Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good will. For before the eyes of God the hand is never empty of a gift, if the treasury of the heart has been filled with good will. Hence the Psalmist says: In me, O God, are your vows which I shall pay, praises to you. As if he were saying openly: Even if outwardly I do not have gifts to offer, yet within myself I find what I may place upon the altar of your praise, because you who are not fed by our giving are better pleased by the offering of the heart. For nothing richer than good will is offered to God. But good will is to fear the adversities of another as our own, to rejoice in the prosperity of our neighbor as in our own advancement, to consider the losses of others as our own, to reckon the gains of others as our own, to love a friend not for the sake of the world but for the sake of God, to tolerate even an enemy by loving him, to do to no one what you do not wish to suffer, to deny to no one what you justly desire to be rendered to yourself, not only to assist the needs of your neighbor according to your abilities, but to wish to help even beyond your abilities. What then is richer than this holocaust, when through what the soul sacrifices to God on the altar of the heart, it slays itself?
