Our Lord and Redeemer speaks through His Gospel sometimes in words, sometimes in deeds; sometimes one thing in words and another in deeds; but sometimes the same thing in words as in deeds. For you have heard two things from the Gospel, brothers: the unfruitful fig tree and the bent woman, and compassion was bestowed upon both. The one He told through a parable, the other He performed through an actual deed. But the unfruitful fig tree signifies the same thing as the bent woman, and the fig tree that was spared signifies the same as the woman made upright. The lord of the vineyard came to the fig tree three times and found no fruit at all, and the woman who was made upright had been bent for eighteen years. What is signified by this number of eighteen years is the same as what is conveyed by the lord of the vineyard coming to the unfruitful fig tree three times. Since, therefore, by setting forth these things in advance we have touched upon the whole summary, let us now discuss each point in order through the reading.

Someone had a fig tree planted in his vineyard; and he came seeking fruit on it, and found none. What does the fig tree designate, if not human nature? What does the bent woman signify and declare, if not the same nature? Which was both well planted like the fig tree, and well made like the woman; but having fallen into fault by its own will, it preserves neither the fruit of good work nor the state of uprightness. For falling into sin by its own will, because it refused to bear the fruit of obedience, it lost the state of uprightness. Created in the likeness of God, while it did not persist in its dignity, it scorned to preserve what it had been when planted or created.
