6.  What is ‘the root’ of the righteous, but holy preaching, since it is that he springs out of, and that he holds on in? and what is meant by the name of ‘the earth’ or of ‘dust,’ but the sinner? to whom it is said by the voice of the Creator, Earth thou art, and unto earth shalt thou return [m] [Gen. 3, 19].  Or, indeed, as our Translation reads, Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return. [so V.]  Thus ‘the root of the righteous waxes old in the earth, and his stock dies in the dust,’ in that in the hearts of the wicked his preaching is despised, and thought dried of all goodness, and ‘his stock dies in the dust,’ in that amidst the hands of the persecutors his body is bereft of life; for according to the words of Wisdom, In the sight of the unwise they seemed to die, and their departure is taken for misery. [Wisd. 3, 2]  But this one, whose ‘root waxed old in the earth, and whose trunk died in the dust,’ through the smell of water, buddeth; in that through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, by the example of his conduct he causes the budding of virtue in the hearts of the Elect.  For by the designation of water sometimes the watering of the Holy Spirit is used to be understood, as where it is written, If any man thirst, let him come unto Me, and drink. [John 7, 37]  But whosoever drinketh of the water that shall give him, shall never thirst. [John 4, 14]  It follows; And bring forth foliage as when it was first planted.  To ‘bring forth foliage on the stock being cut down’ is, when the just man is put an end to in the body, by the mere example of his suffering to raise up the hearts of many, and out of a right faith to show forth the greenness of truth.  And it is well said, As when it was first planted.  All that is done by the righteous here is a second planting; in that clearly the first planting does not consist in the practice of the good, but in the foreknowledge of the Creator; and whereas all that the Elect do, as it is first seen and settled interiorly, so afterwards is executed outwardly.
