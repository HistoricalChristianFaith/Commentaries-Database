"And you shall set the siege against it, and you shall build fortifications, and you shall heap up a mound, and you shall set camps against it, and place battering rams around it."

Therefore the teacher must vigilantly make known to the progressing soul what temptations follow it, so that it may be able to prepare itself cautiously against the snares of the malignant spirit. Hence it is well that now, after the city of Jerusalem has been described on the brick, it is said to the prophet: "And you shall set the siege against it, and you shall build fortifications, and you shall heap up a mound." For when the vision of peace is already being described, it is necessary that the wars of temptations be announced to it. For in order that it may be able to reach those eternal joys of peace, it must without doubt endure here many struggles of tribulations. Of which it is well said: "You shall set the siege against it." For the preacher sets a siege against the soul to be instructed when by forewarning he indicates in what ways vices oppose themselves to virtues, how lust strikes chastity, how anger disturbs the tranquility of the mind, how much foolish joy dissolves the vigor of the mind, how talkativeness destroys the fortification of the heart, how envy kills charity, how pride undermines the citadel of humility, how deceit, when it has corrupted truth in speech, corrupts it also in understanding, so that he who was unwilling to speak the truth that he understood no longer even understands what he might speak. Therefore the siege is set by the preacher when through the words of holy admonition it is shown which vices lie in wait against each and every virtue, and in what ways. And the preacher builds fortifications against the Jerusalem which he describes on the brick when he demonstrates how fortified all evils come against the mind, so that vices hide themselves under the appearance of virtues; so that, as we have often already said, immoderate anger may seek to appear as justice, and relaxation of discipline may wish to appear as gentleness, and stinginess may call itself frugality, and disordered pouring out of resources may call itself benevolence. For there are, as it were, fortifications built against the mind when vices grow up under the appearance of virtues and show themselves on high through an image, though they always lie low through their action.

"You shall also heap up a mound." For when the mind has begun to desire heavenly things, malignant spirits through their temptations heap up earthly thoughts all the more against it. Therefore the prophet heaps up a mound when the holy preacher announces to good minds how earthly desires are accustomed to creep in.

"And you shall set camps against it, and place battering rams round about." The teacher sets camps against the soul, as it were, when he points out the ambushes of malignant spirits gathered and united together against it, so that they may sometimes tempt not only from one vice, but from vices joined together at once.

For there are certain vices that are closely related to one another by a kind of kinship, such as dissipation of spirit, appetite for gluttony, and the uncleanness of lust, as well as excessive talking, deceit, and perjury. For from dissipation of spirit the mind is swept away to the gorging of the belly, and when the belly is distended with food, the flesh is drawn captive to lust through pride. And again from excessive talking deceit is generated, because it is very difficult for one who speaks much not also to lie; and often a lie is even covered by perjury, so that it may be concealed before human judgments. Pride also can in no way exist without envy and vainglory. For every proud person envies others the honor that he himself seeks. And when he has perhaps obtained it, he is raised up in the elation of temporal glory, and what he sees others were unable to attain, he rejoices through vainglory to possess above all others.

It should also be known that often certain vices do not come to the mind simultaneously, but are substituted one for another, so that one succeeds another in temptation. And one comes against the face, while another insinuates itself into temptation from the side, so that while one is being resisted, the mind, deceived, is captured by the other. For those very vices which we mentioned above often stealthily substitute themselves one for another, just as sometimes when we strive to conquer anger within ourselves, gentleness occupies the mind more than necessary, so that it fails to present the severity that ought to be shown to sinners. Often indeed, when incautious gentleness within us displeases us, zeal draws itself into fury and carries the captive soul beyond the limit of patience. Therefore, because vices come against the mind mixed together and united at once, rightly in the mouth of the preacher siege camps are set against the Jerusalem that has been described. And because sometimes individual vices strike the sense from here and there, battering rams are arranged in a circle. Therefore the preacher sets battering rams in a circle when he cautiously declares how softly lust strikes, how harshly impatience kills, how laboriously avarice inflames and destroys, how proudly pride extinguishes. Thus to place battering rams in a circle is to show by preaching which blades of the vices are accustomed to strike the soul from every side.
