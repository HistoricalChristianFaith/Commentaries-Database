“For he has said, ‘A man will not please God even though he runs with him.’ ” But that he never said so, everyone acknowledges who reads the words of blessed Job. Is it not a wonder that he, who speaks for the sole purpose of proudly setting himself off, invents something to find fault within another person? How can he adhere to truth in his words of reproof, whom pride of mind within removes far away from the same truth? - "Morals on the Book of Job 24.43"
