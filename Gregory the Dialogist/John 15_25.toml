It is one thing not to do good, another to hate the teacher of goodness since there is a difference between sudden and deliberate sins. Our state generally is that we love what is good but from infirmity cannot perform it. But to sin on purpose means not doing or desiring what is good. As, then, it is sometimes a heavier offense to love sin than to do it, so is it more wicked to hate justice than not to do it. There are some in the church who not only do not do what is good but even persecute it and hate in others what they neglect to do themselves. The sin of these people is not that of infirmity or ignorance but deliberate, willful sin.
