But since you have now entered the house of the wedding, that is, the holy Church, by the Lord's generosity, carefully observe, brothers, lest the king upon entering find fault with something in the attire of your mind. For with great fear of heart we must consider what is immediately added: "The king entered to see those reclining at table, and he saw there a man not clothed in a wedding garment." What, dearest brothers, do we think is expressed by the wedding garment? For if we say the wedding garment is baptism or faith, who entered this wedding without baptism and faith? For by that very fact he is outside, because he has not yet believed. What then should we understand the wedding garment to be, except charity? For he enters the wedding, but does not enter with a wedding garment, who standing in the holy Church has faith but does not have charity. For rightly is charity called the wedding garment, because our Creator had this in himself when he came to the wedding of uniting the Church to himself. For it was accomplished solely by the love of God that his only-begotten Son united the minds of chosen people to himself. Hence John also says: "For God so loved the world that he gave his only-begotten Son for us." He therefore who came to humanity through charity made known that same charity to be the wedding garment. Therefore everyone among you who, being placed in the Church, has believed in God has already entered the wedding; but he does not come with a wedding garment if he does not preserve the grace of charity. And certainly, brothers, if anyone were invited to a carnal wedding, he would change his garment, he would show by the very beauty of his attire that he rejoices with the bridegroom and bride, and he would be ashamed to appear in despised garments among those rejoicing and celebrating the feast. We come to the wedding of God, and we neglect to change the garment of our heart. The angels rejoice together when the elect are taken up to heaven. With what mind, then, do we behold these spiritual festivities, we who do not have the wedding garment, that is, charity, which alone presents us as beautiful?

It should be known that just as a garment is woven on two beams, namely the upper and the lower, so charity is held in two commandments, that is, in the love of God and of neighbor. For it is written: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength; and your neighbor as yourself." In this matter it should be noted that in the love of neighbor a measure of love is established, when it is said: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself"; but the love of God is constrained by no measure, when it is said: "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your strength." For one is not commanded how much to love, but from how much, when it is said: "With all," because he truly loves God who leaves nothing of himself for himself.

Therefore whoever takes care to have a wedding garment at the wedding must keep these two commandments of charity. For this is why, in the prophet Ezekiel, the vestibule of the gate of that city situated on the mountain is measured at two cubits, because surely the entrance to the heavenly city is not opened to us if in this Church, which is called a vestibule because it is still outside, the love of God and neighbor is not maintained. This is why scarlet twice-dyed is commanded to be woven into the curtains of the tabernacle. You are, brothers, you are the curtains of the tabernacle, who veil heavenly secrets in your hearts through faith. But twice-dyed scarlet must be in the curtains of the tabernacle. For scarlet has the appearance of fire. And what is charity, if not fire? But this charity must be twice-dyed, so that it may be dyed through the love of God, and dyed through the love of neighbor. For he who so loves God that through contemplation of Him he neglects his neighbor, is indeed scarlet, but not twice-dyed. Again, he who so loves his neighbor that nevertheless he abandons the contemplation of God through love of him, is scarlet, but not twice-dyed. Therefore, that your charity may be able to be twice-dyed scarlet, let it kindle itself both to the love of God and to the love of neighbor, so that it neither abandons the contemplation of God out of compassion for neighbor, nor, clinging to the contemplation of God more than it ought, casts aside compassion for neighbor. And so let every person living among people so yearn for Him whom he desires, that nevertheless he does not abandon the one with whom he was running; and let him so bring help to this one, that he in no way grows sluggish toward Him to whom he was hastening.

It must also be known that this love of neighbor is subdivided into two precepts, as a certain wise man says: "See that you do not do to another what you hate to have done to you." And Truth Himself preaches through Himself, saying: "What you wish men to do to you, do the same to them." For if we both give to others what we rightly wish to be rendered to us, and we ourselves avoid doing to others what we do not wish done to us, we preserve the laws of charity unharmed.

But let no one, when he loves someone, think that he immediately has charity, unless he first examines the very strength of his love. For if anyone loves someone, but does not love him for the sake of God, he does not have charity, but thinks he has it. True charity, however, is when a friend is loved in God, and an enemy is loved for the sake of God. For he loves those whom he loves for the sake of God, who already knows how to love even those by whom he is not loved. For charity is usually proven only through the adversity of hatred. Hence the Lord Himself says: "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you." Therefore, he loves securely who loves for the sake of God the one by whom he understands he is not loved. These things are great, these things are lofty, and difficult for many to practice, but nevertheless this is the wedding garment.

Whoever does not have this garment while reclining at the wedding feast, let him now anxiously fear when the king enters, lest he be cast outside. For behold it is said: "The king entered the wedding feast to see those reclining at table, and he saw there a man not clothed with a wedding garment." We are the ones, dearest brothers, who recline at the wedding feast of the Word, who already have faith in the Church, who are fed by the banquets of Sacred Scripture, who rejoice that the Church is joined to God. Consider, I ask, whether you have come to this wedding feast with a wedding garment; examine your thoughts with anxious inquiry. Weigh your hearts concerning each matter: whether you now hold hatred against no one, whether you are not inflamed by any torch of envy against another's good fortune, whether you do not hasten to harm anyone through hidden malice.
