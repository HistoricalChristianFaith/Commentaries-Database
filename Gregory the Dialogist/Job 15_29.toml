53.  That which is here expressed, He shall not be inhabited, I have found in some copies, He shall not be enriched; but the sense is not at variance, though the phraseology is at variance.  For he is ‘enriched’ with virtuous attainments whose mind is ‘inhabited’ by Almighty God.  But because the thought of the proud man is not ‘inhabited’ by the grace of his Maker, hereby surely he is not ‘enriched’ with virtues.  On this account then that he is empty within, let it be said, He shall not be inhabited.  But in respect to that which is swollen up without, being of a transitory nature, it is rightly added, Nor shall his substance continue.  As though it were said in plain speech, ‘This which he seems to have outwardly passes away, and what was not capable of passing away, he has not within.’  And hence it is fitly subjoined, Neither shall he send his root into the earth.  Which if we take as spoken of this earth, doubtless it is plain, that the tree which has no root in the earth, is brought to the ground on being shaken by the very slightest gales of wind; and every proud man while he is ‘strengthened against the Almighty Lord,’ while he ‘runs with erected neck,’ and is ‘uplifted with a stout neck against his Maker,’ is seen to stand like a tree; but his standing is without root, in that as it were at a light breath, so at the stirring of the secret sentence, his life is rooted up.  But if in this passage we take ‘the earth’ for the recompensing of the Eternal Country, concerning which the Prophet saith, My portion is in the land of the living [Ps. 142, 5], this wicked man does not ‘send forth his root in the earth,’ in that he never plants the thoughts of his heart into the desire of the eternal life.  For what the root is to the tree, the same is the thought of his own heart to each one of mankind; for in the case of that which is seen outwardly, there is a holding by that which is not seen outwardly [al. ‘which (being) within is not seen.’].  And hence it is said by the Prophet, Shall again take root downwardly, and bear fruit upwards. [Is. 37, 31]  For when we stretch our thought in sympathizing with a poor neighbour; ‘we as it were send a root downwards, that we may bear the fruit of recompense above.'
