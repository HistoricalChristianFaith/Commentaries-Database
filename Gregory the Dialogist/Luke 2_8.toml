But what does it mean that the angel appears to shepherds keeping watch, and the glory of God shines around them, except that they deserve above others to see sublime things, who know how to preside over their faithful flocks with care? And while they themselves watch piously over their flock, divine grace flashes upon them more abundantly.

But we must ask why, when the Redeemer was born, an angel appeared to the shepherds in Judea, while a star, not an angel, led the Magi from the East to worship him. The reason is that for the Jews, as those who use reason, a rational creature—that is, an angel—was the proper herald; but the Gentiles, because they did not know how to use reason, were led to know the Lord not through a voice but through signs. Hence Paul also says: Prophecies were given to believers, not to unbelievers; but signs to unbelievers, not to believers; because prophecies were given to the former as believers, not unbelievers, and signs to the latter as unbelievers, not believers.
