If, therefore, the preacher freed his soul because he warned the just man not to sin, when the just man has fallen into sin while the preacher remained silent, the preacher is held guilty because he was silent. But who among us, I ask, is sufficient for these things, not only to zealously rebuke sinners, but also to watch over the just lest they fall? For we, conscious of our own weakness, when we behold just men, do not presume to admonish them to hold to the way of justice, which we see they already hold; and yet it is the duty of a preacher to admonish even the just. Hence the distinguished preacher said: I am a debtor both to the wise and to the unwise.

But meanwhile, while I speak, I want to turn my eyes away from myself, and behold, again the divine word drives me back upon myself, that I may see my own negligence and fear that these things I hear are spoken to me. For as I said above, whose heart, scattered among innumerable cares, can gather itself back to itself? For when am I able both to attend carefully to all things around me and to behold myself with a unified mind? When am I able to correct the wickedness of the wicked by pursuing them, to guard the actions of the good by praising and admonishing them, to show terror to some and gentleness to others? When am I able both to think about what is necessary for the brothers and to bear anxiety for the watches of the city against hostile swords, to take care lest citizens perish from a sudden attack, and amid all these things to devote myself fully and effectively to the word of exhortation for the custody of souls? For to speak about God belongs to a mind that is very quiet and free. For then the tongue is rightly directed in speech when the mind has rested securely in tranquility, because agitated water does not return the image of one looking into it, but the face of one gazing is seen in it only when it is not moving. What exhortation, then, dearest brothers, can your watchman offer you, whom the confusion of so many things disturbs? Certainly the prophet of whom we speak, seeing the temple in his final revelation, narrates among other things what he beheld in that same temple, saying: "Earth up to the windows, and the windows were closed." The apostle Paul also says: "For the temple of God is holy, which you are." Now in this temple the windows are the priests and watchmen, who pour forth the light of holy preaching among the faithful people. But when earth reaches up to the windows, the windows are closed, because when earthly thought grows up in the hearts of priests, the windows do not pour forth light, because the priests fall silent from the office of preaching.

There is also another thing very grave in the order of priests, because they are not able to remain fixed in their own meditation like those who lead a quiet and secluded life. For these, as we said above, who are far from a position of governance, are able both to wash the stains of their sins with weeping and after weeping to persist in the same sorrow of mind, just as it is written of a certain good woman who had prayed at the tabernacle and did not change her mind from its purpose after the grace of compunction, when it says: "And her countenance was no longer changed in various ways." In this we must consider that if a woman who was seeking a son lamented thus, how ought a soul that seeks God to lament? But a priest, even after compunction and tears, is compelled to learn whatever needs of his children there are, and to hear patiently those things from which his mind shrinks, and after sighs for heavenly things to bear the burdens of any carnal men whatsoever, and often to pour out his heart into various states with those who come upon him. For sometimes he rejoices over spiritual gains, but when someone grieving comes upon him, unless he takes that person's grief into himself, he is not compassionate toward his tribulation. And sometimes he mourns over the loss of souls, and suddenly there come upon him those who are rejoicing over certain prosperities of theirs; if the priest does not rejoice together with their joy, he is believed to love less those children in whose joy he does not exult, especially since Paul says: "Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep."

I see nothing, therefore, so burdensome to the order of priests as to bend the rigor of the mind through compassion, and to change one's disposition according to the persons who come before them; and yet this is greatly necessary. For when a sinner is brought back to the grace of good works through his preaching, what if the preacher himself appears ungracious? Hence through this same prophet it is said in the latter part: "And when the priests minister within, they shall not use woolen garments." Concerning which it is added: "And when they go out to the outer court to the people, they shall put off their garments in which they had ministered, and lay them up in the treasury of the sanctuary." Woolen garments are indeed coarser. But when the priest approaches the sacred ministry, when he enters within through compunction, it is necessary that he be clothed as if with a linen garment of more refined understanding. But when he goes out to the people, he ought to put away the garments in which he had ministered within, and appear before the people clothed in other garments, because if he holds himself in the rigor of his compunction, if he persists in the grief he had at the time of prayer, he does not allow himself to receive words about external matters. And what shall the flock do about necessary things, if the Pastor refuses to hear and consider even what the present time demands? Therefore let the priest going out before the people put on coarser garments, so that he may dispose the habit of his mind for the benefit of his children even to tolerating earthly matters. Consider, I ask you, dearest brothers, how great a labor it is for the watchman both to stretch his heart toward sublime things, and suddenly to call it back to the lowest things, and to refine his soul in the sublimity of intimate knowledge, and on account of the external concerns of his neighbors, so to speak, to suddenly become thick in thought.

It is therefore not now necessary for me to expound the words of the prophet, but to bewail my own misery before you. Wherefore I ask that your prayer may make me such that I may be able to profit both myself and you. He who out of His own loving-kindness deigned to become weak for us is able to grant these things to me, unworthy and weak, through your intercession. For the power and wisdom of God, who took upon Himself our weakness in order to strengthen us by His own strength, is Jesus Christ our Lord, who lives and reigns with God the Father in the unity of the Holy Spirit, through all ages of ages. Amen.
