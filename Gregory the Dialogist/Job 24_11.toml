67.  All those that persecute Holy Church, what else do they but ‘tread the winepress?’  Which is allowed to be by the Divine appointment, that the clusters of souls may flow out into spiritual wine, and being divested of the corruptible flesh run into the heavenly realms as into a receptacle.  For whilst the unrighteous bear down the righteous, they as it were put clusters of the grape beneath their feet.  And the clusters being squeezed run over for the fulness of the heavenly feast, which were before as if hanging in the freedom of this air.  Thus David the Prophet, regarding the chastening of Holy Church [b], writes the Psalm ‘for the winepresses.’  Now all that bear hard upon the life of the faithful, tread and thirst, in that by doing things that are cruel they are rendered the more savage; being blinded by just deserts of their ungodliness, they go about to do things more grievous the more they have already done grievous things.  But Heretics, when they have not themselves the power of persecuting, stir up the men of this world that have power, and incline their minds for the exercising persecution, and inflame them with what persuasions they are able.  And when they see these pursuing cruel measures against the lives of the Catholics, they as it were rest in the very fervour of the sun.  Therefore it is well said now, They rest at mid-day amidst the heaps of those that thirst with the winepresses being trodden, in that they join the multitude of those whom they see already employed in hard measures and still thirsting after harder ones.  And whilst the fervour of these satisfies their desires, they rest in the deeds of such as in the mid-day.
