For as long as we live in this life, what else do we do against malignant spirits but stand in battle array? As we have said before, the mind of a teacher is perhaps struck by some pride. But whether lest he himself perish, or lest through his example he drag others to perdition, he vigilantly and swiftly looks around himself, he gnaws at himself in his thoughts; bringing the life of his hearers to memory, he humbles himself, and in whatever ways he is able he acts lest pride rule in his mind, lest it dominate in his work. For it is written: The beginning of all sin is pride. What then will be the fruit of good work before the eyes of God, if it has rotted from the root of pride? Often, as has been said, his mind is tempted by anger; but more quickly he collects himself by looking around at himself, and pressing himself down with the weight of discipline he acts lest the motion of his mind pass into speech, lest it burst forth in voice. And it happens that the anger of a disturbed mind, where it arises through negligence, there being suffocated by judgment it dies. From this it is brought about that from conceived fault the mind brings forth virtue, because even if it was unwilling to guard itself strongly lest it rise to motion, nevertheless it strongly conquered itself in the commotion.
