To whom it is said that they have Moses and the prophets. But he says: "They will not believe, unless someone rises from the dead." To whom it is immediately answered: "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe even if someone rises from the dead." Certainly the Truth says of Moses: "If you believed Moses, you would certainly believe me also. For he wrote of me." Therefore what is said through Abraham's response is fulfilled. For the Lord rose from the dead, but that Jewish people, because they were unwilling to believe Moses, also scorned to believe him who rose from the dead. And since they scorned to understand the words of Moses spiritually, they did not come to him of whom Moses had spoken.

But when the rich man asked that Lazarus be sent, Abraham immediately answered: "They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." But he who had despised the words of God thought that his followers could not hear these things.
