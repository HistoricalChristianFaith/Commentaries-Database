Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east.

The man is described as having a measuring reed in his hand. He came to the gate that looked toward the way of the East. Who else is signified by the name of this gate, except our Lord and Redeemer himself, who was made for us the door of the heavenly kingdom? As he himself says: No one comes to the Father, except through me. But since we have said that the same man clothed in linen held the figure of the Lord, we must ask by what reasoning it is fitting that the same Lord can be designated both by the man and by the gate, when the man comes to the gate? Does he come to himself? Or is it so, because in the Gospel he himself testifies, saying: He who does not enter by the door into the sheepfold of the sheep, but climbs up another way, that one is a thief and a robber. But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. And a little later he says: I am the door. And again he adds: I am the good shepherd. If therefore the shepherd enters by the door, and he himself is the door, he the shepherd, he without doubt enters through himself. Behold, while we desire to unravel the meaning of Ezekiel, we also bind a question from the Gospel. We must therefore ask how he both enters and enters through himself. For our Lord and Redeemer, with the holy Church which he redeemed, is one substance according to the flesh, as Paul attests who says: I fill up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the Church. Of this head the body is the Church, and of this body the head is Christ. Concerning its head the body, that is the holy Church, exults, when it says through the Psalmist: But now he has exalted my head above my enemies. For because she herself is also to be exalted at some time, she now rejoices that her head is exalted above her enemies in heaven. Therefore when all the elect arrive at life, because his members enter through him to him, he enters through himself to himself. For he himself is in his members who enters, he himself is the head to which the entering members arrive. The prophet Ezekiel suggests this in many ways, who says that the man came to the gate, and shows what that same gate is, saying: Which looked toward the way of the East. For he himself is the way for us, who said: I am the way, the truth and the life. He is also the Eastern way, of whom it is written: Behold the man, the Rising is his name. Therefore the gate looks toward the Eastern way, because it signifies him who made for us the journey to the rising of the light.

The name of gate can also be understood as each preacher, because whoever opens for us the door of the heavenly kingdom by his mouth is a gate. Hence twelve gates are described both in John's Apocalypse and in the final vision of this prophet. The name of gate can also not unsuitably be understood as knowledge of Sacred Scripture, which, while it opens understanding for us, spreads wide the door of the heavenly kingdom. We can also take the name of gate as faith, which we touch first in order to enter the buildings of the virtues.

And went up the stairs thereof.

For what are the steps of this gate but the merits of virtues? For whether in the knowledge of the Mediator of God and men, the man Jesus Christ, or in the knowledge of divine eloquence, or in that very faith which we have received from Him, we arrive at higher advancements by certain steps. For no one suddenly becomes supreme, but in good conduct everyone begins from the least things in order to arrive at great things. Concerning these steps it is said through the Psalmist: "God shall be known in her steps when He shall receive her." For when the Lord receives holy Church, He is known in her steps, because His glory is declared through her advancements. For as much as holy Church has advanced by ascending, so much does God become known to men from her virtues. Concerning these steps blessed Job also speaks, saying: "Through each of my steps I will proclaim Him." For he proclaims the Almighty Lord through each of his steps, who through the advancements of virtues which he receives always renders to Him the praise of His loving-kindness. If there were not certain steps in the ascent of the heart, the Psalmist would not say: "They shall walk from virtue to virtue."

Nor is it surprising if there are steps from virtue to virtue, since each virtue is increased as if by certain steps, and thus is brought to the highest point through growth in merits. For the beginnings of virtue are one thing, progress another, perfection another. For if faith itself were not led to its perfection by certain steps, the holy apostles would never have said: "Increase our faith." And a certain man came to Jesus who wished his son to be healed, but when asked whether he believed, he answered: "I believe, Lord, help my unbelief." Consider, I ask, what is said. If he believed, why did he speak of unbelief? But if he knew himself to have unbelief, how did he believe? But because through the hidden inspiration of grace faith grows by the steps of its merits, at one and the same time he who had not yet perfectly believed both believed and was unbelieving.

The Lord describes these steps under the name of harvest, saying: "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed into the ground, and should sleep, and rise night and day, and the seed should spring and grow up, while he knows not how. For the earth brings forth fruit of itself: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. And when the fruit has come forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest time has come." A man casts seed into the ground when he plants a good intention in his heart. And after he has cast the seed, he sleeps, because he rests in the hope of good work. But he rises night and day, because he advances through adversity and prosperity. And the seed sprouts and grows while he knows not, because even when he is not yet able to measure his growth, the virtue once conceived is led toward advancement. And the earth brings forth fruit of itself, because, with grace going before it, the mind of man rises spontaneously to the fruit of good work. But this same earth first produces the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. For to produce the blade is to still have the tenderness of a good beginning. But the blade reaches the ear when the virtue conceived in the soul draws itself forward to the advancement of good work. And it bears full grain in the ear when virtue now advances so greatly that it can become robust and perfect work. But when the fruit has come forth, immediately he puts in the sickle, because the harvest time has come. For Almighty God, when the fruit has been produced, puts in the sickle and cuts down his harvest, because when he has led each one to perfect works, he cuts short his temporal life by the sentence sent forth, so that he may bring his grain to the heavenly barns. Therefore, when we conceive good desires, we cast seed into the ground. When we begin to do right things, we are the blade. When we grow toward the advancement of good work, we reach the ear. And when we are made firm in the perfection of this same good work, we now bring forth full grain in the ear.

The grass, indeed, Peter had been, who, at the time of the Passion, following the Lord through love, feared to confess Him before the voice of a maidservant. For there was already greenness in his mind, because he believed in the Redeemer of all, but still very pliable he was trampled underfoot by fear. He had already risen into an ear of grain when he saw Him whom he had feared to confess as about to die, living in Galilee, as the Angel announced. But then the full grain had come into the ear, when, with the Spirit coming from above and strengthening his mind in love of Him, he was so solidified that, being beaten, he despised the forces of his persecutors and freely preached his Redeemer amid the scourges. Therefore let no one who is seen to be still in tenderness of mind regarding a good resolution be despised, because the wheat of God begins from grass in order to become grain. The man clothed in linen, therefore, came to the gate, because our Lord and Redeemer is led to Himself through His members entering. And he ascended by its steps, because, as we advance, He is the more exalted to us, the more He is known to be high and incomprehensible. Indeed, in the steps of our virtues He Himself is said to ascend, because He is shown to be all the more sublime to us, the more our mind is separated from the lowest things.

And measured the threshold of the gate, which was one reed broad.

And he measured the threshold of the gate with one reed in width, that is, one threshold with one reed in width. Why, after "the threshold of the gate" was said, is "one threshold" immediately added, unless because it openly indicates that another threshold is mentioned still further below? Moreover, the gate rises from the threshold so that it may be a gate. If therefore the Lord is the gate, who is the threshold of this gate except those ancient fathers, from whose lineage the Lord deigned to become incarnate? As is said through Paul: "Whose are the fathers, from whom is Christ according to the flesh, who is over all things God blessed forever." But it should be noted in this statement of Paul that gods and other men have been called such, as is said to Moses: "I will make you a god to Pharaoh." And through the Psalmist it is said: "I said, you are gods." And again: "God stood in the assembly of gods." But it is one thing to be called God nominally, another to be called God by nature. And although Moses was made a god to Pharaoh, he is called a god within all things, not God over all things. But he who was incarnate within the Virgin's womb is called God over all things. And so the threshold of the gate are the ancient fathers, from whom he was born who opened for us the entrance to the heavenly kingdom. Moreover, the threshold of the gate is measured by one reed, because those ancient fathers themselves, who were able to proclaim our Redeemer both by prophesying and by living well, had as it were six cubits in the perfection of work and a palm in the beginning of contemplation. For since both perfect work and begun contemplation rendered their life sublime in the unity of faith, the measure of the threshold was in one reed.
