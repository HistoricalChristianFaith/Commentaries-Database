80. He mocketh at fear, because he is not so far alarmed by fear of any temptation, as to keep silence. And he yieldeth not to the sword; because though violent temptation assails him, it yet drives him not away from the care of his neighbour. Whence also Paul, teaching us an example of resolute conversation, both states what swords he endures from the enemy, and shows how he yields not to these same swords. For he had endured from the enemy the sword of carnal temptation, after every contest with the works of the flesh had been already overcome, who said; I see another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and leading me captive to the law of sin, which is in my members. [Rom. 7, 23] But to that sword, which he had overcome in himself, he yielded not in others also, when saying in truth, to those about him; Let not sin reign in your mortal body, to obey the desires thereof. [Rom. 6, 12] And again; Mortify your members, which are upon the earth, fornication, uncleanness, lust, evil concupiscence. [Col. 3, 5] There smote him more heavily the sword of those temptations, of which he himself says, In more numerous labours, in prisons more abundantly, in stripes above measure, in deaths oft. Of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one, thrice was I beaten with rods, once was I stoned, thrice I suffered shipwreck, by night and by day I have been in the deep of the sea. [2 Cor. 11, 23-25] And other sufferings, which he was able to endure, and we are weary of enumerating. But how, from love to his neighbour, he yields not to this sword, after stating many things, he himself subjoins; Besides those things that are without, that which cometh upon me daily, the care of all the Churches. [ib. 28] The horse of God is therefore smitten with the sword, and yet is not, by this blow, kept from his course, whilst the bold soldier in the spiritual contest both receives himself wounds from the enemy, and yet binds [or ‘smites.’ (strength)] others, for their salvation. But, against this so hard breast of the heavenly soldier, the ancient enemy seeks the more for sharper weapons, as he beholds himself more resolutely despised.

61. Let us see how he mocks at fear, who, as he counts, tramples under foot the swords of the adversaries. For he says, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? shall tribulation, or distress, or famine, or persecution? [Rom. 8, 35] In fear, coming punishment is dreaded; but in the sword, pain is felt already from a present blow. Because therefore a holy man dreads not coming evils, he despises fear: but because he is not overcome even by a blow as it comes upon him, he yields not at all to the sword. Against this horse then there are as many swords of enemies as there are kinds of persecutions, all which he meets and overcomes, because from the love of life, he prepares himself for destruction. But since we have heard how so very sturdy a breast exposes itself to the shafts, let us now hear what is done by the adversaries.
