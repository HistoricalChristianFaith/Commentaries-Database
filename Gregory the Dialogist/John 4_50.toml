In this matter we must pay careful attention to what we have learned from the testimony of another Evangelist. A centurion came to the Lord saying, “Sir, my son is lying at home paralyzed and in great pain.” Jesus immediately answered him, “I myself will come and heal him.” Why is it that when the ruler asked him to come to his son, he refused to go there in person, but he promised to go in person to the servant, when the centurion had not asked him to do so? He did not condescend to be physically present to the ruler’s son but did hurry to the side of the centurion’s servant.Why was this, except to check our pride? We do not respect in people their nature, made in God’s image, but their riches and reputation. When we consider what is important about them we scarcely regard what they are inwardly. We pay attention to what is physically displeasing about them and neglect to consider what they are. Our Redeemer, to show us that the things human beings regard highly are displeasing to the saints and that we are not to be displeased by what humans consider displeasing, refused to go to the ruler’s son but was ready to go to the centurion’s servant.…
You see that one came from heaven who was not reluctant to hurry to a servant on earth, and yet we who are of the earth refuse to be humbled on earth.
