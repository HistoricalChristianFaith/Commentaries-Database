The friends of Job are said to have been afraid of the words of Elihu, since frequently proud defenders of the church, though they do not observe due order in what they say, confound the adversaries by the very virtue of their words. It follows, “Because therefore I have waited, and they have not spoken, they have stood and have answered no more.” Wise people are accustomed to make it the limit of their speaking, to speak as far as silence to their adversaries, for they do not wish to display their own powers but to put down the false teachers. But after, it is said of the friends of Job, “They are dismayed, they answer no more; they have not a word to say,” Elihu subjoins and says, “Because therefore I have waited, and they have not spoken, they have stood and have answered no more.” Even when they are already silent, he yet multiplies his words, because, being an arrogant man and representing the character of the arrogant, he is in haste not merely to refute the arguments of his opponents but to display his own wisdom.
