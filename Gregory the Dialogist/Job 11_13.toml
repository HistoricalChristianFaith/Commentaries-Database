25.  The heart is not here said to be ‘set firm’ by virtue but by insensibility, for every soul that submits itself to the consideration of the interior severity, is directly softened by the fear thereof; and the shaft of divine dread enters into him, in that he carries weak bowels through humility.  But he that is hardened by obstinacy in insensibility, as it were sets his heart firm, that the darts of heavenly fear may not pierce it.  Whence the Lord says mercifully to some by the Prophet, And I will take away the stony heart out of you, and I will give you a heart of flesh. [Ezek. 36, 26]  For He ‘takes away the stony heart,’ when He removes from us the hardness of pride.  And He ‘gives us a heart of flesh,’ when He thereupon changes that same hardness into sensibility.  Now by ‘hands’ as we have often taught are denoted works.  To stretch out the hands to God, then, with sin, is to pride ourselves upon the excellency of our works to the prejudice of the grace of the Giver.  For he that, speaking in the presence of the Eternal Judge, ascribes to himself the good that he does, stretches out his hands to God in a spirit of pride.  It is in this way truly that the lost ever let themselves loose against the Elect, and so heretics against Catholics; that when they are unable to abuse their doings, they set themselves to blame the good for pride in those doings, that those, whom they cannot upbraid for weak points in practice, they may charge with the guilt of high-mindedness.  And hence the good things which are done outwardly, they now no longer reckon to be good, in that they are set forth as it were in the prosecution of swelling conceit.  And these oftentimes with swelling thoughts rebuke lowly deeds, and know not that they are dealing blows against themselves by their words.  But whereas Zophar had hitherto chidden the righteous man with reproof, now, as giving him lessons of instruction.
