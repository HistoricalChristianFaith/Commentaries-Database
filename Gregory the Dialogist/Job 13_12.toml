42.  All that are confounded to this present state of being by an earthly temper of mind, mean, by all that they do, to leave the remembrance of themselves to the world.  Some in the toils of war, some in the towering walls of edifices, some in eloquent books of this world’s lore, they are eagerly toiling and striving and building up for themselves a name of remembrance.  But whereas life itself runs on to an end with speed, what is there in it that will stand stedfast, when even its very self by nature running rapidly speeds away.  For a breath of air seizes the ashes, as it is written; The ungodly are not so, but are like the chaff, which the wind scattereth away from the face of the earth. [Ps. 1, 4]  And so the remembrance of fools is rightly compared to ‘ashes,’ in that it is placed there, where it is liable to be carried away by a breath of air.  For howsoever a man may toil to achieve the glory of his name, he has placed his ‘remembrance like ashes,’ in that the wind of mortality hurries it away in a moment.  Contrary to which it is written of the just man, The righteous shall be had in everlasting remembrance. [Ps. 112, 6]  For by the very circumstance, that he imprints his deeds upon the eyes of God alone, he sets firm the name of his remembrance in the eternal world.  It goes on;
And your necks shall be brought down to the mire.
43.  As the sight is used to be denoted by the eye, so is pride by the ‘neck.’  Thus ‘the neck is brought down to the mire,’ when every proud man is humbled in death, and the flesh that was lifted up rots in corruption.  For let us contemplate how and like what the carcases of the rich lie in their graves, what that form of death is in the lifeless flesh, what the rottenness of corruption.  And surely these were the very persons who were lifted up with honours, swollen with the things gotten by them, who looked down upon others, and exulted to stand as it were alone.  Yet, while they never considered whereunto they were going, they knew nothing at all what they were.  But ‘the neck is brought down to the mire,’ in that they lie neglected in rottenness, who swelled high in emptiness.  ‘The neck is brought down to the mire,’ because what the might of flesh is good for, the rottenness of corruption evidences.
