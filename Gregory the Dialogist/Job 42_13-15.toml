For the souls of the elect surpass, by the comeliness of their beauty, all the human race that lives after the fashion of men on the earth. The more they humble themselves by outward affliction, the more truly do they array themselves within. Hence this is said by the psalmist to the holy church, which is adorned with the beauty of the elect, “The King has greatly desired your beauty.” And of him it is added a little after, “All the glory of this daughter of kings is from within,” for if [the church] sought glory outside, it would have no beauty within for the king greatly to desire. And although many shine therein with the beauty of virtues and surpass the merits of others by the very perfection of their conduct, yet some, because they are not able to attain to higher things being conscious of their own weakness, are embraced in the bosom of its gentleness. These, as far as they possess strength, avoid sins, although they do not fulfill higher excellencies as far as thy desire. Yet God graciously receives them and admits them to himself in proportion to the recompense they deserve.
