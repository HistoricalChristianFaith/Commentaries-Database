The law suppressed physical sins, but our Redeemer condemned even unlawful thoughts. And so “if they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they believe one who rises from the dead.” When will those who neglect to fulfill the less important commandments of the law be strong enough to obey our Savior’s more demanding precepts? This much is clear: anyone whose sayings they decline to fulfill, they have refused to believe.
