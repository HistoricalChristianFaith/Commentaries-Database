70.  Whereas graves cover dead bodies, what else is denoted by ‘the graves’ but the lost, in whom their souls extinct of the life of blessedness lie as in graves?  Thus this wicked one shall be ‘brought to the graves,’ in that he shall be admitted in the hearts of the wicked, in that they only admit him, in whom are found souls dead to God, concerning whom it is rightly said by the Prophet likewise where his punishments are described, His graves are about him, all the slain, and those that felt by the sword.  For they in hell ‘are about him,’ in whom that evil spirit lies dead, which same fell, having been slain by the sword of his wickedness.  Whence it is written, Who hast delivered David Thy servant from the hurtful sword.  And it is rightly said, in the heap of the dead bodies he shall watch, in that now in the assembly of sinners he puts forth the artifices of his cunning.  And on this account, that in the world there is a scarcity of good men, and a multitude of bad, it is rightly called ‘the heap of dead bodies,’ that the very multitude of the wicked might be denoted.  For broad is the way that leadeth to destruction, and many there be that go in thereat. [Matt. 7, 13]  So Satan’s ‘keeping watch in the heap of dead bodies,’ is his exercising the wiles of his wickedness in the hearts of the children of perdition.
