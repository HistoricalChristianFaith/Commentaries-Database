60.  For what is man but a leaf, who fell in Paradise from the tree?  what but a leaf is he, who is caught by the wind of temptation, and lifted up by the gusts of his passions?  For the mind of man is agitated as it were by as many gusts, as it undergoes temptations.  Thus very often anger agitates it; when anger is gone, empty mirth succeeds.  It is driven by the goadings of lust, by the fever of avarice it is made to stretch itself far and wide to compass the things which belong to the earth.  Sometimes pride lifts it up, and sometimes excessive fear sinks it lower than the dust.  Therefore seeing that he is lifted and carried by so many gusts of temptation, man is well likened to a ‘leaf.’  Hence it is well said too by Isaiah, And we all have fallen as a leaf, and our iniquities like the wind have taken us away.  For ‘our iniquity like a wind has taken us away,’ in that being steadied by no weight of virtue, it has lifted us into empty self-elation.  And it is well that, after a leaf, man should be called ‘stubble’ likewise.  For he that was a ‘tree’ by his creating, was by himself made a ‘leaf’ in his tempting, but afterwards he appeared ‘stubble’ in his fallen estate.  For in that he fell from on high, he was a leaf, but, whereas by the flesh he was fellow to the earth, even when he seemed to stand, he is described as ‘stubble.’  But because he lost the greenness of interior love, he is henceforth ‘dry stubble.’  So let the holy man reflect both what meanness man is of, and what severity God is of, and let him say, Wilt Thou show Thy power against a leaf driven to and fro?  and wilt Thou pursue the dry stubble?  As if he openly bewailed, saying, ‘Why dost Thou run him down with so much force of righteousness, whom Thou knowest to be so frail in temptation?’
