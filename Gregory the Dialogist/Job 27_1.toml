2.  By which same verse it is shown in how great mystery the words of this most saintly man are delivered, when ‘a parable,’ i.e. a simile, is described as ‘taken up’ by him, who utters nothing below in the way of simile or comparison.  For be it far from us in this place to interpret a ‘parable’ that musical instrument [‘We know of no musical instrument so called either now or formerly; but one may imagine some so named from their parabolic figure.’ Ben.]. Since neither is it allowable to suppose that under infliction of chastenings he used music, when Truth saith by His Scripture, Music in mourning is as a tale out of season.  The word ‘parable,’ then, having been named, see how we now learn, the text itself telling it, not by the text only to estimate his words.  And so every thing must be drawn to turn to that likeness, by which the Church is denoted in a figure.  And indeed in the very beginning of his speaking, the things said are put forth in a plain sense, but they are entwined with more obscure ones subjoined.  For he begins as he is used, with a plain mode of speech, but he finishes his words with a description pregnant through mystical significations.
