62. For they were seeming to live as if in calm, when they were taking care to rejoice in the credit of holiness. But their soul, which used to rejoice in the fatal tranquillity of human praise, dies by a sudden tempest. For most commonly an unexpected tempest suddenly produces a change in all the calm blandishment of the air, and danger cannot be avoided, inasmuch as it could not be foreseen. Whence hypocrites, who neglect to watch over their conduct, are said to die in a tempest. For the sudden whirlwind of an inward shock casts them forth hence, whom the pride of outward applause exalts on high; and, while they embrace in their praise that which they are not, they suddenly find in vengeance what they are. But it is well said by Solomon, As silver is proved in the fining-pot, and gold in the furnace, so is a man proved by the mouth of him that praiseth him. [Prov. 17, 3] For praise of oneâ€™s self tortures the just, but elates the wicked. But while it tortures, it purifies the just; and while it pleases the wicked, it proves them to be reprobate. For these revel in their own praise, because they seek not the glory of their Maker. But they who seek the glory of their Maker, are tortured with their own praise, lest that which is spoken of without, should not exist within them; lest, if that, which is said, really exist, it should be made void in the sight of God by these very honours; lest the praise of men should soften the firmness of their heart, and should lay it low in self-satisfaction; and lest that, which ought to aid them to increase their exertions, should be, even now, the recompense of their labour. But when they see that their own praises tend to the glory of God, they even long for and welcome them. For it is written, They may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven. [Matt. 5, 16] They make themselves, therefore, a path for men to follow, as often as they manifest any thing in themselves, by which God can be recognised; because they seek not to attract the praises of men to themselves, but wish they should pass on, through their means, to the glory of their Maker. But haughty men prostitute their effeminate hearts to human praise, because they are corrupted by self-love. Of whom it is said in another place, Men shall be lovers of their own selves. [2 Tim. 3, 2] But of this very corruption of theirs it is here fitly subjoined,
And their life among the effeminate.
63. For, if they were living as men, transitory praise would not infect them with any corruption. Whence the Prophet persuades the Elect, saying, Do manfully; and let your heart be strengthened. For when saying, Do manfully, he immediately subjoined, and let your heart be strengthened. As if he desired to secure the sex of the heart. For the mind of a luxurious man is corrupted, if it is delighted with transitory objects. The life of hypocrites then perishes among the effeminate, because it is found to be corrupted with the luxury of praise. But in another translation, [LXX.] it is not rendered, Their life among the effeminate, but, Let their life be wounded by angels. But though these expressions differ in words, they agree in sense; for angels wound the life of the effeminate, when the messengers of truth assail it with the shafts of holy preaching. Because we have heard then what occurs in the damnation of the reprobates, let us hear what follows, respecting the deliverance of the humble.
