And he confirms her whom he had healed by the sentence of his mercy, saying: "Your faith has saved you, go in peace." For faith indeed saved her, because she did not doubt that she could receive what she sought. But she had already received that very certainty of hope from him from whom she also sought salvation through hope. And she is commanded to go in peace, so that she may no longer be turned aside from the way of truth into the path of scandal. Hence it is also said through Zechariah: "To direct our feet into the way of peace." For we direct our steps into the way of peace when we proceed along that path of actions in which we are not at discord with the grace of our Creator.
