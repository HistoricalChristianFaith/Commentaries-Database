15. What does it mean that when he gave portions to Peninnah, and to her sons and daughters, he was by no means sad: but when he gave one portion to Hannah, he is said to have been sad? But what is the one portion of Hannah, except the temporal affliction of holy Church? For he was giving her this portion when he said: Amen, amen, I say to you, that you shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice, and you shall be sorrowful (John 16:20). He was giving her this portion when he commended Paul to Ananias, saying: Go, for this man is a vessel of election to me, to carry my name before the Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel: for I will show him how much he must suffer for my name (Acts 9:15-16). Wherefore in receiving this, the same teacher of the Gentiles glories, saying: I fill up what is lacking of the sufferings of Christ in my body (Col. 1:24). Hence he says again: I bear the marks of Jesus in my body (Gal. 6:17). Hence he says: But far be it from me to glory, except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world (Gal. 6:14). For he had received one portion from the bridegroom, who was disposed to glory in the cross alone. Therefore when he gave portions to Peninnah, Elkanah was not sad; because our Redeemer, after the triumph of death, now joyfully restored the elect of the synagogue to the joys of paradise. But he gave Hannah's portion sadly, because he could not but suffer with her whom he was leaving as the spouse of death and the heir of the cross. Wherefore also when Stephen was suffering, with the heavens opened, Jesus is said to stand (Acts 7:55). For to stand is to suffer with him.

16. But what is added, that he loved Anna, can properly be understood as the cause of both things. For whether one accepts that he was sad because he loved Anna, or that he gave her one portion for that reason, it does not lack a good interpretation. For if he did not love her, he would by no means wish to sympathize with her sufferings. For why is she led out of Egypt, unless because she is called to suffering? But places flowing with milk and honey are promised to her. Rightly therefore when he is said to give her one portion, he is declared to love her: because indeed our Redeemer, although he entrusted to the holy Church the labor of his cross, established for her far more excellent gifts of reward in heaven. Expounding indeed the increase of her suffering, he adds and says: (Verses 6 and 7.) But the Lord had closed her womb. Her rival also afflicted her, and vehemently distressed her to such an extent that she reproached her because the Lord had closed her womb.

(Moral Exposition) The sons of Peninnah are the counsels of the holy mind, which grow through the pursuit of piety in the active life. These sons receive portions with their mother when the counsels of piety grow rich in devotion to good works unto the splendor of heavenly grace. For the pious mind, the more sublimely it is raised in divine contemplation, the more devoutly it extends itself in holy action. For the portions of this mother and her sons are the preparations for holy works. But he gives one portion to the sorrowful Hannah, because through contemplation, by which she desires heavenly things, as long as she is hindered in this misery of time and does not obtain the heavenly things she loves, she has the food of refreshment only in weeping. Indeed, she holds herself fasting whenever, remembering that she is cast out from eternal joys, she cannot weep. Therefore she receives one portion from the sorrowful one, because she is never refreshed according to her desire unless she is satisfied by weeping. The Ephrathite husband gives it to her sorrowfully, who when he gave a portion to Peninnah was not sorrowful, because indeed he rejoices in the preparation of good works, but does not rejoice in joys as long as he is delayed from the heavenly things he loves. Certainly he had given this portion to Hannah, who, seeing himself excluded from eternal goods, spoke saying: "My tears have been my bread day and night, while it is said to me daily: Where is your God?" (Psalm 41:4). But the imperfection of one still beginning is indicated when one wife of the Ephrathite is said to afflict and vehemently distress the other. For in the perfect person, the battle of wives is by no means engaged, since firm experience already knows how to arrange discretely the need for work and the intention for contemplation. For he possesses both wives as if in peace, who neither assigns the times of work to contemplation nor disturbs the leisure of contemplation through the intention of work. (Verse 6) Her rival also afflicted her and vehemently distressed her, to such an extent that she reproached her because the Lord had closed her womb.
