Hence it is also added: "Do not carry a money bag, nor a wallet, nor sandals, and greet no one along the way." For the preacher ought to have such great trust in God that, although he does not provide for the expenses of the present life, he nevertheless knows most certainly that these will not be lacking to him, lest while his mind is occupied with temporal things, he provide less for others concerning eternal things. He is also permitted to greet no one along the way, to show with what great haste he ought to proceed on the journey of preaching. If anyone wishes to understand these words also allegorically: in a money bag, money is enclosed; but enclosed money is hidden wisdom. Therefore, whoever has the word of wisdom but neglects to distribute it to his neighbor holds money bound up in a bag, as it were. Hence it is written: "Hidden wisdom and a concealed treasure, what profit is there in either?" And what is signified by the wallet, except the burdens of the world; and what in this place by sandals, except the examples of dead works? Therefore, whoever undertakes the office of preaching, it is not fitting that he carry the burden of worldly affairs, lest while this weighs down his neck, he not rise up to preach heavenly things. Nor ought he to look upon the examples of foolish works, lest he believe he is protecting his own works, as it were, with the skins of dead animals. For there are many who defend their own depravity from the depravities of others. Because they consider that others have done such things, they think they may do these things freely. What else do these people do except try to protect their feet with the skins of dead animals? But everyone who greets on the way greets by occasion of the journey, not from zeal for wishing that same salvation. Therefore, whoever preaches salvation to his hearers not from love of the eternal homeland but from ambition for rewards greets, as it were, on the journey, because he wishes salvation for his hearers by occasion and not by intention.
