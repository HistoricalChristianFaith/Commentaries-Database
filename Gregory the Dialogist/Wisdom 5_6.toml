Readers must exercise great discernment, so that when any single word is used in sacred Scripture, it is not believed to always signify one and the same thing—just as sometimes "sun" is taken in a good sense, and sometimes in a bad sense. For by the name of sun, sometimes our Redeemer Himself is signified, and sometimes persecution. For as the Book of Wisdom attests, the impious in hell will say: "We have erred from the way of truth, and the sun of justice has not shone upon us." And concerning the seeds that were cast, the Lord says: "When the sun rose, they withered"—because, that is, when persecution arose, the words of preaching dried up in the hearts of the reprobate.
