Readers must use great discernment, so as to recognize that in sacred Scripture, a particular word does not always have one and the same meaning. The sun, for example, at times has a positive meaning and at times negative. In fact, sometimes it refers to our Redeemer and sometimes to persecution. According to the testimony of the book of Wisdom, the godless in hell will say, “We strayed from the way of truth, and the sun of righteousness never rose for us.” And of the seed that was sown, the Lord says, “The sun rose, and it was scorched,” because, when persecution comes, the word that was preached dries up in the hearts of the wicked.
