“Attend to my wisdom, and bow your ear to my prudence, that you may guard your thoughts. For, indeed, nothing is more fugitive than the heart, which deserts us as often as it slips away through evil thoughts. Therefore, the psalmist says, “My heart has failed me.” Yet, when he returns to himself, he says, “Your servant has found his heart to pray to you.” When, therefore, thought is kept under guard, the heart which was inclined to fly away is found.
