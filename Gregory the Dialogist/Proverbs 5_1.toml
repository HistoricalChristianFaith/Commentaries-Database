“Attend to my wisdom, and incline your ear to my prudence, that you may guard your thoughts.” Truly, there is nothing in us more fugitive than the heart that deserts us as often as it slips away in evil thoughts. Therefore, the psalmist says, “My heart has forsaken me.” So, too, returning to himself, he says [that he has found his heart to pray to you]. When thought is guarded, the heart so accustomed to flee away, is found. .
