63.  God ‘set man’s foot in the stocks,’ in that he bound fast his wickedness with the strong sentence of His severity.  And He ‘looketh narrowly into all his paths,’ in that He judges with minute exactness all the several particulars that belong to him.  For a ‘path’ is usually narrower than a ‘way;’ but as by ‘ways’ we understand actions, so by ‘paths’ we not unjustly understand the mere thoughts of them.  So God ‘looketh narrowly into all our paths,’ in that in all our several actions He takes account of the thoughts of the heart too; and He ‘marketh the prints of our feet,’ in that He examineth the intentions [i] of our works, how far they are placed aright, lest that which is done a good work, be not done with a right object.  But it is possible that by the prints of the feet the several things done badly may be understood.  For a foot in the body is a print in the way.  And very commonly, when we do some things wrong, whereas our brethren see it, we are setting them a bad example, and our foot being as it were turned out of the way, we leave to those that follow our footsteps all awry, while by our own deeds we lead the way for other men’s consciences to stumble.  But it is very hard for man to keep on his guard, that he never presume to do evil, that in his good actions he be not unsteady in the intention, and amidst upright deeds let no wrong purpose deceive him.  Yet all these particulars Almighty God minutely examines, and weighs each one of them in judgment.  But when can man, bound about as he is by the frailty of the flesh, have power to rise up against all of them with exact particularity, and to maintain the line of uprightness with the thought of the heart unmoved?
