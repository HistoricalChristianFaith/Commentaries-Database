77.  Who that is sound of perception would deem it worthy to understand this according to the letter?  For ‘glass,’ as we said above, is of much less worth than ‘gold,’ and after it was said that ‘gold is not equal’ to this Wisdom, it is yet further, as if heightening, subjoined, that ‘glass’ too cannot equal it either.  But the bare letter failing us in the historical sense, sends us to investigating the mystery of the allegory.  For we know that the metal gold shines with a superior brightness to all the metals.  But it is of the nature of glass that whilst seen without it shines with perfect transparency in the inside.  In every other metal whatever is contained within is hidden from sight, but in the case of glass, every liquid, such as it is contained within, such is it shown to be without, and, so to say, all the liquid in a glass vessel, whilst shut up is open.  What other thing, then, do we understand by ‘gold and glass,’ but that heavenly Country, that society of blessed citizens, whose hearts mutually one with another at once shine with brightness, and are transparent by pureness; which John in Revelations had beheld, when he said, And the building of the wall of it was of jasper, and the city was of pure gold like unto clear glass. [Rev. 21, 18]  For because all the Saints shall shine in the supreme brightness of bliss, it is described as constructed of gold. 
78.  And because their very brightness itself is reciprocally open to them in each other’s breasts, and when the countenance of each one marked his conscience is penetrated along with it, this very gold is described as like pure glass.  For there the mind of every person no bodily frame of limbs will hide from the eyes of his fellow, but the interior will be given to view, the very harmony of the body too will also be plain to the eyes of the body, and each one will be in such wise distinguishable to another, as now he cannot be distinguishable to himself.  But now our hearts, so long as we are in this life, because they cannot be seen in one by another, are enclosed not within glass vessels, but within vessels of earthenware; in which same clay in respect of the mind being affected the Prophet dreaded to stick, when he said, Deliver me out of the clay, that I may not stick fast. [Ps. 69, 14]  Which very tabernacle of bodies, Paul calls ‘our earthly house,’ saying, For we know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle be dissolved, we have a building of God, an house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. [2 Cor, 5, 1]  Therefore in this earthly house so long as we live, the mere partition wall of our corrupt state, so to say, we do not penetrate with the eyes of the mind, and the hidden things in each other we cannot see.  Hence Holy Church desiring to see the form of her Spouse in the Godhead, yet not being able, because the fashion of His Eternal Being, which she longed to behold, His Manhood, which He took upon Him, hid from her eyes, says mourning in the Song of Songs; Behold he standeth behind our wall. [Cant. 2, 9]  As if she said in plain speech, ‘I desire to see HIM now already in the appearance of His Godhead, but I am still shut out from the sight of Him by the wall of the flesh He has assumed.’  Therefore so long as we live in this corruptible flesh, we see not the thoughts of the hearts in one another.  Whence it is said by the same Paul, For what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of man that is in him? [1 Cor. 2, 11]  And again; Therefore Judge nothing before the time, until the Lord come, Who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts. [1 Cor. 4, 5]  So then that City, which manifests the hearts of them that are in it to each severally and reciprocally, is described ‘of gold like to pure glass,’ that by the gold it may be represented bright, and by the glass transparent.
79.  But though all the Saints therein glitter with such wonderful brightness, and shine through with such extraordinary transparency, yet that Wisdom, by a likeness of Which they have all that they are, they ‘cannot equal.’  Therefore it is well said, The gold and the glass cannot equal it.  For it is for this that all the Saints are brought to those eternal joys, that they may be like to God, as it is written, When He shall appear, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. [1 John 3, 2]  And yet it is written, O Lord God of hosts, who is like unto Thee? [Ps. 89, 9]  And again; Who shall be like unto God among the sons of God? [ib. v. 6]  Whence then shall they be like, and whence not like, but that to this ‘Wisdom’ they at once be like for a semblance and not like for equality?  For by gazing on the Eternity of God, it is brought to pass upon them that they should be eternal, and while they receive the gift of seeing Him, by the receiving of Blessedness they copy the thing that they see.  They are both like, then, because they are made blessed; and they are not like to the Creator, because they are a creature.  And thus they both have a certain likeness to God, because they are without end; and yet they have no equality to the Incomprehensible One, because they have comprehensible being.  Therefore let it be justly said, The gold and the glass is not equal to it.  For with whatever brightness and transparency the Saints may shine, it is one thing for men to be wise in God, and another thing for a Man to be the Wisdom of God.  Which same Wisdom he was truly acquainted with, who never ventured to liken any one of the Saints to the Mediator between God and man.  And hence it is added;   .
Neither shall vessels of gold high and overtopping be exchanged instead of it.
80.  For a ‘lofty vessel of gold’ did Elijah prove, ‘a lofty vessel of gold’ Jeremiah, ‘lofty and overtopping vessels of gold’ the old Fathers were.  But this Wisdom of God, in order that It might redeem us from a carnal kind of life, appeared in the flesh, and he, who did not see that Wisdom in a true light, supposed that the Mediator between God and man, the Man Christ Jesus, was one of the Prophets, which Christ the eyes of the Elect held for God, when they saw by Him but Man.  Hence it is said by Him to the holy Disciples, Whom do men say that I, the Son of man, am? [Matt. 16, 13, &c.]  And when they thereupon answered Him, Some say that Thou art John the Baptist; some Elias: some Jeremias, or one of the prophets; they were immediately interrogated touching their own perception; But whom say ye that I am?  To whom Peter, answering directly in the voice of the whole Church, says, Thou art the Christ, the Son of the Living God.  Thus, then, forasmuch as according to the declaration of Paul we ‘know Christ, the Power of God, and the Wisdom of God,’ for this  Wisdom Peter refused to ‘exchange vessels of gold lofty and overtopping,’ because he understood concerning it no other thing than it was.  For as has been said, a great ‘vessel of gold’ was John, a great ‘vessel of gold’ Elijah, a great vessel of gold ‘Jeremiah.  Now whoever accounted that That God was anyone of these, did ‘exchange a vessel of gold high and overtopping’ for this ‘Wisdom.’  But for this Wisdom the Church doth not ‘exchange vessels of gold high and overtopping,’ because it holds that Christ the Son of God is not one of the Prophets, but the One Lord of the Prophets.  For seeing that ‘Wisdom’ Itself had come to her, she refused to keep herself fixed in those golden vessels, but was eager with certainty of faith to pass on into that Wisdom.  Whence she saith in the Song of Songs; The watchmen that keep the city found me; to whom I said, Saw ye him, whom my soul loveth?  It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him, whom my soul loveth. [Cant. 3, 3. 4.]  For whom do we take ‘the watchmen that go about the city’ to be, but the former fathers and prophets who set themselves to watch by the voice of holy preaching for our safe keeping?  but when the Church sought her Redeemer, she would not fix her hope in those same ancient preachers, in that she says, It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth.  For Him she had not been able to find, if she had been unwilling ‘to pass by through these.’  For the unbelievers had rested themselves in those warders, who believed that Christ the Son of God was anyone of those.  With the voice then and the faith of Peter, Holy Church passed by the watchmen she found, in that she disdained to believe the Lord Who had been prophesied to be anyone of the number of the prophets.  Thus, let it be said, nor shall vessels of gold high and overtopping be exchanged for it.  Because the Elect severally both venerate the life of the Saints for their loftiness, and yet do not take up with it for error.  For those whom they know to be simple men they do not all compare to God-Man.
