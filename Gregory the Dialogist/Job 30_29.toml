I was a brother to dragons, and a companion to ostriches.

The term 'dragons' is used to denote the cruel spirits who plot our destruction, or those persons who in the Holy Church imitate those spirits by living corruptly. The ostrich has wings and cannot fly, for it shows as it were the appearance of flight but never mounts upward into the air. Thus all hypocrites are like ostriches, who while they pretend holiness, never practice the reality of holiness. For they have wings by their display of seeming virtue, but they walk on the ground by their habit of secret self-indulgence. Holy Church then in the time of her tribulation has 'dragons for brethren' when cruel persecutors come against her with open cruelty. And she has 'ostriches for companions' when hypocrites who appear righteous outwardly but live wickedly within bear down upon her.
