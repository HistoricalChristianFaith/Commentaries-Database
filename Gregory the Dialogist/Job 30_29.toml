75. What is there denoted by the title of ‘dragons,’ but the life of evil minded men? Of whom also it is said by the prophet, They drew up the wind like dragons. [Jer. 14, 6] For all wicked men ‘draw in wind like dragons,’ when they are swoln with evil minded pride. But who are used to be understood by the designation of ‘ostriches,’ saving pretenders? For the ostrich has wings, but has not flight; because all pretenders have an appearance of sanctity, but the goodness of sanctity they have not. For those persons the appearance of good conduct adorns, but the wing of virtue never lifts them from the earth. So let the Elect people of Holy Church, because in the time of its peace it suffers within itself persons that are evil minded and pretenders, say the words, I was a brother to dragons, and a companion to ostriches. Which too in a special manner accords with the words of blessed Job, who to the highest pitch of great fortitude was a good man amongst bad. For no one is perfect who amidst his neighbours’ evil things is not patient. For he who does not bear others’ evil with composure, is by his impatience witness to himself that he is very far removed from the plenitude of goodness. For he refuses to be Abel, whom the malice of Cain does not exercise.
76. Thus in the threshing of the floor the grains are squeezed under the chaff; thus the flowers come forth between thorns, and the rose that smells grows along with the thorn that pricks. Thus the first man had two sons, but one was elect, the other refuse. The three sons of Noah too did the ark contain, but while two continued in humility, one went headlong into the mocking of his father. Two sons Abraham had; but one was innocent, the other the persecutor of his brother. Two sons also Isaac had, one saved in humility, while the other even before that he was born was cast away. Twelve sons Jacob begat, but of these one was sold in innocency, while the rest were through wickedness the sellers of their brother. Twelve Apostles too were chosen in Holy Church; but that they might not remain untried, one is mixed with them, who by persecuting should try them. For to a just man there is joined a sinner together with wickedness, just as in the furnace to the gold there is added chaff along with fire, that in proportion as the chaff burns the gold may be purified. So then those are truly good men, who are enabled to hold on in goodness even in the midst of bad men; herein too it is said to Holy Church by the voice of the Spouse; As a lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters. [Cant. 2, 2] Hence the Lord saith to Ezekiel And thou, son of man, unbelievers and overturners are with thee, and thou dwellest among scorpions. [Ez. 2, 6] Hence Peter magnifies the life of blessed Lot, saying, And delivered righteous Lot, when oppressed, from the wrongful conversation of the wicked. For to be seen and to be heard he was righteous, living among, those, who from day to day vexed the soul of the righteous man by wicked works. [2 Pet. 2, 7. &c.] Hence Paul magnifies the life of his disciples, and in magnifying strengthens it, saying, In the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world, holding the word of life. [Phil. 2, 15. 16.] Hence by John, the Angel of the Church of Pergamus is borne witness to in the words, I know where thou dwellest, even where Satan’s seat is; and thou holdest fast My name, and hast not denied My faith. [Rev. 2, 15] So then let blessed Job, that he may evince what firmness he is of, tell with whom he lived, saying, I was a brother to dragons, and a companion to ostriches. Because it would have been but little that he himself did good things, except that for the heightening of his goodness he likewise sustained what was evil at the hands of others.
