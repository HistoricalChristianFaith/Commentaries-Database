70.  Very often wicked people at once know the right things that they ought to follow, and yet neglect to follow what they know; and so they are ‘rebellious against the light,’ in that following their desires, they contemn the good that they know.  They then that do wrong not from ignorance, but pride, present the shield of their exaltation against the darts of truth, that they may not be stricken in heart to their good.  By which same pride of theirs it is brought to pass, that whereas they will not do the things that they know, neither do they now know the good they should do, but that their own blindness should utterly exclude them from the light of truth.  And hence it is fitly subjoined,
They know not the ways thereof, nor have returned by the paths thereof.
71.  For they that are first rebels knowing it, are afterwards blinded so as not to know; as it is said of certain, Because that when they knew God they glorified Him not as God, neither were thankful. [Rom 1, 21]  Of whom it is added a little while afterwards, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient. [v. 28]  For because they would not glorify Him Whom they knew, being given over to a reprobate sense, they were left to this fate, that they should not any longer know how to estimate the evil things they did.  And it is well said, They know not the ways thereof, neither have returned by the paths thereof.  For a ‘path’ is narrower than a ‘way.’  Now those that care not to do the plainer good works, never attain to the understanding of the more refined.  But Almighty God waited that they might go ‘by the paths thereof.’  And would that they had been minded even to have ‘returned’ by them, that the paths of life which they would not keep by innocency they might at least keep by repentance.  Wherein of what great mercifulness are the bowels of God is shown, in that those whom He sees departing from Him, He seeks that they may return.  Hence after the sins; of those doing wrong having been enumerated, He calls back the Synagogue by the voice of Prophecy, saying; Therefore at least from this time cry unto Me, My Father, Thou art the guide of my youth. [Jer. 3, 4]
