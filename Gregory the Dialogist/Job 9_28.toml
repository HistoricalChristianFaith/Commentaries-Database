52.  What were the works that blessed Job practised, the text of this sacred history makes plain.  For he studied to propitiate his Maker by numberless burnt offerings; in that according to the number of his sons, as it is written, rising up early in the morning, he offered burnt offerings for each, and purified them not only from impure actions, but likewise from bad thoughts.  Of whom it is recorded, by the witness of Scripture, For Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed [Lat. blessed] God in their hearts. [Job 1, 5]  He exercised the feeling of sympathy, in that he declares of himself, when he was importuned by the interrogations of his friends, Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? [Job 30, 25]  He discharged the office of pity, as he says, I was an eye to the blind, and a foot was I to the lame. [Job 29, 15]  He kept pureness of chastity in heart, in that he discovers himself openly with adjuration, saying, If mine heart have been deceived by a woman. [Job 31, 9]  He held the very topmost point of humility, from the grounds of his heart, who saith, If I did despise to be judged with my manservant or my maidservant, when they contended with me. [ver. 13]  He bestowed the bounties of liberality, who saith, Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath not eaten thereof? [ver. 17]  And again; If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed with the fleece of my sheep. [ver. 20]  He displayed the kindness of hospitality, who says, The stranger did not lodge in the street; but I opened my doors to the traveller. [ver. 32]  And in the midst of these things, for the consummation of his virtues, by that more excellent way of charity, he even loved his very enemies, in that he says, If I rejoiced at the destruction of him that hated me. [ver. 29]  And again, Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin, by wishing a curse to his soul. [ver. 30]  Why then was the holy man ‘afraid for his works,’ in that he ever practised these, by which God is wont to be softened towards transgressions?  How then is it, that while doing works to be admired, he even fears for these same, being in alarm, when he says, I was afraid of all my works, save that we gather from the deeds and the words of the holy man, that if we really desire to please God, after we overcome our bad habits, we must fear the very things themselves that are done well in us?
58.  For there are two particulars which must of necessity be seriously apprehended in our good works, viz. sloth and deceit.  And hence it is said by the Prophet, as the old translation has it, Cursed be he that doeth the work of the Lord deceitfully and negligently. [Jer. 48, 10]  Now it is to be carefully noted, that sloth comes of insensibility, deceit of self-love, for over little love of God gives magnitude to the first, while self-love, miserably possessing the mind, engenders the other.  For he is guilty of deceit in the work of God, whosoever loving himself to excess, by that which he may have done well, is only making the best of his way to transitory good things in compensation.  We must bear in mind too that there are three ways in which deceit itself is practised, in that, surely, the object aimed at in it is either the secret interest of our fellow creatures’ feelings, or the breath of applause, or some outward advantage; contrary to which it is rightly said of the righteous man by the prophet, Blessed is he that shaketh his hands clear of every favour. [Is. 33, 15]  For as deceit does not consist only in the receiving of money; so, no doubt, a favour is not confined to one thing, but there are three ways of receiving favours after which deceit goeth in haste.  For a favour from the heart, is interest solicited in the opinion, a favour from the mouth is glory from applause, a favour from the head a reward by gift.  Now every righteous man ‘shaketh his hands clear of every favour,’ in that in whatever he does aright, he neither aims to win vainglory from the affections of his fellow creatures, nor applause from their lips, nor a gift from their hands.  And so he alone is not guilty of deceit in doing God's work, who while he is energetic in studying right conduct, neither pants after the rewards of earthly substance [corporalis rei], nor after words of applause, nor after favour in man's judgment.  Therefore because our very good actions themselves cannot escape the sword of ambushed sin, unless they be guarded every day by anxious fear, it is rightly said in this place by the holy man, I was afraid of all my works.  As if he said with humble confession, ‘What I have done publicly, I know, but what I may have been secretly subject to therein, I cannot tell.’  For often our good points are spoilt by deceit robbing us, in that earthly desires unite themselves to our right actions; oftentimes they come to nought from sloth intervening, in that, love waxing cold, they are starved of the fervour in which they began.  And so because the stealth of sin is scarcely got the better of even in the very act of virtue, what safeguard remains for our security, but that even in our virtue, we ever tread with fear and caution?
54.  But what he adds after this presents itself as a very great difficulty to the mind; I know that Thou wouldest not spare one that offendeth.  For if there be no ‘sparing of one that offendeth,’ who can be rescued from death eternal, seeing that there is no one to be found clear of sin?  Or does He spare a penitent, but not one that offendeth, in that whilst we bewail our offences we are no longer offending?  Yet how is it that Peter is looked at, while he is denying, and that by the look of his denied Redeemer he is brought to tears?  How is it that Paul, when he was bent to do out the name of our Redeemer upon earth, was vouchsafed to hear His words from heaven?  Yet was sin punished both in the one and in the other.  In that of Peter on the one hand it is written, as the Gospel is witness, And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, and went out, and wept bitterly. [Luke 22, 61. 62.]  And of Paul, that very same ‘Truth’ Which called him, saith, For I will show him how great things he must suffer for My Name's sake. [Acts 9, 16]  Therefore God never doth ‘spare him that offendeth,’ in that He never leaves his sin without taking vengeance on it.  For either man himself in doing penance punishes it in himself, or God in dealing [h] with man in vengeance for it, visits it with His rod, and thus there is never any sparing of sin, in that it is never loosed without vengeance.  Thus David after his confession obtained to hear, The Lord also hath put away thy sin. [2 Sam. 12, 13]  And yet being afterwards scourged ‘with numberless afflictions, and a fugitive, he discharged the obligation of the sin which he had been guilty of.  So we by the water of salvation are absolved from the sin of our first parent; and yet in clearing off the obligations of that same sin, although absolved, we still undergo the death of the flesh.  Therefore it is well said, I know that thou wouldest not spare one that offendeth.  In that either by ourselves or by His own self He cuts off even when He lets off our sins.  For from His Elect He is studious to wipe off by temporal affliction those spots of wickedness, which He would not behold in them for ever.  But it oftentimes happens that when the mind is fearful more than behoves, when it is shaken with alarm, when it is pressed with ill-omened misgivings, it feels weary that it should live, in that it questions the attaining to life even through pains and labour.
