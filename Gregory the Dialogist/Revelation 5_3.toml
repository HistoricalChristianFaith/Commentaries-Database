under the earth. For there are some who think that hell is in a definite place on earth, and others who think that it is under the earth. But it occurs to me that if we call an object ‘infernal’ because it lies in a lower position, then hell ought to be ‘infernal’ to the earth just as the earth is to the sky.... Since, then, no one under the earth was found worthy to unseal the book, I see no reason why we should not believe that Hades is under the earth. (Dial. 4.44 )
