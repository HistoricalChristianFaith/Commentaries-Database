But it occurs to me that if we call an object “infernal” because it lies in a lower position, then hell ought to be “infernal” to the earth just as the earth is to the sky. This is perhaps what the psalmist had in mind when he said, “You have freed my soul from the lower infernal regions.” The earth then is the “upper infernal,” and lying below this is the “lower infernal.” The words of John, too, are in keeping with this concept. He says he saw a book sealed with seven seals, and, because no one was found worthy to open the seals, either in heaven or on earth or under the earth, he “was all in tears.” Yet, later, he says that the Lion of the tribe of Judah opened the book. This book can refer only to sacred Scriptures, for no one opened it but Christ our Redeemer, who became man, and by his death, resurrection and ascension opened the way to all the mysteries it contained. No one in heaven opened it, because no angel could. No one on earth opened it, because no one living in the flesh had the power of doing so. No one under the earth was found worthy to open it, because souls separated from their bodies do not have such powers. No one but our Lord could open up the hidden meanings of the sacred word. Since, then, no one under the earth was found worthy to unseal the book, I see no reason why we should not believe that hell is under the earth.
