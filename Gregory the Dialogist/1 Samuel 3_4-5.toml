(Verses 4, 5.) Who answering, said: "Here I am." And he ran to Eli and said: "For you called me." Who said: "I did not call you, my son; return and sleep."

8. Why did the one who heard the Lord calling him run to Eli, unless because he thought he had been called by Eli? And since we are following the order of typological explanation, how is Eli considered to be the one speaking when God speaks to the boy who was called? But whatever our ancient Fathers spoke in the Holy Scriptures is referred back to the speech of Eli. They, of course, because they did not speak of themselves, since God spoke through them what He willed, the voice that is heard in the Holy Scriptures is recognized as being God's, which is uttered through Eli. Moreover, the boy, because when God spoke he ran to Eli, shows that God indeed produced a voice similar to Eli's. What then does it mean that the voice of the divine speech does not differ from the voice of Eli, except that He Himself produces His speech also through the ancient Fathers? For the voice of Eli is recognized as being God's, since whatever the chosen Fathers speak through the sacred utterances, they received not from themselves but from the Lord. Hence also in the prophets, through nearly every utterance it is repeated: "Thus says the Lord," so that we may understand that the voice which resounds through the oracle of the prophet is not that of the man speaking but of God commanding.

9. Sometimes God speaks through Scripture, and sometimes through hidden inspiration. He speaks by hidden revelation when things to be done or taught are disclosed to the chosen mind through the Spirit. And so Samuel, when he heard the Lord calling him, ran to Eli, because the chosen order of preachers of the holy Church sought in sacred eloquence to determine the nature of what it had come to know by God's revealing. For the rule of right understanding is set forth in the books of sacred Scripture, because the divine counsels have been expounded there through our venerable Fathers, who possessed the Holy Spirit. Therefore Samuel, called so many times by the Lord, ran to Eli, because the order of preachers consulted the sayings of the ancient Fathers in everything it learned by spiritual revelation, so that it would only then believe something had been revealed to it by the Lord when it recognized that it in no way differed from what it read in sacred Scripture. For he is easily deceived who does not know how to examine in the clear truth of holy Scripture the nature of what he gathers by hidden contemplation. Hence the Apostle also warns, saying: "Satan transforms himself into an angel of light" (2 Cor. 11:14). But how are false things discerned in the brightness of true light? Samuel therefore runs to Eli every time he is called by the Lord, because the holy preachers, lest they be deceived by the image of false light in inward contemplation, examine the manner of hidden revelation in the open truth of holy Scripture.

10. Because in this matter it must be asked how it is fitting for Eli to say: "I did not call you, my son." But our Fathers, who speak to new preachers through sacred Scripture, do not call them, but indicate what their internal revelation is like. For to call is to arouse the minds of God's elect by the inspiration of his grace. But the ancient Fathers indeed speak through sacred Scripture, yet they cannot arouse the hearts of their hearers by the inspiration of divine grace. Therefore the sacred Scriptures, when consulted, while they indicate that they cannot give the gift of spiritual grace, excuse themselves as Eli, as it were by certain utterances, through the authority of the account of Samuel. But assuredly, what they cannot give, they can suggest how it ought to be acquired. Whence also it is said by the voice of Eli to Samuel: "Return, and sleep."
