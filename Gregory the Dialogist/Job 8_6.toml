If thou wilt walk pure and upright; surely now He will awake for thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness at peace.

That is to say, pure in thought, upright in practice. Surely now He will awake for thee. As if it were in plain words, 'that He, Who now forbears to put forth the power of His protecting hand to thy tribulations, is as if asleep to the succouring of one going wrong.' And make the habitation of thy righteousness at peace, i.e. 'does away with the crosses of the present life, and vouchsafes without delay security in repose.' For because men that are bad reckon temporal enjoyment as a special blessing of Divine recompensing, what they themselves go after with solicitous concern, they promise to others as something great. Hence it very often happens that they either pledge themselves to regain them when lost, or draw on the minds of their hearers after still greater rewards of this world.
