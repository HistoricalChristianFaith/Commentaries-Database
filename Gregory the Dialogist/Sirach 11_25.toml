What is it therefore that the holy man enumerates so many of his virtues amid afflictions? What is it that he praises with his own mouth the works he had done, except that amid wounds and words which could drag him to despair, they reform his soul to hope? And he who was humble in prosperity, having recalled his good deeds to memory, remained unbroken in adversity. For whose soul would those words not drive to despair amid so many afflictions, unless he had recalled to memory the good things he had done? The holy man therefore saw his mind being shaken toward despair upon hearing so many evils, and he wonderfully strove to be strengthened in certain hope from his good actions. Thus is fulfilled what is written: In the day of good things be not unmindful of evil things, and in the day of evil things be not unmindful of good things. For if when we have good things we remember the evil things which we have either already suffered or can still suffer, the good things received do not elevate the mind, because the fear from the memory of evil things suppresses their joy. And if when we have evil things we remember the good things which we have either already received or hope we can still receive, the weight of evil things does not press the soul down into despair, because the memory of good things lifts it to hope.
