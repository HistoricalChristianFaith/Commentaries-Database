Holy church, sighing for the coming of the mediator between God and humanity, for the coming of her Redeemer, prays to the Father that he would send the Son and illuminate him with his presence, that he would speak to the church no longer through the mouths of prophets but by his own mouth.

But the Gentiles, once called, do not cease to kiss the footsteps of their Redeemer, because they continually sigh in love for him. Hence also in the voice of the bride concerning this same Redeemer it is said in the Song of Songs: "Let him kiss me with the kiss of his mouth." Rightly does she desire the kiss of her Creator, who prepares herself to serve him through love.
