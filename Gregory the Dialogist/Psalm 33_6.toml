Concerning this Spirit it is written: "His Spirit has adorned the heavens." For the ornaments of the heavens are the virtues of those who preach. Paul enumerates these ornaments, saying: "To one is given through the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge according to the same Spirit, to another faith in the same Spirit, to another the grace of healing in one Spirit, to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the discernment of spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of speeches. But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually as He wills." Therefore, as many as are the gifts of those who preach, so many are the ornaments of the heavens. Hence it is written again: "By the word of the Lord the heavens were established." For the Word of the Lord is the Son of the Father. But concerning these same heavens, namely the holy apostles, so that the entire holy Trinity might be shown to have worked together, it is suddenly added concerning the divinity of the Holy Spirit: "And by the breath of His mouth is all their power." Therefore the power of the heavens was received from the Spirit, because they would not have presumed to oppose the powers of this world unless the strength of the Holy Spirit had made them firm.
