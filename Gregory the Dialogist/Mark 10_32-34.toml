Our Redeemer, foreseeing that the souls of the disciples would be troubled by His passion, foretold to them long beforehand both the suffering of that same passion and the glory of His resurrection, so that when they saw Him dying, as had been predicted, they would not doubt that He would also rise again. But because the disciples, still carnal, were by no means able to grasp the words of the mystery, a miracle is performed. Before their eyes a blind man receives light, so that those who could not grasp the words of the heavenly mystery might be strengthened in faith by heavenly deeds.
