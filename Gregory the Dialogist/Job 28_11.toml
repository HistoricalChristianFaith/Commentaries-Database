60.  For what else are here called ‘floods’ but the sayings of the ancient Fathers.  For who might be able to estimate how vehement a flood, whilst he was founding the Law, burst forth from the very breast of Moses?  how vehement a flood gushed from the heart of David?  what mighty streams of floods flowed out from the lips of Solomon and all the Prophets?  Now of these ‘floods’ Judaea held the show, when in keeping the surface of the letter she knew not the depths thereof.  But we, who, on the Lord coming, seek therein interior spiritual things, search their ‘depths.’  And this thing the Lord is Himself said to do, because by Himself vouchsafing it we are enabled to do it; and so by us, who follow not the letter which killeth, but the spirit which maketh alive, the Lord ‘searcheth the depths of.  the floods, and bringeth the hidden things into light,’ because the statements of the Law, which the too dark history makes obscure, a spiritual interpretation now lights up.  And hence ‘Truth’ when speaking in parables in the Gospel bade the Disciples, saying, What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light; and what ye hear in the ear, that preach ye on the house tops. [Mat. 10, 27]  For the plainly spoken words of these interpreting have made the sentences of the ancient Fathers henceforth clear to us.  Hence the Prophet Isaiah viewing the words plain by the interpretation of Holy Church, not obscured by the darkness of allegories, exclaimed, saying, The place of rivers, the broadest and open streams. [Is. 33, 21]  For the sayings of the Old Testament were as narrow and close streams, which bound up the sentences of their lore in the darkest gathering together.  But on the other hand the teaching of Holy Church are’ streams both broad and open,’ because her declarations are at once many in number to those that find them, and plain to those that seek.  Therefore he says, The depths of the floods he hath searched, and the hidden things he hath brought to light.  Because when He poured into His interpreters the spirit of understanding, He set open the ancient obscurities of those prophesying.  And that Holy Church henceforth knows and sees by the Spirit, which the Synagogue before was not at all able to understand by the letter..  Whence Moses also, while he spoke to the people, veiled his face; surely, in order to denote that that People of the Jews knew the words of the Law, but did not at all see the clearness of that Law.  And hence it is rightly said by Paul; But even to this day, when Moses is read, the veil is upon their heart. [2 Cor. 3, 15]  But because the declarations of God are, without His wisdom, never fathomed at all, (for except him who hath received His Spirit, none knoweth in any sort His words,) the holy man adds words touching the subject of searching out that same Wisdom of God.
