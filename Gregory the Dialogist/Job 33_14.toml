35. But yet this remark, God will speak once, and will not repeat the same thing twice, may be understood in a deeper meaning; that the Father begat His Consubstantial, Only-begotten Son. For God’s speaking is His having begotten the Word. But for God to speak once, is for Him to have no other Word beside the Only-begotten. And hence it is fitly subjoined, And He will not repeat the same thing twice, because this very Word, that is, the Son, He begat not otherwise than only-begotten. But in that He says not, “He spake,” but “will speak,” using, namely, not the past tense but the future, it is plain to all, that neither past nor future time is appropriate to God. Any tense is therefore the more freely used in speaking of Him, since no one is used with strict truth. But any tense whatever could not be freely used, if one at least could be used properly. It is allowable then for any tense to be boldly used in speaking of God, since no one is strictly proper. For the Father begat the Son without regard to time.
36. And who can worthily speak of that ineffable nativity, that the Coeternal is begotten from the Eternal, that He who existed before all ages begat His Equal, that the Son was not posterior to Him Who begat Him? We can marvel at these things, but it is beyond our power to look into them. But to be able to wonder at that mighty nativity is in a certain degree to see it. But how do we see that which we do by no means comprehend? But we must borrow an instance from the habits of the body to illustrate the feelings of the mind. If any one is lying down in a dark place, with his eyes closed, and the light of a candle suddenly flashes before him, his eyes, though closed, are so struck by the very approach of the light, that they open. Why are they thus affected, if they saw nothing when closed? And yet it was not any thing perfect which they could see when closed. For if they had seen the whole object perfectly, why should they when opened seek for something to look at? And thus, thus are we, when we endeavour to behold ought of the incomprehensible nativity. For even in this, that the mind is struck with surprise at the shining, and sees in a manner what it is not able really to see, it beholds as if in darkness the power of the light with closed eyes [Here the older Edd. have a passage which Ben. omits, as it is not in the MSS. ‘For Eliu says, God speaketh once; but David, looking to the nativity of the only-begotten Word, says, God spake once.’ For since the only-begotten Son and Word of the Father is both called ‘Born’ in respect of perfection, and in respect of eternity is even said to be in birth; Holy Scripture useth to say freely of God that He ‘hath spoken,’ and ‘speaketh.’ For in that He begat the Word perfect, God ‘hath spoken,’ and in that He ever begetteth, He surely ‘speaketh;’ though this which we called ‘perfect’ we do not say with strictness. for that which is not effected (factum) cannot be strictly said to be ‘perfected,’ (perfectum.) But we express His fullness with a somewhat straitened form of speech; as also of the Father the Lord saith, Be ye perfect, even as your heavenly Father is perfect, (Matt. v. 48) It looks like a note on the former paragraph, which may have been written at the foot of the page.]. But because the secret admiration of the Divine Nature is not easily made known to minds which are occupied with worldly desires, he very fitly suggests the way in which God speaks to us.
