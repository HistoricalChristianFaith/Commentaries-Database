For as Samson at midnight not only left Gaza, but also carried away the gates of it, so also our Redeemer rising before the light, did not only come out free from hell, but destroyed also thevery gates of hell. a whole is fitly figured.
That the disciples were slow inbelieving our Lordâ€™s Resurrection was not so much a weakness of theirs as it isour strength. For the Resurrection itself through their doubts was manifested by many proofs; and whilst we read and acknowledge them, what do we but become firmer through their doubting?
