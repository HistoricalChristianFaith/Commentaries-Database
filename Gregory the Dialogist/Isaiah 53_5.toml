No one usually brings hardship on himself. For example, the prophet insinuates the severity of [Christ’s] hardship when he says, “Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows.” For dying does not [necessarily] entail suffering what a condemned nature is capable of suffering. Therefore, the severity of the hardship he brought on himself comes to the fore in that he did not have by nature a body that could suffer; and yet, so that he might free us by his suffering, he humbly assumed the very thing that would allow him to suffer.
