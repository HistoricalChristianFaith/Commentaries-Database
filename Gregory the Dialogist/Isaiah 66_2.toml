Differently to be admonished are the humble and the haughty. To the former it is to be insinuated how true is that excellence which they hold in hoping for it; to the latter it is to be intimated how that temporal glory is as nothing which even when embracing it they hold not. Let the humble hear how eternal are the things that they long for, how transitory the things which they despise; let the haughty hear how transitory are the things they court, how eternal the things they lose. Let the humble hear from the authoritative voice of the Truth, Every one that humbleth himself shall be exalted. Let the haughty hear, Every one that exalteth himself shall be humbled. Let the humble hear, Humility goeth before glory; let the haughty hear, The spirit is exalted before a fall. Let the humble hear, Unto whom shall I have respect, but to him that is humble and quiet, and that trembleth at my words?
