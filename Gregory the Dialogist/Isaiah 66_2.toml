Differently to be admonished are the humble and the haughty. To the former it is to be carefully communicated how true is that excellence that they hold in hoping for it; to the latter it is to be intimated how that temporal glory is as nothing, which even when embracing it they do not grasp it. Let the humble hear how eternal are the things that they long for, how transitory the things that they despise; let the haughty hear how transitory the things are that they court, how eternal the things are that they lose.
