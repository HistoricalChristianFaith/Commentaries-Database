49. Above it was said of Anna alone: "And she brought him with her, after she had weaned him." But now it is added concerning both Elkanah and Anna: "And they sacrificed a calf, and offered the boy to Eli." The calf was sacrificed when Samuel was brought and offered. If therefore Elkanah was there both when he was being brought and when he was being offered, why was it not said "they brought him with them," just as it was said "they sacrificed" and "they offered"? But because we have referred these things to the Church and to Christ, it pertains to her to nurse, to her to bring, but to offer and sacrifice pertains to herself and to Christ. For she herself applies the word of preaching, but she by no means supplies to those to whom she imparts doctrine the power of fulfilling the work. For by speaking she presents the letter of Scripture, but she can give the good itself to those seeking it only together with the Bridegroom. Therefore the calf is sacrificed when divine grace is poured into the heart of one seeking good things, so that the good things which one determines by resolving, one may cheerfully expend in the pursuit of good work. For the calf is then sacrificed, because the offering of good work proposed is received by Almighty God through the oblation of a devout mind, if what the mind presents to Him by vowing is wholly sacrificed to God through cheerfulness. Concerning this sacrifice of the calf the Lord says in the Gospel: "If you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will my heavenly Father give the good spirit to those who ask Him?" Hence Paul says: "He who sows in blessings will also reap from blessings; each one as he has purposed in his heart, not from sadness or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver." For what is it to purpose in the heart, if not to propose from deliberation? Therefore when he said "he purposed," he affirmed, as it were, that the calf was brought. But when he added "not from sadness or from necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver," he explained how the calf that was brought is to be sacrificed. Calves are therefore brought when we are prepared to propose well the doing of mighty deeds, but the calf is sacrificed when the deliberation of a good purpose is expended on God in the oblation of great devotion. Moreover, both, that is the husband and wife, are said to have sacrificed the calf, because the same cheerfulness is shown to faithful subjects by the voice of the preacher, and divine grace is propagated in their hearts. Therefore they sacrifice the calf together when in the heart of a subject progressing well the divine agrees with human preaching. Moreover, three calves are brought, because when we propose to bring help to the fallen and to those standing, and to bring the assistance of guardianship to ourselves, while we attend to these things with one good intention, they are indeed three with respect to the work, but one in the gift of oblation. They are indeed three, because they are rendered toward us and toward our neighbors with different regard and at different times, but they are one calf, because they are proposed together, and are expended on God with equal devotion of oblation, and there is one cheerfulness in them, and no other is had.

50. "And they offered the boy to Eli." In Eli are figured not only the persons of the ancient teachers, but also their doctrine. What then does it mean that the boy Samuel is said to have been offered to Eli, except what is openly understood: that whoever strives to benefit others by preaching ought not only to write new things, but also old things? Hence the Lord also says in the Gospel through a parable: "Therefore every scribe instructed in the kingdom of heaven is like a householder who brings forth from his treasure new things and old" (Matthew 13:52). Samuel is therefore offered to Eli when the mind of a well-progressing subject is instructed in the knowledge of the law and the prophets, so that in the books of the ancients he may read the letter that kills, but also understand according to the Spirit that gives life; and so receive what sounds outwardly that, beyond the sound of the letters, he may recognize what the Spirit sounds within; and hold new things for faith, but, as often as necessary, bring forward the old Scriptures for the confirmation of the New Testament. For then he will be able to defend the new when he recognizes their reasoning from the old. Therefore Samuel is openly said to have been offered to Eli, because only he sufficiently preaches the new who does not ignore that reasoning by which the old things are to be understood. And because we cannot understand those same old Scriptures without a teacher, and a teacher accomplishes nothing in us by teaching if what he himself speaks outwardly is not poured into our hearts through divine grace, the mother did not offer the boy alone, but with her husband. And to him to whom she entrusted her son, Anna made herself known with a word of proclamation, saying: (Verse 26) "I beseech you, my lord, as your soul lives, I am that woman who stood before you here."
